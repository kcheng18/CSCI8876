The physicochemical conditions that prompt bacterial binding to oil/water interfaces are not well understood. To provide key insights into this process, A. borkumensis cells were cultured either in a clean environment condition (dissolved organic carbon) or in an oil spill condition (hexadecane as the sole energy source). The ability of these bacteria to bind to the oil/water interface was monitored through interfacial tension measurements, bacterial cell hydrophobicity, and fluorescence microscopy. Our experiments show that A. borkumensis cells cultured in clean environment conditions remain hydrophilic and do not show significant transport or binding to the oil/water interface. In sharp contrast, bacteria cultured in oil spill conditions become partially hydrophobic and their amphiphilicity drives them to oil/water interfaces, where they reduce interfacial tension and form the early stages of a biofilm. We show that it is A. borkumensis cells that attach to the oil/water interface and not a synthesized biosurfactant that is released into solution that reduces interfacial tension. This study provides key insights into the physicochemical properties that allow A. borkumensis to adhere to oil/water interfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Michael P Godfrin"},{"name":"Maswazi Sihlabela"},{"name":"Arijit Bose"},{"name":"Anubhav Tripathi"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"29974746","title":"Terpyridine-Micelles for Inhibiting Bacterial Biofilm Development.","abs":"Iron plays a critical role in bacterial infections and is especially critical for supporting biofilm formation.

The purpose of this study was to characterize an approximately 50-kDa CR-binding amyloid-like protein (ALP) expressed by M. haemolytica. This protein resisted boiling and formic acid digestion and was recognized by a polyclonal anti-Escherichia coli curli serum, suggesting its relationship with amyloid proteins. Immunolabeling and transmission electron microscopy showed that antibodies bound long, thin fibers attached to the bacterial surface. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that these fibers are M. haemolytica OmpP2-like proteins. The purified protein formed filaments in vitro, and antiserum against it reacted positively with biofilms. An in silico analysis of its amino acid sequence indicated it has auto-aggregation properties and eight amyloid peptides. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against this ALP diminished the adhesion of ATCC 31612 and BA1 M. haemolytica strains to A549 human epithelial cells, indicating its participation in cell adhesion.

Limitations include the need for photosensitizer proximity to tissue because of the short (3.5 μs) lifetime of singlet oxygen in contact with water; the strong optical absorption of the photosensitizer, which limits the penetration depth; and hypoxic environments that restrict the concentration of available oxygen. In this article, we describe a novel superhydrophobic singlet oxygen delivery device for the selective inactivation of bacterial biofilms. The device addresses the current limitations by: immobilizing photosensitizer molecules onto inert silica particles; embedding the photosensitizer-containing particles into the plastron (i.e. the fluid-free space within a superhydrophobic surface between the solid substrate and fluid layer); distributing the particles along an optically transparent substrate such that they can be uniformly illuminated; enabling the penetration of oxygen via the contiguous vapor space defined by the plastron; and stabilizing the superhydrophobic state while avoiding the direct contact of the sensitizer to biomaterials. In this way, singlet oxygen generated on the sensitizer-containing particles can diffuse across the plastron and kill bacteria even deep within the hypoxic periodontal pockets. For the first time, we demonstrate complete biofilm inactivation (>5 log killing) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium implicated in periodontal disease using the superhydrophobic singlet oxygen delivery device. The biofilms were cultured on hydroxyapatite disks and exposed to active and control surfaces to assess the killing efficiency as monitored by colony counting and confocal microscopy. Two sensitizer particle types, a silicon phthalocyanine sol-gel and a chlorin e6 derivative covalently bound to fluorinated silica, were evaluated; the biofilm killing efficiency was found to correlate with the amount of singlet oxygen detected in separate trapping studies.

Surfaces of the specimens in test groups were coated with poly(MPC) (PMPC) by graft polymerization of MPC in different concentrations (0.25 mol/L; 0.50 mol/L and 0.75 mol/L), while no surface treatment was applied to the control group.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to investigate whether vicRKX and adjacent downstream genes were cotranscribed. Binding of purified recombinant VicR protein to promoter regions of vicR, rnc, and syfA genes was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and by chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses.

AS vicR overexpression mutants were constructed, and the biofilm biomass was determined by crystal violet microtiter assay. Adjacent downstream genes rnc, smc, syfA, smu.1511, and syfB were cotranscribed with vicRKX. The predicted promoter regions of vicR, rnc, and syfA genes were directly regulated by VicR. An AS vicR RNA transcript was detected upstream of the rnc gene. Expression of the AS vicR RNA transcript was elevated in planktonic cultures and repressed during biofilm growth. In addition, Western blot data showed that expression of the VicR protein decreased by 35% in planktonic as compared with biofilm cultures. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of AS vicR led to a reduction in biofilm formation. The downstream genes rnc, smc, syfA, smu.1511, and syfB are cotranscribed with vicRKX.

While the nature of the incomplete reproductive isolation remains unknown, its occurrence in natural diatom populations represents an additional mechanism contributing to population genetic structuring and adaptation and can spur further research into the mechanisms of species divergence and the maintenance of species identity in the presence of gene flow.","authors":[{"name":"Sam De Decker"},{"name":"Pieter Vanormelingen"},{"name":"Eveline Pinseel"},{"name":"Josefin Sefbom"},{"name":"Sien Audoor"},{"name":"Koen Sabbe"},{"name":"Wim Vyverman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillariophyta"},{"word":"gene flow."},{"word":"genetic diversity"},{"word":"hybridization"},{"word":"speciation"},{"word":"species concept"}]},"article24":{"pmid":"29966687","title":"Fish pathogen bacteria: Adhesion, parameters influencing virulence and interaction with host cells.","abs":"Wild fisheries are declining due to over-fishing, climate change, pollution and marine habitat destructions among other factors, and, concomitantly, aquaculture is increasing significantly around the world. Fish infections caused by pathogenic bacteria are quite common in aquaculture, although their seriousness depends on the season. Drug-supplemented feeds are often used to keep farmed fish free from the diseases caused by such bacteria. However, given that bacteria can survive well in aquatic environments independently of their hosts, bacterial diseases have become major impediments to aquaculture development. On the other hand, the indiscriminate uses of antimicrobial agents has led to resistant strains and the need to switch to other antibiotics, although it seems that an integrated approach that considers not only the pathogen but also the host and the environment will be the most effective method in the long-term to improve aquatic animal health. This review covers the mechanisms of bacterial pathogenicity and details the foundations underlying the interactions occurring between pathogenic bacteria and the fish host in the aquatic environment, as well as the factors that influence virulence. Understanding and linking the different phenomena that occur from adhesion to colonization of the host will offer novel and useful means to help design suitable therapeutic strategies for disease prevention and treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Said Ben Hamed"},{"name":"Maria José Tavares Ranzani-Paiva"},{"name":"Leonardo Tachibana"},{"name":"Danielle de Carla Dias"},{"name":"Carlos Massatoshi Ishikawa"},{"name":"María Angeles Esteban"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial adhesion"},{"word":"Bacterial colonization"},{"word":"Infectious diseases"},{"word":"Pathogen-host interaction"},{"word":"Virulence factor"}]},"article25":{"pmid":"29966090","title":"A New Concept of Promoting Nitrate Reduction in Surface Waters: Simultaneous Supplement of Denitrifiers, Electron Donor Pool, and Electron Mediators.","abs":"The efficiency of biological nitrate reduction depends on the community composition of microorganisms, the electron donor pool, and the electron mediators participating in the biological reduction process.

Colony biofilms represent an ideal system for studying molecular mechanisms and regulations involved in development and internal organization of biofilm structure as well as those that are involved in fungal domestication. We have identified here antagonistic functional interactions between transcriptional regulators Cyc8p and Tup1p that modulate the life-style of natural S. cerevisiae strains between biofilm and domesticated mode. Herein, strains with different levels of Cyc8p and Tup1p regulators were constructed, analyzed for processes involved in colony biofilm development and used in the identification of modes of regulation of Flo11p, a key adhesin in biofilm formation. Our data show that Tup1p and Cyc8p regulate biofilm formation in the opposite manner, being positive and negative regulators of colony complexity, cell-cell interaction and adhesion to surfaces. Notably, in-depth analysis of regulation of expression of Flo11p adhesin revealed that Cyc8p itself is the key repressor of FLO11 expression, whereas Tup1p counteracts Cyc8p's repressive function and, in addition, counters Flo11p degradation by an extracellular protease. Interestingly, the opposing actions of Tup1p and Cyc8p concern processes crucial to the biofilm mode of yeast multicellularity, whereas other multicellular processes such as cell flocculation are co-repressed by both regulators. This study provides insight into the mechanisms regulating complexity of the biofilm lifestyle of yeast grown on semisolid surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Phu Van Nguyen"},{"name":"Otakar Hlaváček"},{"name":"Jana Maršíková"},{"name":"Libuše Váchová"},{"name":"Zdena Palková"}],"keywords":[]},"article27":{"pmid":"29965780","title":"Salmonella enterica Contamination of Market Fresh Tomatoes: A Review.","abs":"Salmonella contamination associated with market fresh tomatoes has been problematic for the industry and consumers.

Previous studies established FapC as the major amyloid subunit, but its mechanism of fibril formation in P. aeruginosa remained largely unexplored. Here, we examine the FapC sequence in greater detail through a combination of bioinformatics and protein engineering, and we identify specific motifs that are implicated in amyloid formation. Sequence regions of high evolutionary conservation tend to coincide with regions of high amyloid propensity, and mutation of amyloidogenic motifs to a designed, non-amyloidogenic motif suppresses fibril formation in a pH-dependent manner. We establish the particular significance of the third repeat motif in promoting fibril formation and also demonstrate emergence of soluble oligomer species early in the aggregation pathway.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the growth of biofilms in wounds, and showed phage treatment could significantly reduce the formation of these communities. Evaluation of agr activity by qRT-PCR showed an increase in activity during growth in wound models for most strains. Activation of a prototype infection-responsive dressing designed to provide a visual signal of wound infection, was related to increased agr activity. In all assays, excellent reproducibility was observed between replicates using this model.","authors":[{"name":"Diana R Alves"},{"name":"Simon P Booth"},{"name":"Paola Scavone"},{"name":"Pascale Schellenberger"},{"name":"Jonathan Salvage"},{"name":"Cinzia Dedi"},{"name":"Naing-Tun Thet"},{"name":"A Toby A Jenkins"},{"name":"Ryan Waters"},{"name":"Keng W Ng"},{"name":"Andrew D J Overall"},{"name":"Anthony D Metcalfe"},{"name":"Jonathan Nzakizwanayo"},{"name":"Brian V Jones"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"accessory gene regulator"},{"word":"bacteriophage therapy"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"ex-vivo burn wound model"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"infection responsive materials"}]},"article53":{"pmid":"29963049","title":"Human Anti-Als3p Antibodies Are Surrogate Markers of NDV-3A Vaccine Efficacy Against Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis.","abs":"A Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of NDV-3A vaccine containing a Candida albicans recombinant Als3 protein formulated with alum protected women <40 years old from recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). We investigated the potential use of anti-Als3p sera as surrogate marker of NDV-3A efficacy. Pre- and post-vaccination sera from subjects who experienced recurrence of vulvovaginal candidiasis (R) vs. those who were recurrence-free [non-recurrent (NR)] were evaluated. Anti-Als3p antisera obtained were evaluated for (1) titer and subclass profile and (2) their ability to influence C. albicans virulence traits including hyphal elongation, adherence to plastic, invasion of vaginal epithelial cells, biofilm formation on plastic and catheter material, and susceptibility to neutrophil killing in vitro. Serum IgG titers in NR patients were consistently higher than in R patients, particularly for anti-Als3 subclass IgG2. Sera from vaccinated NR patients reduced hyphal elongation, adhesion to plastic, invasion of vaginal epithelial cells, and biofilm formation significantly more than pre-immune sera, or sera from R- or placebo-group subjects. Pre-adsorption of sera with C. albicans germ tubes eliminated these effects, while heat inactivation did not. Finally, sera from NR subjects enhanced neutrophil-mediated killing of C. albicans relative to pre-immune sera or sera from R patients. Our results suggest that higher Als3p antibody titers are associated with protection from RVVC, attenuate C. albicans virulence, and augment immune clearance of the fungus in vitro. Thus, Als3p serum IgG antibodies are likely useful markers of efficacy in RVVC patients vaccinated with NDV-3A.","authors":[{"name":"Priya Uppuluri"},{"name":"Shakti Singh"},{"name":"Abdullah Alqarihi"},{"name":"Clint S Schmidt"},{"name":"John P Hennessey"},{"name":"Michael R Yeaman"},{"name":"Scott G Filler"},{"name":"John E Edwards"},{"name":"Ashraf S Ibrahim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Als3p"},{"word":"Candida albicans, RVVC"},{"word":"NDV-3"},{"word":"NDV-3A"},{"word":"vaccine"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article54":{"pmid":"29963035","title":"Identification of a Novel Polyamine Scaffold With Potent Efflux Pump Inhibition Activity Toward Multi-Drug Resistant Bacterial Pathogens.","abs":"We have previously reported the use of combinatorial chemistry to identify broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Herein, we extend our analysis of this technology toward the discovery of anti-resistance molecules, focusing on efflux pump inhibitors. Using high-throughput screening against multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we identified a polyamine scaffold that demonstrated strong efflux pump inhibition without possessing antibacterial effects. We determined that these molecules were most effective with an amine functionality at R1 and benzene functionalities at R2 and R3. From a library of 188 compounds, we studied the properties of 5 lead agents in detail, observing a fivefold to eightfold decrease in the 90% effective concentration of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and aztreonam toward P. aeruginosa isolates. Additionally, we determined that our molecules were not only active toward P. aeruginosa, but toward Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus as well. The specificity of our molecules to efflux pump inhibition was confirmed using ethidium bromide accumulation assays, and in studies with strains that displayed varying abilities in their efflux potential. When assessing off target effects we observed no disruption of bacterial membrane polarity, no general toxicity toward mammalian cells, and no inhibition of calcium channel activity in human kidney cells. Finally, combination treatment with our lead agents engendered a marked increase in the bactericidal capacity of tetracycline, and significantly decreased viability within P. aeruginosa biofilms. As such, we report a unique polyamine scaffold that has strong potential for the future development of novel and broadly active efflux pump inhibitors targeting multi-drug resistant bacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Renee M Fleeman"},{"name":"Ginamarie Debevec"},{"name":"Kirsten Antonen"},{"name":"Jessie L Adams"},{"name":"Radleigh G Santos"},{"name":"Gregory S Welmaker"},{"name":"Richard A Houghten"},{"name":"Marc A Giulianotti"},{"name":"Lindsey N Shaw"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial resistance"},{"word":"efflux pump inhibitors"},{"word":"efflux pumps"},{"word":"polyamines"},{"word":"potentiation"}]},"article55":{"pmid":"29963022","title":"Experimental Microbial Alteration and Fe Mobilization From Basaltic Rocks of the ICDP HSDP2 Drill Core, Hilo, Hawaii.","abs":"The interaction of a single bacterial species (Burkholderia fungorum) with basaltic rocks from the ICDP HSDP2 drill core and synthetic basaltic glasses was investigated in batch laboratory experiments to better understand the role of microbial activity on rock alteration and Fe mobilization. Incubation experiments were performed with drill core basaltic rock samples to investigate differences in the solution chemistry during biotic and abiotic alteration. Additionally, colonization experiments with synthetic basaltic glasses of different Fe redox states and residual stresses were performed to evaluate their influence on microbial activity and surface attachment of cells. In biotic incubation experiments bacterial growth was observed and the release of Fe and other major elements from drill core basaltic rocks to solution exceeded that of abiotic controls only when the rock sample assay was nutrient depleted. The concentration of dissolved major elements in solution in biotic colonization experiments with synthetic basaltic glasses increased with increasing residual stress and Fe(II) content. Furthermore, the concentration of dissolved Fe and Al increased similarly in biotic colonization experiments indicating that their dissolution might be triggered by microbial activity. Surface morphology imaging by SEM revealed that cells on basaltic rocks in incubation experiments were most abundant on the glass and surfaces with high roughness and almost absent on minerals. In colonization experiments, basaltic glasses with residual stress and high Fe(II) content were intensely covered with a cellular biofilm. In contrast, glasses with high Fe(III) content and no residual stress were sparsely colonized. We therefore conclude that structurally bound Fe is most probably used by B. fungorum as a nutrient. Furthermore, we assume that microbial activity overall increased rock dissolution as soon as the environment becomes nutrient depleted. Our results show that besides compositional effects, other factors such as redox state and residual stress can control microbial alteration of basaltic glasses.","authors":[{"name":"Marius Stranghoener"},{"name":"Axel Schippers"},{"name":"Stefan Dultz"},{"name":"Harald Behrens"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia"},{"word":"Fe mobilization"},{"word":"Fe redox state"},{"word":"ICDP"},{"word":"bio-mediated alteration"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"microbe-basalt interaction"},{"word":"volcanic islands"}]},"article56":{"pmid":"29963020","title":"Herring Oil and Omega Fatty Acids Inhibit Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Formation and Virulence.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is notorious for its ability to become resistant to antibiotics and biofilms play a critical role in antibiotic tolerance.

Herring oil decreased biofilm formation by two S. aureus strains. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of several polyunsaturated fatty acids in herring oil, and of these, two omega-3 fatty acids, DHA and EPA, significantly inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation. In addition, herring oil, DHA, and EPA at 20 μg/ml significantly decreased the hemolytic effect of S. aureus on human red blood cells, and when pre-treated to S. aureus, the bacterium was more easily killed by human whole blood. Transcriptional analysis showed that herring oil, DHA, and EPA repressed the expression of the α-hemolysin hla gene. Furthermore, in a Caenorhabditis elegans nematode model, all three prolonged nematode survival in the presence of S. aureus.

In this study, soluble EPSs and loosely bound EPSs can be extracted by centrifugation first and tightly bound EPSs in activated sludge require additional eight treatments for extraction, respectively. Three physical methods (centrifugation, sonication, and heating) and five chemical methods (cation exchange resin, NaOH, formaldehyde+NaOH, EDTA, and formaldehyde+EDTA) were tested, and the content and composition of TB-EPS were analyzed. Meanwhile, the functional groups and elements in TB-EPS were investigated. Results showed that the heating method did not introduce exogenous substances during the EPS extraction process and that the destruction of cells from this method was relatively slight. Heating was shown to be a gentle and efficient method in this study. The three-dimensional excitation and emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the cation exchange resin method had good extraction effect on humic-like and protein-like substances. As to fulvic-acid-like substances, NaOH was better than the other seven methods. Infrared spectroscopy showed that no notable difference appeared in the functional groups of the TB-EPS extracted by physical methods, whereas chemical methods induced big differences and showed particular bands that did not appear in the TB-EPS extracted by physical methods. Overall, the amounts of TB-EPS elements extracted using chemical methods were greater than those extracted using physical methods.

The purpose of this study was to investigate how bis-GMA changes the virulence properties of Streptococcus mutans, a major cariogenic bacterium in humans. The results show that bis-GMA not only inhibited the planktonic growth of cells in medium containing glucose, fructose, or mannose, but also reduced the viability of S. mutans. However, the presence of bis-GMA increased sugar transport and intracellular polysaccharide accumulation in S. mutans, thereby increasing the potential of cell persistence. In addition, bis-GMA could enhance S. mutans's adhesion to hard surfaces and glucan synthesis, which could contribute to biofilm formation. Although free bis-GMA made cells vulnerable to acidic stress, it also provided increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide, which might confer an advantage in competition with other oral microorganisms during the early stage of biofilm development. Interestingly, the presence of bis-GMA did not change the ability of S. mutans to interact with saliva.

One important but poorly understood system, ubiquitous among Gram-negative organisms, involves packaging cargo into outer membrane vesicles (OMVs).

Building upon the discovery that the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) stimulates OMV biogenesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we proposed a model where PQS interacts with the outer membrane to induce curvature and ultimately OMV formation. Though this model is well supported in P. aeruginosa, it remained unclear whether other organisms produce similar compounds. Here we describe the development of a tightly controlled experimental system to test the interaction of bacterially-produced factors with target cells. Using this system, we show that multiple species respond to PQS by increasing OMV formation, that PQS accumulates in the induced vesicles, and that other bacteria secrete OMV-promoting factors. Analysis of induced vesicles indicates that recipient-mediated mechanisms exist to control vesicle size and that relatedness to the producer organism can dictate susceptibility to OMV-inducing compounds. This work provides evidence that small molecule induced OMV biogenesis is a widely conserved process and that cross-talk between systems may influence OMV production in neighboring bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander M Horspool"},{"name":"Jeffrey W Schertzer"}],"keywords":[]},"article70":{"pmid":"29959041","title":"Coupling xylitol with remineralizing agents improves tooth protection against demineralization but reduces antibiofilm effect.","abs":"To explore the efficiency of xylitol chewing gum enriched or not with remineralizing agents to protect tooth against cariogenic biofilm formation and demineralization.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are among the newest antibiotics; these peptides are integral compounds in all kinds of organisms and play a significant role in microbial ecology, and critically contribute to the innate immunity of organisms by destroying invading microorganisms. Moreover, AMPs may encourage cells to produce chemokines, stimulate angiogenesis, accelerate wound healing, and influence programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. Bacteria differ in their inherent susceptibility and resistance mechanisms to these peptides when responding to the antimicrobial effects of AMPs. Generally, the development of AMP resistance mechanisms is driven by direct competition between bacterial species, and host and pathogen interactions. Several studies have shown diverse mechanisms of bacterial resistance to AMPs, for example, some bacteria produce proteases and trapping proteins; some modify cell surface charge, change membrane fluidity, and activate efflux pumps; and some species make use of biofilms and exopolymers, and develop sensing systems by selective gene expression. A closer understanding of bacterial resistance mechanisms may help in developing novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of infections caused by pathogenic organisms that are successful in developing extensive resistance to AMPs. Based on these observations, this review discusses the properties of AMPs, their targeting mechanisms, and bacterial resistance mechanisms against AMPs.","authors":[{"name":"Hoda Moravej"},{"name":"Zahra Moravej"},{"name":"Maryam Yazdanparast"},{"name":"Mohammad Heiat"},{"name":"Ali Mirhosseini"},{"name":"Mehrdad Moosazadeh Moghaddam"},{"name":"Reza Mirnejad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"bacteria resistance"},{"word":"mechanism of action"},{"word":"pathogenic bacteria"},{"word":"resistance mechanisms"}]},"article78":{"pmid":"29957103","title":"Characterization of Clinical Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecium Isolated in Eastern Hungary.","abs":"The aim of our study was to characterize and elicit the genetic relatedness of emerging vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated between 2012 and 2015 at a teaching hospital in Debrecen, Hungary.","authors":[{"name":"Dorottya Franyó"},{"name":"Balázs Kocsi"},{"name":"Virág Lesinszki"},{"name":"Judit Pászti"},{"name":"Anita Kozák"},{"name":"Evelin Erzsébet Bukta"},{"name":"Judit Szabó"},{"name":"Zsuzsanna Dombrádi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MALDI-TOF"},{"word":"PFGE"},{"word":"VREfm"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"esp"},{"word":"multilocus sequence typing"}]},"article79":{"pmid":"29956887","title":"Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Molecular Docking of Novel Thiazoles and [1,3,4]Thiadiazoles Incorporating Sulfonamide Group as DHFR Inhibitors.","abs":"2-(1-{4-[(4-Methylphenyl)sulfonamido]phenyl}ethylidene)thiosemicarbazide (3) was exploited as a starting material for the synthesis of two novel series of 5-arylazo-2-hydrazonothiazoles 6a - 6j and 2-hydrazono[1,3,4]thiadiazoles 10a - 10d, incorporating sulfonamide group, through its reactions with appropriate hydrazonoyl halides.

Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of high-risk/immunocompromised patients by enterococci exhibiting resistance to vancomycin (VRE) can lead to life-threating infections, including bloodstream infections and endocarditis. Decolonization of VRE from the GIT of high-risk patients represents an alternative method to suppress the risk of the infection. It could be considered as a preventative measure to protect against VRE infections in high-risk individuals. Though multiple agents (ramoplanin and bacitracin) have been evaluated clinically, no drugs are currently approved for use in VRE decolonization of the GIT. The present study evaluates ebselen, a clinical molecule, for use as a decolonizing agent against VRE. When evaluated against a broad array of enterococcal isolates in vitro, ebselen was found to be as potent as linezolid (minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of clinical isolates tested was 2 μg/ml). Though VRE has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antibacterial agents, no resistance to ebselen emerged after a clinical isolate of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was serially-passaged with ebselen for 14 days. Against VRE biofilm, a virulence factor that enables the bacteria to colonize the gut, ebselen demonstrated the ability to both inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt mature biofilm. Furthermore, in a murine VRE colonization reduction model, ebselen proved as effective as ramoplanin in reducing the bacterial shedding and burden of VRE present in the fecal content (by > 99.99%), cecum, and ileum of mice. Based on the promising results obtained, ebselen warrants further investigation as a novel decolonizing agent to quell VRE infection.","authors":[{"name":"Ahmed AbdelKhalek"},{"name":"Nader S Abutaleb"},{"name":"Haroon Mohammad"},{"name":"Mohamed N Seleem"}],"keywords":[]},"article89":{"pmid":"29952324","title":"Microorganism levels in spray from warm-water bidet toilet seats: factors affecting total viable and heterotrophic plate counts, and examination of the fluctuations and origins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"The objectives of this study were to conduct an appropriate microbial evaluation of warm-water bidet toilet seats.

DADS at 1.28 mg/mL did not affect P. aeruginosa PAO1 growth, although it decreased elastase and pyocyanin production, biofilm formation, and swarming motility. Each of these phenomena is regulated by the three QS systems of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (las, rhl, and pqs). Real-time q-PCR revealed that DADS down-regulated the transcription levels of several important QS genes (lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, pqsA, and pqsR) in the three systems. Furthermore, the transcription levels of QS-regulated virulence genes were also down-regulated. The lasB gene, encoding LasB elastase, is co-regulated by the las, rhl, and pqs systems, and thus the down-regulation of genes across the three systems further down-regulated lasB. Additionally, phzM (encoding pyocyanin), pslB (responsible for the production of a biofilm matrix polysaccharide), and chiC (encoding chitinase) were positively activated by LasR, and a decrease in lasR transcription further down-regulated the transcription of phzM, pslB, and chiC.

In this study, we have generated biofilm-altered Tn5 mutants of V. cholerae O139 and evaluated their in vivo colonization ability on mouse model. These Tn5 mutants were found to harbor an independent, single Tn5 insertion in their genome. The DNA sequence analysis revealed that genomic region wherein Tn5 insertion occurred is identified to be involved in functions like LPS biosynthesis, efflux transporters, motility, purine metabolism, stringent response, VPS synthesis, and a hypothetical protein of unknown function. In single-strain infection with the planktonic culture, the biofilm-altered as well as the biofilm intermediate mutants were found to be more or less similar in their intestinal colonization ability, however infection with their biofilm form, a marked difference was observed between the biofilm deficient and other biofilm forming strains. Further, in the competition experiments, biofilm deficient and proficient mutants were found reduced in their colonization ability and outcompeted by their parent strain.

Drug-resistant strains often undergo mutations, adopt alternative pathways, and express drug efflux pumps to reduce or eliminate drug doses. Besides these intrinsic resistance mechanisms, bacteria can evade drug doses by forming biofilms. Biofilms are the concerted growth of adherent microorganisms, which can also be formed at the air-water interface. The growth is supported by the extracellular polymer matrix which is self-produced by the microorganisms. Reduced metabolic activity in a nutrient-deficient environment in the biofilm may cause the microorganisms to take alternative pathways that can make the microorganisms recalcitrant to the drug doses. Recent works have shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis expresses several proteins during its growth in biofilm, those when deleted, did not show any effect on mycobacterial growth in normal nutrient-sufficient conditions. Studying these unconventional proteins in mycobacterial biofilms is therefore of utmost importance. In this article, I will discuss one such mycobacterial biofilm-related protein FabG4 that is recently shown to be important for mycobacterial survival in the presence of antibiotic stressors and limited nutrient condition. In an attempt to find more effective FabG4 inhibitors and its importance in biofilm forming M. tuberculosis, present knowledge about FabG4 and its known inhibitors are discussed.

Currently, changes to the biophysical properties of RSCV and mucoid biofilms due to variations in EPS are not well understood. This knowledge may reveal how lung infections resist host clearance mechanisms. Here, we used mechanical indentation and shear rheometry to analyse the viscoelasticity of RSCV and mucoid colony-biofilms compared to their isogenic parent at 2-, 4-, and 6-d. While the viscoelasticity of parental colony-biofilms underwent fluctuating temporal changes, in contrast, RSCV and mucoid colony-biofilms showed a gradual progression to more elastic-solid behaviour. Theoretical indices of mucociliary and cough clearance predict that mature 6-d parental and RSCV biofilms may show reduced cough clearance from the lung, while early mucoid biofilms may show reduced clearance by both mechanisms.

For the first time, we demonstrated the possibility of AgNP release to membrane-treated water through direct AgNP detachment.

Dead-end filtration exhibited silver mass release an order of magnitude lower than the other three tests. Although cross-flow filtration may best represent the RO membrane operation, quantifying silver release suffers from poor mass balance due to the adsorption of dissolved silver by various reactor components and large volumes of water usage. A commonly applied batch immersion method was low cost and easily performed, but may not induce hydraulic shear sufficient for AgNP detachment from a RO membrane.

We used an extensive in silico workflow combining several bioinformatics tools for function annotation, sub-cellular localization and physicochemical characterization, three-dimensional structure determination, and protein-protein interactions.

Protein analysis can reveal the chemical composition of natural adhesives; however, developing synthetic analogs that mimic their performance remains a challenge due to an incomplete understanding of adhesion processes. Here, it is shown that acorn barnacles (Amphibalanus (=Balanus) amphitrite) secrete a phase-separating fluid ahead of growth and cement deposition.

Nearby biofilms rapidly oxidize and lift off the surface as the secretion advances.

Using the tractable model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can form biofilms, we investigate the interactions of environmental isolates with different social phenotypes.

Furthermore, biofilms may protect against killer toxin, a warfare phenotype.

Two forms of arsenic (As(III), As(V)) with different concentrations were used for induction of the oxidative stress in tested strains. Microbiological methods showed that the growth inhibition of MSSA was higher than that of MRSA in presence of both arsenic ions. As(III) showed 24% and 33% higher anti-microbial effects than As(V) against MSSA and MRSA respectively. A similar result was found also in the experiment of reduction of biofilm-formation. By using spectrophotometry, it was revealed that As(III) induced higher antioxidant production in both bacterial cultures. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus produced an app. 50 mg equivalent of gallic acid (GAE/1 mg of protein) and MRSA produced an app. 15 mg of GAE/1 mg of protein. The productions of metallothionein in MSSA and MRSA were decreased up to 62.41% and 55.84% respectively in presence of As ions. Reduction of As(III) and As(V) concentrations leads to a decrease in antioxidant production and increased the formation of metallothionein. All of these changes in the results were found to be significant statistically. Taken together, these experiments proved that in comparison with MSSA, MRSA is less susceptible not only to the antimicrobial effects of antibiotics but also against effects caused by metalloids, as arsenic. Thus, it can be stated that MRSA abounds with complex defensive mechanisms, which may in the future constitute significant problem in the efficiency of antibiotics alternatives as metal ions or nanoparticles.","authors":[{"name":"Pavlina Jelinkova"},{"name":"Radek Vesely"},{"name":"Kristyna Cihalova"},{"name":"Dagmar Hegerova"},{"name":"Hanadi Abd Alrahman Ali Ananbeh"},{"name":"Lukas Richtera"},{"name":"Kristyna Smerkova"},{"name":"Martin Brtnicky"},{"name":"Jindrich Kynicky"},{"name":"Amitava Moulick"},{"name":"Vojtech Adam"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Growth inhibition"},{"word":"Metals"},{"word":"Microbes"},{"word":"Oxidative stress"}]},"article153":{"pmid":"29936172","title":"Potential of synthetic chalcone derivatives to prevent marine biofouling.","abs":"Biofouling represents a major economic, environmental and health concern for which new eco-friendly solutions are needed.

The pathogenicity of S.aureus isolates are related with features like adherence, various toxins, enzymes, structural and extracellular factors. Slime factor and biofilm formation are also the pathogenicity factors of the bacteria. Biofilm formation is usually associated with chronic infections and has become a subject of interest in a wide area of research. Biofilm is an adherent structure formed by bacteria encased within a matrix produced on natural body surfaces or medical devices. As the biofilm producing S.aureus isolates are more resistant to antibiotics and and their biofilms prevent phagocytosis, the treatment of infections caused by biofilm positive S.aureus isolates become difficult. The icaADBC locus and some proteins have provento be responsible for the formation of S.aureus type biofilm. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the genotypic and phenotypic detection methods of biofilm formation with icaA, icaD and bap genes and phenotype expressions which are responsible for the formation of biofilm in S.aureus isolates. One hundred seventy five S.aureus isolates from various clinical specimens were included in the study. For the phenotypic detection of biofilm producing isolates Congo red agar (CRA) medium and microplate method were used. The biofilm-producing strain Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984 and S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. One hundred fifty two S.aureus biofilm producing isolates were detected at least by either Congo Red agar or microplate method and all isolates were screened for icaA, icaD and bap genes by PCR. The production of polysaccharide intracellular adhesins /poly-N-acetyl-beta-1-6-glucosamine (PIA/PNAG) was also investigated in S.aureus isolates. For the detection of PIA/PNAG chemiluminescence dot-blot method was used. According to the phenotypic evaluations based on colony morphologies in CRA medium, biofilm formation were found as negative in 101 of 175 isolates (57.7%), while biofilm formation were positive in 74 (42.3%) of the isolates. As a result of quantitative evaluation by microplate method based on absorbance measurement, biofilm production was determined as negative in 34 (19.4%) specimens, moderate in 112 (64.0%) specimens and strong in 29 (16.6%) specimens. Microplate and CRA methods were incompatible with each other when compared for their biofilm production determination (p< 0.001). Among the 152 clinical isolates used to determine the presence of icaA and icaD genes responsible for the formation of biofilms, the genes were detected in 136 (89.5%) of the isolates and in the S.epidermidis ATCC 35984 strain used as a positive control. icaA and icaD genes were not detected in sixteen of the 152 (10.5%) clinical isolates and in the S.epidermidis ATCC 12228 strain used as a negative control. A weak-moderate correlation was found between icaA and icaD genes and biofilm production determined in CRA medium. A good correlation was found between icaA and icaD genes and biofilm production detected in microplate method. bap gene was determined in only one of the 152 clinical S.aureus isolates studied and in S.aureus V329 strain used as positive control. For the detection of PIA/PNAG which was synthesized by icaADBC genes, 50 clinical S.aureus isolates were used. PNAG production was determined in 42 isolates with positive icaA and icaD genes by the chemiluminescence dot-blot method, and no PNAG production was determined among eight isolates with negative ica genes. As a result, it was found that the microplate method was more sensitive and reliable for the phenotypic determination of biofilm formation in S.aureus isolates, high level of biofilm formation among clinical S.aureus isolates (about 80%), the role of icaA and icaD genes and products (PIA/PNAG) in biofilm production was determined.","authors":[{"name":"Rasim Şahin"},{"name":"İlknur Kaleli"}],"keywords":[]},"article161":{"pmid":"29933557","title":"Phenolic and Nonpolar Fractions of Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.)

Four metamorphic stones widely used in the façade and showing rather different compositional, mineralogical and microstructural features were studied. The state of conservation of the stones was characterized under the mineralogical and compositional point of view by X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transformed infrared analysis. The microstructure of colonized substrates and of reference not colonized ones was studied by means of optical and electron microscopy, to comparatively evaluate the damage extent and weathering patterns in both conservative conditions. The structure and the architecture of biofilms growing on different lithic surfaces were investigated by CLSM in both fluorescence and reflection modes. Captured images were analyzed for 3D reconstructions of biofilm samples. The biovolumes were also calculated to estimate the total biomass. The results indicate that the four lithotypes showed different colonization extents. However, even in presence of extensive biological growth, chemical-physical deterioration mechanisms caused by environmental exposure were largely responsible for deterioration. A relationship between compositional and surface morphological features and biocolonization was also observed.","authors":[{"name":"Davide Gulotta"},{"name":"Federica Villa"},{"name":"Francesca Cappitelli"},{"name":"Lucia Toniolo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocolonization"},{"word":"Bioreceptivity"},{"word":"Marble"},{"word":"Metamorphic stones"},{"word":"Stone deterioration"},{"word":"Subaerial biofilm"}]},"article173":{"pmid":"29929218","title":"Exogenous N-acyl homoserine lactones facilitate microbial adhesion of high ammonia nitrogen wastewater on biocarrier surfaces.","abs":"Startup of biofilm process triggered by initial adhesion of bacteria is difficult in high ammonia nitrogen wastewater treatment.

It was shown that synthetic peptides can be used in conjunction with the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, meropenem, erythromycin, gentamicin, and vancomycin to improve the treatment outcome of murine cutaneous abscesses caused by clinical hard-to-treat pathogens including all ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae) pathogens and Escherichia coli. Promisingly, combination treatment often showed synergistic effects that significantly reduced abscess sizes and/or improved clearance of bacterial isolates from the infection site, regardless of the antibiotic mode of action.

The strong exponential correlation (R2 ≥ 0.97) between the culturable cell counts in water and the pipe surface-to-volume ratio suggests the biofilm as the main contributor to the rapid increase in suspended culturable cells measured after a short stagnation of one-hour. Results evidence the contribution of the high surface-to-volume ratio at the point of use and the impact of short stagnation times on the increased bacterial load observed. Simple faucets with minimal internal surface area should be preferred to minimize surface area.

Here we use an individual-based simulation model of microbial biofilms to investigate how competitive and mutualistic interactions between an antibiotic-resistant and a susceptible strain (or species) influence the two-lineage community response to antibiotic exposure. Our model predicts that while increasing competition and antibiotics leads to increasing competitive release of the antibiotic-resistant strain, hitting a mutualistic community of cross-feeding species with antibiotics leads to a mutualistic suppression effect where both susceptible and resistant species are harmed. We next show that the impact of antibiotics is further governed by emergent spatial feedbacks within communities. Mutualistic cross-feeding communities can rescue susceptible members by subsidizing their growth inside the biofilm despite lack of access to the nutrient-rich and high-antibiotic growing front. Moreover, we show that antibiotic detoxification by resistant cells can protect nearby susceptible cells, but such cross-protection is more effective in mutualistic communities because mutualism drives mixing of resistant and susceptible cells. In contrast, competition leads to segregation, which ultimately prevents susceptible cells to profit from detoxification. Understanding how the interplay between microbial metabolic interactions and community spatial structuring shapes the outcome of antibiotic treatment can be key to effectively leverage the power of antibiotics and promote microbiome health.","authors":[{"name":"Sylvie Estrela"},{"name":"Sam P Brown"}],"keywords":[]},"article180":{"pmid":"29927357","title":"Enhanced Control of Plant Wilt Disease by a Xylose-Inducible degQ Gene Engineered into Bacillus velezensis Strain SQR9XYQ.","abs":"Bacillus velezensis SQR9 (former B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9) is a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) that promotes plant growth and health.

To inhibit the bacterial adhesion and proliferation on biomaterials, several surface functionalization strategies have been developed. However, most of these strategies lead to bacteriostatic effect and only few of these are able to reach the bactericidal condition. In this work, bactericidal surfaces were designed through the functionalization of titanium surfaces with poly-l-lysine (PLL) as the mediator for the incorporation of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). This functionalization influences the adsorption of the particles on the substrate impeding the agglomeration observed when bare titanium surfaces are used, leading to a homogeneous distribution of AgNPs on the surfaces. The antimicrobial activity of this surface has been tested against two different strains, namely, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For both strains and different AgNPs sizes, the surface modified with PLL and AgNPs shows a much enhanced antimicrobial activity in comparison with AgNPs deposited on bare titanium. This enhanced antibacterial activity is high enough to reach bactericidal effect, a condition hard to achieve in antimicrobial surfaces. Importantly, the designed surfaces are able to decrease the bacterial viability more than 5 orders with respect to the initial bacterial inoculum. That means that a relative low load of AgNPs on the PLL-modified titanium surfaces reaches 99.999% bacterial death after 24 h. The results of the present study are important to avoid infections in indwelling materials by reinforcing the preventive antibiotic therapy usually dosed throughout the surgical procedure and during the postoperative period.","authors":[{"name":"Fiorela Ghilini"},{"name":"Miriam C Rodríguez González"},{"name":"Alejandro G Miñán"},{"name":"Diego Pissinis"},{"name":"Alberto Hernández Creus"},{"name":"Roberto C Salvarezza"},{"name":"Patricia L Schilardi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bactericidal"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"poly-l-lysine"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"},{"word":"titanium functionalization"}]},"article182":{"pmid":"29926958","title":"Dental plaque-induced gingival conditions.","abs":"This review proposes revisions to the current classification system for gingival diseases and provides a rationale for how it differs from the 1999 classification system.","authors":[{"name":"Shinya Murakami"},{"name":"Brian L Mealey"},{"name":"Angelo Mariotti"},{"name":"Iain L C Chapple"}],"keywords":[{"word":"diagnosis"},{"word":"evidence-based dentistry"},{"word":"gingivitis"}]},"article183":{"pmid":"29926954","title":"Peri-implant mucositis.","abs":"This narrative review was prepared for the 2017 World Workshop of the American Academy of Periodontology and European Federation of Periodontology to address key questions related to the clinical condition of peri-implant mucositis, including: 1) the definition of peri-implant mucositis, 2) conversion of peri-implant health to the biofilm-induced peri-implant mucositis lesion, 3) reversibility of peri-implant mucositis, 4) the long-standing peri-implant mucositis lesion, 5) similarities and differences between peri-implant mucositis at implants and gingivitis at teeth, and 6) risk indicators/factors for peri-implant mucositis.","authors":[{"name":"Lisa J A Heitz-Mayfield"},{"name":"Giovanni E Salvi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"peri-implant disease"},{"word":"peri-implant mucositis"},{"word":"peri-implantitis"},{"word":"risk factor"},{"word":"risk indicator"}]},"article184":{"pmid":"29926944","title":"Periodontal health and gingival diseases and conditions on an intact and a reduced periodontium: Consensus report of workgroup 1 of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions.","abs":"Periodontal health is defined by absence of clinically detectable inflammation.

Clinical gingival health can be restored following treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis.

Two broad categories of gingival diseases include non-dental plaque biofilm-induced gingival diseases and dental plaque-induced gingivitis. Non-dental plaque biofilm-induced gingival diseases include a variety of conditions that are not caused by plaque and usually do not resolve following plaque removal. Such lesions may be manifestations of a systemic condition or may be localized to the oral cavity.

The objectives of this study were to synthesize a novel bioactive dental bonding agent containing dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) to inhibit biofilm formation at the tooth-restoration margin and to investigate the effects of water-aging for 6 months on the dentin bond strength and protein-repellent and antibacterial durability. A protein-repellent agent (MPC) and antibacterial agent (DMAHDM) were added to a Scotchbond multi-purpose (SBMP) primer and adhesive. Specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 1, 30, 90, or 180 days (d). At the end of each time period, the dentin bond strength and protein-repellent and antibacterial properties were evaluated. Protein attachment onto resin specimens was measured by the micro-bicinchoninic acid approach. A dental plaque microcosm biofilm model was used to test the biofilm response. The SBMP + MPC + DMAHDM group showed no decline in dentin bond strength after water-aging for 6 months, which was significantly higher than that of the control (P < 0.05). The SBMP + MPC + DMAHDM group had protein adhesion that was only 1/20 of that of the SBMP control (P < 0.05). Incorporation of MPC and DMAHDM into SBMP provided a synergistic effect on biofilm reduction. The antibacterial effect and resistance to protein adsorption exhibited no decrease from 1 to 180 d (P > 0.1). In conclusion, a bonding agent with MPC and DMAHDM achieved a durable dentin bond strength and long-term resistance to proteins and oral bacteria. The novel dental bonding agent is promising for applications in preventive and restorative dentistry to reduce biofilm formation at the tooth-restoration margin.","authors":[{"name":"Ning Zhang"},{"name":"Ke Zhang"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"David J Xu"},{"name":"Mark A Reynolds"},{"name":"Yuxing Bai"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"}],"keywords":[]},"article194":{"pmid":"29925842","title":"Publisher Correction: Anti-Psl Targeting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms for Neutrophil-Mediated Disruption.","abs":"A correction to this article has been published and is linked from the HTML and PDF versions of this paper.

In pursuit of complementary morphologies, formation of graphene foams is often preferred over the native two-dimensional (2D) forms due to the higher available area. Graphene foams have been successfully prepared by several routes including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods and by wet-chemical approaches. For these methods, one often needs either high temperature furnaces and highly pure gases or large amounts of strong acids and oxidants. In 2014, using a commercial laser scribing system as found in most machine shops, a direct lasing of polyimide (PI) plastic films in the air converted the PI into 3D porous graphene, a material termed laser-induced graphene (LIG). This is a one-step method without the need for high-temperature reaction conditions, solvent, or subsequent treatments, and it affords graphene with many five-and seven-membered rings. With such an atomic arrangement, one might call LIG kinetic graphene since there is no annealing in the process that causes the rearrangement to the preferred all-six-membered-ring form. In this Account, we will first introduce the approaches that have been developed for making LIG and to control the morphology as either porous sheets or fibrils, and to control porosity, composition, and surface properties. The surfaces can be varied from being either superhydrophilic with a 0° contact angle with water to being superhydrophobic having >150° contact angle with water. While it was initially thought that the LIG process could only be performed on PI, it was later shown that a host of other polymeric substrates, nonpolymers, metal/plastic composites, and biodegradable and naturally occurring materials and foods could be used as platforms for generating LIG. Methods of preparation include roll-to-roll production for fabrication of in-plane electronics and two different 3D printing (additive manufacturing) routes to specific shapes of LIG monoliths using both laminated object manufacturing and powder bed fabrication methods. Use of the LIG in devices is performed very simply. This is showcased with high performance supercapacitors, fuel cell materials for oxygen reduction reactions, water splitting for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions coming from the same plastic sheet, sensor devices, oil/water purification platforms, and finally applications in both passive and active biofilm inhibitors. So the ease of formation of LIG, its simple scale-up, and its utility for a range of applications highlights the easy transition of this substrate-bound graphene foam into commercial device platforms.","authors":[{"name":"Ruquan Ye"},{"name":"Dustin K James"},{"name":"James M Tour"}],"keywords":[]},"article199":{"pmid":"29924414","title":"Reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms from implant materials in a diffusion dominated environment.","abs":"Antibiotic-loaded calcium sulfate beads (CS-B) are used to treat biofilm-related periprosthetic joint infections (PJI).

Finally, the effects of angelicin on a mouse model of periodontitis were also investigated. The results showed that psoralen and angelicin had beneficial dose-dependent effects regarding the inhibition of planktonic P. gingivalis and biofilms of P. gingivalis. There were no significant differences in the viability of monocyte-like THP-1 cells and human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) treated with either psoralen or angelicin compared to the untreated control cells.

These lipids fulfill various important functions, from sliding motility or biofilm formation to interaction with host cells and intramacrophage trafficking. Being highly immunogenic, the induction of a strong humoral response is likely to select for rough low-GPL producers. These, in contrast to the smooth high-GPL producers, display aggregative properties, which strongly impacts upon intracellular survival. A propensity to grow as extracellular cords allows these low-GPL producing bacilli to escape the innate immune defenses. Transitioning from high-GPL to low-GPL producers implicates mutations within genes involved in biosynthesis or transport of GPL. This leads to induction of an intense pro-inflammatory response and robust and lethal infections in animal models, explaining the presence of rough isolates in patients with decreased pulmonary functions.

Additional studies, aimed at understanding the toxicity mechanism of MgONPs, indicated that physical injury occurred to the cell membranes, along with decreased motility and biofilm formation ability of R. solanacearum, due to the direct attachment of MgONPs to the surfaces of the bacterial cells, which was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Because of the limited drug arsenal available to treat general fungal infections and the frequent failure of onychomycosis treatment, the search for new therapeutic sources is essential, and topical treatment with natural products for onychomycosis has been encouraged. Propolis, an adhesive resinous compound produced by honeybees (Apis mellifera), has shown multiple biological properties including significant antifungal and anti-biofilm activities in vitro. In spite of promising in vitro results, in vivo results have not been reported so far. This study assessed an ethanol propolis extract (PE) as a topical therapeutic option for onychomycosis, including its characterization in vitro and its applicability as a treatment for onychomycosis (from bench to clinic). The in vitro evaluation included analysis of the cytotoxicity and the antifungal activity against the planktonic cells and biofilm formed by Trichophyton spp. We also evaluated the capacity of PE to penetrate human nails. Patients with onychomycosis received topical PE treatments, with a 6-month follow-up period. The results of the in vitro assays showed that PE was non-toxic to the cell lines tested, and efficient against both the planktonic cells and the biofilm formed by Trichophyton spp. The results also showed that PE is able to penetrate the human nail. The results for PE applied topically to treat onychomycosis were promising, with complete mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis in 56.25% of the patients. PE is an inexpensive commercially available option, easy to obtain and monitor. Our results indicated that PE is a promising natural compound for onychomycosis treatment, due to its ability to penetrate the nail without cytotoxicity, and its good antifungal performance against species such as Trichophyton spp. that are resistant to conventional antifungals, both in vitro and in patients.","authors":[{"name":"Flavia F Veiga"},{"name":"Marina C Gadelha"},{"name":"Marielen R T da Silva"},{"name":"Maiara I Costa"},{"name":"Brenda Kischkel"},{"name":"Lidiane V de Castro-Hoshino"},{"name":"Francielle Sato"},{"name":"Mauro L Baesso"},{"name":"Morgana F Voidaleski"},{"name":"Vanessa Vasconcellos-Pontello"},{"name":"Vânia A Vicente"},{"name":"Marcos L Bruschi"},{"name":"Melyssa Negri"},{"name":"Terezinha I E Svidzinski"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antifungal activity"},{"word":"dermatophytosis"},{"word":"ex vivo nail model"},{"word":"natural products"},{"word":"permeation property"},{"word":"photoacoustic spectroscopy"},{"word":"propolis"}]},"article213":{"pmid":"29922159","title":"Spectrum-Effect Relationships Between the Bioactive Ingredient of Syringa oblata Lindl.

The spectrum-effect relationships method was applied to screen the main active ingredients in S. oblata obtained from Heilongjiang Province based on gray relational analysis. The results revealed that Sub-MICs obtained from 10 batches of S. oblata could inhibit biofilm formation by S. suis. Gray relational analysis revealed variations in the contents of 15 main peaks and rutin was discovered to be the main active ingredient. Then, the function of rutin was further verified by inhibiting S. suis biofilm formation using crystal violet staining. Computational studies revealed that rutin may target the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein in the biofilm formation of S. suis. In conclusion, this study revealed that the spectrum-effect relationships and computational studies are useful tools to associate the active ingredient with the potential anti-biofilm effects of S. oblata.

In addition, subsequent methionine oxidation and disulfide reduction contribute to heterogeneous photodamage. The proximity to tryptophan residues explains >95% of the photodamage across the protein structures. The presence of redox active organic matter or a model antioxidant in solution quenched not only photoinactivation and tryptophan oxidation but also all subsequent damage.

Their tolerances are often attributed to reduced activities of antibiotic targets, which limit corruption and damage in persisters compared with bacteria that die from treatment. However, that model does not hold for nongrowing populations treated with ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, where antibiotic-induced damage is comparable between cells that live and those that die. To understand how those persisters achieve this feat, we employed a genetic system that uses orthogonal control of MazF and MazE, a toxin and its cognate antitoxin, to generate model persisters that are uniformly tolerant to ofloxacin. Despite this complete tolerance, MazF model persisters required the same DNA repair machinery (RecA, RecB, and SOS induction) to survive ofloxacin treatment as their nongrowing, WT counterparts and exhibited similar indicators of DNA damage from treatment. Further investigation revealed that, following treatment, the timing of DNA repair was critical to MazF persister survival because, when repair was delayed until after growth and DNA synthesis resumed, survival was compromised. In addition, we found that, with nongrowing, WT planktonic and biofilm populations, stalling the resumption of growth and DNA synthesis after the conclusion of fluoroquinolone treatment with a prevalent type of stress at infection sites (nutrient limitation) led to near complete survival. These findings illustrate that the timing of events, such as DNA repair, following fluoroquinolone treatment is important to persister survival and provide further evidence that knowledge of the postantibiotic recovery period is critical to understanding persistence phenotypes.","authors":[{"name":"Wendy W K Mok"},{"name":"Mark P Brynildsen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNA damage"},{"word":"MazF"},{"word":"SOS response"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"starvation"}]},"article233":{"pmid":"29914989","title":"The OmpR Regulator of Burkholderia multivorans Controls Mucoid-to-Nonmucoid Transition and Other Cell Envelope Properties Associated with Persistence in the Cystic Fibrosis Lung.","abs":"Bacteria from the Burkholderia cepacia complex grow in different natural and man-made environments and are feared opportunistic pathogens that cause chronic respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients.

As bacteria commonly reside in biofilms, there has been an increased interest in studying these phenomena within biofilms in recent years. This review summarizes the present knowledge within this important area of research. Studies on bacterial evolution in biofilms have shown that mature biofilms develop into diverse communities over time. There is growing evidence that the biofilm lifestyle may be more mutagenic than planktonic growth. Furthermore, all three main mechanisms for HGT have been observed in biofilms. This has been shown to occur both within and between bacterial species, and higher transfer rates in biofilms than in planktonic cultures were detected. Of special concern are the observations that mutants with increased antibiotic resistance occur at higher frequency in biofilms than in planktonic cultures even in the absence of antibiotic exposure. Likewise, efficient dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes, as well as virulence genes, has been observed within the biofilm environment.

Therefore, the aim of this experimental study was to compare the bacterial colonization and the tissue compatibility of a hypoallergenic polyamide with a frequently used PMMA resin tested intraorally in a randomized split-mouth design. Test specimens made of polyamide (n = 10) and PMMA (n = 10) were attached over a molar band appliance in oral cavity of 10 subjects. A cytological smear test was done from palatal mucosa at baseline and after four weeks. The monolayers were inspected for micronuclei. After four weeks in situ, the appliance was removed. The test specimens were immediately cultivated on non-selective and selective nutrient media. All growing colonies were identified using VITEK-MS. The anonymized results were analyzed descriptively. A total of 110 different bacterial species could be isolated, including putative pathogens. An average of 17.8 different bacterial species grew on the PMMA specimens, and 17.3 on the polyamide specimens. The highest number of different bacterial species was n = 24, found on a PMMA specimen. On the two specimens, a similar bacterial distribution was observed. Micronuclei, as a marker for genotoxic potential of dental materials, were not detected. This study indicates that the composition of bacterial biofilm developed on these resins after four weeks is not influenced by the type of resin itself. The two materials showed no cytological differences. This investigation suggests that polyamide and PMMA are suitable for clinical use as denture base material.","authors":[{"name":"Constanze Olms"},{"name":"Maryam Yahiaoui-Doktor"},{"name":"Torsten W Remmerbach"},{"name":"Catalina Suzana Stingu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"cell biology"},{"word":"polyamide"},{"word":"polymethyl methacrylate"}]},"article237":{"pmid":"29914092","title":"Collagen from Cartilaginous Fish By-Products for a Potential Application in Bioactive Film Composite.","abs":"The acid solubilised collagen (ASC) and pepsin solubilised collagen (PSC) were extracted from the by-products (skin) of a cartilaginous fish (Mustelus mustelus).

N. gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative bacterium responsible for gonorrhea, infects humans exclusively and can form aggregates during infection. While minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests are often used for determining antibiotic resistance development and treatment, the knowledge of the true MIC in individual patients and how it relates to this laboratory measure is not known. We examined the effect of aggregation on GC antibiotic susceptibility and the relationship between bacterial aggregate size and their antibiotic susceptibility. Aggregated GC have a higher survival rate when treated with ceftriaxone than non-aggregated GC, with bacteria in the core of the aggregates surviving the treatment. GC lacking opacity-associated protein or pili, or expressing a truncated lipooligosaccharide, three surface molecules that mediate GC-GC interactions, reduce both aggregation and ceftriaxone survival. This study demonstrates that the aggregation of N. gonorrhoeae can reduce the susceptibility to antibiotics, and suggests that antibiotic utilization can select for GC surface molecules that promote aggregation which in turn drive pathogen evolution. Inhibiting aggregation may be a potential way of increasing the efficacy of ceftriaxone treatment, consequently reducing treatment failure.","authors":[{"name":"Liang-Chun Wang"},{"name":"Madeline Litwin"},{"name":"Zahraossadat Sahiholnasab"},{"name":"Wenxia Song"},{"name":"Daniel C Stein"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gonorrhea"},{"word":"increased susceptibility"},{"word":"recurrence"},{"word":"treatment failure"}]},"article239":{"pmid":"29913401","title":"Removal of precursors of typical nitrogenous disinfection byproducts in ozonation integrated with biological activated carbon (O","abs":"The O","authors":[{"name":"Jian Zheng"},{"name":"Tao Lin"},{"name":"Wei Chen"},{"name":"Hui Tao"},{"name":"Yiwen Tan"},{"name":"Baiwen Ma"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biological activated carbon"},{"word":"Drinking water treatment"},{"word":"Nitrogenous disinfection byproducts"},{"word":"Precursors"},{"word":"Soluble microbial products"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"29913266","title":"The mechanism of iron-compensation for manganese deficiency of Streptococcus pneumoniae.","abs":"Given their involvement in catalysis, infection, and biofilm formation, Fe and Mn are essential for bacterial survival and virulence.

The PaP1-resistant variant, termed PA1RG, showed decreased adsorption to PaP1 and was devoid of long chain O-antigen on its cell envelope. Whole genome sequencing and comparative analysis revealed a single nucleotide mutation in the gene PA1S_08510, which encodes the O-antigen polymerase Wzy that is involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis.

Synthesis of these polymers often involves the assembly of monomer oligosaccharide units on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl-phosphate at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. For many polymers, including cell wall peptidoglycan, the lipid-linked precursors must be transported across the membrane by flippases to facilitate polymerization at the membrane surface. Flippase activity for this class of polysaccharides is most often attributed to MOP (Multidrug/Oligosaccharidyl-lipid/Polysaccharide) family proteins. Little is known about how this ubiquitous class of transporters identifies and translocates its cognate precursor over the many different types of lipid-linked oligosaccharides produced by a given bacterial cell. To investigate the specificity determinants of MOP proteins, we selected for variants of the WzxC flippase involved in Escherichia coli capsule (colanic acid) synthesis that can substitute for the essential MurJ MOP-family protein and promote transport of cell wall peptidoglycan precursors. Variants with substitutions predicted to destabilize the inward-open conformation of WzxC lost substrate specificity and supported both capsule and peptidoglycan synthesis. Our results thus suggest that specific substrate recognition by a MOP transporter normally destabilizes the inward-open state, promoting transition to the outward-open conformation and concomitant substrate translocation. Furthermore, the ability of WzxC variants to suppress MurJ inactivation provides strong support for the designation of MurJ as the flippase for peptidoglycan precursors, the identity of which has been controversial.","authors":[{"name":"Lok-To Sham"},{"name":"Sanduo Zheng"},{"name":"Anastasiya A Yakhnina"},{"name":"Andrew C Kruse"},{"name":"Thomas G Bernhardt"}],"keywords":[]},"article264":{"pmid":"29907449","title":"High-risk Staphylococcus aureus transmission in the operating room: A call for widespread improvements in perioperative hand hygiene and patient decolonization practices.","abs":"Increased awareness of the epidemiology of transmission of pathogenic bacterial strain characteristics may help to improve compliance with intraoperative infection control measures.

The kernels of M. indica, obtained from raw and ripe fruits, were macerated using various solvents. Agar diffusion and broth microdilution methods were performed to investigate the antibacterial activities of the extracts against P. acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The ethanolic fractions exhibited the strongest antimicrobial effect against P. acnes with minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of 1.56 mg/mL and 12.50 mg/mL, respectively. Bactericidal effect against P. acnes of these extracts could be observed after 3 h of incubation from time-kill curve. The chromatograms of high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the extracts existed gallic acid with high total phenolic content. These extracts additionally showed strong free radical scavenging properties on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) as well as a notable inhibitory effect on linoleic acid peroxidation, which highly correlated to their antimicrobial effect, total phenolic, and gallic acid contents. The images, studied through using transmission electron microscopy, revealed that the extract certainly disrupted P. acnes cell membrane after exposure for 1 h as well as induced the consequent leakage of cytoplasmic materials. The inhibitory effects of the extracts on IL-8 secretion from LPS-inducing RAW 264.7 cells were also presented. In conclusion, the kernel extracts of raw M. indica fruit were effective against aerobic and anaerobic acne-inducing bacteria particularly P. acnes and exerted antioxidant along with anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, the extracts might be potential agents for inflammatory acne treatment.

No less than seven sRNAs (McaS, RprA, GcvB, RydC, RybB, OmrA and OmrB) are known to repress the expression of the curli activator CsgD. Many of the sRNAs repress CsgD production by binding to the csgD mRNA at sites far upstream of the ribosomal binding site. The precise mechanism behind sRNA-mediated regulation of CsgD synthesis is largely unknown. In this study, we identify a conserved A/U-rich region in the csgD mRNA 5' untranslated region, which is cleaved upon binding of the small RNAs, McaS, RprA or GcvB, to sites located more than 30 nucleotides downstream. Mutational analysis shows that the A/U-rich region as well as an adjacent stem-loop structure are required for McaS-stimulated degradation, also serving as a binding platform for the RNA chaperone Hfq. Prevention of McaS-activated cleavage completely relieves repression, suggesting that endoribonucleolytic cleavage of csgD mRNA is the primary regulatory effect exerted by McaS.

In this work, 19 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa originating from intubated patients in an intensive care unit have been characterized and compared to the lab reference strain PAO1 and a rmlC lipopolysaccharide mutant of PAO1. The adhesion and biofilm formation was monitored, as well as cell properties such as hydrophobicity, zeta potential and motility. Two groups of isolates were observed: one with high adhesion to polymer surfaces and one with low adhesion (the latter including PAO1). Furthermore, detailed biofilm assays in a flow system were performed using five characteristic isolates from the two groups. Confocal microscopy showed that the adhesion and biofilm formation of four of these five strains could be reduced dramatically on zwitterionic surface coatings. However, one isolate with pronounced swarming colonized and formed biofilm also on the antifouling surface. We demonstrate that the biofilm properties of clinical isolates can differ greatly from that of a standard lab strain and propose two clinical model strains for testing of materials designed for prevention of biofilm formation in the respiratory tract.

Therefore, native biofilms, as the prominent life form of microorganisms in almost all known ecosystems, will be subjected to AgNP exposure. Despite the exponentially growing research activities worldwide, it is still difficult to assess nanoparticle-mediated toxicity in natural environments. In order to obtain an ecotoxicologically relevant exposure scenario, we performed experiments with artificial stream mesocosm systems approaching low dose AgNP concentrations close to predicted environmental concentrations. Pregrown freshwater biofilms were exposed for 14 days to citrate-stabilized AgNPs at a concentration of 600 μg l-1 in two commonly used sizes (30 and 70 nm). Sublethal effects of AgNP treatment were assessed with regard to biofilm structure by gravimetric measurements (biofilm thickness and density) and by two biomass parameters, chlorophyll a and protein content. The composition of bacterial biofilm communities was characterized by t-RFLP fingerprinting combined with phylogenetic studies based on the 16S gene. After 14 days of treatment, the structural parameters of the biofilm such as thickness, density, and chlorophyll a and protein content were not statistically significantly changed by AgNP exposure. Furthermore, t-RFLP fingerprint analysis showed that the bacterial diversity was not diminished by AgNPs, as calculated by Shannon Wiener and evenness indices. Nevertheless, t-RFLP analysis also indicated that AgNPs led to an altered biofilm community composition as was shown by cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on the Bray Curtis index. Sequence analysis of cloned 16S rRNA genes further revealed that changes in community composition were related with the displacement of putatively AgNP-sensitive bacterial taxa Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria by taxa known for their enhanced adaptability towards metal stress, such as Acidobacteria, Sphingomonadales, and Comamonadaceae. This measurable community shift, even after low dose AgNP treatment, causes serious concerns with respect to the broad application of AgNPs and their potentially adverse impact on the ecological function of lotic biofilms, such as biodegradation or biostabilization.","authors":[{"name":"Alexandra Y Grün"},{"name":"Constantin B App"},{"name":"Andreas Breidenbach"},{"name":"Jutta Meier"},{"name":"George Metreveli"},{"name":"Gabriele E Schaumann"},{"name":"Werner Manz"}],"keywords":[]},"article282":{"pmid":"29902223","title":"Modelling of ciprofloxacin killing enhanced by hyperbaric oxygen treatment in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms.","abs":"In chronic lung infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) the bacteria thrive in biofilm structures protected from the immune system of the host and from antibiotic treatment.

This is achieved in a reaction-diffusion model that describes the combined effect of ciprofloxacin diffusion, oxygen diffusion and depletion, bacterial growth and killing, and adaptation of the bacteria to ciprofloxacin. In the model, the oxygen diffusion and depletion use a set of parameters derived from experimental results presented in this work. The part of the model describing ciprofloxacin killing uses parameter values from the literature in combination with our estimates (Jacobs, et al., 2016; Grillon, et al., 2016).

The parameters were validated against existing data from an HBOT experiment by Kolpen et al. (2017). The complete oxygen model comprises a reaction-diffusion equation describing the oxygen consumption by using a Michaelis-Menten reaction term. The oxygen model performed well in predicting oxygen concentrations in both time and depth into the biofilm. At 2.8 bar pure oxygen pressure, HBOT increases the penetration depth of oxygen into the biofilm almost by a of factor 4 in agreement with the scaling that follows from the stationary balance between the consumption term and diffusion term.","authors":[{"name":"Peter Alexander Vistar Gade"},{"name":"Terkel Bo Olsen"},{"name":"Peter Østrup Jensen"},{"name":"Mette Kolpen"},{"name":"Niels Høiby"},{"name":"Kaj-Åge Henneberg"},{"name":"Thomas Sams"}],"keywords":[]},"article283":{"pmid":"29902011","title":"Block Copolymer Nanoparticles Remove Biofilms of Drug-Resistant Gram-Positive Bacteria by Nanoscale Bacterial Debridement.","abs":"Biofilms and the rapid evolution of multidrug resistance complicate the treatment of bacterial infections.

DA95B5 self-assembles into core-shell nanoparticles with a nonfouling dextran shell and a cationic core. These nanoparticles diffuse into biofilms and attach to bacteria but do not kill them; instead, they promote the gradual dispersal of biofilm bacteria, probably because the solubility of the bacteria-nanoparticle complex is enhanced by the nanoparticle dextran shell. DA95B5, when applied as a solution to a hydrogel pad dressing, shows excellent in vivo MRSA biofilm removal efficacy of 3.6 log reduction in a murine excisional wound model, which is significantly superior to that for vancomycin. Furthermore, DA95B5 has very low in vitro hemolysis and negligible in vivo acute toxicity. This new strategy for biofilm removal (nanoscale bacterial debridement) is orthogonal to conventional rapidly developing resistance traits in bacteria so that it is as effective toward resistant strains as it is toward sensitive strains and may have widespread applications.","authors":[{"name":"Jianghua Li"},{"name":"Kaixi Zhang"},{"name":"Lin Ruan"},{"name":"Seow Fong Chin"},{"name":"Nirmani Wickramasinghe"},{"name":"Hanbin Liu"},{"name":"Vikashini Ravikumar"},{"name":"Jinghua Ren"},{"name":"Hongwei Duan"},{"name":"Liang Yang"},{"name":"Mary B Chan-Park"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"biocompatibility"},{"word":"cationic copolymer nanoparticles"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"nonhemolytic"}]},"article284":{"pmid":"29901811","title":"Decreased susceptibility of Streptococcus anginosus to vancomycin in a multispecies biofilm is due to increased thickness of the cell wall.","abs":"Streptococcus anginosus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are often co-isolated from the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients.

Bioinformatics analyses indicated that MisL clusters with ATs are involved in bacterial biofilm formation, aggregation and adherence. In this study, we found that the misL overexpression increased S.

However, most studies examining these pretreatments are limited as they have been conducted on single-species cultures, while biofilms are composed of multiple-species communities. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of UV-C irradiation on a model community composed of six environmental isolates from a marine biofilm formed in RO seawater desalination plant. There was a high variance in the susceptibility of the single-isolate cultures to UV-C, from no response (isolate Eryth23) to complete inactivation (isolate Vib3). The most active wavelength was around 260 nm, resulting in a loss of viability of single-isolate cultures and loss of vitality of the mixed-isolate cultures. With respect to biofilm formation, the activity of this wavelength was completely different compared to its activity on planktonic suspension. Irradiation with 260 nm did not inhibit the total biofilm formation by the six-isolate culture; moreover, isolates such as the resistant Eryth23 or the susceptible Pseudoalt17, even gained abundance in the mixed isolate biofilm. The only decrease in total biofilm was obtained from irradiation at 280 nm, which was less active against the planktonic culture. These results indicate that the complexity of the biofilm-forming microbial community may contribute to its resistance to UV-C irradiation.","authors":[{"name":"I Kviatkovski"},{"name":"H Mamane"},{"name":"A Lakretz"},{"name":"I Sherman"},{"name":"D Beno-Moualem"},{"name":"D Minz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"UV resistance"},{"word":"UV-C irradiation"},{"word":"bacterial resistance"},{"word":"biofilm community"},{"word":"biofouling"}]},"article289":{"pmid":"29900920","title":"Effectiveness of nanoparticles solutions and conventional endodontic irrigants against Enterococcus faecalis biofilm.","abs":"To overcome the challenge imposed by the presence of biofilm and reach significant bacterial reduction of the root canals, many irrigants have been indicated during endodontic treatment, among them nanoparticles solutions.","authors":[{"name":"Josiane de Almeida"},{"name":"Bruna Casagrande Cechella"},{"name":"Anarela Vassen Bernardi"},{"name":"Andrea de Lima Pimenta"},{"name":"Wilson Tadeu Felippe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"silver"},{"word":"zinc oxide"}]},"article290":{"pmid":"29900886","title":"Effect of chlorine on Mycobacterium gordonae and Mycobacterium chubuense in planktonic and Biofilm State.","abs":": There is evidence that drinking water could be a source of infections with pathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) potentially risky to human health.

Experiments designed to explore the effect of environment on large scale recombination events used saturating purified donor DNA, short-term cell assemblages on Millipore filters, and mature biofilm mixed cultures. WGS of 22 recombinants for each environment mapped all SNPs that were identical between the recombinant and the donor but not the recipient.

These stress responses have clear implications on the composition and structure of Candida cell wall. Therefore, we studied the impact of lactate, a physiologically relevant carbon source, on the activity of C. albicans RLM1 transcriptional factor. RLM1 is involved in the cell wall integrity pathway and plays an important role in regulating the flow of carbohydrates into cell wall biosynthesis pathways. The role of C. albicans RLM1 in response to lactate adaptation was assessed in respect to several virulence factors, such as the ability to grow under cell wall damaging agents, filament, adhere or form biofilm, as well as to immune recognition. The data showed that growth of C. albicans cells in the presence of lactate induces the secretion of tartaric acid, which has the potential to modulate the TCA cycle on both the yeast and the host cells. In addition, we found that adaptation of C. albicans cells to lactate reduces their internalization by immune cells and consequent % of killing, which could be correlated with a lower exposure of the cell wall β-glucans. In addition, absence of RLM1 has a minor impact on internalization, compared with the wild-type and complemented strains, but it reduces the higher efficiency of lactate grown cells at damaging phagocytic cells and induces a high amount of IL-10, rendering these cells more tolerable to the immune system. The data suggests that RLM1 mediates cell wall remodeling during carbon adaptation, impacting their interaction with immune cells.","authors":[{"name":"João Oliveira-Pacheco"},{"name":"Rosana Alves"},{"name":"Augusto Costa-Barbosa"},{"name":"Bruno Cerqueira-Rodrigues"},{"name":"Patricia Pereira-Silva"},{"name":"Sandra Paiva"},{"name":"Sónia Silva"},{"name":"Mariana Henriques"},{"name":"Célia Pais"},{"name":"Paula Sampaio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. albicans"},{"word":"RLM1"},{"word":"alternative carbon sources"},{"word":"candidiasis"},{"word":"carbon adaptation"},{"word":"cell wall remodeling"},{"word":"lactate"}]},"article309":{"pmid":"29895757","title":"Self-Assembled Nanoporous Biofilms from Functionalized Nanofibrous M13 Bacteriophage.","abs":"Highly periodic and uniform nanostructures, based on a genetically engineered M13 bacteriophage, displayed unique properties at the nanoscale that have the potential for a variety of applications.

Overall, this emerging key information offers new perspectives in the treatment of acne, with future innovative strategies focusing on C. acnes biofilms and/or on its acne-associated phylotypes.","authors":[{"name":"B Dréno"},{"name":"S Pécastaings"},{"name":"S Corvec"},{"name":"S Veraldi"},{"name":"A Khammari"},{"name":"C Roques"}],"keywords":[]},"article313":{"pmid":"29894297","title":"Twitch or swim: towards the understanding of prokaryotic motion based on the type IV pilus blueprint.","abs":"Bacteria and archaea are evolutionarily distinct prokaryotes that diverged from a common ancestor billions of years ago.

To examine the in vivo potential of GE in eradicating the in vivo colonization of S. epidermidis, an implanted rat jugular vein catheter model was developed. Oral supplementation of GE (GE at 200 mg/kg bw for three days) in rats infected with S. epidermidis exhibited a significant reduction of the bacterial burden in catheter, blood, heart and kidney, when compared to the untreated infection control. In addition, GE supplemented animals showed significantly reduced level of inflammatory markers such as nitric oxide and malondialdehyde in heart and kidney tissues. Furthermore, in contrast to the infection control, histopathology analysis of the heart and kidney tissues of the GE-treated group showed a normal histoarchitecture similar to animal control. Thus, the outcome of the present study exhibits the potential of GE as antibiofilm and anti-inflammatory agent against S. epidermidis infections. Furthermore, elucidating the molecular mechanism of GE is important to exploit the therapeutic efficacy of GE.","authors":[{"name":"Kannappan Arunachalam"},{"name":"Mohankumar Ramar"},{"name":"Srinivasan Ramanathan"},{"name":"Archunan Govindaraju"},{"name":"Karutha Pandian Shunmugiah"},{"name":"Ruckmani Kandasamy"},{"name":"Veera Ravi Arumugam"}],"keywords":[]},"article315":{"pmid":"29893737","title":"Treatment of discontinuous emission of sewage sludge odours by a full scale biotrickling filter with an activated carbon polishing unit.","abs":"A SULPHUS","authors":[{"name":"F Sempere"},{"name":"P Winter"},{"name":"A Waalkens"},{"name":"N Hühnert"},{"name":"I Cranshaw"},{"name":"B Beigi"},{"name":"R B Thorpe"}],"keywords":[]},"article316":{"pmid":"29893497","title":"Staphylococcus pseudintermedius biofilms secrete factors that induce inflammatory reactions in vitro.","abs":"Biofilms, composed of bacterial cells embedded in a secreted polysaccharide and protein matrix, often cause problems such as chronic and refractory infections.

In this study, we comparatively analyzed the whole genome sequence of a highly virulent UPEC strain, namely UPEC 26-1, which was isolated from urine sample of a patient suffering from UTI in Korea. Whole genome analysis showed that the genome consists of one circular chromosome of 5,329,753 bp, comprising 5064 protein-coding genes, 122 RNA genes (94 tRNA, 22 rRNA and 6 ncRNA genes), and 100 pseudogenes, with an average G+C content of 50.56%.

Comparative genome analysis of UPEC 26-1 with the UPEC strain CFT073 revealed an average nucleotide identity of 99.7%. The genome comparison with CFT073 provides major differences in the genome of UPEC 26-1 that would explain its increased virulence and biofilm formation. Nineteen of the total GIs were unique to UPEC 26-1 compared to CFT073 and nine of them harbored unique genes that are involved in virulence, multidrug resistance, biofilm formation and bacterial pathogenesis.

P. larvae is a peritrichously flagellated bacterium and, hence, we hypothesized that P. larvae is capable of coordinated and cooperative multicellular behaviors like swarming motility and biofilm formation. In order to analyze these behaviors of P. larvae, we firstly established appropriate functional assays. Using these assays we demonstrated that P. larvae ERIC II, but not P. larvae ERIC I, was capable of swarming. Swarming motility was hampered in a P. larvae ERIC II-mutant lacking production of paenilarvin, an iturin-like lipopeptide exclusively expressed by this genotype. Both genotypes were able to form free floating biofilm aggregates loosely attached to the walls of the culture wells.

In 1952, Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator-inhibitor birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with no severe requirement on the ratio of activator-inhibitor diffusion coefficients. To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules form a stochastic activator-inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity, can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.","authors":[{"name":"David Karig"},{"name":"K Michael Martini"},{"name":"Ting Lu"},{"name":"Nicholas A DeLateur"},{"name":"Nigel Goldenfeld"},{"name":"Ron Weiss"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Turing patterns"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"signaling molecules"},{"word":"stochastic gene expression"},{"word":"synthetic biology"}]},"article325":{"pmid":"29891547","title":"A Light-Regulated Type I Pilus Contributes to Acinetobacter baumannii Biofilm, Motility, and Virulence Functions.","abs":"Transcriptional analyses of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 showed that the expression of A1S_2091 was enhanced in cells cultured in darkness at 24°C through a process that depended on the BlsA photoreceptor.

They can also include authigenic mineral precipitates that may preserve signs of biological activity on Earth and possibly other planets. The abiogenic or biogenic origins of such precipitates can be difficult to discern, therefore a better understanding of mineral formation processes is critical for the accurate interpretation of biosignatures from hot springs. Little Hot Creek (LHC) is a hot spring complex located in the Long Valley Caldera, California, that contains mineral precipitates composed of a carbonate base (largely submerged) topped by amorphous silica (largely emergent). The precipitates occur in close association with microbial mats and biofilms. Geological, geochemical, and microbiological data are consistent with mineral formation via degassing and evaporation rather than direct microbial involvement. However, the microfabric of the silica portion is stromatolitic in nature (i.e., wavy and finely laminated), suggesting that abiogenic mineralization has the potential to preserve textural biosignatures. Although geochemical and petrographic evidence suggests the calcite base was precipitated via abiogenic processes, endolithic microbial communities modified the structure of the calcite crystals, producing a textural biosignature. Our results reveal that even when mineral precipitation is largely abiogenic, the potential to preserve biosignatures in hot spring settings is high. The features found in the LHC structures may provide insight into the biogenicity of ancient Earth and extraterrestrial rocks.","authors":[{"name":"Emily A Kraus"},{"name":"Scott R Beeler"},{"name":"R Agustin Mors"},{"name":"James G Floyd"},{"name":" "},{"name":"Blake W Stamps"},{"name":"Heather S Nunn"},{"name":"Bradley S Stevenson"},{"name":"Hope A Johnson"},{"name":"Russell S Shapiro"},{"name":"Sean J Loyd"},{"name":"John R Spear"},{"name":"Frank A Corsetti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biosignature"},{"word":"carbonate–silicate microbialite"},{"word":"hot spring biofilm"},{"word":"microbial mat"},{"word":"stromatolite"}]},"article338":{"pmid":"29887307","title":"Division of Labor during Biofilm Matrix Production.","abs":"Organisms as simple as bacteria can engage in complex collective actions, such as group motility and fruiting body formation. Some of these actions involve a division of labor, where phenotypically specialized clonal subpopulations or genetically distinct lineages cooperate with each other by performing complementary tasks. Here, we combine experimental and computational approaches to investigate potential benefits arising from division of labor during biofilm matrix production. We show that both phenotypic and genetic strategies for a division of labor can promote collective biofilm formation in the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In this species, biofilm matrix consists of two major components, exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and TasA. We observed that clonal groups of B. subtilis phenotypically segregate into three subpopulations composed of matrix non-producers, EPS producers, and generalists, which produce both EPSs and TasA. This incomplete phenotypic specialization was outperformed by a genetic division of labor, where two mutants, engineered as specialists, complemented each other by exchanging EPSs and TasA. The relative fitness of the two mutants displayed a negative frequency dependence both in vitro and on plant roots, with strain frequency reaching a stable equilibrium at 30% TasA producers, corresponding exactly to the population composition where group productivity is maximized. Using individual-based modeling, we show that asymmetries in strain ratio can arise due to differences in the relative benefits that matrix compounds generate for the collective and that genetic division of labor can be favored when it breaks metabolic constraints associated with the simultaneous production of two matrix components.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Dragoš"},{"name":"Heiko Kiesewalter"},{"name":"Marivic Martin"},{"name":"Chih-Yu Hsu"},{"name":"Raimo Hartmann"},{"name":"Tobias Wechsler"},{"name":"Carsten Eriksen"},{"name":"Susanne Brix"},{"name":"Knut Drescher"},{"name":"Nicola Stanley-Wall"},{"name":"Rolf Kümmerli"},{"name":"Ákos T Kovács"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"TasA"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"competition"},{"word":"cooperation"},{"word":"division of labor"},{"word":"pellicle"},{"word":"phenotypic heterogeneity"},{"word":"plant colonization"}]},"article339":{"pmid":"29886982","title":"Multiple stressors and benthic harmful algal blooms (BHABs): Potential effects of temperature rise and nutrient enrichment.","abs":"Blooms of Ostreopsis cf. ovata, causing health incidence and mass human intoxications in the Mediterranean, gained special attention over the past decades.

If these were bioinfluenced constructions, they could be priority targets in the search for early and extraterrestrial microbial life. However, there are questions over whether such chimneys are built on a geobiological framework or are solely abiotic geomorphological features produced by mixing of lake and spring waters. Here, we use correlative microscopy to show that microbes were living around Pleistocene Mono Lake carbonate chimneys during their growth. A plausible interpretation, in line with some recent works by others on other lacustrine carbonates, is that benthic cyanobacteria and their associated extracellular organic material (EOM) formed tubular biofilms around rising sublacustrine spring vent waters, binding calcium ions and trapping and binding detrital silicate sediment. Decay of these biofilms would locally have increased calcium and carbonate ion activity, inducing calcite precipitation on and around the biofilms. Early manganese carbonate mineralisation was directly associated with cell walls, potentially related to microbial activity though the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. Much of the calcite crystal growth was likely abiotic, and no strong evidence for either authigenic silicate growth or a clay mineral precursor framework was observed. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the biofilms provided initial sites for calcite nucleation and encouraged the primary organised crystal growth. We suggest that the nano-, micro- and macroscale fabrics of these Pleistocene Mono Lake chimneys were affected by the presence of centimetre-thick tubular and vertically stacked calcifying microbial mats. Such carbonate chimneys represent a promising macroscale target in the exploration for ancient or extraterrestrial life.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander Brasier"},{"name":"David Wacey"},{"name":"Mike Rogerson"},{"name":"Paul Guagliardo"},{"name":"Martin Saunders"},{"name":"Siri Kellner"},{"name":"Ramon Mercedes-Martin"},{"name":"Tim Prior"},{"name":"Colin Taylor"},{"name":"Anna Matthews"},{"name":"John Reijmer"}],"keywords":[]},"article356":{"pmid":"29885070","title":"Expression and regulation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa hibernation promoting factor.","abs":"Bacterial biofilms contain subpopulations of cells that are dormant and highly tolerant to antibiotics.

Besides, low concentration of VOCs and odorous pollutants can also be effectively removed using BTF systems. However, the VOCs and odorants removal performance by BTF may be limited by the hydrophobicity, toxicity, and low bioavailability of these pollutants. To solve these problems, this review summarizes the design, mechanism, and common analytical methods of recent BTF advances. In addition, the operating conditions, mass transfer, packing materials and microorganisms (which are the critical parameters in a BTF system) were evaluated and discussed in view of improving the removal performance of BTFs. Further research on these specific topics, together with the combination of BTF technology with other technologies, should improve the removal performance of BTFs.","authors":[{"name":"Hao Wu"},{"name":"Huayu Yan"},{"name":"Yue Quan"},{"name":"Huazhang Zhao"},{"name":"Nanzhe Jiang"},{"name":"Chengri Yin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Air pollution control"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biotrickling filter"},{"word":"Deodorization"},{"word":"Microbial analysis"},{"word":"VOCs"}]},"article361":{"pmid":"29883848","title":"Long-term operation of electro-biocatalytic reactor for carbon dioxide transformation into organic molecules.","abs":"Electro-biocatalytic reactor was operated using selectively enriched mixed culture biofilm for about 320 days with CO","authors":[{"name":"Sandipam Srikanth"},{"name":"Manoj Kumar"},{"name":"Dheer Singh"},{"name":"M P Singh"},{"name":"S K Puri"},{"name":"S S V Ramakumar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bio-electrochemical system (BES)"},{"word":"Butanol"},{"word":"Butyric acid"},{"word":"CO(2) capture and reduction"},{"word":"Microbial electrosynthesis (MES)"}]},"article362":{"pmid":"29883434","title":"Critical Assessment of Methods to Quantify Biofilm Growth and Evaluate Antibiofilm Activity of Host Defence Peptides.","abs":"Biofilms are multicellular communities of bacteria that can adhere to virtually any surface. Bacterial biofilms are clinically relevant, as they are responsible for up to two-thirds of hospital acquired infections and contribute to chronic infections. Troublingly, the bacteria within a biofilm are adaptively resistant to antibiotic treatment and it can take up to 1000 times more antibiotic to kill cells within a biofilm when compared to planktonic bacterial cells. Identifying and optimizing compounds that specifically target bacteria growing in biofilms is required to address this growing concern and the reported antibiofilm activity of natural and synthetic host defence peptides has garnered significant interest. However, a standardized assay to assess the activity of antibiofilm agents has not been established. In the present work, we describe two simple assays that can assess the inhibitory and eradication capacities of peptides towards biofilms that are formed by both Gram-positive and negative bacteria. These assays are suitable for high-throughput workflows in 96-well microplates and they use crystal violet staining to quantify adhered biofilm biomass as well as tetrazolium chloride dye to evaluate the metabolic activity of the biofilms. The effect of media composition on the readouts of these biofilm detection methods was assessed against two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1 and PA14), as well as a methicillin resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Our results demonstrate that media composition dramatically alters the staining patterns that were obtained with these dye-based methods, highlighting the importance of establishing appropriate biofilm growth conditions for each bacterial species to be evaluated. Confocal microscopy imaging of P. aeruginosa biofilms grown in flow cells revealed that this is likely due to altered biofilm architecture under specific growth conditions. The antibiofilm activity of several antibiotics and synthetic peptides were then evaluated under both inhibition and eradication conditions to illustrate the type of data that can be obtained using this experimental setup.","authors":[{"name":"Evan F Haney"},{"name":"Michael J Trimble"},{"name":"John T Cheng"},{"name":"Quentin Vallé"},{"name":"Robert E W Hancock"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm peptides"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"high-throughput assay"}]},"article363":{"pmid":"29883284","title":"Non-antibiotic antimicrobial interventions and antimicrobial stewardship in wound care.","abs":"Control of wound infection today relies largely on antibiotics, but the continual emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms threatens a return to the pre-antibiotic era when physicians used antiseptics to prevent and manage infection.

Evidence suggest that genetic factors can highly influence periodontitis risk, modulating disease elements such as the susceptibility to microbial colonization and the nature of subsequent host-microbe interaction. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with the occurrence of periodontitis, but the full range of genetic influence in periodontitis outcomes remains to be determined. In this context, this study comprises an analysis of possible correlation between periodontitis-related genetic variants with changes in the subgingival microbiological pattern performed in a Brazilian population (n = 167, comprising 76 chronic periodontitis patients and 91 healthy subjects). For the genetic characterization, 19 candidate SNPs were selected based on the top hits of previous large genome wide association studies (GWAS), while the subgingival microbiota was characterized for the presence and relative quantity of 40 bacterial species by DNA-DNA checkerboard. The case/control association test did not demonstrate a significant effect of the target SNPs with the disease phenotype. The polymorphism rs2521634 proved significantly associated with Tannerella. forsythia, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Prevotella nigrescens; rs10010758 and rs6667202 were associated with increased counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis; and rs10043775 proved significantly associated with decreased counts of Prevotella intermedia.

Hormesis can play a critical role in all these biological effects and mechanisms of effectiveness. The hormetic effects of balneotherapy can be related to non-specific factors such as heat—which induces the heat shock response, and therefore the synthesis and release of heat shock proteins—and also to specific biochemical components such as hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in sulfurous water and radon in radioactive water.

Skin and soft tissue infections have been observed to be caused by many coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms: Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus simulans. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus skin infections predominantly present as abscesses and paronychia. They are most common in elderly patients or those individuals who are immunosuppressed, and tend to be broadly susceptible to antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, albeit less common, coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms can result in skin and soft tissue infections, particularly in older and/or immunocompromised individuals. A review of the literature found that coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms are most commonly grown in cultures of abscesses and paronychia. Therefore, coagulase-negative staphylococcal organisms should not always be considered as contaminants or normal flora, but rather as causative pathogens.

This study investigated the efficacy of selenium for inhibiting and inactivating UPEC biofilms on urinary catheters. Urinary catheters were inoculated with UPEC and treated with 0 and 35 mM selenium at 37 °C for 5 days for the biofilm inhibition assay. In addition, catheters with preformed UPEC biofilms were treated with 0, 45, 60, and 85 mM selenium and incubated at 37 °C.

Additionally, the effect of selenium on exopolysacchride (EPS) production and expression of UPEC biofilm-associated genes was evaluated. Selenium at 35 mM concentration was effective in preventing UPEC biofilm formation on catheters compared to controls (p < 0.05). Further, this inhibitory effect was associated with a reduction in EPS production and UPEC gene expression. Moreover, at higher concentrations, selenium was effective in inactivating preformed UPEC biofilms on catheters as early as day 3 of incubation.

The main extracellular components of the biofilm were analyzed, and the results showed that the mutant yielded significantly less exopolysaccharide but more extracellular DNA and protein than the wild-type strain. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that CHU_2750 is important for cellulose degradation, cell motility, and biofilm formation of C. hutchinsonii by modulating transcription of certain related genes, and it is the first identified transcriptional regulator in these processes of C. hutchinsonii.

These microbes contribute to the development and function of physiologic and immunological features that are key to host health status. Not surprisingly, several chronic inflammatory diseases have been attributed to dysbiosis of microbiota composition or function, including chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). CRS is a heterogeneous disease characterized by inflammation of the sinonasal cavity and mucosal microbiota dysbiosis. Inflammatory phenotypes and bacterial community compositions vary considerably across individuals with CRS, complicating current studies that seek to address causality of a dysbiotic microbiome as a driver or initiator of persistent sinonasal inflammation. Murine models have provided some experimental evidence that alterations in local microbial communities and microbially-produced metabolites influence health status. In this perspective, we will discuss the clinical implications of distinct microbial compositions and community-level functions in CRS and how mucosal microbiota relate to the diverse inflammatory endotypes that are frequently observed. We will also describe specific microbial interactions that can deterministically shape the pattern of co-colonizers and the resulting metabolic products that drive or exacerbate host inflammation. These findings are discussed in the context of CRS-associated inflammation and in other chronic inflammatory diseases that share features observed in CRS.

The population groups at high risk of death from bacterial pneumonia are infants, elderly and immunosuppressed people. These groups are more vulnerable because they have immature or impaired immune systems, the efficacy of their response to vaccines is lower, and antibiotic treatment often does not take place until the inflammatory response triggered is already overwhelming. The immune response to bacterial lung infections involves dynamic interactions between several types of cells whose activation is driven by intracellular molecular networks. A feasible approach to the integration of knowledge and data linking tissue, cellular and intracellular events and the construction of hypotheses in this area is the use of mathematical modeling. For this paper, we used a multi-level computational model to analyse the role of cellular and molecular interactions during the first 10 h after alveolar invasion of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. By multi-level we mean that we simulated the interplay between different temporal and spatial scales in a single computational model. In this instance, we included the intracellular scale of processes driving lung epithelial cell activation together with the scale of cell-to-cell interactions at the alveolar tissue. In our analysis, we combined systematic model simulations with logistic regression analysis and decision trees to find genotypic-phenotypic signatures that explain differences in bacteria strain infectivity. According to our simulations, pneumococci benefit from a high dwelling probability and a high proliferation rate during the first stages of infection. In addition to this, the model predicts that during the very early phases of infection the bacterial capsule could be an impediment to the establishment of the alveolar infection because it impairs bacterial colonization.","authors":[{"name":"Guido Santos"},{"name":"Xin Lai"},{"name":"Martin Eberhardt"},{"name":"Julio Vera"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus pneumoniae"},{"word":"alveolar infection"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"mathematical modeling"},{"word":"pneumonia"}]},"article415":{"pmid":"29868500","title":"Anti-quorum Sensing Activities of Selected Coral Symbiotic Bacterial Extracts From the South China Sea.","abs":"The worldwide increase in antibiotic-resistant pathogens means that identification of alternative antibacterial drug targets and the subsequent development of new treatment strategies are urgently required. One such new target is the quorum sensing (QS) system. Coral microbial consortia harbor an enormous diversity of microbes, and are thus rich sources for isolating novel bioactive and pharmacologically valuable natural products. However, to date, the versatility of their bioactive compounds has not been broadly explored. In this study, about two hundred bacterial colonies were isolated from a coral species (Pocillopora damicornis) and screened for their ability to inhibit QS using the bioreporter strain Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472. Approximately 15% (30 isolates) exhibited anti-QS activity, against the indicator strain. Among them, a typical Gram-positive bacterium, D11 (Staphylococcus hominis) was identified and its anti-QS activity was investigated. Confocal microscopy observations showed that the bacterial extract inhibited the biofilm formation of clinical isolates of wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 in a dose-dependent pattern. Chromatographic separation led to the isolation of a potent QS inhibitor that was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as DL-homocysteine thiolactone. Gene expression analyses using RT-PCR showed that strain D11 led to a significant down-regulation of QS regulatory genes (lasI, lasR, rhlI, and rhlR), as well as a virulence-related gene (lasB). From the chemical structure, the target compound (DL-homocysteine thiolactone) is an analog of the acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), and we presume that DL-homocysteine thiolactone outcompetes AHL in occupying the receptor and thereby inhibiting QS. Whole-genome sequence analysis of S. hominis D11 revealed the presence of predicted genes involved in the biosynthesis of homocysteine thiolactone. This study indicates that coral microbes are a resource bank for developing QS inhibitors and they will facilitate the discovery of new biotechnologically relevant compounds that could be used instead of traditional antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Ping Ma"},{"name":"Yu Song"},{"name":"Zhong-Hua Cai"},{"name":"Zhi-Jun Lin"},{"name":"Guang-Hui Lin"},{"name":"Yan Wang"},{"name":"Jin Zhou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"HPLC-MS-NMR"},{"word":"S. hominis"},{"word":"anti-quorum sensing"},{"word":"coral microbes"},{"word":"marine drug"}]},"article416":{"pmid":"29868495","title":"In-Group Communication in Marine Vibrio: A Review of N-Acyl Homoserine Lactones-Driven Quorum Sensing.","abs":"N-Acyl Homoserine Lactones (N-AHLs) are an important group of small quorum-sensing molecules generated and released into the surroundings by Gram-negative bacteria.

Interactions among the Mfa proteins and the polymerization mechanism for Mfa1 are poorly understood. Here we show that Mfa3 can bind to Mfa1, 2, 4, and 5 in vitro, and may function as an adaptor protein interlinking other fimbrial subunits. Polymerization of Mfa1 is independent of Mfa3-5 and requires proteolytic processing mediated by the RgpA/B arginine gingipains of P. gingivalis. Both the N- and C- terminal regions of Mfa1 are necessary for polymerization; however, potential β-strand disrupting amino acid substitutions in these regions do not impair Mfa1 polymerization. In contrast, substitution of hydrophobic amino acids with charged residues in either the N- or C- terminal domains yielded Mfa1 proteins that failed to polymerize. Collectively, these results indicate that Mfa3 serves as an adaptor protein between Mfa1 and other accessory fimbrial proteins. Mfa1 fimbrial polymerization is dependent on hydrophobicity in both the N- and C-terminal regions, indicative of an assembly mechanism involving the terminal regions forming a hydrophobic binding interface between Mfa1 subunits.","authors":[{"name":"Jae Y Lee"},{"name":"Daniel P Miller"},{"name":"Leng Wu"},{"name":"Carolyn R Casella"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Hasegawa"},{"name":"Richard J Lamont"}],"keywords":[{"word":"accessory fimbrial proteins"},{"word":"donor strand exchange"},{"word":"hydrophobicity"},{"word":"periodontal disease"},{"word":"polymerization"}]},"article418":{"pmid":"29868242","title":"Comparison of antibacterial activity of alexidine alone or as a final irrigant with sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine.","abs":"To compare the antibacterial activity of alexidine (ALX) alone or as a final irrigant in combination with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), with the most common canal irrigants, NaOCl and chlorhexidine (CHX).","authors":[{"name":"Thaís M da Silva"},{"name":"Flávio Rf Alves"},{"name":"Márcia Ts Lutterbach"},{"name":"Maurício M Paiva"},{"name":"Dennis de Carvalho Ferreira"}],"keywords":[]},"article419":{"pmid":"29868163","title":"Antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens DD2 against oral pathogens.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Dana Jeong"},{"name":"Dong-Hyeon Kim"},{"name":"Kwang-Young Song"},{"name":"Kun-Ho Seo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Kefir"},{"word":"Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"Streptococcus sobrinus"},{"word":"artificial oral model system"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"oral biofilm"},{"word":"oral probiotics"}]},"article420":{"pmid":"29867902","title":"Dual Role of Mechanisms Involved in Resistance to Predation by Protozoa and Virulence to Humans.","abs":"Most opportunistic pathogens transit in the environment between hosts and the environment plays a significant role in the evolution of protective traits.

In response to protozoan predation, bacteria have evolved various defensive mechanisms which may also function as virulence factors. In this review, we summarize the dual role of factors involved in both grazing resistance and human pathogenesis, and compare the traits using model intracellular and extracellular pathogens. Intracellular pathogens rely on active invasion, blocking of the phagosome and lysosome fusion and resistance to phagocytic digestion to successfully invade host cells.

Control of SRB-mediated souring in oil-containing bioreactors was inhibited by 4 mM (340 ppm) of sodium nitrate, but required only 0.05 mM (15 ppm) of SNP. Interestingly, nitrate and SNP were found to be highly synergistic with 0.003 mM (1 ppm) of SNP and 1 mM (85 ppm) of sodium nitrate being sufficient in inhibiting souring.

SNP analysis versus available genomes of wine and flor strains revealed 2,270 genetic variants in 1,337 loci specific to flor strains. Gene ontology analysis in combination with gene content evaluation revealed a complex landscape of possibly adaptive genetic changes in flor yeast, related to genes associated with cell morphology, mitotic cell cycle, ion homeostasis, DNA repair, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cell wall biogenesis.

However, the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs used for CD treatment on AIEC virulence have not yet been investigated. In this report, we show that exposure of AIEC LF82 strain to amino-6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) riboside, one of the most widely used anti-inflammatory drugs in CD, impairs its ability to adhere to, and consequently to invade, human epithelial cells. Notably, phagocytosis of LF82 treated with 6-MP by human macrophages is also reduced, suggesting that 6-MP affects AIEC cell surface determinants involved both in interaction with epithelial cells and in uptake by macrophages. Since a main target of 6-MP in bacterial cells is the inhibition of the important signal molecule c-di-GMP, we also tested whether perturbations in cAMP, another major signaling pathway in E. coli, might have similar effects on interactions with human cells. To this aim, we grew LF82 in the presence of glucose, which leads to inhibition of cAMP synthesis. Growth in glucose-supplemented medium resulted in a reduction in AIEC adhesion to epithelial cells and uptake by macrophages. Consistent with these results, both 6-MP and glucose can affect expression of cell adhesion-related genes, such as the csg genes, encoding thin aggregative fimbriae (curli). In addition, glucose strongly inhibits expression of the fim operon, encoding type 1 pili, a known AIEC determinant for adhesion to human cells. To further investigate whether 6-MP can indeed inhibit c-di-GMP signaling in AIEC, we performed biofilm and motility assays and determination of extracellular polysaccharides. 6-MP clearly affected biofilm formation and cellulose production, but also, unexpectedly, reduced cell motility, itself an important virulence factor for AIEC. Our results provide strong evidence that 6-MP can affect AIEC-host cell interaction by acting on the bacterial cell, thus strengthening the hypothesis that mercaptopurines might promote CD remission also by affecting gut microbiota composition and/or physiology, and suggesting that novel drugs targeting bacterial virulence and signaling might be effective in preventing chronic inflammation in CD.","authors":[{"name":"Federica Migliore"},{"name":"Raffaella Macchi"},{"name":"Paolo Landini"},{"name":"Moira Paroni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"6-mercaptopurines"},{"word":"Crohn’s disease"},{"word":"adherent-invasive E. coli"},{"word":"azathioprine"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"dysbiosis"},{"word":"virulence factors"}]},"article426":{"pmid":"29867851","title":"Dynamics of Pellet Fragmentation and Aggregation in Liquid-Grown Cultures of Streptomyces lividans.","abs":"Streptomycetes are extensively used for the production of valuable products, including various antibiotics and industrial enzymes.

While the process of pellet formation is well characterized, little is known about their disintegration. Here, we use a qualitative and quantitative approach to show that pellet fragmentation in Streptomyces lividans is initiated when cultures enter the stationary phase, which coincides with a remarkable change in pellet architecture. Unlike young pellets, aging pellets have a less dense appearance and are characterized by the appearance of filaments protruding from their outer edges. These morphological changes are accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of mycelial fragments in the culture broth. In the presence of fresh nutrients, these fragments are able to aggregate with other small fragments, but not with disintegrating pellets, to form new mycelial particles.

Delivering antibiotics to the sites of these infections is a major hurdle of therapy because pulmonary NTM infections can persist in biofilms or as intracellular infections within macrophages. Inhaled treatments can improve antibiotic delivery into the lungs, but efficient nebulization delivery, distribution throughout the lungs, and penetration into biofilms and macrophages are considerable challenges for this approach. Therefore, we developed amikacin liposome inhalation suspension (ALIS) to overcome these challenges. Nebulization of ALIS has been shown to provide particles within the respirable size range that distribute to both central and peripheral lung compartments in humans. The in vitro and in vivo efficacy of ALIS against NTM has been demonstrated previously. The key mechanistic questions are whether ALIS penetrates NTM biofilms and enhances amikacin uptake into macrophages. We found that ALIS effectively penetrated throughout NTM biofilms and concentration-dependently reduced the number of viable mycobacteria. Additionally, we found that ALIS improved amikacin uptake by ∼4-fold into cultured macrophages compared with free amikacin. In rats, inhaled ALIS increased amikacin concentrations in pulmonary macrophages by 5- to 8-fold at 2, 6, and 24 h post-dose and retained more amikacin at 24 h in airways and lung tissue relative to inhaled free amikacin. Compared to intravenous free amikacin, a standard-of-care therapy for refractory and severe NTM lung disease, ALIS increased the mean area under the concentration-time curve in lung tissue, airways, and macrophages by 42-, 69-, and 274-fold. These data demonstrate that ALIS effectively penetrates NTM biofilms, enhances amikacin uptake into macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo, and retains amikacin within airways and lung tissue. An ongoing Phase III trial, adding ALIS to guideline based therapy, met its primary endpoint of culture conversion by month 6. ALIS represents a promising new treatment approach for patients with refractory NTM lung disease.","authors":[{"name":"Jimin Zhang"},{"name":"Franziska Leifer"},{"name":"Sasha Rose"},{"name":"Dung Yu Chun"},{"name":"Jill Thaisz"},{"name":"Tracey Herr"},{"name":"Mary Nashed"},{"name":"Jayanthi Joseph"},{"name":"Walter R Perkins"},{"name":"Keith DiPetrillo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ALIS"},{"word":"Arikace"},{"word":"Arikayce"},{"word":"LAI"},{"word":"amikacin"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"macrophage uptake"},{"word":"non-tuberculous mycobacteria"}]},"article431":{"pmid":"29867813","title":"The Impact of Media, Phylogenetic Classification, and E. coli Pathotypes on Biofilm Formation in Extraintestinal and Commensal E. coli From Humans and Animals.","abs":"Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) include avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), neonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC), and uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and are responsible for significant animal and human morbidity and mortality. This study sought to investigate if biofilm formation by ExPEC likely contributes to these losses since biofilms are associated with recurrent urinary tract infections, antibiotic resistance, and bacterial exchange of genetic material. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine differences in biofilm formation among a collection of ExPEC and to ascertain if there is a relationship between their ability to produce biofilms and their assignment to phylogenetic groups in three media types - M63, diluted TSB, and BHI. Our results suggest that ExPEC produce relatively different levels of biofilm formation in the media tested as APEC (70.4%, p = 0.0064) and NMEC (84.4%, p = 0.0093) isolates were poor biofilm formers in minimal medium M63 while UPEC isolates produced significantly higher ODs under nutrient-limited conditions with 25% of strains producing strong biofilms in diluted TSB (p = 0.0204). Additionally, E. coli phylogenetic assignment using Clermont's original and revised typing scheme demonstrated significant differences among the phylogenetic groups in the different media. When the original phylogenetic group isolates previously typed as group D were phylogenetically typed under the revised scheme and examined, they showed substantial variation in their ability to form biofilms, which may explain the significant values of revised phylogenetic groups E and F in M63 (p = 0.0291, p = 0.0024).

The morphological and architectural features of these dual-species biofilms formed on titanium were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Mixed biofilms formed on titanium discs showed a high level of resistance to combination therapy with antifungal and antibacterial drugs. This model can serve as a platform for further analyses of complex fungal/bacterial biofilms and can also be applied to screening of new drug candidates against mixed-species biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Montelongo-Jauregui"},{"name":"Anand Srinivasan"},{"name":"Anand K Ramasubramanian"},{"name":"Jose L Lopez-Ribot"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Streptococcus gordonii"},{"word":"mixed biofilms"},{"word":"synthetic saliva"},{"word":"titanium alloy"}]},"article434":{"pmid":"29866877","title":"Pharmacodynamic and Immunomodulatory Effects of Micafungin on Host Responses against Biofilms of Candida parapsilosis in Comparison to Those of Candida albicans.","abs":"Micafungin (MFG) demonstrates potent activity against biofilms of Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis, the most frequent opportunistic fungal pathogens. Little is known about its immunopharmacologic effect on antibiofilm activity of phagocytic cells following exposure to Candida biofilms. In this study, we investigated the effects of MFG on human neutrophil-mediated damage of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis biofilms by XTT [2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] and the potential mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory MFG activities on cultured monocyte-derived THP-1 cells in response to these biofilms by reverse transcription-PCR and sandwich and multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Preexposure of C. albicans to subinhibitory MFG concentrations significantly enhanced neutrophil-mediated biofilm damage, an effect that appears to be species specific since a comparable effect was not observed with drug-pretreated C. parapsilosis biofilms. Human THP-1 cells responded to both Candida biofilms through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 upregulation, modest TLR6 involvement, and enhanced NLRP3 activation, whereas the signal was relayed to the nucleus via NF-κB p65 activation. MFG caused 2- to 3-fold lower TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA levels than those caused by either organism. C. albicans biofilms induced a robust proinflammatory response, whereas C. parapsilosis biofilms either alone or in the presence of MFG caused increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production, but small amounts of IL-8, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In conclusion, MFG may condition THP-1 cells toward an inflammatory response through TLR2/TLR4 recruitment. Inflammatory signals observed with C. albicans biofilms are considerably reduced upon exposure of THP-1 cells to C. parapsilosis biofilms, possibly enhancing fungal survival and increasing biofilm pathogenicity.","authors":[{"name":"Maria Simitsopoulou"},{"name":"Katerina Chlichlia"},{"name":"Daniela Kyrpitzi"},{"name":"Thomas J Walsh"},{"name":"Emmanuel Roilides"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida biofilms"},{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"immunomodulation"},{"word":"micafungin"}]},"article435":{"pmid":"29866870","title":"In Vitro and In Vivo Activity of a Novel Catheter Lock Solution against Bacterial and Fungal Biofilms.","abs":"Central-line-associated bloodstream infections are increasingly recognized to be associated with intraluminal microbial biofilms, and effective measures for the prevention and treatment of bloodstream infections remain lacking.

Biofilms were formed by bacterial (seven different species, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE]) or fungal (Candida albicans) species on catheter materials. Biofilm formation was evaluated by quantitative culture (CFU) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Treatment with ACL inhibited the growth of adhesion-phase biofilms in vitro after 60 min (VRE) or 15 min (all others), while mature biofilms were completely inhibited after exposure for 2 or 4 h, compared to control. Similar results were observed for drug-resistant bacteria. Compared to the heparinized saline controls, ACL lock therapy significantly reduced the catheter bacterial (3.49 ± 0.75 versus 0.03 ± 0.06 log CFU/catheter; P = 0.016) and fungal (2.48 ± 1.60 versus 0.55 ± 1.19 log CFU/catheter segment; P = 0.013) burdens in the catheterized rabbit model.

Of these, the type 1 secretion system (T1SS) is known to secrete an array of biologically diverse proteins-from small, <10-kDa bacteriocins to gigantic adhesins with a mass >1 MDa. For the last several decades, T1SSs have been characterized as a one-step translocation strategy whereby the secreted substrate is transported directly into the extracellular environment from the cytoplasm with no periplasmic intermediate. Recent phylogenetic, biochemical, and genetic evidences point to a distinct subgroup of T1SS machinery linked with a bacterial transglutaminase-like cysteine proteinase (BTLCP), which uses a two-step secretion mechanism. BTLCP-linked T1SSs transport a class of repeats-in-toxin (RTX) adhesins that are critical for biofilm formation. The prototype of this RTX adhesin group, LapA of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, uses a novel N-terminal retention module to anchor the adhesin at the cell surface as a secretion intermediate threaded through the outer membrane-localized TolC-like protein LapE. This secretion intermediate is posttranslationally cleaved by the BTLCP family LapG protein to release LapA from its cognate T1SS pore. Thus, the secretion of LapA and related RTX adhesins into the extracellular environment appears to be a T1SS-mediated two-step process that involves a periplasmic intermediate. In this review, we contrast the T1SS machinery and substrates of the BLTCP-linked two-step secretion process with those of the classical one-step T1SS to better understand the newly recognized and expanded role of this secretion machinery.","authors":[{"name":"T Jarrod Smith"},{"name":"Holger Sondermann"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"}],"keywords":[{"word":"LapA"},{"word":"T1SS"},{"word":"adhesin"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"retention module"}]},"article437":{"pmid":"29866805","title":"RsmV, a Small Noncoding Regulatory RNA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa That Sequesters RsmA and RsmF from Target mRNAs.","abs":"The Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has distinct genetic programs that favor either acute or chronic virulence gene expression. Acute virulence is associated with twitching and swimming motility, expression of a type III secretion system (T3SS), and the absence of alginate, Psl, or Pel polysaccharide production. Traits associated with chronic infection include growth as a biofilm, reduced motility, and expression of a type VI secretion system (T6SS). The Rsm posttranscriptional regulatory system plays important roles in the inverse control of phenotypes associated with acute and chronic virulence. RsmA and RsmF are RNA-binding proteins that interact with target mRNAs to control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Previous work found that RsmA activity is controlled by at least three small, noncoding regulatory RNAs (RsmW, RsmY, and RsmZ). In this study, we took an in silico approach to identify additional small RNAs (sRNAs) that might function in the sequestration of RsmA and/or RsmF (RsmA/RsmF) and identified RsmV, a 192-nucleotide (nt) transcript with four predicted RsmA/RsmF consensus binding sites. RsmV is capable of sequestering RsmA and RsmF in vivo to activate translation of tssA1, a component of the T6SS, and to inhibit T3SS gene expression. Each of the predicted RsmA/RsmF consensus binding sites contributes to RsmV activity. Electrophoretic mobility shifts assays show that RsmF binds RsmV with >10-fold higher affinity than RsmY and RsmZ. Gene expression studies revealed that the temporal expression pattern of RsmV differs from those of RsmW, RsmY, and RsmZ.
