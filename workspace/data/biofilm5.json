Indeed, some drinking water Betaproteobacteria with intrinsic and sometimes acquired antibiotic resistance, harbouring virulence factors and often found in biofilm structures, can persist after water disinfection and reach the consumer. This literature review summarises and discusses the current knowledge about the occurrence and implications of Betaproteobacteria in drinking water. Although the sparse knowledge on the ecology and physiology of Betaproteobacteria thriving in tap or bottled natural mineral/spring drinking water (DW) is an evidence of this review, it is demonstrated that DW holds a high diversity of Betaproteobacteria, whose presence may not be innocuous. Frequently belonging to genera also found in humans, DW Betaproteobacteria are ubiquitous in different habitats, have the potential to resist antibiotics either due to intrinsic or acquired mechanisms, and hold different virulence factors. The combination of these factors places DW Betaproteobacteria in the list of candidates of emerging opportunistic pathogens. Improved bacterial identification of clinical isolates associated with opportunistic infections and additional genomic and physiological studies may contribute to elucidate the potential impact of these bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Pompeyo Ferro"},{"name":"Ivone Vaz-Moreira"},{"name":"Célia M Manaia"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Microbiological hazard"},{"word":"autochthonous bacteria"},{"word":"intrinsic antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"virulence factors"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"31686540","title":"Enantiomeric synthesis of natural alkylglycerols and their antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.","abs":"Alkylglycerols (AKGs) are bioactive natural compounds that vary by alkyl chain length and degree of unsaturation, and their absolute configuration is 2S.

Here we elucidate the molecular mechanism underpinning recognition of staphylococcal peptidoglycan by the lysostaphin SH3b domain.

Mutations in the zinc uptake systems of S. sanguinis SK36 reduced growth of these strains by 1 to 3 logs compared to that of wild-type S. sanguinis SK36 when grown in coculture with P. aeruginosa PAO1, and exogenous zinc (0.1 to 10 μM) rescued the coculture defect of zinc uptake mutants of S. sanguinis SK36.

An analysis of 118 CF sputum samples revealed that total zinc levels varied from ∼5 to 145 μM.

Furthermore, the employment of such delicate devices underwater is unavoidably subjected to the adhesion of microorganisms and formation of biofilms that limit their reliability. Thus, the demand of waterproofing solutions has increased in recent years, focusing on more conformal, flexible and insulating coatings. This work introduces an evaluation of different polymeric coatings (parylene-C, poly-dimethyl siloxane (PDMS), poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA), and poly-(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)) aimed at increasing the reliability of piezoelectric flexible microdevices used for sensing water motions or for scavenging wave energy. Absorption and corrosion tests showed that Parylene-C, while susceptible to micro-cracking during prolonged oscillating cycles, exhibits the best anti-corrosive behavior. Parylene-C was then treated with oxygen plasma and UV/ozone for modifying the surface morphology in order to evaluate the biofilm formation with different surface conditions. A preliminary characterization through a laser Doppler vibrometer allowed us to detect a reduction in the biofilm mass surface density after 35 days of exposure to seawater.","authors":[{"name":"Massimo Mariello"},{"name":"Francesco Guido"},{"name":"Vincenzo Mariano Mastronardi"},{"name":"Roberto Giannuzzi"},{"name":"Luciana Algieri"},{"name":"Antonio Qualteri"},{"name":"Alfonso Maffezzoli"},{"name":"Massimo De Vittorio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"aqueous environments"},{"word":"coating"},{"word":"flexible micro-devices"},{"word":"piezoelectric transducers"},{"word":"reliability"},{"word":"seawater"},{"word":"waterproof"}]},"article24":{"pmid":"31683431","title":"Anaerobically digested blackwater treatment by simultaneous denitrification and anammox processes: Feeding loading affects reactor performance and microbial community succession.","abs":"Source diverted blackwater collected from toilets can be anaerobically digested to recover energy.

Importantly, detecting the pathogen in endangered native crayfish populations before a disease outbreak would provide a starting point in the development of effective control measures. However, current A. astaci-detection protocols either rely on degradation-prone eDNA isolated from large volumes of water or, if focused on individual animals, include killing the crayfish.

The Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can initially attach to surfaces via its single polar flagellum. Although many bacteria quickly detach, some become irreversibly attached and express surface-associated structures, such as Type IV pili, and behaviors, including twitching motility and biofilm initiation. P. aeruginosa that lack the GTPase FlhF assemble a randomly placed flagellum that is motile; however, we observed that these mutant bacteria show defects in biofilm formation comparable to those seen for non-motile, aflagellate bacteria. This phenotype was associated with altered behavior of ΔflhF bacteria immediately following surface-attachment. Forward and reverse genetic screens led to the discovery that FlhF interacts with FimV to control flagellar rotation at a surface, and implicated cAMP signaling in this pathway. Although cAMP controls many transcriptional programs in P. aeruginosa, known targets of this second messenger were not required to modulate flagellar rotation in surface-attached bacteria. Instead, alterations in switching behavior of the motor appeared to result from direct or indirect effects of cAMP on switch complex proteins and/or the stators associated with them.","authors":[{"name":"Maren Schniederberend"},{"name":"Jessica F Williams"},{"name":"Emilee Shine"},{"name":"Cong Shen"},{"name":"Ruchi Jain"},{"name":"Thierry Emonet"},{"name":"Barbara I Kazmierczak"}],"keywords":[]},"article28":{"pmid":"31682631","title":"Nodosilinea signiensis sp. nov.

Nitric oxide (NO) is known to mediate biofilm formation in many bacteria via ligation to H-NOX (heme-NO/oxygen binding) domains. Most NO-responsive bacteria, however, lack H-NOX domain-containing proteins. We have identified another NO-sensing protein (NosP), which is predicted to be involved in two-component signaling and biofilm regulation in many species. Here, we demonstrate that NosP participates in the previously described H-NOX/NO-responsive multicomponent c-di-GMP signaling network in Shewanella oneidensis. Strains lacking either nosP or its co-cistronic kinase nahK (previously hnoS) produce immature biofilms, while hnoX and hnoK (kinase responsive to NO/H-NOX) mutants result in wild-type biofilm architecture. We demonstrate that NosP regulates the autophosphorylation activity of NahK as well as HnoK. HnoK and NahK have been shown to regulate three response regulators (HnoB, HnoC, and HnoD) that together comprise a NO-responsive multicomponent c-di-GMP signaling network. Here, we propose that NosP/NahK adds regulation on top of H-NOX/HnoK to modulate this c-di-GMP signaling network, and ultimately biofilm formation, by governing the flux of phosphate through both HnoK and NahK. In addition, it appears that NosP and H-NOX act to counter each other in a push-pull mechanism; NosP/NahK promotes biofilm formation through inhibition of H-NOX/HnoK signaling, which itself reduces the extent of biofilm formation. Addition of NO results in a reduction of c-di-GMP and biofilm formation, primarily through disinhibition of HnoK activity.","authors":[{"name":"Lisa-Marie Nisbett"},{"name":"Lucas Binnenkade"},{"name":"Bezalel Bacon"},{"name":"Sajjad Hossain"},{"name":"Nicholas J Kotloski"},{"name":"Evan D Brutinel"},{"name":"Raimo Hartmann"},{"name":"Knut Drescher"},{"name":"Dhruv P Arora"},{"name":"Sandhya Muralidharan"},{"name":"Kai M Thormann"},{"name":"Jeffrey A Gralnick"},{"name":"Elizabeth M Boon"}],"keywords":[]},"article30":{"pmid":"31682251","title":"Cephalosporin nitric oxide-donor prodrug DEA-C3D disperses biofilms formed by clinical cystic fibrosis isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"The cephalosporin nitric oxide (NO)-donor prodrug DEA-C3D ('DiEthylAmin-Cephalosporin-3'-Diazeniumdiolate') has been shown to initiate the dispersal of biofilms formed by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa laboratory strain PAO1.

Biofilm formation is one of the prime virulence factors of S. epidermidis that supports its colonization on biotic and abiotic surfaces. The global dissemination of three lineages of S. epidermidis superbugs highlights its clinical significance and the imperative need to combat its pathogenicity. Thus, in the current study, the antibiofilm activity of umbelliferone (UMB), a natural product of the coumarin family, was assessed against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE). UMB exhibited significant antibiofilm activity (83%) at 500 μg/ml concentration without growth alteration. Microscopic analysis corroborated the antibiofilm potential of UMB and unveiled its potential to impair intercellular adhesion, which was reflected in auto-aggregation and solid phase adherence assays. Furthermore, real time PCR analysis revealed the reduced expression of adhesion encoding genes (icaD, atlE, aap, bhp, ebh, sdrG, and sdrF). Down regulation of agrA and reduced production of secreted hydrolases upon UMB treatment were speculated to hinder invasive lifestyle of MRSE. Additionally, UMB hindered slime synthesis and biofilm matrix components, which were believed to augment antibiotic susceptibility. In vivo assays using Caenorhabditis elegans divulged the non-toxic nature of UMB and validated the antibiofilm, antivirulence, and antiadherence properties of UMB observed in in vitro assays. Thus, UMB impairs MRSE biofilm by turning down the initial attachment and intercellular adhesion. Altogether, the obtained results suggest the potent antibiofilm activity of UMB and the feasibility of using it in clinical settings for combating S. epidermidis infections.","authors":[{"name":"Thirukannamangai Krishnan Swetha"},{"name":"Murugesan Pooranachithra"},{"name":"Ganapathy Ashwinkumar Subramenium"},{"name":"Velayutham Divya"},{"name":"Krishnaswamy Balamurugan"},{"name":"Shunmugiah Karutha Pandian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance (AMR)"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"initial attachment"},{"word":"intercellular adhesion"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE)"},{"word":"umbelliferone"}]},"article33":{"pmid":"31681632","title":"The Transcriptional Regulator Lrp Contributes to Toxin Expression, Sporulation, and Swimming Motility in Clostridium difficile.","abs":"Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium, and major cause of nosocomial diarrhea.

This study revealed that disruption of the lone lrp homolog in C. difficile decelerated growth under nutrient-limiting conditions, increased TcdA and TcdB production. Lrp was also found to negatively regulate sporulation while positively regulate swimming motility in strain R20291, but not in strain 630.

Nasopharyngeal biofilms are structured with a matrix that includes extracellular DNA (eDNA), which is sourced from the same pneumococci and other bacteria. This eDNA also allows pneumococci to acquire new traits, including antibiotic resistance genes. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of lactoferrin (LF), at physiological concentrations found in secretions with bactericidal activity [i.e., colostrum (100 μM), tears (25 μM)], in eradicating pneumococcal biofilms from human respiratory cells. The efficacy of synthetic LF-derived peptides was also assessed. We first demonstrated that LF inhibited colonization of S. pneumoniae on human respiratory cells without affecting the viability of planktonic bacteria. LF-derived peptides were, however, bactericidal for planktonic pneumococci but they did not affect viability of pre-formed biofilms. In contrast, LF (40 and 80 μM) eradicated pneumococcal biofilms that had been pre-formed on abiotic surfaces (i.e., polystyrene) and on human pharyngeal cells, as investigated by viable counts and confocal microscopy. LF also eradicated biofilms formed by S. pneumoniae strains with resistance to multiple antibiotics. We investigated whether treatment with LF would affect the biofilm structure by analyzing eDNA. Surprisingly, in pneumococcal biofilms treated with LF, the eDNA was absent in comparison to the untreated control (∼10 μg/ml) or those treated with LF-derived peptides. EMSA assays showed that LF binds S. pneumoniae DNA and a time-course study of DNA decay demonstrated that the DNA is degraded when bound by LF. This LF-associated DNase activity inhibited acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes in both in vitro transformation assays and in a life-like bioreactor system. In conclusion, we demonstrated that LF eradicates pneumococcal-colonizing biofilms at a concentration safe for humans and identified a LF-associated DNAse activity that inhibited the acquisition of resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Uriel A Angulo-Zamudio"},{"name":"Jorge E Vidal"},{"name":"Kamran Nazmi"},{"name":"Jan G M Bolscher"},{"name":"Claudia Leon-Sicairos"},{"name":"Brenda S Antezana"},{"name":"Adrián Canizalez-Roman"},{"name":"Nidia León-Sicairos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNAse activity"},{"word":"disaggregates"},{"word":"lactoferrin"},{"word":"pneumococcal biofilms"},{"word":"resistance acquisition"}]},"article39":{"pmid":"31681200","title":"Gymnemic Acids Inhibit Adhesive Nanofibrillar Mediated Streptococcus gordonii-Candida albicans Mono-Species and Dual-Species Biofilms.","abs":"Dental caries and periodontitis are the most common oral disease of all age groups, affecting billions of people worldwide. These oral diseases are mostly associated with microbial biofilms in the oral cavity. Streptococcus gordonii, an early tooth colonizing bacterium and Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogenic fungus, are the two abundant oral microbes that form mixed biofilms with augmented virulence, affecting oral health negatively. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the pathogen interactions and identifying non-toxic compounds that block the growth of biofilms are important steps in the development of effective therapeutic approaches. In this in vitro study we report the inhibition of mono-species or dual-species biofilms of S. gordonii and C. albicans, and decreased levels of biofilm extracellular DNA (eDNA), when biofilms were grown in the presence of gymnemic acids (GAs), a non-toxic small molecule inhibitor of fungal hyphae. Scanning electron microscopic images of biofilms on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) surfaces revealed attachment of S. gordonii cells to C. albicans hyphae and to sHA surfaces via nanofibrils only in the untreated control, but not in the GAs-treated biofilms. Interestingly, C. albicans produced fibrillar adhesive structures from hyphae when grown with S. gordonii as a mixed biofilm; addition of GAs abrogated the nanofibrils and reduced the growth of both hyphae and the biofilm. To our knowledge, this is the first report that C. albicans produces adhesive fibrils from hyphae in response to S. gordonii mixed biofilm growth. Semi-quantitative PCR of selected genes related to biofilms from both microbes showed differential expression in control vs. treated biofilms. Further, GAs inhibited the activity of recombinant S. gordonii glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

Moreover, fungal biofilms impose an additional challenge, leading to multidrug resistance. This fact, along with the contamination of medical devices and the limited number of effective antifungal agents available on the market, demonstrates the importance of finding novel drug candidates targeting pathogenic fungal cells and biofilms. In this context, an alternative strategy is the use of antifungal peptides (AFPs) against fungal biofilms. AFPs are considered a group of bioactive molecules with broad-spectrum activities and multiple mechanisms of action that have been widely used as template molecules for drug design strategies aiming at greater specificity and biological efficacy. Among the AFP classes most studied in the context of fungal biofilms, defensins, cathelicidins and histatins have been described. AFPs can also act by preventing the formation of fungal biofilms and eradicating preformed biofilms through mechanisms associated with cell wall perturbation, inhibition of planktonic fungal cells' adhesion onto surfaces, gene regulation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, considering the critical scenario imposed by fungal biofilms and associated infections and the application of AFPs as a possible treatment, this review will focus on the most effective AFPs described to date, with a core focus on antibiofilm peptides, as well as their efficacy in vivo, application on surfaces and proposed mechanisms of action.","authors":[{"name":"Karen G N Oshiro"},{"name":"Gisele Rodrigues"},{"name":"Bruna Estéfani D Monges"},{"name":"Marlon Henrique Cardoso"},{"name":"Octávio Luiz Franco"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antifungal peptides"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"fungal biofilms"},{"word":"fungal infections"},{"word":"mechanisms of action"}]},"article42":{"pmid":"31680977","title":"Growth Inhibitory Activity of Callicarpa americana Leaf Extracts Against Cutibacterium acnes.","abs":"Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease affecting adolescents and young adults of all ethnic groups, negatively impacting self-esteem, self-confidence, and social life.

In particular, we seek drivers of community assembly at the regional scale using a large lacustrine dataset (>300 lakes) along the geographical, limnological and physico-chemical gradients in the Pyrenees. By using high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and inferring environmental sources of bacterial immigrants, we showed that surface aquatic bacterial assemblages were strongly influenced by terrestrial populations from soil, biofilms or sediments, and primarily selected by a pH-alkalinity gradient. Indeed, source proportions explained 27% of the community variation, and chemistry 15% of the total variation, half of it shared with the sources. Major taxonomic groups such as Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes showed higher aquatic affinities than Parcubacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria or Betaproteobacteria, which may be recruited and selected through different hydrographic habitats. A regional fingerprint was observed with lower alpha diversity and higher beta diversity in the central Pyrenees than in both ends.

Deep mine biofilm samples that contain high amounts of mucoid exopolysaccharide often pose difficulties to obtaining refined community DNA. To circumvent this hindrance, we report our MINES method which we developed for optimal biofilm DNA recovery suitable for all types of high-resolution downstream applications. The method is also suitable for samples collected from landfill compost, kitchen digest (KD), and for Gram-positive Geobacillus sp. strain WSUCF1 and Gram-negative E. coli DH5α strains. In one form of the method, use of a gentle preprocessing technique to loosen the mucoid layer, combined with a multi-lytic polyzyme treatment to maximize yields from all cell types in the biofilm sample, yielded >1 μg of high molecular weight DNA (16-20 kb) per gram of the biofilm sample, with an A260/280 and A260/230 ratio of about 2. Furthermore, amplification of 16S rRNA genes as well as restriction digestion with BamHI and HindIII suggest that the newly developed method can minimize any inhibitory effects of contaminants. Results indicate that it is an appropriate methodology for the extraction of total genomic DNA for functional metagenomic studies and may be applicable to other environmental samples from which DNA extraction is challenging.

Compared to the reactor without PPCPs, the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of the reactors containing sulfadiazine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine declined by 21%, 30% and 42%, respectively. Based on the microbial community analysis, increasing the PPCPs concentration within a certain range (<2 mg/L) could stimulate microbial growth and increase microbial diversity yet the diversity reduced when the concentration (5 mg/L) exceeded the tolerance of microorganisms. Furthermore the presence and degradation of different PPCPs resulted in a different kind of microbial community structure in the MBBRs.","authors":[{"name":"Xinbo Zhang"},{"name":"Zi Song"},{"name":"Huu Hao Ngo"},{"name":"Wenshan Guo"},{"name":"Zumin Zhang"},{"name":"Yang Liu"},{"name":"Dan Zhang"},{"name":"Zhongliang Long"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Microbial community structure"},{"word":"Microbial diversity"},{"word":"Moving bed biofilm reactor"},{"word":"Nitrogen removal"},{"word":"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products"}]},"article68":{"pmid":"31675374","title":"Effects of artificially introduced Enterococcus faecalis strains in experimental necrotizing enterocolitis.","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis is a ubiquitous intestinal symbiont and common early colonizer of the neonatal gut.

It is best defined as the changes to pore morphology after implantation of mesh in situ. It is heavily dependent on mesh construct and repair technique and has the potential to impact hernia repair by reducing mesh tissue integration and promoting fibrosis. Bacterial biofilm is a well-described condition affecting prosthesis in breast and join replacement surgery with catastrophic consequences. There is a paucity of information on bacterial biofilm in mesh hernia repair. We speculate that bacterial biofilm has the potential to reduce the effective porosity of mesh, resulting in non-suppurative mesh-related complications as well as the potential for late suppurative infections.

The addition of an external soluble carbon source has been the usual procedure to achieve denitrification. However, the disadvantage of this treatment process is the need of a closed, rather sophisticated and costly process control as well as the risk of overdosing. Solid-phase denitrification using biodegradable polymers as biofilm carrier and carbon source was considered as an attractive alternative for biological denitrification. The start-up time of the novel process using PCL (polycaprolactone) as biofilm carrier and carbon source was comparable with that of conventional process using ceramsite as biofilm carrier and acetate as carbon source. Further, the solid-phase denitrification process showed higher nitrogen removal efficiency under shorter hydraulic retention time (HRT) and low carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio since the biofilm was firmly attached to the clear pores on the surface of PCL carriers and in this process bacteria that could degrade PCL carriers to obtain electron donor for denitrification was found. In addition, solid-phase denitrification process had a stronger resistance of shock loading than that in conventional process. This study revealed, for the first time, that the physical properties of the biodegradable polymer played a vital role in denitrification, and the different microbial compositions of the two processes was the main reason for the different denitrification performances under low C/N ratio.","authors":[{"name":"Qian Zhang"},{"name":"Xue Chen"},{"name":"Heng Wu"},{"name":"Wandong Luo"},{"name":"Xiangyang Liu"},{"name":"Li Feng"},{"name":"Tiantao Zhao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ceramsite filter"},{"word":"conventional denitrification"},{"word":"nitrate removal"},{"word":"polycaprolactone (PCL)"},{"word":"solid-phase denitrification"}]},"article79":{"pmid":"31671533","title":"Candida albicans Biofilm Heterogeneity and Tolerance of Clinical Isolates: Implications for Secondary Endodontic Infections.","abs":"Endodontic infections are caused by the invasion of various microorganisms into the root canal system.

Ideally, the interface will encourage osseointegration with the host bone, resulting in strong fixation and implant stability. However, implant failure can occur due to the lack of integration with bone tissue or bacterial infection. The chosen material and surface topography of orthopedic implants are key factors that influence the early events following implantation and may ultimately define the success of a device. Early attachment, rapid migration and improved differentiation of stem cells to osteoblasts are necessary to populate the surface of biomedical implants, potentially preventing biofilm formation and implant-associated infection. This article explores these early stem cell specific events by seeding human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on four clinically relevant materials: polyether ether ketone (PEEK), Ti6Al4V (smooth Ti), macro-micro rough Ti6Al4V (Endoskeleton®), and macro-micro-nano rough Ti6Al4V (nanoLOCK®). The results demonstrate the incorporation of a hierarchical macro-micro-nano roughness on titanium produces a stellate morphology typical of mature osteoblasts/osteocytes, rapid and random migration, and improved osteogenic differentiation in seeded MSCs.

We found that Trichoplax adhaerens, the simplest multicellular animal ever described, engages in social feeding behavior. T. adhaerens lacks muscle tissue, nervous and digestive systems - yet is capable of aggregating and forming groups of closely connected individuals who collectively feed. The tight physical interactions between the animals are transitory and appear to serve the goal of staying connected to neighbors during the external digestion of algae when enzymes are released on the biofilm and nutrients are absorbed through the ventral epithelium. We found that T. adhaerens are more likely to engage in social feeding when the concentrations of algae are high - both in a semi-natural conditions and in vitro. It is surprising that T. adhaerens - an organism without a nervous system - is able to engage in this social feeding behavior. Whether this behavior is cooperative is still an open question. Nevertheless, the social feeding behavior of T. adhaerens, an early multicellular animal, suggests that sociality may have played an important role in the early evolution of animals.

We screened only the common proteins from nine different sources of A. veronii by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and identified the gene hisJ. We then constructed ΔhisJ (deleted) and C-hisJ (complemented) variants of A. veronii TH0426 to assess the biological function of hisJ. While the ΔhisJ strain did not show altered growth (P > 0.05), we observed that it had reduced colony formation and biofilm formation and reduced adhesion to and invasion of epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells by 2.0-, 1.9-, and 10.8-fold, respectively. Additionally, infection experiments on zebrafish and mouse infection experiments showed that the virulence of the ΔhisJ strain was decreased by 865-fold (P < 0.001) compared with the wild-type strain; virulence of the complemented C-hisJ strain was reduced only 2.8-fold. Furthermore, in the context of hisJ deletion, flagella of A. veronii TH0426 were easily detached and the expression of virulence genes was downregulated.

It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of diabetes along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced during periodontal inflammation can interfere with the actions of insulin receptors and worsen the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, affecting over 300 million people and bacteria associated with periodontitis are also linked with systemic problems like endocarditis, atherosclerosis. Recent work has highlighted a major role for the host sugar sialic acid in the biofilm physiology and host-pathogen interactions of T. forsithya, a key periodontal pathogen. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Serum sialic acids were estimated in Indian population by diphenylamine method and Thiobarbituric acid method. The average values were 68 ± 2.6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ± 5 mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric acid assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic acid level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study, the participants were divided into three groups: Group A, B and C. Group A consists of systemically healthy subjects, Group B consists of subjects with (CMP) while Group C consists of subjects with (CMP) with (NIDDM) and results of this study indicated that, at baseline, there were significant differences between Group A, B and Group C with respect to all the clinical parameters, including (GI), (OHI-S), (PPD), (CAL), (TSSA) and (HbA1c) levels. Thus (TSSA) level could be considered as novel biomarker in the progression of periodontal disease and diabetic status.

Peptide mix from the marine mollusc, Olivancillaria hiatula, has been studied for its antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Microscopy and microtiter plate-based assays were used to evaluate biofilm inhibitory activities. Effect of the peptide mix on quorum sensing-mediated processes was also evaluated. Peptide mix proved to be a good antibiofilm agent, requiring less than 39 μg/mL to inhibit 50% biofilm formation.

The analyses performed in this study increased the understanding of the horizontal transfer of plasmids found within Pseudomonas populations inhabiting Antarctic soils. It was shown that the majority of the studied plasmids are narrow-host-range replicons, whose transfer across taxonomic boundaries may be limited. Moreover, structural and functional analyses enabled identification and characterization of various accessory genetic modules, including genes encoding major pilin protein (PilA), that enhance biofilm formation, as well as active transposable elements.

Here, we introduce a membrane-based culturing workflow that enables a rapid MSI-compatible steam inactivation of pathogens and generation of a flat surface. We equipped precision mass spectrometers with laser-postionization (MALDI-2) modules to increase the analytical sensitivity by up to several orders of magnitude.

To visualize the metabolic exchange between competing microorganisms, we challenged commensal Escherichia coli MG1655 and virulence factor-depleted E. coli C600 strains with enteropathogenic Shiga-toxin negative E. coli O26:H11, and Staphylococcus aureus with antagonistic P. aeruginosa.

In Vibrio cholerae, quorum sensing coordinates virulence, biofilm formation, and DNA uptake by natural competence. The transcription factors AphA and HapR, expressed at low and high cell density respectively, play a key role. In particular, AphA triggers the entire virulence cascade upon host colonisation. In this work we have mapped genome-wide DNA binding by AphA. We show that AphA is versatile, exhibiting distinct modes of DNA binding and promoter regulation. Unexpectedly, whilst HapR is known to induce natural competence, we demonstrate that AphA also intervenes. Most notably, AphA is a direct repressor of tfoX, the master activator of competence. Hence, production of AphA markedly suppressed DNA uptake; an effect largely circumvented by ectopic expression of tfoX. Our observations suggest dual regulation of competence. At low cell density AphA is a master repressor whilst HapR activates the process at high cell density. Thus, we provide deep mechanistic insight into the role of AphA and highlight how V. cholerae utilises this regulator for diverse purposes.","authors":[{"name":"James R J Haycocks"},{"name":"Gemma Z L Warren"},{"name":"Lucas M Walker"},{"name":"Jennifer L Chlebek"},{"name":"Triana N Dalia"},{"name":"Ankur B Dalia"},{"name":"David C Grainger"}],"keywords":[]},"article127":{"pmid":"31657672","title":"Dominant, Heritable Resistance to Stewart's Wilt in Maize Is Associated with an Enhanced Vascular Defense Response to Infection with Pantoea stewartii.","abs":"Vascular wilt bacteria such as Pantoea stewartii, the causal agent of Stewart's bacterial wilt of maize (SW), are destructive pathogens that are difficult to control. These bacteria colonize the xylem, where they form biofilms that block sap flow leading to characteristic wilting symptoms. Heritable forms of SW resistance exist and are used in maize breeding programs but the underlying genes and mechanisms are mostly unknown. Here, we show that seedlings of maize inbred lines with pan1 mutations are highly resistant to SW. However, current evidence suggests that other genes introgressed along with pan1 are responsible for resistance. Genomic analyses of pan1 lines were used to identify candidate resistance genes. In-depth comparison of P. stewartii interaction with susceptible and resistant maize lines revealed an enhanced vascular defense response in pan1 lines characterized by accumulation of electron-dense materials in xylem conduits visible by electron microscopy. We propose that this vascular defense response restricts P. stewartii spread through the vasculature, reducing both systemic bacterial colonization of the xylem network and consequent wilting. Though apparently unrelated to the resistance phenotype of pan1 lines, we also demonstrate that the effector WtsE is essential for P. stewartii xylem dissemination, show evidence for a nutritional immunity response to P. stewartii that alters xylem sap composition, and present the first analysis of maize transcriptional responses to P. stewartii infection.","authors":[{"name":"Paula Doblas-Ibáñez"},{"name":"Kaiyue Deng"},{"name":"Miguel F Vasquez"},{"name":"Laura Giese"},{"name":"Paul A Cobine"},{"name":"Judith M Kolkman"},{"name":"Helen King"},{"name":"Tiffany M Jamann"},{"name":"Peter Balint-Kurti"},{"name":"Leonardo De La Fuente"},{"name":"Rebecca J Nelson"},{"name":"David Mackey"},{"name":"Laurie G Smith"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pantoea stewartii"},{"word":"Stewart’s bacterial wilt"},{"word":"WtsE"},{"word":"bacterial pathogenesis"},{"word":"electron-dense materials"},{"word":"maize"},{"word":"plant responses to pathogens"},{"word":"secretion and cell wall changes"},{"word":"type-3 secretion"},{"word":"vascular defense response"},{"word":"xylem-dwelling bacteria"}]},"article128":{"pmid":"31657209","title":"Antibiofilm Platform based on the Combination of Antimicrobial Polymers and Essential Oils.","abs":"The development of potent strategies to counter microbial biofilm is an urgent priority in healthcare.

Herein, we report an effective antibiofilm platform based on the use of synthetic antimicrobial polymers in combination with essential oils, where the antimicrobial polymers play a secondary role as delivery vehicle for essential oils. Two ternary antimicrobial polymers consisting of cationic primary amines, low-fouling oligo(ethylene glycol) and hydrophobic ethylhexyl groups were synthesized in the form of random and block copolymers, and mixed with either carvacrol or eugenol. Coadministration of these compounds improved the efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms compared to the individual compounds. We observed about a 60-75% and 70-85% biofilm inhibition effect for all tested combinations against wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 and MDR strain PA37, respectively, upon 6.5 h of incubation time. While both random and block copolymers demonstrated similar biofilm inhibition potencies in combination with essential oils, only the block copolymer acted synergistically with essential oils in killing biofilm. Treatment of PAO1 biofilm for 20 min with the block copolymer-oil combinations resulted in the killing of >99.99% of biofilm bacteria. This synergistic bactericidal activity is attributed to the targeted delivery of essential oils to the biofilm, driven by the electrostatic interaction between positively charged delivery vehicles, in the form of polymeric micelles, and negatively charged bacteria. This study thus highlights the advantage of combining essential oils and antimicrobial polymers as an effective avenue for antibacterial applications.","authors":[{"name":"Rashin Namivandi-Zangeneh"},{"name":"Yiling Yang"},{"name":"Sihao Xu"},{"name":"Edgar H H Wong"},{"name":"Cyrille Boyer"}],"keywords":[]},"article129":{"pmid":"31657125","title":"A comparative study on the cellular viability and debridement efficiency of antimicrobial-based wound dressings.","abs":"A concentrated surfactant gel containing polyhexamethylene biguanide (CSG-PHMB) (CSG: Plurogel) was evaluated for in vitro cell cytotoxicity using the direct contact, extraction, and cell insert assays, along with its ability to breakdown artificial wound eschar and slough, compared with other clinically available wound gels: a wound gel loaded with 0.13% benzalkonium chloride (BXG) and a highly viscous gel loaded with 0.1% polyhexamethylene biguanide (PXG).

Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate measurable biological indicators of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary omics technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the microbiome. The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other. Vast such data is derived from oral biological fluids, including gingival crevicular fluid and saliva, which is progressively completed and catalogued as the analytical technologies and bioinformatics tools progressively advance.

Usps play an important role in adaptation of bacteria to a variety of environmental stresses. There is increasing evidence that Usps facilitate pathogens to adapt host environment and are involved in pathogenicity. Edwardsiella piscicida (formerly included in E. tarda) is a severe fish pathogen and infects various important economic fish including tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In E. piscicida, a number of systems and factors that are involved in stress resistance and pathogenesis were identified. However, the function of Usps in E. piscicida is totally unknown. In this study, we examined the expressions of 13 usp genes in E. piscicida and found that most of these usp genes were up-regulated expression under high temperature, oxidative stress, acid stress, and host serum stress. Particularly, among these usp genes, usp13, exhibited dramatically high expression level upon several stress conditions. To investigate the biological role of usp13, a markerless usp13 in-frame mutant strain, TX01Δusp13, was constructed. Compared to the wild type TX01, TX01Δusp13 exhibited markedly compromised tolerance to high temperature, hydrogen peroxide, and low pH. Deletion of usp13 significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis showed that the inactivation of usp13 significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida to invade into host cell and infect host tissue. Introduction of a trans-expressed usp13 gene restored the lost virulence of TX01Δusp13. In support of these results, host immune response induced by TX01 and TX01Δusp13 was examined, and the results showed reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in TX01Δusp13-infected macrophages were significantly higher than those in TX01-infected cells. The expression level of several cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and CC2) in TX01Δusp13-infected fish was significantly higher than that in TX01-infected fish. These results suggested that the deletion of usp13 attenuated the ability of bacteria to overcome the host immune response to pathogen infection.

Although several formulations have been developed for inhalation therapy to improve the pulmonary condition in CF patients, there is still no comprehensive study on a combined multifunctional dry powder formulation of antibiotics with NAC. In this work, we developed an innovative multifunctional dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation based on salt formation between NAC and antibiotics and characterized their solid state properties and physical stability. NAC could be spray dried together with three different antibiotics, azithromycin (Azi), tobramycin (Tobra) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro), without the use of organic solvents to form Azi/NAC, Tobra/NAC and Cipro/NAC DPI formulations. Solid-state characterization of these DPI formulations showed that they were amorphous after spray drying.

Notably, the ΔmtrB strain was markedly defective in establishing lung infection in mice, with no detectable lung pathology following aerosol challenge. ΔmtrB was less able to withstand hypoxic and acid stresses and to form biofilms and had decreased viability under hypoxia. Transcriptional profiling of ΔmtrB by gene microarray analysis, validated by quantitative RT-PCR, indicated down-regulation of the hypoxia-associated dosR regulon, as well as genes associated with other pathways linked to adaptation of M. tuberculosis to the host environment. Using in vitro biochemical assays, we demonstrate that MtrB interacts with DosR (a noncognate RR) in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that MtrB enhances the binding of DosR to the hspX promoter, suggesting an unexpected role of MtrB in DosR-regulated gene expression in M. tuberculosis Taken together, these findings indicate that MtrB functions as a regulator of DosR-dependent gene expression and in the adaptation of M. tuberculosis to hypoxia and the host environment.

Highly conserved residues specifically bind the guanine base of c-di-GMP/cGAMP in the G2 site while the semi-conserved nature of residues at the G1 site could act as a specificity determinant. Two metal ions, co-ordinated with six stubbornly conserved residues and two non-bridging scissile phosphate oxygens of c-di-GMP/cGAMP, activate a water molecule for an in-line attack on the phosphodiester bond, supporting two-metal ion-based catalytic mechanism. PDE activity and biofilm assays of several prudently designed mutants collectively demonstrate that VcEAL active site is charge and size optimized. Intriguingly, in VcEAL-5'-pGpG-Ca2+ structure, β5-α5 loop adopts a novel conformation that along with conserved E131 creates a new metal-binding site. This novel conformation along with several subtle changes in the active site designate VcEAL-5'-pGpG-Ca2+ structure quite different from other 5'-pGpG bound structures reported earlier.","authors":[{"name":"Malti Yadav"},{"name":"Kamalendu Pal"},{"name":"Udayaditya Sen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"cGAMP"},{"word":"crystallography"},{"word":"phosphodiesterase"},{"word":"second messenger"},{"word":"site-directed mutagenesis"}]},"article167":{"pmid":"31647407","title":"An invitro experimental study of the effect of fosfomycin in combination with amikacin, ciprofloxacin or meropenem on biofilm formation by multidrug-resistant urinary isolates of Escherichia coli.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Sugalya Sugathan"},{"name":"Jharna Mandal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FIC"},{"word":"MDR E.coli"},{"word":"MIC"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"fosfomycin combination"}]},"article168":{"pmid":"31647218","title":"N-Benzyl Derivatives of Long-Chained 4-Amino-7-chloro-quionolines as Inhibitors of Pyocyanin Production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of nosocomial infections that are becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to the occurrence of antibiotic resistant strains.

The combination of D-LANA-14 and the antibiotics tetracycline or rifampicin showed not only synergistic activity against growing planktonic cells of meropenem-resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa clinical isolates but was also able to disrupt their established biofilms. More importantly, this synergistic effect was retained under the in vivo scenario, wherein the combination showed excellent efficacy in mice model of burn-wound infection with a drastic reduction of bacterial burden. A combined treatment of D-LANA-14 (40 mg/kg) and rifampicin (40 mg/kg) showed 4.9 log and 4.0 log reduction in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa viability, respectively. On the contrary, individual treatment of D-LANA-14 decreased bacterial burden by 2.3 log (A. baumannii) and 1.3 log (P. aeruginosa) and rifampicin reduced about 3.0 log (A. baumannii) and 1.6 log (P. aeruginosa). Owing to the membrane-active nature imparted by D-LANA-14, bacteria could not develop resistance against the combined treatment, whereas a high-level of resistance development was observed against the last resort Gram-negative antibiotic, colistin.

While the frequency of infection following elective orthopedic surgery is low, rates of reinfection are disturbingly high. Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for the majority of chronic osteomyelitis cases and is often considered to be incurable due to bacterial persistence deep within bone. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on clinical classifications of osteomyelitis and the ensuing treatment algorithm. Given the high patient morbidity, mortality, and economic burden caused by osteomyelitis, it is important to elucidate mechanisms of bone infection to inform novel strategies for prevention and curative treatment. Recent discoveries in this field have identified three distinct reservoirs of bacterial biofilm including: Staphylococcal abscess communities in the local soft tissue and bone marrow, glycocalyx formation on implant hardware and necrotic tissue, and colonization of the osteocyte-lacuno canalicular network (OLCN) of cortical bone. In contrast, S. aureus intracellular persistence in bone cells has not been substantiated in vivo, which challenges this mode of chronic osteomyelitis. There have also been major advances in our understanding of the immune proteome against S. aureus, from clinical studies of serum antibodies and media enriched for newly synthesized antibodies (MENSA), which may provide new opportunities for osteomyelitis diagnosis, prognosis, and vaccine development. Finally, novel therapies such as antimicrobial implant coatings and antibiotic impregnated 3D-printed scaffolds represent promising strategies for preventing and managing this devastating disease.

As with E. coli O157:H7, leaf populations of the non-O157 strains declined rapidly during the first 72 h postinoculation, displaying the biphasic decay curve typical of serotype O157:H7 isolates. Preinoculation treatment appeared not to influence decay rates greatly (P > 0.5), but strain-specific differences (persistence period and attachment proficiency) indicated that serotype O103:H2 strain PARC445 was a better survivor. Also assessed was the impact of preinoculation treatment on phenotypes key to leaf colonization and survival and the expression of starvation stress-associated genes.

We induced active stresses by systematically varying the agitation rate during the growth of FBCs. By growing FBCs that are strong enough to be conventionally tensile loaded, we find that as agitation rate increases, the elongation strain at which the FBCs break, increases linearly, and their elastic modulus correspondingly decreases. Using results from microstructural imaging and thermogravimetry, we rationalize that agitation increases the production of ECM, which concomitantly increases the water content of agitated FBCs up to 250% more than un-agitated FBCs. Water held in the nanopores of the ECM acts a plasticizer and controls the ductility of FBCs in close analogy with polyelectrolyte complexes.

A total of 23 chemical components with relative levels ≥0.11%, including a large number of terpene compounds, were identified in C. camphora leaf EO by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The principal component was linalool, followed by eucalyptol, with relative levels of 51.57% and 22.07%, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and antibacterial activity of C. camphora EO were examined, and P. aeruginosa and E. coli ATCC25922 showed the highest and lowest sensitivity to C. camphora EO, respectively. Tests of QS inhibitory activity revealed that C. camphora EO significantly decreased the production of violacein and biofilm biomass in C. violaceum, with the maximum inhibition rates of 63% and 77.64%, respectively, and inhibited the biofilm formation and swarming movement, independent of affecting the growth of C. violaceum. Addition of C. camphora EO also resulted in downregulation of the expression of the acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) synthesis gene (cviI) and transcription regulator (cviR), and inhibited the expression of QS-regulated virulence genes, including vioA, vioB, vioC, vioD, vioE, lasA, lasB, pilE3, and hmsHNFR.

In this study, we investigated the possibility to combine well-established microbiological procedures with advanced microscopies to get information on composition and distribution of the macromolecular components of biofilm matrices. To this, confocal microscopy, diffraction-limited infrared (IR) spectral imaging, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to explore biofilm produced by a clinical strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. IR imaging permitted to have clues on how the biofilm grows and spreads on surfaces, and the local distribution of the components within it.

However, secreted by lower organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, amyloid fibers play a functional role: for example, when they serve as cement in the extracellular matrix of biofilms. Originating either in humans or in microorganisms, the sequence of amyloid proteins is decorated with hexapeptides with high propensity to form fibers, known as steric zippers. We have found that steric zippers form globular structures on route to making fibers and exhibit a characteristic force-distance (F-D) fingerprint when pulled with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. Particularly, the F-D pulling curves showed force plateau steps, suggesting that the globular structures were composed of chains that were unwound like a yarn ball. Force plateau analysis showed that the F-D characteristic parameters were sequence sensitive, representing differences in the packing of the hexapeptides within the globules. These unprecedented findings show that steric zippers exhibit a characteristic nanomechanical signature in solution in addition to previously observed characteristic crystallographic structure.

Proteobacteria was the most diverse and overwhelming phylum in biofilms formed on all PDMS-based coatings, followed by Cyanobacteria. In addition, the decreased abundance of Proteobacteria and the increased abundance of Cyanobacteria on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-modifed PDMS composites (CPCs) may contribute to their differential anti-biofouling effect against the colonization of juvenile macrofoulers.","authors":[{"name":"Yuan Sun"},{"name":"Yanhe Lang"},{"name":"ZhengYu Yan"},{"name":"Lei Wang"},{"name":"Zhizhou Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Carbon nanotubes"},{"word":"High-throughput sequencing"},{"word":"Marine biofouling"},{"word":"Pioneer surface-biofilm bacteria"},{"word":"Polydimethylsiloxane"}]},"article212":{"pmid":"31634213","title":"Assessing the Effect of Middle Ear Effusions on Wideband Acoustic Immittance Using Optical Coherence Tomography.","abs":"Wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) noninvasively assesses middle ear function by measuring the sound conduction over a range of audible frequencies.

These mutations were coanalyzed for the presence of stress survival islet 1 (SSI-1) and for the abilities of the isolates to invade Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and form biofilms on polystyrene. PMSC mutations were present in one-third of the isolates (predominantly those of serogroup 1/2a), and their presence was correlated with a noninvasive phenotype. The presence of SSI-1 and the ability to form biofilms were also linked to the 1/2a serogroup. Serogroup 4b isolates lacked inlA PMSC mutations and were invasive, but neither formed biofilms nor carried SSI-1. To expand upon these experimental findings, an in silico analysis was performed on L. monocytogenes genomes from Canadian databases of 278 food isolates and 607 clinical isolates. The prevalence of inlA PMSC mutations in genomes of food isolates was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than that in clinical isolates. Also, a three-codon deletion in inlA associated with a hyperinvasive phenotype was more prevalent in genomes from clinical isolates (primarily of clonal complex 6, serogroup 4b) than in those from food isolates (P < 0.001). In contrast, SSI-1 was significantly overrepresented (P < 0.001) in genomes from food isolates. We propose the hypothesis that SSI-1 and inlA play a role in the evolution of Canadian L. monocytogenes strains into either a virulent (represented by serogroup 4b clinical isolates) or an environmentally persistent (represented by serogroup 1/2a food isolates) phenotype. The combined presence of SSI-1 and inlA PMSC mutations have potential for use as genetic markers for risk assessment when L. monocytogenes is recovered from foods, indicating low potential for pathogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Jacqueline Upham"},{"name":"Stephen Chen"},{"name":"Elizabeth Boutilier"},{"name":"Lisa Hodges"},{"name":"Mikaela Eisebraun"},{"name":"Matthew A Croxen"},{"name":"Alex Fortuna"},{"name":"Gustavo V Mallo"},{"name":"Rafael A Garduño"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"Persistence"},{"word":"Premature stop codon"},{"word":"SSI-1"},{"word":"Virulence"},{"word":"inlA"}]},"article215":{"pmid":"31633423","title":"Characterization of Virulence and Persistence Abilities of Listeria monocytogenes Strains Isolated from Food Processing Premises.","abs":"We report the characterization of 15 Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from various food processing plants by multivirulence locus sequence typing to determine virulence types (VTs) and epidemic clones.

Dental caries remains the most common chronic disease worldwide, accompanied by a tremendous financial and social burden, despite widespread and efficacious fluoride and hygienic regimens. Over the past several decades, various precision approaches to combat dental caries, including vaccines, probiotics, and antimicrobial compounds, have been pursued. Despite the distinct overall conceptual strengths of each approach, for various reasons, there are currently no approved precision antibiotic therapeutics to prevent dental caries. Specifically targeted antimicrobial peptides (STAMPs) are synthetic molecules that combine the antibiotic moiety of a traditional antimicrobial peptide with a targeting domain to provide specificity against a particular organism. Conjoining the killing domain from the antimicrobial, novispirin G10, and a targeting domain derived from the Streptococcus mutans pheromone, CSP, the STAMP C16G2 was designed to provide targeted killing of S. mutans, widely considered the keystone species in dental caries pathogenesis. C16G2 was able to selectively eliminate S. mutans from complex ecosystems while leaving closely related, yet health-associated, oral species unharmed. This remodeling of the dental plaque community is expected to have significant advantages compared to conventional broad-spectrum mouthwashes, as the intact, surviving community is apt to prevent reinfection by pathogens. Following successful phase I clinical trials that evaluated the safety and basic microbiology of C16G2 treatments, the phase II trials of several C16G2 formulations are currently in progress. C16G2 represents an exciting advance in precision therapeutics, and the STAMP platform provides vast opportunities for both the development of additional therapeutics and the overall study of microbial ecology.","authors":[{"name":"J L Baker"},{"name":"X He"},{"name":"W Shi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"clinical trial"},{"word":"dysbiosis"},{"word":"human microbiome"},{"word":"oral health"},{"word":"precision antibiotics"}]},"article217":{"pmid":"31632948","title":"Antimicrobial Activity of Naturally Occurring Phenols and Derivatives Against Biofilm and Planktonic Bacteria.","abs":"Biofilm-forming bacteria present formidable challenges across diverse settings, and there is a need for new antimicrobial agents that are both environmentally acceptable and relatively potent against microorganisms in the biofilm state.

Examples of such surfaces include rose petals, which possess hierarchical structures like the micropapillae measuring tens of microns and nanofolds that range in the size of 700 ± 100 nm. We duplicated the natural structures on rose petal surfaces via a simple UV-curable nanocasting technique and tested the efficacy of these artificial surfaces in preventing biofilm growth using clinically relevant bacteria strains. The rose petal-structured surfaces exhibited hydrophobicity (contact angle (CA) ≈ 130.8° ± 4.3°) and high CA hysteresis (∼91.0° ± 4.9°). Water droplets on rose petal replicas evaporated following the constant contact line mode, indicating the likely coexistence of both Cassie and Wenzel states (Cassie-Baxter impregnating the wetting state). Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis revealed the significantly lower attachment of Staphylococcus epidermidis (86.1 ± 6.2% less) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85.9 ± 3.2% less) on the rose petal-structured surfaces, compared with flat surfaces over a period of 2 h. An extensive biofilm matrix was observed in biofilms formed by both species on flat surfaces after prolonged growth (several days), but was less apparent on rose petal-biomimetic surfaces. In addition, the biomass of S. epidermidis (63.2 ± 9.4% less) and P. aeruginosa (76.0 ± 10.0% less) biofilms were significantly reduced on the rose petal-structured surfaces, in comparison to the flat surfaces. By comparing P. aeruginosa growth on representative unitary nanopillars, we demonstrated that hierarchical structures are more effective in delaying biofilm growth. The mechanisms are two-fold: (1) the nanofolds across the hemispherical micropapillae restrict initial attachment of bacterial cells and delay the direct contact of cells via cell alignment and (2) the hemispherical micropapillae arrays isolate bacterial clusters and inhibit the formation of a fibrous network. The hierarchical features on rose petal surfaces may be useful for developing strategies to control biofilm formation in medical and industrial contexts.","authors":[{"name":"Yunyi Cao"},{"name":"Saikat Jana"},{"name":"Leon Bowen"},{"name":"Xiaolong Tan"},{"name":"Hongzhong Liu"},{"name":"Nadia Rostami"},{"name":"James Brown"},{"name":"Nicholas S Jakubovics"},{"name":"Jinju Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article231":{"pmid":"31630018","title":"Constructing zwitterionic polymer brush layer to enhance gravity-driven membrane performance by governing biofilm formation.","abs":"In this study, zwitterionic polymer brushes with controlled architecture were grafted on the surface of gravity-driven membrane (GDM) via surface-initiated reaction to impart antifouling property.

Early implant-related infections often occur in the first 4 weeks post-operation. Inhibiting bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation at the early stage and promoting subsequent implant osseointegration are important for implant success. Our previous studies demonstrated that dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM) provided dental materials with antibacterial effects. In the present study, DMADDM and hydroxyapatite (HA) are loaded on to the titanium (Ti) surface via poly dopamine (PDA) self-polymerization. This local DMADDM-delivery Ti is referred as Ti-PHD. Here we report the two-staged capability of Ti-PHD: (1) in the first stage, releasing DMADDM during the high-infection-risk initial period post-implantation for 4 weeks; (2) then in the second stage, enhancing osteogenesis and promoting osseointegration. Ti-PHD has a porous surface with higher average roughness and greater hydrophilicity than pure Ti. Its biocompatibility is verified in vitro and in vivo. During the first 4 weeks of release, both DMADDM remaining on Ti surface and DMADDM released into the soaking medium greatly reduced the adherence and growth of pathogens. This is further confirmed by the prevention of bone destruction in a rat osteomyelitis model. After releasing DMADDM for 4 weeks, Ti-PHD promotes osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and new bone formation around the implants in vivo. This article represents the first report on the two-staged, time-dependent antibacterial and osteogenesis effects of Ti-PHD, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications to inhibit implant-associated infections.

The DNA sequences for 147 fully sequenced IncI2 plasmids were studied by a whole-plasmid multi-locus sequence typing (wpMLST) scheme. A total of 171 loci were identified of which 52 were considered core (carried by greater than 95% of the plasmids). Most of the plasmids carrying the antimicrobial gene mcr-1 were in a distinct clade while most of the antimicrobial gene free plasmids were more distantly related. However, the host strains of bacteria were disparate for both groups of plasmids, showing that conjugal transfer of IncI2 plasmid is frequent. The mcr-1 gene was likely to have been introduced into IncI2 plasmids multiple times. It was also observed that the genes for conjugation showed significant linkage disequilibrium despite substantial diversity for most of those genes. Genes associated with biofilm formation were also among the core genes. The core genes can be considered the cohesive unit that defines the IncI2 plasmid group. Given the role conjugation can play in biofilm formation, it was concluded that conjugation is an active survival strategy for IncI2 plasmids.

Heterologous expression of the chrA gene and the nitR2 gene indicated that ChrA was associated with Cr(VI) resistance, while NitR2 was responsible for Cr(VI) reduction. Furthermore, soluble end products were detected. On the basis of FTIR, it was speculated that the formation of soluble end products may be due to the complexation of EPS with Cr(III).

In many type IVa pilus systems, extension occurs through the action of an extension ATPase, often called PilB, while optimal retraction requires the action of a retraction ATPase, PilT. Many type IVa systems also encode a homolog of PilT called PilU. However, the function of this protein has remained unclear because pilU mutants exhibit inconsistent phenotypes among type IV pilus systems and because it is relatively understudied compared to PilT. Here, we study the type IVa competence pilus of Vibrio cholerae as a model system to define the role of PilU. We show that the ATPase activity of PilU is critical for pilus retraction in PilT Walker A and/or Walker B mutants. PilU does not, however, contribute to pilus retraction in ΔpilT strains. Thus, these data suggest that PilU is a bona fide retraction ATPase that supports pilus retraction in a PilT-dependent manner. We also found that a ΔpilU mutant exhibited a reduction in the force of retraction suggesting that PilU is important for generating maximal retraction forces. Additional in vitro and in vivo data show that PilT and PilU act as independent homo-hexamers that may form a complex to facilitate pilus retraction. Finally, we demonstrate that the role of PilU as a PilT-dependent retraction ATPase is conserved in Acinetobacter baylyi, suggesting that the role of PilU described here may be broadly applicable to other type IVa pilus systems.","authors":[{"name":"Jennifer L Chlebek"},{"name":"Hannah Q Hughes"},{"name":"Aleksandra S Ratkiewicz"},{"name":"Rasman Rayyan"},{"name":"Joseph Che-Yen Wang"},{"name":"Brittany E Herrin"},{"name":"Triana N Dalia"},{"name":"Nicolas Biais"},{"name":"Ankur B Dalia"}],"keywords":[]},"article244":{"pmid":"31626589","title":"Pangenome of Acinetobacter baumannii uncovers two groups of genomes, one of them with genes involved in CRISPR/Cas defence systems associated with the absence of plasmids and exclusive genes for biofilm formation.","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic bacterium that causes hospital-acquired infections with a high mortality and morbidity, since there are strains resistant to virtually any kind of antibiotic.

Some bacteria produce antibiotics in biofilms; however, since the diffusion of antibiotics is generally hindered in biofilms by extracellular polymeric substances, i.e., the biofilm matrix, their function remains unclear. The Bacillus subtilis yitPOM operon is a paralog of the sdpABC operon, which produces the secreted peptide toxin SDP. Unlike sdpABC, yitPOM is induced in biofilms by the DegS-DegU two-component regulatory system. High yitPOM expression leads to the production of a secreted toxin called YIT. Expression of yitQ, which lies upstream of yitPOM, confers resistance to the YIT toxin, suggesting that YitQ is an anti-toxin protein for the YIT toxin. The alternative sigma factor SigW also contributes to YIT toxin resistance. In a mutant lacking yitQ and sigW, the YIT toxin specifically inhibits biofilm formation, and the extracellular neutral protease NprB is required for this inhibition. The requirement for NprB is eliminated by Δeps and ΔbslA mutations, either of which impairs production of biofilm matrix polymers. Overexpression of biofilm matrix polymers prevents the action of the SDP toxin but not the YIT toxin. These results indicate that, unlike the SDP toxin and many conventional antibiotics, the YIT toxin can pass through layers of biofilm matrix polymers to attack cells within biofilms with assistance from NprB. When the wild-type strain and the YIT-sensitive mutant were grown together on a solid medium, the wild-type strain formed biofilms that excluded the YIT-sensitive mutant. This observation suggests that the YIT toxin protects B. subtilis biofilms against competitors. Several bacteria are known to produce antibiotics in biofilms. We propose that some bacteria including B. subtilis may have evolved specialized antibiotics that can function within biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Kazuo Kobayashi"},{"name":"Yukako Ikemoto"}],"keywords":[]},"article263":{"pmid":"31622303","title":"The antibiofilm activity of Acetylsalicylic acid, Mefenamic acid, Acetaminophen against biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis.","abs":"To evaluate the antibacterial activity of Aspirin, Mefenamic acid and Acetaminophen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Syed Hani Abidi"},{"name":"Khalid Ahmed"},{"name":"Shahana Urooj Kazmi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiofilm activity, Aspirin, Mefenamic acid, Acetaminophen, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis biofilms.

Thus, the development of antibacterial materials that integrate bactericidal and antifouling properties is a promising approach to prevent biomaterial-associated infections. In this study, two types of dopamine-modified polymers, dopamine-terminated quaternary ammonium salt polymer (D-PQAs) with various lengths of N-alkyl chain (D-PQA4C, D-PQA8C, and D-PQA12C) and dopamine-terminated poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (D-PSBMA), were synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Mixed polymer brushes of D-PQAs and D-PSBMA with various ratios were well-integrated onto the surface of a silicon wafer via a facile mussel-inspired adhesion. We demonstrate that the synergistic antibacterial effect depends on both the ratio of the two components and the surface structures of the mixed polymer brushes, originating from the interactions between D-PQAs and D-PSBMA. The N-alkyl chain length of D-PQAs influenced the distribution and orientation of the alkyl chain on the mixed polymer brushes. A chart of the antibacterial efficiency of the mixed polymer brushes was obtained to reveal the synergistic role of their cationic and zwitterionic chains to resist S. aureus. The dominant amount of antifouling D-PSBMA with a minor amount of bactericidal D-PQAs with a short N-alkyl chain length facilitated the synergistic antibacterial effect. The selected polymer brushes (PSBMA/PQA4C-10%, PSBMA/PQA4C-30%, and PSBMA/PQA8C-10%) could effectively prevent biofilm formation by S. aureus for a long time, while having good biocompatibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the role of C. albicans transcription factors in regulation of polymicrobial biofilms and antibiotic tolerance of S. gordonii. The proteins secreted by C. albicans and S. gordonii in mixed planktonic cultures were determined using mass spectrometry. Antibiotic tolerance of S. gordonii to ampicillin and erythromycin was determined in mixed cultures and mixed biofilms with C. albicans. Additionally, biofilm formation of S. gordonii with C. albicans knock-out mutants of 45 transcription factors that affect cell wall integrity, filamentous growth and biofilm formation was determined. Furthermore, these mutants were also screened for antibiotic tolerance in mixed biofilms with S. gordonii. Analysis of secreted proteomes resulted in the identification of proteins being secreted exclusively in mixed cultures. Antibiotic testing showed that S. gordonii had significantly increased survival in mixed planktonic cultures with antibiotics as compared to single cultures. C. albicans mutants of transcription factors Sfl2, Brg1, Leu3, Cas5, Cta4, Tec1, Tup1, Rim101 and Efg1 were significantly affected in mixed biofilm formation. Also mixed biofilms of S. gordonii with mutants of C. albicans transcription factors, Tec1 and Sfl2, had significantly reduced antibiotic tolerance as compared to control cultures.

There is evidence that other Gram-negative species also continue to synthesize proteins during growth arrest and that a stringent response is required for their longevity as well.

The budding yeast has been studied for over a century, yet little is known about its social behaviour in nature. Flo11 is a highly regulated cell adhesin required for most laboratory social phenotypes; studies suggest it may function in cell recognition and its heterogeneous expression may be adaptive for collectives such as biofilms.

The cellular pool of DolP is derived from de novo synthesis in the dolichol branch of the mevalonate pathway and from recycling of DolPP after each cycle of N-glycosylation, when the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid carrier to the protein and DolPP is released and then dephosphorylated. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the dephosphorylation of DolPP is known to be catalyzed by the Cwh8p protein. To establish the role of the Cwh8p orthologue in another distantly related yeast species, Candida albicans, we studied its mutant devoid of the CaCWH8 gene. A double Cacwh8∆/Cacwh8∆ strain was constructed by the URA-blaster method. As in S. cerevisiae, the mutant was impaired in DolPP recycling. This defect, however, was accompanied by an elevation of cis-prenyltransferase activity and higher de novo production of dolichols. Despite these compensatory changes, protein glycosylation, cell wall integrity, filamentous growth, and biofilm formation were impaired in the mutant. These results suggest that the defects are not due to the lack of DolP for the protein N-glycosylation but rather that the activity of oligosacharyltransferase could be inhibited by the excess DolPP accumulating in the mutant.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Janik"},{"name":"Monika Niewiadomska"},{"name":"Urszula Perlińska-Lenart"},{"name":"Jacek Lenart"},{"name":"Damian Kołakowski"},{"name":"Karolina Skorupińska-Tudek"},{"name":"Ewa Swiezewska"},{"name":"Joanna S Kruszewska"},{"name":"Grażyna Palamarczyk"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. albicans"},{"word":"Cwh8p"},{"word":"Rer2p"},{"word":"cell wall integrity"},{"word":"dolichol"},{"word":"morphogenesis"}]},"article294":{"pmid":"31614693","title":"A Diverse Repertoire of Exopolysaccharide Biosynthesis Gene Clusters in Lactobacillus Revealed by Comparative Analysis in 106 Sequenced Genomes.","abs":"Production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) is one of the unique features of Lactobacillus genus.

Therefore, we investigated the potential presence of B. burgdorferi antigens and DNA in human autopsy tissues from a well-documented serum-, PCR-, and culture-positive Lyme disease patient, a 53-year-old female from northern Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley Region of New York State, who had received extensive antibiotic treatments during extensive antibiotic treatments over the course of her 16-year-long illness. We also asked what form the organism might take, with special interest in the recently found antibiotic-resistant aggregate form, biofilm. We also examined the host tissues for the presence of inflammatory markers such as CD3+ T lymphocytes. Autopsy tissue sections of the brain, heart, kidney, and liver were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical methods (IHC), confocal microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/metagenomics. We found significant pathological changes, including borrelial spirochetal clusters, in all of the organs using IHC combined with confocal microscopy. The aggregates contained a well-established biofilm marker, alginate, on their surfaces, suggesting they are true biofilm. We found B. burgdorferi DNA by FISH, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an independent verification by WGS/metagenomics, which resulted in the detection of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto specific DNA sequences.

In recent years, colonization of pigs by methicillin resistant S. aureus has become a problem with increasing numbers of humans being infected by livestock strains. In S. aureus colonization and virulence factor expression is controlled by the agr quorum sensing system, which responds to and is activated by self-generated, autoinducing peptides (AIPs). AIPs are also produced by coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) commonly found as commensals in both humans and animals, and interestingly, some of these inhibit S. aureus agr activity. Here, we have addressed if cross-communication occurs between S. aureus and CoNS strains isolated from pig nares, and if so, how properties such as host factor binding and biofilm formation are affected. From 25 pig nasal swabs we obtained 54 staphylococcal CoNS isolates belonging to 8 different species. Of these, none were able to induce S. aureus agr as monitored by reporter gene fusions to agr regulated genes but a number of agr-inhibiting species were identified including Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus arlettae, Staphylococcus lentus, and Staphylococcus chromogenes. After establishing that the inhibitory activity was mediated via AgrC, the receptor of AIPs, we synthesized selective AIPs to explore their effect on adhesion of S. aureus to fibronectin, a host factor involved in S. aureus colonization. Here, we found that the CoNS AIPs did not affect adhesion of S. aureus except for strain 8325-4. When individual CoNS strains were co-cultured together with S. aureus we observed variable degrees of biofilm formation which did not correlate with agr interactions. Our results show that multiple CoNS species can be isolated from pig nares and that the majority of these produce AIPs that inhibit S. aureus agr.

The exposure to bacterial biofilm triggers host inflammatory response whose dysregulation is ultimately responsible for the destruction of hard and soft periodontal tissues resulting in tooth loss. To date, significant effort has been invested in the research of the involvement of host cells and inflammatory mediators in regulation of inflammatory response in periodontitis. Syndecans (Sdcs) belong to a four-member family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Sdcs are compound molecules comprised of the core protein to which several heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached. The role of Sdcs in pathogenesis of periodontitis is poorly investigated despite the numerous reports from experimental studies about the critical involvement of these factors in modulation of various aspects of inflammatory response, such as the formation of inflammatory mediators gradients, leukocyte recruitment and extracellular matrix remodeling in resolution of inflammation. Most of these functions of Sdcs are HS-related and, thus, dependent upon the structure of HS. This, in turn, is determined by the combinatorial action of enzymes for biosynthesis and modification of HS such as exostosis (EXTs), sulfotransferases (NDSTs), and heparanase 1 (HPSE1). The data presented in this study clearly indicate that some Sdcs display different expression profiles in healthy and diseased periodontal tissue. Additionally, the differences in expression profiles of HS GAG biosynthesis and modification enzymes (EXTs, NDSTs, and HPSE1) in healthy and diseased periodontal tissue imply that changes in HS GAG content and structure might also take place during periodontitis. Most notably, expression profiles of Sdcs, EXTs, NDSTs, and HPSE1 differentially correlate with the presence of inflammatory infiltrate in healthy and diseased periodontal tissue, which might imply that these factors could also be involved in modulation of inflammatory response in periodontitis.","authors":[{"name":"Roko Duplancic"},{"name":"Marija Roguljic"},{"name":"Ivan Puhar"},{"name":"Nika Vecek"},{"name":"Ruzica Dragun"},{"name":"Katarina Vukojevic"},{"name":"Mirna Saraga-Babic"},{"name":"Darko Kero"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EXTs"},{"word":"NDSTs"},{"word":"heparan sulfate"},{"word":"inflammatory response"},{"word":"periodontitis"},{"word":"syndecans"}]},"article307":{"pmid":"31611714","title":"A thin-film extensional flow model for biofilm expansion by sliding motility.","abs":"In the presence of glycoproteins, bacterial and yeast biofilms are hypothesized to expand by sliding motility.

Variants in A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin (ltx) were created, labeled, inoculated, and compared with their progenitor strain for in vivo colonization. Samples of tooth-related plaque were assessed for colonization at baseline and after debridement and inoculation of labeled strains.

Ltx-hyperproducing strains colonized with greater prevalence and at higher levels than wild type or ltx mutants (P = 0.05).

Increased attachment can be linked to ltx gene expression and up-regulation of adherence-associated genes.

Five unique C. difficile strains embedded in three different biofilm types grown for 72 or 120 h were exposed to seven different hospital disinfectants. C. difficile abundance [as log(number of CFU/milliliter)] was calculated after manufacturer-determined contact times along with biofilm biomass and microscopy.

C. difficile vegetative cells and spores were recovered from biofilms regardless of the type of biofilm growth or biofilm growth time. No disinfectant was able to completely eliminate C. difficile from the biofilms. Overall, Clorox, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), and Virex were most effective at killing C. difficile spores regardless of biofilm age, ribotype, or wash conditions (whether biofilms are washed or unwashed) (P = 0.001, each). Clorox and OPA were also effective at killing total vegetative cell growth (P = 0.001, each), but Virex was found to be ineffective against vegetative cell growth in biofilms (P = 0.77).

The layer's softness responds to the environment. Both negative potentials of the electrode (the equivalent of suffocation) and lack of nutrient supply (the equivalent of starvation) were studied. For comprehensive analysis, torsional resonators operating on three different modes of vibration are suited best. Such data can be fitted with a viscoelastic model, leading to a quantitative estimate of the shear modulus. On a more empirical level, one might also use the ratio of the shift in bandwidth to the negative shift in frequency as an indicator of stress.

In this study, we studied the acute effects (3 h of exposure) of polystyrene beads (PS, with diameter range from 100 nm to 9 μm) on five biological endpoints targeting community and ecosystem-level processes in biofilms: chlorophyll a, photosynthetic yield, and three extracellular enzyme activities. The results showed that the large size PS beads (500 nm, 1 μm, and 9 μm) exhibited negligible effects on the determined biological endpoints in biofilms within the range of concentrations (5-100 mg/L) in this study. However, high concentration of PS beads (100 nm, 100 mg/L) significantly decreased the content of chlorophyll a, and the functional enzyme activities of β-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase, suggesting negative effects on the carbon and nitrogen cycling of freshwater biofilms. Moreover, the influences of PS NPs (100 nm) on biofilms strongly depended on the surface modification of PS particles, with the positively charged PS NPs (amide-modified) exhibiting the highest toxicity to biofilms. The excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this study indicated oxidative stress induced by PS NPs, which might lead to the observed nano-toxic effects on biofilms.

One such mechanism by which bacteria regulate their physiology during infection of a host is through a process known as quorum sensing (QS). Bacteria use QS to regulate community-wide gene expression in response to changes in population density. In order to sense these changes in population density, bacteria produce, secrete and detect small molecules called autoinducers. The most common signals detected by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are acylated homoserine lactones and autoinducing peptides (AIPs), respectively. However, increasing evidence has supported a role for the small molecule nitric oxide (NO) in influencing QS-mediated group behaviors like bioluminescence, biofilm production, and virulence. In this review, we discuss three bacteria that have an established role for NO in influencing bacterial physiology through QS circuits. In two Vibrio species, NO has been shown to affect QS pathways upon coordination of hemoprotein sensors. Further, NO has been demonstrated to serve a protective role against staphylococcal pneumonia through S-nitrosylation of a QS regulator of virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Ilana Heckler"},{"name":"Elizabeth M Boon"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gas sensing"},{"word":"hemoproteins"},{"word":"nitric oxide"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article327":{"pmid":"31608020","title":"DropSOAC: Stabilizing Microfluidic Drops for Time-Lapse Quantification of Single-Cell Bacterial Physiology.","abs":"The physiological heterogeneity of cells within a microbial population imparts resilience to stresses such as antimicrobial treatments and nutrient limitation. This resilience is partially due to a subpopulation of cells that can survive such stresses and regenerate the community. Microfluidic approaches now provide a means to study microbial physiology and bacterial heterogeneity at the single cell level, improving our ability to isolate and examine these subpopulations. Drop-based microfluidics provides a high-throughput approach to study individual cell physiology within bacterial populations. Using this approach, single cells are isolated from the population and encapsulated in growth medium dispersed in oil using a 15 μm diameter drop making microfluidic device. The drops are arranged as a packed monolayer inside a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device. Growth of thousands of individual cells in identical microenvironments can then be imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). A challenge for this approach has been the maintenance of drop stability during extended time-lapse imaging. In particular, the drops do not maintain their volume over time during incubation in PDMS devices, due to fluid transport into the porous PDMS surroundings. Here, we present a strategy for PDMS device preparation that stabilizes drop position and volume within a drop array on a microfluidic chip for over 20 h. The stability of water-in-oil drops is maintained by soaking the device in a reservoir containing both water and oil in thermodynamic equilibrium. This ensures that phase equilibrium of the drop emulsion fluids within the porous PDMS material is maintained during drop incubation and imaging. We demonstrate the utility of this approach, which we label DropSOAC (Drop Stabilization On A Chip), for time-lapse studies of bacterial growth. We characterize growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its Δhpf mutant derivative during resuscitation and growth following starvation. We demonstrate that growth rate and lag time heterogeneity of hundreds of individual bacterial cells can be determined starting from single isolated cells. The results show that the DropSOAC capsule provides a high-throughput approach toward studies of microbial physiology at the single cell level, and can be used to characterize physiological differences of cells from within a larger population.","authors":[{"name":"Shawna L Pratt"},{"name":"Geoffrey K Zath"},{"name":"Tatsuya Akiyama"},{"name":"Kerry S Williamson"},{"name":"Michael J Franklin"},{"name":"Connie B Chang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"drop-based microfluidics"},{"word":"emulsion stability"},{"word":"growth rate"},{"word":"heterogeneity"},{"word":"lag time"},{"word":"single cell"},{"word":"time-lapse imaging"}]},"article328":{"pmid":"31608018","title":"Geobacter Protein Nanowires.","abs":"The study of electrically conductive protein nanowires in Geobacter sulfurreducens has led to new concepts for long-range extracellular electron transport, as well as for the development of sustainable conductive materials and electronic devices with novel functions. Until recently, electrically conductive pili (e-pili), assembled from the PilA pilin monomer, were the only known Geobacter protein nanowires. However, filaments comprised of the multi-heme c-type cytochrome, OmcS, are present in some preparations of G. sulfurreducens outer-surface proteins. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the available evidence on the in vivo expression of e-pili and OmcS filaments and their biological function. Abundant literature demonstrates that G. sulfurreducens expresses e-pili, which are required for long-range electron transport to Fe (III) oxides and through conductive biofilms. In contrast, there is no definitive evidence yet that wild-type G. sulfurreducens express long filaments of OmcS extending from the cells, and deleting the gene for OmcS actually increases biofilm conductivity. The literature does not support the concern that many previous studies on e-pili were mistakenly studying OmcS filaments. For example, heterologous expression of the aromatic-rich pilin monomer of Geobacter metallireducens in G. sulfurreducens increases the conductivity of individual nanowires more than 5,000-fold, whereas expression of an aromatic-poor pilin reduced conductivity more than 1,000-fold. This more than million-fold range in nanowire conductivity was achieved while maintaining the 3-nm diameter characteristic of e-pili. Purification methods that eliminate all traces of OmcS yield highly conductive e-pili, as does heterologous expression of the e-pilin monomer in microbes that do not produce OmcS or any other outer-surface cytochromes. Future studies of G. sulfurreducens expression of protein nanowires need to be cognizant of the importance of maintaining environmentally relevant growth conditions because artificial laboratory culture conditions can rapidly select against e-pili expression. Principles derived from the study of e-pili have enabled identification of non-cytochrome protein nanowires in diverse bacteria and archaea. A similar search for cytochrome appendages is warranted. Both e-pili and OmcS filaments offer design options for the synthesis of protein-based green electronics, which may be the primary driving force for the study of these structures in the near future.","authors":[{"name":"Derek R Lovley"},{"name":"David J F Walker"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biomaterials"},{"word":"cytochrome"},{"word":"electromicrobiology"},{"word":"electron transfer"},{"word":"pili"}]},"article329":{"pmid":"31608016","title":"Shear Stress as a Major Driver of Marine Biofilm Communities in the NW Mediterranean Sea.","abs":"While marine biofilms depend on environmental conditions and substrate, little is known about the influence of hydrodynamic forces.

In addition, different artificial surfaces designed to hamper cell attachment (self-polishing coating: SPC; and fouling-release coating: FRC) were compared to inert plastic. Prokaryotic community composition was affected by immersion mode, surface characteristics and site. Rhodobacteriaceae and Flavobacteriaceae dominated the biofilm community structure, with distinct genera according to surface type or immersion mode. Cell density increased with time, greatly limited by hydrodynamic forces, and supposed to delay biofilm maturation. After 1 year, a significant impact of shear stress on the taxonomic structure of the prokaryotic community developed on each surface type was observed. When surfaces contained no biocides, roughness and wettability shaped prokaryotic community structure, which was not enhanced by shear stress. Conversely, the biocidal effect of SPC surfaces, already major in static immersion mode, was amplified by the 15 knots speed. The biofilm community on SPC was 60% dissimilar to the biofilm on the other surfaces and was distinctly colonized by Sphingomonadaceae ((Alter)Erythrobacter). At Banyuls, prokaryotic community structures were more similar between the four surfaces tested than at Toulon, due possibly to a masking effect of environmental constraints, especially hydrodynamic, which was greater than in Toulon. Finally, predicted functions such as cell adhesion confirmed some of the hypotheses drawn regarding biofilm formation over the artificial surfaces tested here.","authors":[{"name":"Elisa C P Catão"},{"name":"Thomas Pollet"},{"name":"Benjamin Misson"},{"name":"Cédric Garnier"},{"name":"Jean-Francois Ghiglione"},{"name":"Raphaëlle Barry-Martinet"},{"name":"Marine Maintenay"},{"name":"Christine Bressy"},{"name":"Jean-François Briand"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Sphingomonadaceae"},{"word":"artificial surface"},{"word":"hydrodynamic"},{"word":"marine microbiome"},{"word":"multi-species biofilm"}]},"article330":{"pmid":"31607727","title":"Antibacterial activity of Salvadora persica against oral pathogenic bacterial isolates.","abs":"The objective was to determine the antibacterial activity of Salvadora persica extract against bacteria isolated from dental plaque of patients.","authors":[{"name":"M A Khalil"},{"name":"M S El-Sabbagh"},{"name":"E B El Naggar"},{"name":"R H El-Erian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial activity"},{"word":"Salvadora persica"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Streptococcus spp"},{"word":"gas chromatography-mass spectrometry"},{"word":"high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry"},{"word":"plaque-induced gingivitis"}]},"article331":{"pmid":"31607578","title":"Uranium bioremediation by acid phosphatase activity of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms: Can a foe turn a friend?","abs":"In this study, Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, which are considered a foe for being pathogenic, were tested for their uranium bioremediation capacity to find out if they can turn out to be a friend.

Bacterial twitching is important for initial bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. The existing research about bacteria twitching is largely experimental orientated. There is a lack of models of twitching motility of bacteria in shear flows, which could provide fundamental understanding about how bacterial twitching would be affected by bacteria associated properties such as number of pili and their distribution on the cell body and environmental factors such as flow and surface patterns. In this work, a three-dimensional modelling approach of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) coupled with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) proposed to study bacterial twitching on flat and groove surfaces under shear flow conditions. Rod-shaped bacteria are modelled as groups of spherical particles and Type IV pili attached to bacteria are modelled as dynamic springs which can elongate, retract, attach and detach. The CFD-DEM model of rod-shape bacteria is validated against orbiting of immotile bacteria in shear flows. The effects of fluid flow rate and surface topography on twitching motility are studied. The model can successfully predict upstream twitching motility of rod-shaped bacteria in shear flows. Our model can predict that there would be an optimal range of wall shear stress in which bacterial upstream twitching is most efficient. The results also indicate that when bacteria twitch on groove surfaces, they are likely to accumulate around the downstream side of the groove walls.","authors":[{"name":"Pahala Gedara Jayathilake"},{"name":"Bowen Li"},{"name":"Paolo Zuliani"},{"name":"Tom Curtis"},{"name":"Jinju Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article354":{"pmid":"31601671","title":"Complete Genome Sequence of Megaplasmid-Bearing Streptococcus salivarius Strain LAB813, Isolated from the Dental Plaque of a Caries-Free Child.","abs":"Streptococcus salivarius strain LAB813 was isolated from the dental plaque biofilm of a caries-free child with healthy oral tissues.

As surfaces, hydrophobized silicon wafers were used that were etched to exhibit surface structures in the same size range as the bacterial cell wall molecules. The surface structures were characterized by a detailed morphometric analysis based on Minkowski functionals revealing both qualitatively similar features and quantitatively different extensions. We find that as the size of the nanostructures increases, the adhesion forces decrease in a way that can be quantified by the area of the surface that is available for the tethering of cell wall molecules. In addition, we observe a bactericidal effect, which is more pronounced on substrates with taller structures but does not influence adhesion. Our results can be used for a targeted development of 3D-structured materials for/against bio-adhesion.

Indeed, nucleotide levels were elevated and strengthened ciprofloxacin resistance. Quorum sensing (QS) genes were upregulated in the early growth phase, thus potentially improving survival. Further, a thicker cell wall potentially serves as a stronger barrier and reduces drug permeation. The aforementioned three drug resistance levels displayed continuity and differences; the low-resistant level displayed no prominent mechanism; medium, a more focused change in nucleotide metabolism; and high, a thorough evolution to a complete systematic mechanism with higher adenosine 5'-triphosphate levels, serving as a defense mechanism for reducing drug-induced stress.

The S. mutans Cid/Lrg system likely contributes to tolerating stresses encountered in this environment as cid and/or lrg mutants exhibit altered oxidative stress sensitivity, genetic competence, and biofilm phenotypes. It was recently noted that the cidB mutant had two stable colony morphologies: a rough phenotype (similar to wild type) and a smooth phenotype. In our previously published work, the cidB rough mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, and RNAseq identified widespread transcriptomic changes in central carbon metabolism and oxidative stress response genes. In this current report, we conducted Illumina-based genome resequencing of wild type, cidB rough, and cidB smooth mutants and compared their resistance to oxidative and acid stress, biofilm formation, and competence phenotypes. Both cidB mutants exhibited comparable aerobic growth inhibition on agar plates, during planktonic growth, and in the presence of 1 mM hydrogen peroxide. The cidB smooth mutant displayed a significant competence defect in BHI, which was rescuable by synthetic CSP. Both cidB mutants also displayed reduced XIP-mediated competence, although this reduction was more pronounced in the cidB smooth mutant. Anaerobic biofilms of the cidB smooth mutant displayed increased propidium iodide staining, but corresponding biofilm CFU data suggest this phenotype is due to cell damage and not increased cell death. The cidB rough anaerobic biofilms showed altered structure relative to wild type (reduced biomass and average thickness) which correlated with decreased CFU counts. Sequencing data revealed that the cidB smooth mutant has a unique loss of read coverage of ~78 kb of DNA, corresponding to the genomic island TnSMU2 and genes flanking its 3' end.

The response regulator ArlR consists of a C-terminal DNA-binding effector domain and an N-terminal receiver domain that is phosphorylated by ArlS, the cognate transmembrane sensor histidine kinase. We demonstrate that the receiver domain of ArlR adopts the canonical α5β5 response regulator assembly, which dimerizes upon activation, using beryllium trifluoride as an aspartate phosphorylation mimic. Activated ArlR recognizes a 20-bp imperfect inverted repeat sequence in the ica operon, which is involved in intercellular adhesion polysaccharide production. Crystal structures of the inactive and activated forms reveal that activation induces a significant conformational change in the β4-α4 and β5-α5-connecting loops, in which the α4 and α5 helices constitute the homodimerization interface. Crystal structures of the DNA-binding ArlR effector domain indicate that it is able to dimerize via a non-canonical β1-β2 hairpin domain swapping, raising the possibility of a new mechanism for signal transduction from the receiver domain to effector domain.

In this context, recent theoretical studies suggest that an environment containing both resources and toxic waste can promote the emergence of complex, spatially distributed proto-organisms exhibiting division of labour and higher-scale features beyond the cell-cell pairwise interactions. Some previous non-spatial models suggest that the presence of a growth inhibitor can trigger the coexistence of competitive species in an antibiotic-resistance context. In this paper, we further explore this idea using both mathematical and computational models taking the most fundamental features of the proto-organisms model interactions.

However, IV catheters are also prone to blood clotting at the point of insertion and infection by formation of robust bacterial biofilms on their surface. Nitric oxide (NO) is ideally suited to counteract both of these problems, due to its antimicrobial properties and its ability to inhibit platelet activation/aggregation. One way to equip catheters with NO releasing properties is by electrocatalytic nitrite reduction to NO by copper complexes in a multi-lumen configuration. In this work, we systematically investigate six closely related Cu(II) BMPA- and BEPA-carboxylate complexes (BMPA = bis-(2-methylpyridyl)amine); BEPA = bis-(2-ethylpyridyl)amine), using carboxylate groups of different chain lengths. The corresponding Cu(II) complexes were characterized using UV-Vis, EPR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. Using detailed cyclic voltammetry (CV) and bulk electrocatalyic studies (with real-time NO quantification), in aqueous buffer, pH 7.4, we are able to derive clear reactivity relations between the ligand structures of the complexes, their Faradaic efficiencies for NO generation, their turnover frequencies (TOFs), and their redox potentials. Our results show that the complex [Cu(BEPA-Bu)](OAc) is the best catalyst with a high Faradaic efficiency over large nitrite concentration ranges and the expected best tolerance to oxygen levels. For this species, the more positive redox potential suppresses NO disproportionation, which is a major Achilles heel of the (faster) catalysts with the more negative reduction potentials.","authors":[{"name":"Andrew P Hunt"},{"name":"Allison E Batka"},{"name":"Marjan Hosseinzadeh"},{"name":"Jordan D Gregory"},{"name":"Halima K Haque"},{"name":"Hang Ren"},{"name":"Mark E Meyerhoff"},{"name":"Nicolai Lehnert"}],"keywords":[{"word":"copper nitrite reductase"},{"word":"electrocatalysis"},{"word":"inhaled NO therapy"},{"word":"intravenous catheters"},{"word":"model complexes"},{"word":"modulated NO-release"},{"word":"nitric oxide"},{"word":"nitrite reduction"}]},"article381":{"pmid":"31592330","title":"Improving Water and Nutrient Use Efficiency in Rice by Changing Crop Establishment Methods, Application of Microbial Inoculations, and Zn Fertilization.","abs":"A field experiment was conducted during the wet seasons of 2013 and 2014 to evaluate the effect of three rice establishment methods: viz. puddled transplanted rice (PTR), system of rice intensification (SRI) and aerobic rice system (ARS), two cyanobacteria based inoculants, viz.

In this review, we summarize recent work in identifying specific molecular components that mediate cell-cell interactions and describe metabolic interactions, such as cross-feeding and exchange of electron acceptors and small molecules, that modify the growth and virulence of individual species. We argue, however, that although pairwise interaction models have provided useful information, complex community-like systems are needed to study the properties of oral communities. The networks of multiple synergistic and antagonistic interactions within oral biofilms give rise to the emergent properties of persistence, stability, and long-range spatial structure, with these properties mediating the dysbiotic transitions from health to oral diseases.

Unfortunately, antibiotics frequently fail to control the symptoms of AECRS due to biofilm formation, disruption of the natural microbiota, and arising antibiotic resistance. These issues can potentially be addressed by phage therapy. In this study, the endoscopically-guided cultures were postoperatively obtained from 50 patients in order to explore the microbiology of AECRS, evaluate options for antibiotic treatment, and, most importantly, assess a possibility of efficient phage therapy. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae. Alarmingly, mechanisms of antibiotic resistance were detected in the isolates from 46% of the patients. Bacteria not sensitive to amoxicillin were carried by 28% of the patients. The lowest rates of resistance were noted for fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Fortunately, 60% of the patients carried bacterial strains that were sensitive to bacteriophages from the Biophage Pharma collection and 81% of the antibiotic-resistant strains turned out to be sensitive to bacteriophages. The results showed that microbiology of AECRS is distinct from ABRS and amoxicillin should not be the antibiotic of first choice. Currently available bacteriophages could be used instead of antibiotics or as an adjunct to antibiotics in the majority of patients with AECRS.","authors":[{"name":"Joanna Szaleniec"},{"name":"Agnieszka Gibała"},{"name":"Monika Pobiega"},{"name":"Sylwia Parasion"},{"name":"Jacek Składzień"},{"name":"Paweł Stręk"},{"name":"Tomasz Gosiewski"},{"name":"Maciej Szaleniec"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"exacerbations"},{"word":"phage"},{"word":"rhinosinusitis"}]},"article386":{"pmid":"31590240","title":"Methods Used for the Eradication of Staphylococcal Biofilms.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is considered one of the leading pathogens responsible for community and healthcare-associated infections.

MC degradation can be 'primed' by prior addition of biomass from a non-toxic M. aeruginosa strain. Increased proportions of bacteria with an anaerobic metabolism in M. aeruginosa-fed biofilms suggest that this 'priming' could be due to higher productivity and the resulting changes in habitat conditions. We, therefore, investigated GDM systems amended with the biomass of toxic (WT) or non-toxic (MUT) M. aeruginosa strains, of diatoms (DT), or with starch solution (ST). After 25 days, these treatments were changed to receiving toxic cyanobacterial biomass. MC degradation established significantly more rapidly in MUT and ST than in DT. Oxygen measurements suggested that this was due to oxygen-limited conditions in MUT and ST already prevailing before addition of MC-containing biomass. Moreover, the microbial communities in the initial ST biofilms featured high proportions of facultative anaerobic taxa, whereas aerobes dominated in DT biofilms. Thus, the 'priming' of MC degradation in mature GDM biofilms seems to be related to the prior establishment of oxygen-limited conditions mediated by higher productivity.","authors":[{"name":"Marisa O D Silva"},{"name":"Jakob Pernthaler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"habitat priming"},{"word":"microbial communities"},{"word":"microcystin degradation"},{"word":"oxygen-limited conditions"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"31589240","title":"Metabolomic and proteomic changes induced by growth inhibitory concentrations of copper in the biofilm-forming marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica.","abs":"Copper is an essential element for living cells but this metal is present in some marine environments at such high concentrations that it can be toxic for numerous organisms.

In order to highlight differential adaptation according to the phenotype, the response of P. lipolytica TC8 to copper stress was studied in planktonic and biofilm culture modes under growth inhibitory copper concentrations. As expected, copper exposure led to the induction of defense and detoxification mechanisms. Specific metabolite and protein profiles were thus observed in each condition (planktonic vs. biofilm and control vs. copper-treated cultures). Copper exposure seems to induce drastic changes in the lipid composition of the bacterial cell membrane and to modulate the abundance of proteins functionally known to be involved in copper cell homeostasis in both planktonic and biofilm culture modes. Much more proteins differentially expressed after copper treatment were observed in biofilms than in planktonic cells, which could indicate a more heterogeneous response of biofilm cells to this metallic stress.","authors":[{"name":"Laurie Favre"},{"name":"Annick Ortalo-Magné"},{"name":"Lionel Kerloch"},{"name":"Carole Pichereaux"},{"name":"Benjamin Misson"},{"name":"Jean-François Briand"},{"name":"Cédric Garnier"},{"name":"Gérald Culioli"}],"keywords":[]},"article392":{"pmid":"31589121","title":"Virulence Factors in Sporothrix schenckii, One of the Causative Agents of Sporotrichosis.","abs":"Sporothrix schenckii is one of the etiological agents of sporotrichosis, a fungal infection distributed worldwide.

Although removal of the double bond from acyldepsipeptides generally has a significant negative impact on potency, structural studies revealed that the phenyl ureadepsipeptides can retain potency through the formation of a third hydrogen bond between the urea and the key Tyr63 residue in the ClpP activation domain.

In these groups, cells can collectively generate gradients through the uptake and release of compounds. In turn, individual cells adapt their activities to the environment shaped by the whole group. Here, we studied how these processes can generate phenotypic variation in clonal populations and how this variation contributes to the resilience of the population to antibiotics. We grew two-dimensional populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers where limiting amounts of glucose were supplied from one side. We found that the collective metabolic activity of cells created microscale gradients where nutrient concentration varied over a few cell lengths. As a result, growth rates and gene expression levels varied strongly between neighbouring cells. Furthermore, we found evidence for a metabolic cross-feeding interaction between glucose-fermenting and acetate-respiring subpopulations.

Further microscopic analyses demonstrated that flagella promoted the formation of thicker biofilms and served as biofilm matrix scaffolds to accommodate more extracellular cytochromes with an orderly arrangement, which increased the electron diffusion rate within the biofilm.

Because a neutrophil is too small to engulf the entire aggregate, it must be able to detach and engulf a few bacteria at a time if it is to use phagocytosis to clear the infection. Current research techniques do not provide a method for determining how the success of phagocytosis, here defined as the complete engulfment of a piece of foreign material, depends on the mechanical properties of a larger object from which the piece must be removed before being engulfed. This article presents a step toward such a method. By varying polymer concentration or cross-linking density, the elastic moduli of centimeter-sized gels are varied over the range that was previously measured for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms grown from clinical bacterial isolates. Human neutrophils are isolated from blood freshly drawn from healthy adult volunteers, exposed to gel containing embedded beads for 1 h, and removed from the gel. The percentage of collected neutrophils that contain beads that had previously been within the gels is used to measure successful phagocytic engulfment. Both increased polymer concentration in agarose gels and increased cross-linking density in alginate gels are associated with a decreased success of phagocytic engulfment. Upon plotting the percentage of neutrophils showing successful engulfment as a function of the elastic modulus of the gel to which they were applied, it is found that data from both alginate and agarose gels collapse onto the same curve. This suggests that gel mechanics may be impacting the success of phagocytosis and demonstrates that this experiment is a step toward realizing methods for measuring how the mechanics of a large target, or a large structure in which smaller targets are embedded, impact the success of phagocytic engulfment.","authors":[{"name":"Megan Davis-Fields"},{"name":"Layla A Bakhtiari"},{"name":"Ziyang Lan"},{"name":"Kristin N Kovach"},{"name":"Liyun Wang"},{"name":"Elizabeth M Cosgriff-Hernandez"},{"name":"Vernita D Gordon"}],"keywords":[]},"article402":{"pmid":"31586475","title":"The effect of the sub-minimal inhibitory concentration and the concentrations within resistant mutation window of ciprofloxacin on MIC, swimming motility and biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"To explore the effect of sub-minimal inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) and concentrations within resistant mutation window (MSW) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), swimming motility and biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and also to investigate the correlation between swimming motility and genes expression of lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR and pqsR.","authors":[{"name":"Nan Shi"},{"name":"Yating Gao"},{"name":"Donghong Yin"},{"name":"Yan Song"},{"name":"Jianbang Kang"},{"name":"Xiaoxia Li"},{"name":"Zhiqi Zhang"},{"name":"Xinyuan Feng"},{"name":"Jinju Duan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Ciprofloxacin"},{"word":"MSW"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Swimming motility"}]},"article403":{"pmid":"31586133","title":"Automated Platform for Long-Term Culture and High-Content Phenotyping of Single C. elegans Worms.","abs":"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a suitable model organism in drug screening.

Using reconstituted assemblages, from pairs to all 6 members, community biofilm formation was observed to be robust to the absence of any single species and only removal of the C. gleum/S. paucimobilis pair, out of all 15 possible 2-species subtractions, led to loss of community biofilm formation. In conjunction with these findings, dual-species biofilm formation assays supported the view that the contribution of C. gleum to community biofilm formation was dependent on synergistic biofilm formation with either R. insidiosa or C. metallidurans. These data support a model of multiple, partially redundant species interactions to generate robustness in biofilm formation. A bacteriophage and multiple predatory bacteria were used to test the resilience of the community to the removal of individual members in situ, but the combination of precise and substantial depletion of a single target species was not achievable.

However, low-dose antibiotic therapy is a complicated challenge for eradicating biofilms as hundreds (even thousands) of times higher concentrations of antibiotics are needed than killing planktonic bacteria. Polymer vesicles may solve these problems via effective antibiotic delivery into biofilms, but traditional single corona vesicles lack the multifunctionalities essential for biofilm eradication. In this paper, we aim to effectively treat biofilm-induced periodontitis using much lower concentrations of antibiotics than traditional antibiotic therapy by designing a multifunctional dual corona vesicle with intrinsic antibacterial and enhanced antibiotic delivery capabilities. This vesicle is co-assembled from two block copolymers, poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(lysine-stat-phenylalanine) [PCL-b-P(Lys-stat-Phe)] and poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) [PEO-b-PCL]. Both PEO and P(Lys-stat-Phe) coronas have their specific functions: PEO endows vesicles with protein repelling ability to penetrate extracellular polymeric substances in biofilms (stealthy coronas), whereas P(Lys-stat-Phe) provides vesicles with positive charges and broad spectrum intrinsic antibacterial activity. As a result, the dosage of antibiotics can be reduced by 50% when encapsulated in the dual corona vesicles to eradicate Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, effective in vivo treatment has been achieved from a rat periodontitis model, as confirmed by significantly reduced dental plaque, and alleviated inflammation. Overall, this stealthy and antibacterial dual corona vesicle demonstrates a fresh insight for improving the antibiofilm efficiency of antibiotics and combating the serious threat of biofilm-associated diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Yuejing Xi"},{"name":"Yue Wang"},{"name":"Jingyi Gao"},{"name":"Yufen Xiao"},{"name":"Jianzhong Du"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"co-assembly"},{"word":"drug delivery"},{"word":"periodontitis"},{"word":"plaque biofilm"},{"word":"polymer vesicles"},{"word":"self-assembly"}]},"article409":{"pmid":"31584891","title":"Effect of 5 Popular Disinfection Methods on Microflora of Laboratory: Customized Implant Abutments.","abs":"To compare the efficacy of 5 different decontamination methods of titanium abutments and to assess their possible effects on surface roughness of titanium.","authors":[{"name":"Ali Homayouni"},{"name":"Abbas Bahador"},{"name":"Mohammad Moharrami"},{"name":"Maryam Pourhajibagher"},{"name":"Amir Alireza Rasouli-Ghahroudi"},{"name":"Marzieh Alikhasi"}],"keywords":[]},"article410":{"pmid":"31584765","title":"Methicillin resistance and biofilm production in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in México","abs":"Introduction: Infections associated with health care caused by S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci multi-resistant to antibiotics cause a high epidemiological impact due to their high morbidity and mortality.

Within this research, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their analogues are being intensively investigated due to their promising antimicrobial activities. The main goal of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of short cationic lipopeptides that were designed to imitate the features of AMPs responsible for antimicrobial activities: positive net charge and amphipacity. The positive charge of the molecules results from the presence of basic amino acid residues: arginine and lysine. Amphipacity is provided by the introduction of decanoic, dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, and hexadecanoic acid chains to the molecules.

However, how soil carbon, nutrient availability and nutrient ratios drive the phototrophic biofilm community and its contribution to phosphorus cycling is largely unknown. A large scale field investigation in Chinese paddy fields reported here shows that soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) contents rather than soil total phosphorus (STP) triggered phosphorus immobilization of paddy biofilms, as they changed algal diversity and EPS production. High C: P and N: P ratios favored phosphorus immobilization in biofilm biomass via increasing the abundance of green algae. The C: N ratio on the other hand had only a weak effect on phosphorus immobilization, being counteracted by SOC or STN. Results from this study reveal how the in-situ interception of phosphorus in paddy fields is driven by soil carbon, nutrient availability and nutrient ratios and provide practical information on how to reduce runoff losses of phosphorus by regulating SOC and STN contents.","authors":[{"name":"Junzhuo Liu"},{"name":"Pengfei Sun"},{"name":"Rui Sun"},{"name":"Sichu Wang"},{"name":"Bo Gao"},{"name":"Jun Tang"},{"name":"Yonghong Wu"},{"name":"Jan Dolfing"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algal diversity"},{"word":"C: P"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"N: P"},{"word":"P loss"}]},"article429":{"pmid":"31580958","title":"Antimicrobial activity of apitoxin from Apis mellifera in Salmonella enterica strains isolated from poultry and its effects on motility, biofilm formation and gene expression.","abs":"Salmonella is a major global food-borne pathogen. One of the main concerns related to Salmonella and other food-borne pathogens is their capacity to acquire antimicrobial resistance and produce biofilms. Due to the increased resistance to common antimicrobials used to treat livestock animals and human infections, the discovery of new antimicrobial substances is one of the main challenges in microbiological research. An additional challenge is the development of new methods and substances to inhibit and destruct biofilms. We determined the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of apitoxin in 16 Salmonella strains isolated from poultry. In addition, the effect of apitoxin on Salmonella motility and the expression of biofilm- and virulence-related genes was evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of apitoxin ranged from 1,024-256 μg/mL, with 512 μg/mL being the most common. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of apitoxin significantly reduced biofilm formation in 14 of the 16 Salmonella strains tested, with significant increases in motility. MIC concentrations of apitoxin destroyed the pre-formed biofilm by 27.66-68.22% (47.00% ± 10.91). The expression of biofilm- and virulence-related genes and small RNAs was differentially regulated according to the strain and the presence of apitoxin. The transcription of the small RNAs dsrA and csrB, related to antimicrobial resistance, was upregulated in the presence of apitoxin. We suggest that apitoxin is a potential antimicrobial substance that could be used in combination with other substances to develop new drugs and sanitizers against food-borne pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Vicente Arteaga"},{"name":"Alexandre Lamas"},{"name":"Patricia Regal"},{"name":"Beatriz Vázquez"},{"name":"José Manuel Miranda"},{"name":"Alberto Cepeda"},{"name":"Carlos Manuel Franco"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"Apitoxin"},{"word":"Bee"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Gene expression"},{"word":"Motility"},{"word":"Salmonella"}]},"article430":{"pmid":"31580954","title":"Synthesis of sandwich-structured silver@polydopamine@silver shells with enhanced antibacterial activities.","abs":"The unique antibacterial characteristics of Ag nanomaterials offer a wide potential range of applications, but achieving rapid and durable antibacterial efficacy is challenging.

All samples were characterized by different colors but were all of polyethylene; IR and DSC analyses identified different level of degradation, while FT-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence further assessed the degradation level and the presence of pigments. Each plastic type harbored distinct bacterial communities from the others, in agreement with the differences highlighted by the physico-chemical analyses. Furthermore, the most degraded polyethylene films were found to host a bacterial community more similar to the surrounding soil as revealed by both α- and β-diversity NGS analyses.

A survey of 132 MRSA genomes assembled from long reads enabled detailed characterization of an outbreak lasting several months of a CC5/ST105/USA100 clone among 18 infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Available hospital-wide genome surveillance data traced the origins of the outbreak to three patients admitted to adult wards during a 4-month period preceding the NICU outbreak. The pattern of changes among complete outbreak genomes provided full spatiotemporal resolution of its progression, which was characterized by multiple subtransmissions and likely precipitated by equipment sharing between adults and infants. Compared to other hospital strains, the outbreak strain carried distinct mutations and accessory genetic elements that impacted genes with roles in metabolism, resistance, and persistence. This included a DNA recognition domain recombination in the hsdS gene of a type I restriction modification system that altered DNA methylation. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) profiling showed that the (epi)genetic changes in the outbreak clone attenuated agr gene expression and upregulated genes involved in stress response and biofilm formation.
