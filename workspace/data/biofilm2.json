Adhesion to streptococci is driven by interaction of the minor fimbrial antigen (Mfa1) with streptococcal antigen I/II. We identified the region of antigen I/II required for this interaction and developed small molecule mimetics that inhibited P. gingivalis adherence. However, the functional motifs of Mfa1 involved in the interaction with antigen I/II remain uncharacterized. A series of N- and C-terminal peptide fragments of Mfa1 were expressed and tested for inhibition of P. gingivalis adherence to S. gordonii. This approach identified residues 225-400 of Mfa1 as essential for P. gingivalis adherence. Using the three-dimensional structure of Mfa1, a putative binding cleft was identified using SiteMap and five small molecule mimetics could dock in this site. Site-specific mutation of residues in the predicted cleft, including R240A, W275A, D321A and A357P inhibited the interaction of Mfa1 with streptococci, whereas mutation of residues not in the predicted cleft (V238A, I252F and ΔK253) had no effect. Complementation of an Mfa1-deficient P. gingivalis strain with wild-type mfa1 restored adherence to streptococci, whereas complementation with full-length mfa1 containing the R240A or A357P mutations did not restore adherence. The mutations did not affect polymerization of Mfa1, suggesting that the complemented strains produced intact minor fimbriae. These results identified specific residues and structural motifs required for the Mfa1-antigen I/II interaction and will facilitate the design of small molecule therapeutics to prevent P. gingivalis colonization of the oral cavity.","authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Roky"},{"name":"John O Trent"},{"name":"Donald R Demuth"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. gingivalis"},{"word":"Mfa1"},{"word":"adherence"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"streptococci"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"31994223","title":"Antibacterial, antibiofilm, and antiquorum sensing activities of phytosynthesized silver nanoparticles fabricated from Mespilus germanica extract against multidrug resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical strains.","abs":"The aim of the present work was to investigate the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and antiquorum sensing activities of phytosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) fabricated from Mespilus germanica extract against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae strains.

Its ability to form biofilms, which exhibit high tolerance to antifungal treatments, has been considered as an important virulence factor. However, the mechanisms involving antifungal resistance in biofilms and the impact of host niche environments on these processes are still poorly defined. In this study, we performed a whole-transcriptome analysis of C. glabrata biofilm cells exposed to different environmental conditions and constraints in order to identify the molecular pathways involved in fluconazole resistance and understand how acidic pH niches, associated with the presence of acetic acid, are able to modulate these responses. We show that fluconazole treatment induces gene expression reprogramming in a carbon source and pH-dependent manner. This is particularly relevant for a set of genes involved in DNA replication, ergosterol, and ubiquinone biosynthesis. We also provide additional evidence that the loss of mitochondrial function is associated with fluconazole resistance, independently of the growth condition. Lastly, we propose that C. glabrata Mge1, a cochaperone involved in iron metabolism and protein import into the mitochondria, is a key regulator of fluconazole susceptibility during carbon and pH adaptation by reducing the metabolic flux towards toxic sterol formation. These new findings suggest that different host microenvironments influence directly the physiology of C. glabrata, with implications on how this pathogen responds to antifungal treatment.

This system regulates behaviors including but not limited to virulence and biofilm formation. We focused on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human opportunistic pathogen that is involved in acute and chronic lung infections and which disproportionately affects people with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa infections are becoming increasingly challenging to treat with the spread of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, QS disruption approaches, known as quorum quenching, are appealing due to their potential to control the virulence of resistant strains. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa is known to simultaneously utilize two main QS circuits, one based on C4-AHL, the other with 3-oxo-C12-AHL. Here, we evaluated the effects of signal disruption on 39 cystic fibrosis clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, including drug resistant strains. We used two enzymes capable of degrading AHLs, known as lactonases, with distinct substrate preference: one degrading 3-oxo-C12-AHL, the other degrading both C4-AHL and 3-oxo-C12-AHL. Two lactonases were used to determine the effects of signal disruption on the clinical isolates, and to evaluate the importance of the QS circuits by measuring effects on virulence factors (elastase, protease, and pyocyanin) and biofilm formation. Signal disruption results in at least one of these factors being inhibited for most isolates (92%). Virulence factor activity or production were inhibited by up to 100% and biofilm was inhibited by an average of 2.3 fold. Remarkably, the treatments led to distinct inhibition profiles of the isolates; the treatment with the lactonase degrading both signaling molecules resulted in a higher fraction of inhibited isolates (77% vs. 67%), and the simultaneous inhibition of more virulence factors per strain (2 vs. 1.5). This finding suggests that the lactonase AHL preference is key to its inhibitory spectrum and is an essential parameter to improve quorum quenching strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Kathleen Mahan"},{"name":"Ryan Martinmaki"},{"name":"Isabel Larus"},{"name":"Rakesh Sikdar"},{"name":"Jordan Dunitz"},{"name":"Mikael Elias"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"lactonase"},{"word":"quorum quenching"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"signaling"}]},"article10":{"pmid":"31993033","title":"Water Flow and Light Availability Influence on Intracellular Geosmin Production in River Biofilms.","abs":"Hydro-morphological alterations in water bodies caused by climate change and human activities affects the ecosystem functioning and generate important water quality problems. Some of these alterations can generate an increase in cyanobacterial blooms, which are associated with the appearance of bad taste and odorous compounds such as geosmin. The factors that trigger their production are still unclear, and this inability to predict geosmin episodes provokes economic problems for water supply companies. This study aims to evaluate the effects of water flow and light availability on biofilm development and intracellular geosmin formation. A mesocosm experiment was performed between February-April, 2019. The mesocosms were a set of 10 outdoor 3 m long flumes, with a continuous water supply from the Ter river (Catalonia, NE Spain). Two light intensities were established: natural light and light reduced to 80%, combined with five gradual water flows from 0.09 to 1.10 L/s. Water samples were taken to analyze nutrients, and biofilm samples, to analyze geosmin concentration, chlorophyll a and the community. Geosmin in biofilm was detected in those treatments in which Oscillatoria sp. appeared. The concentration of intracellular geosmin was higher at lower water flows (0.09 and 0.18 L/s), and the highest (2.12 mg/g) was found in the flume with the lowest water flow (0.09 L/s) and irradiation (20%). This flume was the one that presented a greater concentration of Oscillatoria sp. (21% of the community). It stands out that, when geosmin in biofilm was found, the dissolved inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus ratio decreased, from an average of 417:1 to 14:1. This was mainly due to an increase in inorganic phosphorus concentration generated by a change in the nutrient uptake capacity of the community's biofilm. The results obtained in this study indicated the potential implications for stream ecosystem management to control geosmin appearance. Likewise, they could be used as an early warning system, establishing that in times of drought, which lead to a general decrease in river water flow, the situation could be optimal for the appearance and development of geosmin producing cyanobacteria in low-flow areas near the river banks.","authors":[{"name":"Carmen Espinosa"},{"name":"Meritxell Abril"},{"name":"Helena Guasch"},{"name":"Núria Pou"},{"name":"Lorenzo Proia"},{"name":"Marta Ricart"},{"name":"Marc Ordeix"},{"name":"Laia Llenas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"geosmin"},{"word":"light availability"},{"word":"mesocosms"},{"word":"water flow"}]},"article11":{"pmid":"31992930","title":"Effects of powdered rifampin and vancomycin solutions on biofilm production of staphylococcus aureus on orthopedic implants.","abs":"Hardware infections in orthopedic surgery, specifically those involving biofilm producing bacteria, are troublesome and are highly resistant to systemic antibiotics.

Breaking down the matrix renders biofilms more susceptible to physical disruption and to treatments such as antibiotics. Different species of bacteria, and different strains within the same species, produce different types of matrix polymers. This suggests that targeting specific polymers for disruption may be more effective than nonspecific approaches to disrupting biofilm matrixes. In this study, we treated Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms with enzymes that are specific to different matrix polymers. We measured the resulting alteration in biofilm mechanics using bulk rheology and changes in structure using electron microscopy. We find that, for biofilms grown in vitro, the effect of enzymatic treatment is greatest when the enzyme is specific to a dominant matrix polymer. Specifically matched enzymatic treatment tends to reduce yield strain and yield stress and increase the rate of biofilm drying, due to increased diffusivity as a result of network compromise. Electron micrographs qualitatively suggest that well-matched enzymatic treatments reduce long-range structure and shorten connecting network fibers. Previous work has shown that generic glycoside hydrolases can cause dispersal of bacteria from in vivo and ex vivo biofilms into a free-swimming state, and thereby make antibiotic treatment more effective. For biofilms grown in wounded mice, we find that well-matched treatments that result in the greatest mechanical compromise in vitro induce the least dispersal ex vivo. Moreover, we find that generic glycoside hydrolases have no measurable effect on the mechanics of biofilms grown in vitro, while previous work has shown them to be highly effective at inducing dispersal in vivo and ex vivo. This highlights the possibility that effective approaches to eradicating biofilms may depend strongly on the growth environment.","authors":[{"name":"Kristin N Kovach"},{"name":"Derek Fleming"},{"name":"Marilyn J Wells"},{"name":"Kendra P Rumbaugh"},{"name":"Vernita Diane Gordon"}],"keywords":[]},"article17":{"pmid":"31990521","title":"Purposely Designed Hierarchical Porous Electrodes for High Rate Microbial Electrosynthesis of Acetate from Carbon Dioxide.","abs":"Carbon-based products are crucial to our society, but their production from fossil-based carbon is unsustainable.

Therefore, this study examined the effectiveness of Lp.LTA on disrupting mature Enterococcus faecalis biofilms, and on enhancing the effects of endodontic medicaments. LTA was purified from L. plantarum through butanol extraction followed by hydrophobic and ion-exchange chromatography. E. faecalis biofilms were formed over 3 weeks on glass bottom dishes and in dentin blocks obtained from human single-rooted premolars.

In this study, human and sheep isolates of P. mirabilis were investigated for antibiotic sensitivity using an antibiotic disk test.

The isolated pathogens were sensitive to 30 μg of amikacin and 5 μg of ciprofloxacin but resistant to other tested antibiotics. After 24 h, auto-aggregation of B. amyloliquefaciens B-1895 was at 89.5% and higher than auto-aggregation of B. subtilis KATMIRA1933 (59.5%).

Recent analyses suggest Pel production proceeds via a synthase-dependent polysaccharide secretion pathway, which in Gram-negative bacteria is defined by an outer-membrane β-barrel porin, a periplasmic tetratricopeptide repeat-containing scaffold protein, and an inner-membrane-embedded synthase. Polymerization is catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase domain of the synthase component of these systems, which is allosterically regulated by cyclic-3',5'-dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). However, while the outer-membrane and periplasmic components of the Pel system have been characterized, the inner membrane complex required for Pel polymerization has yet to be defined. To address this, we examined over 500 pel gene clusters from diverse species of Proteobacteria. This analysis identified an invariant set of four syntenic genes, three of which, PelD, PelE and PelG, are predicted to reside within the inner-membrane while the fourth, PelF, contains a glycosyltransferase domain. Using a combination of gene deletion analysis, sub-cellular fractionation, co-immunoprecipitation, and bacterial two-hybrid assays, we provide evidence for the existence of an inner-membrane complex of PelD, PelE, and PelG. Furthermore, we show that this complex interacts with PelF in order to facilitate its localization to the inner-membrane. Mutations that abolish c-di-GMP binding to the known receptor domain of PelD had no effect on complex formation, suggesting that c-di-GMP binding stimulates Pel production through quaternary structural rearrangements.

The fundamental understanding of membrane biofouling is limited despite years of research, as the means of microbial interactions and response to the conditions on the membrane surface are complicated. Here, we discuss studies that investigated the microbial diversity of fouled high-pressure membranes. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene have shown that Burkholderiales, Pseudomonadales, Rhizobiales, Sphingomonadales and Xanthomonadales frequently obtain a high relative abundance on fouled membranes. The bacterial communities present in the diverse feed water types and in pre-treatment compartments are different from the communities on the membrane, because high-pressure membrane filtration provides a selective environment for certain bacterial groups. The biofilms that form within the pre-treatment compartments do not commonly serve as an inoculum for the subsequent high-pressure membranes. Besides bacteria also fungi are detected in the water treatment compartments. In contrast to bacteria, the fungal community does not change much throughout membrane cleaning. The stable fungal diversity indicates that they are more significant in membrane biofouling than previously thought. By reviewing the biodiversity and ecology of microbes in the whole high pressure membrane filtration water chain, we have been able to identify potentials to improve biofouling control. These include modulation of hydrodynamic conditions, nutrient limitation and the combination of cleaning agents to target the entire membrane microbiome.","authors":[{"name":"Hendrik J de Vries"},{"name":"Alfons J M Stams"},{"name":"Caroline M Plugge"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Fungi"},{"word":"Membrane biofouling"},{"word":"Microbiota"},{"word":"Nanofiltration"},{"word":"Reverse osmosis"}]},"article34":{"pmid":"31986397","title":"Bacterial community dynamics and disinfection impact in cooling water systems.","abs":"Understanding the bacterial dynamics in cooling towers is imperative for the assessment of disinfection efficiency and management of microbial risks linked to aerosol formation.

To address this, 1724 published papers concentrating on three types of microbial aggregates, namely granules, biofilm, and flocs were compiled. A quantitative meta-analysis was carried out to compare the standard error of nitrogen removal efficiencies among these three microbial aggregates. The data sources of this meta-analysis comprised articles on granules (42%), followed by those on biofilm (33%) and flocs (25%). The granular sludge appeared to be competent in achieving the highest average nitrogen removal efficiencies of 81.1%, followed by biofilm (80.8%).

SA with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups can interact with the hydroxyl groups of PLX via hydrogen bonding. A stronger interaction of SA with PLX407 was found when compared to the interaction between SA and PLX188. The PLX-CA beads gave a higher CZ entrapment efficiency than the CA beads. The highest PLX content used created an amorphous form of CZ in the beads because of the CZ solubilization by the PLX micelles.

Considering the importance of the detrimental impact of biofouling, it has received much attention in the scientific community and from concerned stakeholders. With the development of nanotechnology and the nowadays widespread use of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), concerns have been raised regarding their fate in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Safety aspects and public health issues are critical in the management of handling nanomaterials and their nanowastes. The interactions of various types of nanoparticles (NPs) with planktonic bacteria have also received attention due to their antimicrobial properties. However, their behavior in regard to biofilms is not well understood although, in the environment, most of the bacteria prefer living in sessile communities. The question appears relevant considering the need to build knowledge on the fate of nanoparticles and the fact that no one can exclude the risk of accumulation of nanoparticles in biofilms and on surfaces leading to a form of nanofouling involving both engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) and nanoplastics. The present analysis of recent research accounts allows in identifying that (1) research activities related to water remediation systems have been mostly oriented on the impact of NPs on pre-existing biofilms, (2) experimental designs are restricted to few scenarios of exposure, usually limited to relative short-time periods although nanofouling could favour the development of multi-resistant bacterial species through sub-lethal exposures over prolong periods of time (3) nanofouling in other systems in which biofilms develop remains to be addressed, and (4) new research directions are required for investigating the mechanisms involved and the subsequent impact of nanofouling on bacterial consortium responses encountered in a variety of environments such as those prevailing in food production/processing settings.

Most of the bacterial isolates were susceptible to Ofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Gentamicin, and Cefepime and resistant to Ceftazidime, Nitrofurantoin, Ampicillin, and Nalidixic acid. Isolate RB33-V recorded resistant against 11 antibiotics tested, and RB42-V was found susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested. Among the seven heavy metals tested, the highest of 39 bacteria showed resistance to zinc, and least of 9 bacteria recorded resistance against cadmium. Isolate RB20-III was susceptible to all heavy metals tested, and RB23-III was found resistance for six heavy metals tested. A higher correlation was observed with zinc and multiple antibiotic resistance, and Ceftazidime resistance was most frequently associated with all the heavy metals tested. These bacteria grow optimally under neutral-alkali conditions and susceptible to acidic conditions, and they can withstand a broad range of temperatures and salt concentrations. They are very poor in phosphate solubilization. Further, the bacteria recorded varied results for beneficial traits, hemolytic, and DNase activity. The results of bacterial characterization indicated that this bacterial community is of multi-origin in nature and are assisting the host-plant in withstanding the adverse and fluctuating conditions of the Yamuna river by reducing the toxic effect of heavy metals, antibiotics and other xenobiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Duraivadivel P"},{"name":"Gowtham H G"},{"name":"Hariprasad P"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic"},{"word":"Heavy metal"},{"word":"Indole acetic acid"},{"word":"Water hyacinth"},{"word":"Yamuna"}]},"article52":{"pmid":"31981410","title":"Synthesis of Catechin-Rare Earth Complex with Efficient and Broad-Spectrum Anti-Biofilm Activity.","abs":"Biofilm is the crucial reason of clinical infections.

Using virgin polymers that have not being exposed to the environment as a reference, DRS peaks can be attributed to the microorganisms attached to the polymer surface with time. The polymers tested were low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). For LDPE strips for all sampling times in the field, the development of the peaks among 10 similar samples was rather uniform in terms of peak wavelength with time. For PET strips during the early sampling time, the development of the peaks among 10 similar samples was rather uniform in terms of peak wavelength but varied in terms of intensity. This last observation phased out with longer exposure times that the peaks had similar distribution in terms of peak wavelength and intensity. Similar experiments were run for longer exposure times both in an oligotrophic laboratory bioreactor and in the marine environment. In both cases, the biofilm on PET samples seems to reach a steady state faster than LDPE with similar peaks found on both samples DRS proved to be a robust and useful tool to study the formation of biofilm on plastic samples without any pretreatment and without sample destruction.

Generally considered a harmless commensal, these bacteria are studied for their plant-growth promotion (PGP) and biocontrol characteristics. Intriguingly, P. brassicacearum is closely related to P. corrugata, which is classified as an opportunistic phytopathogen. Twenty-one P. brassicacearum genomes have been sequenced to date. In the current review, genomes of P. brassicacearum and strains from the P. corrugata clade were mined for regions associated with PGP, biocontrol and pathogenicity. We discovered that 'beneficial' bacteria and those classified as plant pathogens have many genes in common; thus, only a fine line separates beneficial/harmless commensals from those capable of causing disease in plants. The genotype and physiological state of the plant, the presence of biotic/abiotic stressors, and the ability of bacteria to manipulate the plant immune system collectively contribute to how the bacterial-plant interaction plays out. Because production of extracellular metabolites is energetically costly, these compounds are expected to impart a fitness advantage to the producer. P. brassicacearum is able to reduce the threat of nematode predation through release of metabolites involved in biocontrol. Moreover this bacterium has the unique ability to form biofilms on the head of Caenorhabditis elegans, as a second mechanism of predator avoidance. Rhizobacteria, plants, fungi, and microfaunal predators have occupied a shared niche for millions of years and, in many ways, they function as a single organism.

The existence of diderm members in the classically monoderm Firmicutes challenges the Gram-positive/Gram-negative divide and provides a great opportunity to tackle the issue. In this review, we present current knowledge on the diversity of bacterial cell envelopes, including these atypical Firmicutes. We discuss how phylogenomic analysis supports the hypothesis that the diderm cell envelope architecture is an ancestral character in the Firmicutes, and that the monoderm phenotype in this phylum arose multiple times independently by loss of the outer membrane. Given the overwhelming distribution of diderm phenotypes with respect to monoderm ones, this scenario likely extends to the ancestor of all bacteria.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of pH, ethanol and NaCl concentrations after 24 and 48 h incubation times at 37 °C, also modeling the results with artificial neural network (ANN). For this purpose, after both incubation times, the effect of each parameter was studied, separately and also in combination at the levels in which the highest biofilm was formed. All results were modeled using multiple ANN and compared in terms of R-value and MSE. The highest biofilm formation ability was in neutral pH. Adding the ethanol and NaCl stimulated biofilm formation, but the inhibitory effect was observed at high concentrations of ethanol and NaCl and very acidic or highly alkaline pH levels. The more incubation time also led to an increase in biofilm formation. Eventually, the Feed-Forward, Back-Propagation Neural Network model with the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm and 4-12-1 topology was chosen (R-value = 0.995 and validation MSE = 0.011467). This ANN had high modeling ability because there was a high correlation between experimental data and modeling data. Therefore, it was concluded that pH, ethanol, NaCl, and time are effective parameters in the biofilm formation and there is a nonlinear relationship between these factors that the ANN is capable of modeling them.","authors":[{"name":"Sayedeh Saleheh Vaezi"},{"name":"Elahe Poorazizi"},{"name":"Arezoo Tahmourespour"},{"name":"Farham Aminsharei"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Artificial neural network"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Ethanol"},{"word":"NaCl"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"pH"}]},"article90":{"pmid":"31972092","title":"Process Description of an Unconventional Biofilm Formation by Bacterial Cells Autoagglutinating through Sticky, Long, and Peritrichate Nanofibers.","abs":"In this study, we elucidated the formation process of an unconventional biofilm formed by a bacterium autoagglutinating through sticky, long, and peritrichate nanofibers.

The process forming this unconventional biofilm started with cell-cell interactions, proceeded to cell clumping, and led to the formation of large cell aggregates. The cell-cell interaction was described by Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory based on a new concept, which considers two independent interactions between two cell bodies and between two AtaA fiber tips forming a discontinuous surface. If cell bodies cannot collide owing to an energy barrier at low ionic strengths but approach within the interactive distance of AtaA fibers, cells can agglutinate through their contact. Cell clumping proceeds following the cluster-cluster aggregation model, and an unconventional biofilm containing void spaces and a fractal nature develops.

The mechanism of bactericidal action by aminoglycosides is well-known, by which it terminates the cytoplasmic protein synthesis. However, the potentials of aminoglycosides become hindered when facing the evolution of bacterial resistance mechanisms. Among multiple resistance mechanisms displayed by bacteria against antibiotics, the formation of biofilm is the mechanism that provides a barrier for antibiotics to reach the cellular level. Bacteria present in the biofilm also get protection against the impact of host immune responses, harsh environmental conditions, and other antimicrobial treatments. Hence, with the multifaceted resistance developed by biofilm-forming pathogenic bacteria, antibiotics are therefore discontinued for further applications. However, the recent research developed several alternative strategies such as optimization of the active concentration, modification of the environmental conditions, modification of the chemical structure, combinatorial application with other active agents, and formulation with biocompatible carrier materials to revitalize and exploit the new potential of aminoglycosides.

Employing natural substrates in the human body such as glucose and oxygen, cascade reactions can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill tumor cells, but cascade reactions may also have potential as a direly needed, novel bacterial infection-control strategy. ROS can disintegrate the EPS matrix of infectious biofilm, disrupt bacterial cell membranes, and damage intra-cellular DNA. Application of cascade reactions producing ROS as a new infection-control strategy is still in its infancy. The main advantages for infection-control cascade reactions include the fact that they are non-antibiotic based and induction of ROS resistance is unlikely. However, the amount of ROS generated is generally low and antimicrobial efficacies reported are still far <3-4 log units necessary for clinical efficacy. Increasing the amounts of ROS generated by adding more substrate bears the risk of collateral damage to tissue surrounding an infection site. Collateral tissue damage upon increasing substrate concentrations may be prevented by locally increasing substrate concentrations, for instance, using smart nanocarriers. Smart, pH-responsive nanocarriers can self-target and accumulate in infectious biofilms from the blood circulation to confine ROS production inside the biofilm to yield long-term presence of ROS, despite the short lifetime (nanoseconds) of individual ROS molecules. Increasing bacterial killing efficacies using cascade reaction components containing nanocarriers constitutes a first, major challenge in the development of infection-control cascade reactions. Nevertheless, their use in combination with clinical antibiotic treatment may already yield synergistic effects, but this remains to be established for cascade reactions. Furthermore, specific patient groups possessing elevated levels of endogenous substrate (for instance, diabetic or cancer patients) may benefit from the use of cascade reaction components containing nanocarriers.","authors":[{"name":"Yuanfeng Li"},{"name":"Guang Yang"},{"name":"Yijin Ren"},{"name":"Linqi Shi"},{"name":"Rujiang Ma"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ROS"},{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"cascade reaction"},{"word":"glucose"},{"word":"hydrogen peroxide"},{"word":"infection"}]},"article99":{"pmid":"31969984","title":"Biofilm formation displays intrinsic offensive and defensive features of Bacillus cereus.","abs":"Biofilm formation is a strategy of many bacterial species to adapt to a variety of stresses and has become a part of infections, contaminations, or beneficial interactions.

We report that floating and biofilm cells are populations that differentiate metabolically, with members of each subpopulation developing different branches of certain metabolic pathways. Secondly, biofilm populations rearrange nucleotides, sugars, amino acids, and energy metabolism. Thirdly, this metabolic rearrangement coexists with: the synthesis of the extracellular matrix, sporulation, reinforcement of the cell wall, activation of the ROS detoxification machinery and production of secondary metabolites. This strategy contributes to defend biofilm cells from competitors.

Preliminary biofilm assays suggested a mild role for the products of the eps2 region in biofilm formation and no function for the products of the eps1 region. The aim of this work was to better define the roles of these two regions in B. cereus multicellularity. We demonstrate that the eps2 region is indeed involved in bacterial adhesion to surfaces, cell-to-cell interaction, cellular aggregation and biofilm formation, while the eps1 region appears to be involved in a kind of social bacterial motility.

Given the recognized role of Sphaerotilus in organically enriched environments, additional analyses were pursued to specifically characterize its abundance: a consensus sthA sequence was determined via comparison of whole metagenome sequences with a previously identified sthA sequence, the primers developed for this gene were used to characterize relative Sphaerotilus abundance using quantitative real-time PCR, and a Sphaerotilus strain was isolated to validate the determined sthA sequence. Results indicated that biofilm abundance was stimulated by elevated antecedent chemical oxygen demand concentrations, a surrogate for deicer concentrations, with minimal biofilm volumes observed when antecedent chemical oxygen demand concentrations remained below 48 mg/L. Biofilms were composed of diverse communities (including sheathed bacterium Thiothrix) whose composition appeared to shift in relation to antecedent temperature and chemical oxygen demand. The relative abundance of sthA correlated most strongly with heterotrophic biofilm volume (positive) and dissolved oxygen (negative), indicating that Sphaerotilus was likely a consistent biofilm member and thrived under low oxygen conditions. Additional investigations identified the isolate as a new strain of Sphaerotilus montanus (strain KMKE) able to use deicer components as carbon sources and found that stream dissolved oxygen concentrations related inversely to biofilm volume as well as to antecedent temperature and chemical oxygen demand. The airport setting provides insight into potential consequences of widescale adoption of organic deicers for roadway deicing.","authors":[{"name":"Michelle A Nott"},{"name":"Heather E Driscoll"},{"name":"Minoru Takeda"},{"name":"Mahesh Vangala"},{"name":"Steven R Corsi"},{"name":"Scott W Tighe"}],"keywords":[]},"article111":{"pmid":"31967575","title":"Are we There Yet?

Previous research, mainly performed with pathogens, demonstrated increased environmental stress tolerance of biofilm-growing compared to planktonic bacteria. The lifestyle-specific stress response of colonic microbiota, both natural and fermentation produced, has not been addressed before. Planktonic and sessile artificial colonic microbiota delivered by PolyFermS continuous fermentation models can provide a controllable and reproducible alternative to fecal transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disorders. We therefore characterized planktonic and sessile microbiota produced in two PolyFermS models inoculated with immobilized fecal microbiota and comparatively tested their levels of tolerance of frozen storage (-80°C) and freeze-dried storage (4°C) for 9 months to mimic preservation strategies for therapeutic applications. Sessile microbiota harbored next to shared taxa a unique community distinguishable from planktonic microbiota. Synergistetes and Proteobacteria were highly represented in sessile microbiota, while Firmicutes were more abundant in planktonic microbiota. The community structure and metabolic activity of both microbiota, monitored during standardized reactivation batch fermentations, were better preserved after frozen storage than dried storage, indicated by higher Bray-Curtis similarity and enhanced recovery of metabolite production. For both lifestyles, reestablishment of Bacteroidaceae was impaired after frozen and dried storage along with reduced propionate formation. In contrast, butyrate production was maintained after reactivation despite compositional rearrangements within the butyrate-producing community. Unexpectedly, the rate of recovery of metabolite production was lower after preservation of sessile than planktonic microbiota. We speculate that higher functional dependencies between microbes might have led to the lower stress tolerance of sessile than planktonic microbiota.","authors":[{"name":"Lea Bircher"},{"name":"Clarissa Schwab"},{"name":"Annelies Geirnaert"},{"name":"Anna Greppi"},{"name":"Christophe Lacroix"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FMT"},{"word":"bacterial lifestyle"},{"word":"colonic microbiota"},{"word":"cryopreservation"},{"word":"lyophilization"}]},"article116":{"pmid":"31964715","title":"Mechanism underlying autoinducer recognition in the Vibrio cholerae DPO-VqmA quorum-sensing pathway.","abs":"Quorum sensing is a bacterial communication process whereby bacteria produce, release, and detect extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers to coordinate collective behaviors. In the pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the quorum-sensing autoinducer 3,5-dimethyl-pyrazin-2-ol (DPO) binds the receptor and transcription factor VqmA. The DPO-VqmA complex activates transcription of vqmR, encoding the VqmR small RNA, which represses genes required for biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Here, we show that VqmA is soluble and properly folded, and activates basal-level transcription of its target vqmR in the absence of DPO. VqmA transcriptional activity is increased in response to increasing concentrations of DPO, allowing VqmA to drive the V. cholerae quorum-sensing transition at high cell densities. We solved the DPO-VqmA crystal structure to 2.0 Å resolution and compared it to existing structures to understand the conformational changes VqmA undergoes upon DNA binding. Analysis of DPO analogs showed that a hydroxyl or carbonyl group at the 2' position is critical for binding to VqmA. The proposed DPO precursor, a linear molecule, N-alanyl-aminoacetone or Ala-AA, also bound and activated VqmA. Results from site-directed mutagenesis and competitive ligand-binding analyses revealed that DPO and Ala-AA occupy the same binding site. In summary, our structure-function analysis identifies key features required for VqmA activation and DNA binding and establishes that, while VqmA binds two different ligands, VqmA does not require a bound ligand for folding or basal transcriptional activity. However, bound ligand is required for maximal activity.","authors":[{"name":"Xiuliang Huang"},{"name":"Olivia P Duddy"},{"name":"Justin E Silpe"},{"name":"Jon E Paczkowski"},{"name":"Jianping Cong"},{"name":"Brad R Henke"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3,5-dimethyl-pyrazin-2-ol (DPO)"},{"word":"N-alanyl-aminoacetone (Ala-AA)"},{"word":"Vibrio cholerae"},{"word":"VqmA"},{"word":"autoinducer"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"binding"},{"word":"crystallography"},{"word":"gene regulation"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"31964697","title":"Genomic differences between Listeria monocytogenes EGDe isolates reveals crucial roles for SigB and wall rhamnosylation in biofilm formation.","abs":"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive Firmicute that causes food-borne infections, in part due to its ability to use multiple strategies, including biofilm formation, to survive adverse growth conditions. As a potential way to screen for genes required for biofilm formation we harnessed the ability of bacteria to accumulate mutations in the genome over time, diverging the properties of seemingly identical strains. By sequencing the genomes of four laboratory reference strains of the commonly used L. monocytogenes EGDe, we showed that each isolate contains SNPs compared with the reference genome. We discovered that two SNPs, contained in two independent genes within one of the isolates, impacted biofilm formation. Using bacterial genetics and phenotypic assays, we confirmed that rsbU and rmlA influence biofilm formation. RsbU is the upstream regulator of the alternative sigma factor, SigB and mutation of either rsbU or sigB increased biofilm formation. In contrast, deletion of rmlA, which encodes the first enzyme for TDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis, resulted in a reduction in the amount of biofilm formed. Further analysis of biofilm formation in a strain that still produces TDP-L-rhamnose, but which cannot decorate the wall teichoic acid with rhamnose (rmlT mutant), showed that it is the decorated wall teichoic acid that is required for adhesion of the cells to surfaces. Together these data uncover novel routes by which biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes can be impacted.","authors":[{"name":"Chih-Yu Hsu"},{"name":"Lynne Cairns"},{"name":"Laura Hobley"},{"name":"James Abbott"},{"name":"Conor O'Byrne"},{"name":"Nicola R Stanley-Wall"}],"keywords":[]},"article119":{"pmid":"31964416","title":"Establishment of an in vivo rat model for chronic musculoskeletal implant infection.","abs":"The aim of the study was to establish an experimental chronic musculoskeletal infection model in vivo characterized by (a) a small bacterial inoculum, (b) no general or local signs of infection, (c) several parallels (implants) in each animal and finally (d) a model that is technically easy to perform.","authors":[{"name":"Eivind Witsø"},{"name":"Linh Hoang"},{"name":"Kirsti Løseth"},{"name":"Kåre Bergh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chronic"},{"word":"Experimental"},{"word":"Infection"},{"word":"Model"},{"word":"Musculoskeletal"}]},"article120":{"pmid":"31964196","title":"Mild magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia enhances the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm to antibiotics.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Layla Alumutairi"},{"name":"Bing Yu"},{"name":"Mitchell Filka"},{"name":"Joseph Nayfach"},{"name":"Min-Ho Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Magnetic nanoparticles"},{"word":"S. aureus biofilm"},{"word":"alternating magnetic field"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"hyperthermia"}]},"article121":{"pmid":"31963821","title":"Staphylococcus saprophyticus Proteomic Analyses Elucidate Differences in the Protein Repertories among Clinical Strains Related to Virulence and Persistence.","abs":"Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a Gram-positive and coagulase negative cocci that composes the skin microbiota and can act as an opportunistic agent causing urinary tract infections, being more frequent in sexually active young women.

After uranyl acetate/lead staining, we observe intracellular black particles, some with a difficult-to-see capsid. Some black particles (called LBPs) are larger than phage particles.

One way that C. albicans controls its metabolism is through the glucose repression pathway, where expression of alternative carbon source utilization genes is repressed in the presence of its preferred carbon source, glucose. Here we carry out genetic and gene expression studies that identify transcription factors Mig1 and Mig2 as mediators of glucose repression in C. albicans. The well-studied Mig1/2 orthologs ScMig1/2 mediate glucose repression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; our data argue that C. albicans Mig1/2 function similarly as repressors of alternative carbon source utilization genes. However, Mig1/2 functions have several distinctive features in C. albicans. First, Mig1 and Mig2 have more co-equal roles in gene regulation than their S. cerevisiae orthologs. Second, Mig1 is regulated at the level of protein accumulation, more akin to ScMig2 than ScMig1. Third, Mig1 and Mig2 are together required for a unique aspect of C. albicans biology, the expression of several pathogenicity traits. Such Mig1/2-dependent traits include the abilities to form hyphae and biofilm, tolerance of cell wall inhibitors, and ability to damage macrophage-like cells and human endothelial cells. Finally, Mig1 is required for a puzzling feature of C. albicans biology that is not shared with S. cerevisiae: the essentiality of the Snf1 protein kinase, a central eukaryotic carbon metabolism regulator.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the impact of the P. aeruginosa T6SS on biofilm formation and environmental adaptation. To this end, we collected P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, divided them into strong biofilm formation (SBF) and nonbiofilm formation (NBF) groups based on their biofilm-forming ability, and compared their associated clinical characteristics. The duration of hospitalization was longer in patients infected with SBF than those infected with NBF strains. The expression levels of T6SS-related genes (hcp1 and hcp3) and a quorum-sensing gene (lasR) were higher in the SBF group as compared to those in the NBF group. In addition, the expression level of lasR was negatively associated with that of hcp1, but was positively associated with those of hcp2 and hcp3.

In this Review, we discuss how microbiology and biophysics are converging to advance our understanding of the mechanobiology of microorganisms. We first review the various physical forces that bacteria experience in their natural environments and describe the structures that transmit these forces to a cell. We then discuss how forces can provide feedback to enhance adhesion and motility and how they can be transduced by dedicated cellular machinery to regulate diverse phenotypes.

Ultimately, these studies dismiss the corrosion mechanism as a function of the local microbiome. Sixty spine hardware constructs were examined immediately after explantation for biofilm formation. Marked rod sections were imaged using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Backscatter mode was employed to better image the topology of the surface. There is clear differentiation between discoloration due to corrosion vs mechanical damage. Under scanning electron microscopy backscatter electron shadow examination, the authors noted that not all biofilm was removed using the surgical wipes. Corrosion pits were noticeably larger and numerous in areas of biofilm. In areas not associated with biofilms, there were few pits even if mechanical wear was evident. There is no evidence that the surface corrosion is modified between clinically diagnosed infected and noninfected patients. The surface damage present on explanted Ti6Al4V spine rods is uniquely similar to damage found in other industries where microbial-influenced corrosion is prevalent. Given that similar anaerobic, sulfur-reducing bacteria reside in and on human tissues, it is most likely that corrosion observed on explanted hardware is the result of microbial-influenced corrosion and not from inflammatory or other processes. Using analysis methods from other industries to characterize the microbiome present on explanted hardware is necessary.

We used atomic force microscopy to explore the contribution of gtfB and gtfC, as well as enamel-surface roughness, on the initial attachment of S. mutans. Adhesion forces of four S. mutans strains (wild-type, ΔgtfB, ΔgtfC, and ΔgtfBC), onto etched enamel surfaces, were determined. Force curves showed that, with increasing etching time from 0 to 10 s, the forces of all strains increased accordingly with acid-exposure time, the adhesion forces of wild-type strains were significantly greater than those of mutant strains (p < .05), and the forces of the three mutants were similar (p < .05).

This social habit has tremendous effects on oral and general health of khat chewers. Khat may affect bacterial species in plaque biofilms on oral rehabilitation materials. This preliminary case-controlled study aimed to assess and compare the effect of khat chewing on bacterial biodiversity between non-khat chewers (NKC) and khat chewers (KC) in oral biofilms on oral rehabilitation materials using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty participants were organized into 2 equal groups of NKC and KC, each containing 5 subgroups related to filling material type. Some participants had amalgam (A) or composite (C) restorations, while others had feldspathic porcelain (FP), nickel chromium (NC), and zirconia ceramic (ZC) crowns or bridges. Oral biofilm samples were collected from all participants, DNA was extracted, and samples were subjected to PCR. Bacterial species were then identified and counted. PCR products were sequenced to detect similarity. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of the current study samples were compared with 16S rRNA gene sequences from GenBank using BLAST on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. RESULTS The Streptococcus sp. was the most common bacterial species among our participants (40; 80%), followed by Lactobacillus and Veillonella spp., accounting for 12% (6) and 8% (4), respectively. Streptococcus sp. was observed equally among NKC and KC, but Lactobacillus and Veillonella spp. were higher in KC and NKC, respectively. Lactobacillus was associated mainly with prosthetic materials, and Streptococcus was found among all examined dental restorative materials.

We also investigated the bacterial mRNA expression of biofilm-associated genes (fliC, csgA, and fimA) by quantitative real-time PCR assays. LCEE was found to suppress the growth, time-kill curve, and spread of EPEC. It also reduced the biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological analysis using transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that LCEE diminished the function of flagella resulting in reduced motility and biofilm formation. The mRNA expression of all three biofilm associated genes was downregulated under LCEE treatment. Extracts of the fruit of LCE inhibit the motility and biofilm formation of EPEC as a result of the inhibition of flagella development and function.

Indeed, the ability of Salmonella to form a biofilm seems to significantly contribute to its persistence in food production areas and clinical settings. Plant extracts and phytochemicals appear as promising sources of novel antimicrobials due to their cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, great structural diversity, and lower possibility of antimicrobial resistance development in comparison to synthetic chemicals.

Experimental results revealed that strain BH4 provoked both competitive (76%) and cooperative (24%) interactions (P < 0.05) in dual-species biofilms after 24 h of incubation (mature biofilm), implying that signal destruction by strain BH4 was strain-dependent. Besides hike in the biofilm biomass (~21%), amount of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (25-30 times) and particle size (3.5 times) in the Serratia sp. JSB1 biofilm were increased by str. BH4. This suggests that strain BH4 may only have quenching effects against certain bacteria, and that such effects are overlooked at the community level.

In line with this observation, lactose grown cells showed the highest resistance to lethal heat and acid stress, the highest biofilm formation, and had the highest adhesion/invasion capacity in Caco-2-derived C2Bbe1 cell lines. Our data suggest that lactose utilisation triggers a strong SigB dependent stress response and this may have implications for the resistance of L. monocytogenes along the food chain.","authors":[{"name":"Natalia Crespo Tapia"},{"name":"Amber L Dorey"},{"name":"Cormac G M Gahan"},{"name":"Heidy M W den Besten"},{"name":"Conor P O'Byrne"},{"name":"Tjakko Abee"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acid stress"},{"word":"Adhesion assay"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"C2Bbe1 cell line"},{"word":"Carbon source"},{"word":"Glucose"},{"word":"Glycerol"},{"word":"Heat stress"},{"word":"Invasion assay"},{"word":"Lactose"},{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"SigB"},{"word":"Sigma B"},{"word":"Stress"},{"word":"Stress response"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article159":{"pmid":"31954970","title":"Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) membrane BioReactor: The influence of the operational parameters.","abs":"The present paper investigated an Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) Membrane BioReactor (MBR) system monitored for 340 days.

The microstructure of the dual-species biofilm revealed a similar morphology to V. cholerae alone when both bacteria were initially added at the same amount. The analysis of some major ECM components showed that E. coli was not able to produce curli in the presence of V. cholerae, unless enough time was given for E. coli to colonize the air-liquid interface first.

For electricity generation and contaminant removal, the anode material is one of important factors influencing the performance of SMFCs. In this study, graphene (GR), graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were applied to modify the graphite felt (GF) anode in SMFCs during 110 d operation. An economical and easy modification method with the carbon nanomaterials was applied. The carbon nanomaterials increased the electrochemically active surface areas and biomass content of the anodes and correspondingly effectively enhanced the generation of electricity and the removal rates of loss on ignition (LOI) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (phenanthrene and pyrene). During the steady period from 50 d to 110 d, the GO-SMFCs favored the enrichment of EAB and thus output the highest voltages of 30.60-48.61 mV. The GR-SMFCs and GO-SMFCs generated high electric power of approximate 0.98 ± 0.14 kJ and 0.87 ± 0.04 kJ, followed by CNT-SMFCs (0.57 ± 0.06 kJ) and GF-SMFCs (0.49 ± 0.07 kJ) during the 110 d operation. The PAH degradation was not directly related to the electric current in the SMFCs.

Children were either caries-free (CF), caries-active with enamel lesions (CAE), or caries-active with dentin lesions (CA). Plaque samples were collected from caries-free surfaces (PF), and from enamel (PE) and dentin (PD) lesions. Taxonomic profiles representing the different categorizations (CF-PF, CAE-PF, CAE-PE, CA-PF, CA-PE and CA-PD) were utilized to characterize the mycobiome and its change through disease progression. A total of 139 fungal species were identified.

Its composition may change when pathogenic microorganisms become dominating. Therefore, dental biofilm or plaque has been frequently investigated in the context of oral health and disease. Furthermore, its potential as an alternative matrix for analytical purposes has also been recognized in other disciplines like archeology, food sciences, and forensics. Thus, a careful in-depth characterization of dental plaque is worthwhile. Most of the conducted studies focused on the screening of microbial populations in dental plaque. Their lipid membranes, on the other hand, may significantly impact substance (metabolite) exchange within microbial colonies as well as xenobiotics uptake and incorporation into teeth. Under this umbrella, a comprehensive lipidomic profiling for determination of lipid compositions of in vivo dental plaque samples and of in vitro cultivated biofilm as surrogate matrix to be used for analytical purposes has been performed in this work. An untargeted lipidomics workflow utilizing a ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF) platform together with comprehensive SWATH (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra) acquisition and compatible software (MS-DIAL) that comprises a vast lipid library has been adopted to establish an extensive lipidomic fingerprint of dental plaque. The main lipid components in dental plaque were identified as triacylglycerols, followed by cholesterol, cholesteryl esters as well as diacylglycerols, and various phospholipid classes. In vivo plaque is a rare matrix which is usually available in very low amounts. When higher quantities for specific research assays are required, efficient ways to produce an appropriate surrogate matrix are mandatory. A potential surrogate matrix substituting dental plaque was prepared by cultivation of in vitro biofilm from saliva and similarities and differences in the lipidomics profile to in vivo plaque were mapped by statistical evaluation post-analysis. It was discovered that most lipid classes were highly elevated in the in vitro biofilm samples, in particular diacylglycerols, phosphatidylglycerols, and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). Furthermore, an overall shift from even-chain lipid species to odd-chain lipids was observed in the cultivated biofilms. On the other hand, even-chain phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lysoPCs, cholesteryl esters, and cholesterol-sulfate were shown to be specifically increased in plaque samples.

Bacterial adhesion to foreign material is one of the key risk factors associated with periprosthetic joint infection. The foreign material with large adhesion area might be also the UHMWPE (Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene) particles released during the wear process from the surface of articulating components. The purpose of this study is to evaluate potential adhesion areas of wear particles in relation to diverse distribution of the size and shapes of wear particles in periprosthetic tissue and to assess an increase in the risk of infectious complications associated with an increase in the adhesion area of wear particles. MATERIAL AND METHODS The size and morphology of model and real UHMWPE particles were determined with the use of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. By determining the morphological descriptors, the surfaces of individual particles for different distributions of polyethylene particles were calculated. When measuring the model wear particles, 6 model situations were simulated, in which comparisons with the control measurement by the BET (Brunauer-Emmet-Teller) method were made. RESULTS The variability of individual morphological descriptors demonstrates the effect on the total surface of particles. The calculated coefficient defines how many times the particle surface increases when corrected to the given descriptor (elongation, flattening, roughness, porosity). The total area of real wear particles at 1 year is 4,622 cm2, at 20 years it is 92,440 cm2. Based on our calculations, the area of particles where a biofilm is actually formed (approximately 50 bacteria may adhere to a particle of 3µm in diameter) is 809.5 cm2 at 1 year and 16,190 cm2 at 20 years. DISCUSSION According to the measurements, the size of the potential adhesion area of metal parts and polyethylene particles becomes equal already after several weeks of endoprosthesis usage and after a few years it is many times larger. The question is whether the risk of bacterial adhesion, i.e. also the risk of infectious complications of TEP actually increases. The clinical practice suggests that the number of infections e.g. 10, 15 or 20 years after the primary implantation is not statistically higher, despite the confirmed growth of potential adhesion area in the form of UHMWPE particles. This fact could be explained by a partially equal regulatory pathway of infection and polyethylene disease. The immune system stimulated by wear particles might better resist the hematogenic infection. CONCLUSIONS The study outcomes clearly indicate that the area of polyethylene wear particles considerably increases over time. In spite of the fact that only approximately 10% of wear particles show parameters (also with respect to the size of particles and bacteria) for potential bacterial adhesion, this area is many times larger than the area of metal parts of the endoprosthesis.

These composite microbial communities must adapt to survive in such hostile conditions, sometimes promoting the selection of antibiotic-resistant microbial strains by gene transfer.

Stream biofilms provide multiple functions in stream ecosystems, but their functional response to PPCP contaminants such as ciprofloxacin is unclear. To establish the effect of ciprofloxacin on aquatic biofilms, we colonized biofilms in situ on tiles (n = 80) at four sites along an urban stream in Gainesville, Florida, including two sites above and two sites below a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We then incubated the tiles and associated biofilms in the laboratory for 6 d exposing biofilms to either 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 μg/L (target concentrations) of ciprofloxacin. At the end of the 6 d laboratory exposure, we quantified gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), and biomass (as chlorophyll a) of biofilms, and calculated response ratios for each response. All response metrics were significantly differed across sites (p < 0.01). Ciprofloxacin significantly decreased GPP (p < 0.05) regardless of treatment concentration, most notably at the site immediately below the WWTP, where there was no measurable GPP on any ciprofloxacin-treated biofilms. In contrast, respiration (R) was not significantly affected by ciprofloxacin, despite an apparent increase in R at the WWTP site. However, the WWTP site R was significantly different from the most upstream and downstream sites (p < 0.001) but was not significantly different from a nearby site upstream of the WWTP (p > 0.05). These results indicate that chronic exposure to ciprofloxacin through WWTP effluent can alter ecosystem functions performed by biofilms, which can have consequences for higher trophic levels and stream processes.

Periodontal diseases constitute chronic, biofilm-initiated inflammatory conditions with multifactorial origin including inherited and acquired risk factors. Preventive strategies focus on mechanisms, which may influence the amount and composition of the subgingival biofilm. Oral cancer is one of the most commonly found forms of malignancies worldwide.

Degradation experiments in the laboratory were performed in dark and light conditions, as well as after antibiotic supply, in order to characterize the eventual interactions between photoautotrophs and heterotrophs activity during glyphosate degradation. Fifty percent of the initial concentration of glyphosate (0.6 mM) was transformed into aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) after 9 days in presence or absence of light. Accordingly, the photoautotrophic DOM supply was not stimulating glyphosate degradation by microbial heterotrophs. This lack of response was probably explained by the low net primary production values and weak dissolved organic carbon production recorded in light treatments. The supply of the antibiotic drastically stopped glyphosate transformation demonstrating the central role of bacteria in the biodegradation of the herbicide. Glyphosate also modified the structure of prokaryotes assemblages in the consortium by increasing the relative abundances of Alphaproteobacteria and slightly decreasing those of Gammaproteobacteria. The chemoorganotrophic bacteria Phenylobacterium sp. (Alphaproteobacteria) was related to the transformation of glyphosate in our microbial consortium.

Preliminary evaluation of probiotic potential indicates that 31% of the isolates show biofilm formation ability, 29% acidic pH resistance, and 25% bile salt resistance. Finally, 29% of the isolates were sensitive to antibiotics while the remaining 71%, that include bacterial species well-recognized for their ability to disseminate resistance genes in the environment, showed a variable pattern of antibiotic resistance. The results obtained underline that microbial diversity of extra virgin olive oils represents an unexpected sink of microbial diversity and poses safety issues on the possible biotechnological exploitation of this microbial biodiversity.","authors":[{"name":"Francesco Fancello"},{"name":"Chiara Multineddu"},{"name":"Mario Santona"},{"name":"Pierfrancesco Deiana"},{"name":"Giacomo Zara"},{"name":"Ilaria Mannazzu"},{"name":"Marilena Budroni"},{"name":"Sandro Dettori"},{"name":"Severino Zara"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus spp."},{"word":"Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)"},{"word":"L. rhamnosus"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"}]},"article222":{"pmid":"31936505","title":"Design, Synthesis and In Vitro Characterization of Novel Antimicrobial Agents Based on 6-Chloro-9H-carbazol Derivatives and 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Scaffolds.","abs":"In this paper, we aimed to exploit and combine in the same molecule the carbazole and the 1,3,4-oxadiazole pharmacophores, to obtain novel carprofen derivatives, by using two synthesis pathways.

The introduction of the odc2 gene borne on a plasmid into the odc2 mutant restored wild-type phenotypes for EPS production, growth under oxidative stress and swimming. The production of calcofluor-binding EPS (succinoglycan) by the odc2 mutant was also completely or mostly restored in the presence of exogenous spermidine (Spd), norspermidine (NSpd) or spermine (Spm). The odc2 mutant formed about 25 % more biofilm than the wild-type, and its ability to form biofilm was significantly inhibited by exogenous Spd, NSpd or Spm. The odc2 mutant formed a less efficient symbiosis with alfalfa, resulting in plants with significantly less biomass and height, more nodules but less nodule biomass, and 25 % less nitrogen-fixing activity.

To address this problem, we conjugate the phages to gold nanorods, creating a reagent that can be destroyed upon use (termed phanorods). Chimeric phages were engineered to attach specifically to several Gram-negative organisms, including the human pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae, and the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris The bioconjugated phanorods could selectively target and kill specific bacterial cells using photothermal ablation. Following excitation by near-infrared light, gold nanorods release energy through nonradiative decay pathways, locally generating heat that efficiently kills targeted bacterial cells. Specificity was highlighted in the context of a P. aeruginosa biofilm, in which phanorod irradiation killed bacterial cells while causing minimal damage to epithelial cells. Local temperature and viscosity measurements revealed highly localized and selective ablation of the bacteria. Irradiation of the phanorods also destroyed the phages, preventing replication and reducing potential risks of traditional phage therapy while enabling control over dosing.

We found that mupirocin increased the ability of MRSA cells to attach to surfaces and form biofilms. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) demonstrated that mupirocin treatment promoted thicker biofilm formation, which also correlated with the production of extracellular DNA (eDNA). Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) results revealed that this effect was largely due to the involvement of holin-like and antiholin-like proteins (encoded by the cidA gene), which are responsible for modulating cell death and lysis during biofilm development. We found that cidA expression levels significantly increased by 6.05- to 35.52-fold (P < 0.01) after mupirocin administration. We generated a cidA-deficient mutant of the USA300 S. aureus strain.

Moreover, as multidrug resistance is common among S. maltophilia isolates, treatment options for these infections may be limited. Here we investigated the pathogenicity of S. maltophilia alone and during polymicrobial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Colonization, persistence, and virulence of S. maltophilia were assessed in experimental respiratory infections of mice. The results of this study indicate that S. maltophilia transiently colonizes the lung accompanied by significant weight loss and immune cell infiltration, and the expression of early inflammatory markers including IL-6, IL-1α, and TNF-α. Importantly, polymicrobial infection with P. aeruginosa elicited significantly higher S. maltophilia counts in bronchoalveolar lavages and lung tissue homogenates. This increase in bacterial load was directly correlated with the density of the P. aeruginosa population, and required viable P. aeruginosa bacteria. Microscopic analysis of biofilms formed in vitro revealed that S. maltophilia formed well-integrated biofilms with P. aeruginosa, and these organisms colocalize in the lung during dual species infection. Based on these results, we conclude that active cellular processes by P. aeruginosa afford significant benefit to S. maltophilia during polymicrobial infections.

Entering either colonization program, swarming motility or sessility, involves differential regulation of many genes resulting in a dramatic shift in physiology and behavior. V. parahaemolyticus has evolved complex regulation to control these two processes that have opposing outcomes. One mechanism relies on the balance of the second messenger c-di-GMP: high c-di-GMP favors biofilm formation. V. parahaemolyticus possesses four homologous regulators, the Scr transcription factors, that belong in a Vibrio-specific family of W[F/L/M][T/S]R-motif transcriptional regulators, some members of which have been demonstrated to bind c-di-GMP. In this work, we explore the role of these Scr regulators in biofilm development. We show each protein binds c-di-GMP; this binding requires a critical R in the binding motif; and the biofilm-relevant activities of CpsQ, CpsS, and ScrO, but not ScrP are dependent upon second messenger binding. ScrO and CpsQ are the primary drivers of biofilm formation: biofilms are eliminated when both of these regulators are absent. ScrO is most important for capsule expression. CpsQ is most important for RTX-matrix protein expression, although it contributes to capsule expression when c-di-GMP is high. Both regulators contribute to O-antigen ligase expression. ScrP works oppositely in a minor role to repress the ligase gene. CpsS plays a regulatory checkpointing role by negatively modulating expression of these biofilm-pertinent genes under fluctuating c-di-GMP conditions.

Cooling towers are a major source of outbreaks, since they provide ideal conditions for L. pneumophila growth and produce aerosols. In such systems, L. pneumophila typically grow inside protozoan hosts. Several abiotic factors such as water temperature, pipe material and disinfection regime affect the colonization of cooling towers by L. pneumophila. The local physical and biological factors promoting the growth of L. pneumophila in water systems and its spatial distribution are not well understood. Therefore, we built a lab-scale cooling tower to study the dynamics of L. pneumophila colonization in relationship to the resident microbiota and spatial distribution. The pilot was filled with water from an operating cooling tower harboring low levels of L. pneumophila. It was seeded with Vermamoeba vermiformis, a natural host of L. pneumophila, and then inoculated with L. pneumophila. After 92 days of operation, the pilot was disassembled, the water was collected, and biofilm was extracted from the pipes. The microbiome was studied using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes amplicon sequencing. The communities of the water and of the biofilm were highly dissimilar. The relative abundance of Legionella in water samples reached up to 11% whereas abundance in the biofilm was extremely low (≤0.5%). In contrast, the host cells were mainly present in the biofilm. This suggests that L. pneumophila grows in host cells associated with biofilm and is then released back into the water following host cell lysis. In addition, water temperature shaped the bacterial and eukaryotic community of the biofilm, indicating that different parts of the systems may have different effects on Legionella growth.","authors":[{"name":"Adriana Torres Paniagua"},{"name":"Kiran Paranjape"},{"name":"Mengqi Hu"},{"name":"Emilie Bédard"},{"name":"Sébastien P Faucher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cooling towers"},{"word":"Legionella pneumophila"},{"word":"Microbiome"},{"word":"Pilot"},{"word":"Temperature"}]},"article246":{"pmid":"31931147","title":"Activity of Pulmonary Vancomycin Exposures versus Planktonic and Biofilm Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Cystic Fibrosis Sputum.","abs":"Vancomycin is commonly used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease; however, there are limited data to support the in vitro activity of this agent against MRSA isolated from CF sputum.

Methods The present study was undertaken to investigate the biofilm-forming ability, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production of seven uropathogenic isolates comprising both Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The morphological, cultural and biochemical tests for the identification of the isolates, antibiotic susceptibility test, detection of ESBL production, biofilm formation on 96-well microtiter plate and Congo red agar (CRA) media are performed. Results The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles obtained in this study showed that the most active drugs gentamicin, amikacin and imipenem (100% sensitivity) were followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (85% sensitivity), co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin (57% sensitivity) ceftazidime and kanamycin (50% sensitivity). All the isolates showed resistance to amoxicillin followed by ceftriaxone and cefotaxime (71% resistance), and the scenario gets more complicated because of the production of ESBL by five isolates (three E. coli isolates and two K. pneumoniae). The strains were also able to form biofilm as tested on CRA medium and by microtiter plate assay. The correlation between ESBL, non-ESBL and biofilm-producing E. coli and K. pneumonia was determined along with the multiple drug resistance patterns of E. coli and K. pneumonia. Conclusions The findings of the study indicate that the emergence and rapid spread of such multidrug-resistant pathogens are of great concern.

Effects of increasingly stressful levels of air pollutants on the microbial structure of biofilms within BTFs are not well understood, especially for VOCs such as styrene. To investigate the relationship between biofilm biodiversity and operational stability, the temporal dynamics of a biofilm from a biotrickling filter subjected to stepwise increasing levels of air polluted with styrene was investigated using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). As styrene contaminant loads were increased, microbial community composition was distinctly altered and diversity was initially reduced in early stages but gradually stabilized and increased diversity in later stages, suggesting a recovery and acclimatization period within the microbial community during incremental exposure of the pollutant. Although temporary reductions in known styrene-degrading bacterial genera (Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus) occurred under increased styrene loads, stable BTF performance was maintained due to functional redundancy. New candidate genera for styrene degradation (Azoarcus, Dokdonella) were identified in conditions of high styrene loads, and may have supported the observed stable BTF performance throughout the experiment. Styrene inlet load was found to be important modulator of community composition and may have been partly responsible for the observed temporary reductions of Pseudomonas. Notable differences between dominant genera detected via pyrosequencing compared to species detected by PCR-DGGE suggests that simultaneous implementation of both techniques is valuable for fully characterizing dynamic microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Kevin J Portune"},{"name":"M Carmen Pérez"},{"name":"Javier Álvarez-Hornos"},{"name":"Carmen Gabaldón"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biotrickling filter"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Pyrosequencing"},{"word":"Styrene"},{"word":"qPCR"}]},"article271":{"pmid":"31927002","title":"Suppressing the phenotypic virulence factors of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli using marine polysaccharide.","abs":"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is one of the keystone pathogen that cause 80-90% of community acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) and Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs).

Using an in vitro equine model, we investigated the ability of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) formulations to combat synovial fluid biofilm aggregates. Synovial fluid was infected, and biofilm aggregates allowed to form over a 2-hour period. PRP was collected and processed into different formulations by platelet concentration, leukocyte presence, and activation or lysis. Infected synovial fluid was treated with different PRP formulations with or without aminoglycoside cotreatment. Bacterial load (colony-forming unit/mL) was determined by serial dilutions and plate counting at 8 hours posttreatment. All PRP formulations displayed antimicrobial properties; however, formulations containing higher concentrations of platelets without leukocytes had increased antimicrobial activity. Lysis of PRP and pooling of the PRP lysate (PRP-L) from multiple horses as compared to individual horses further increased antimicrobial activity. This activity was lost with the removal of the plasma component or inhibition of the proteolytic activity within the plasma. Fractionation of pooled PRP-L identified the bioactive components to be cationic and low-molecular weight (<10 kDa). Overall, PRP-L exhibited synergism with amikacin against aminoglycoside tolerant biofilm aggregates with greater activity against gram-positive bacteria. In conclusion, the use of PRP-L has the potential to augment current antimicrobial treatment regimens which could lead to a decrease in morbidity and mortality associated with infectious arthritis.","authors":[{"name":"Jessica M Gilbertie"},{"name":"Thomas P Schaer"},{"name":"Alicia G Schubert"},{"name":"Megan E Jacob"},{"name":"Stefano Menegatti"},{"name":"R Ashton Lavoie"},{"name":"Lauren V Schnabel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"equine model"},{"word":"infectious arthritis"},{"word":"platelet-rich plasma"}]},"article289":{"pmid":"31922015","title":"Vitamin E for Prevention of Biofilm-caused Healthcare-associated Infections.","abs":"The healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) occur in patients both in nosocomial environments and in community.

These infections most often take the form of three-dimensional biofilm communities, which are notoriously recalcitrant to antibiotics and immune clearance, contributing to the chronic wound state. In the chronic wound microenvironment, microbial biofilms interact closely with other key components, including host cellular and matrix elements, immune cells, inflammatory factors, signaling components, and mechanical cues. Intricate relationships between these contributing factors not only orchestrate the development and progression of wound infections but also influence the therapeutic outcome. Current medical treatment for chronic wound infections relies heavily on long-term usage of antibiotics; however, their efficacy and reasons for failure remain uncertain. To develop effective therapeutic approaches, it is essential to better understand the complex pathophysiology of the chronic wound infection microenvironment, including dynamic interactions between various key factors. For this, it is critical to develop bioengineered platforms or model systems that not only include key components of the chronic wound infection microenvironment but also recapitulate interactions between these factors, thereby simulating the infection state. In doing so, these platforms will enable the testing of novel therapeutics, alone and in combinations, providing insights toward composite treatment strategies. In the first section of this review, we discuss the key components and interactions in the chronic wound infection microenvironment, which would be critical to recapitulate in a bioengineered platform. In the next section, we summarize the key features and relevance of current bioengineered chronic wound infection platforms. These are categorized and discussed based on the microenvironmental components included and their ability to recapitulate the architecture, interactions, and outcomes of the infection microenvironment. While these platforms have advanced our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of chronic wound infections and provided insights into therapeutics, they possess certain insufficiencies that limit their clinical relevance. In the final section, we propose approaches that can be incorporated into these existing model systems or developed into future platforms developed, thus enhancing their biomimetic and translational capabilities, and thereby their human-relevance.","authors":[{"name":"Snehal Kadam"},{"name":"Shivani Nadkarni"},{"name":"Janhavi Lele"},{"name":"Savani Sakhalkar"},{"name":"Pratiksha Mokashi"},{"name":"Karishma Surendra Kaushik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioengineered platforms"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chronic wounds"},{"word":"ex vivo"},{"word":"in vitro"},{"word":"wound infection"},{"word":"wound models"}]},"article291":{"pmid":"31921811","title":"Nanomedicine Approaches for the Pulmonary Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis.","abs":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease affecting today nearly 70,000 patients worldwide and characterized by a hypersecretion of thick mucus difficult to clear arising from the defective CFTR protein. The over-production of the mucus secreted in the lungs, along with its altered composition and consistency, results in airway obstruction that makes the lungs susceptible to recurrent and persistent bacterial infections and endobronchial chronic inflammation, which are considered the primary cause of bronchiectasis, respiratory failure, and consequent death of patients. Despite the difficulty of treating the continuous infections caused by pathogens in CF patients, various strategies focused on the symptomatic therapy have been developed during the last few decades, showing significant positive impact on prognosis. Moreover, nowadays, the discovery of CFTR modulators as well as the development of gene therapy have provided new opportunity to treat CF. However, the lack of effective methods for delivery and especially targeted delivery of therapeutics specifically to lung tissues and cells limits the efficiency of the treatments. Nanomedicine represents an extraordinary opportunity for the improvement of current therapies and for the development of innovative treatment options for CF previously considered hard or impossible to treat. Due to the peculiar environment in which the therapies have to operate characterized by several biological barriers (pulmonary tract, mucus, epithelia, bacterial biofilm) the use of nanotechnologies to improve and enhance drug delivery or gene therapies is an extremely promising way to be pursued.

P. gingivalis and T. denticola are co-localized in subgingival plaque and have been previously shown to exhibit strong synergy in growth, biofilm formation and virulence in an animal model of disease. The motility of T. denticola, although not considered as a classic virulence factor, may be involved in synergistic biofilm development between P. gingivalis and T. denticola. We determined the role of T. denticola motility in polymicrobial biofilm development using an optimized transformation protocol to produce two T. denticola mutants targeting the motility machinery. These deletion mutants were non-motile and lacked the gene encoding the flagellar hook protein of the periplasmic flagella (ΔflgE) or a component of the stator motor that drives the flagella (ΔmotB). The specificity of these gene deletions was determined by whole genome sequencing. Quantitative proteomic analyses of mutant strains revealed that the specific inactivation of the motility-associated gene, motB, had effects beyond motility. There were 64 and 326 proteins that changed in abundance in the ΔflgE and ΔmotB mutants, respectively. In the ΔflgE mutant, motility-associated proteins showed the most significant change in abundance confirming the phenotype change for the mutant was related to motility. However, the inactivation of motB as well as stopping motility also upregulated cellular stress responses in the mutant indicating pleiotropic effects of the mutation. T. denticola wild-type and P. gingivalis displayed synergistic biofilm development with a 2-fold higher biomass of the dual-species biofilms than the sum of the monospecies biofilms. Inactivation of T. denticola flgE and motB reduced this synergy. A 5-fold reduction in dual-species biofilm biomass was found with the motility-specific ΔflgE mutant suggesting that T. denticola periplasmic flagella are essential in synergistic biofilm formation with P. gingivalis.","authors":[{"name":"Hong Min Ng"},{"name":"Nada Slakeski"},{"name":"Catherine A Butler"},{"name":"Paul D Veith"},{"name":"Yu-Yen Chen"},{"name":"Sze Wei Liu"},{"name":"Brigitte Hoffmann"},{"name":"Stuart G Dashper"},{"name":"Eric C Reynolds"}],"keywords":[{"word":"chronic periodontitis"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"periplasmic flagella"},{"word":"polymicrobial biofilm"},{"word":"quantitative proteomics"}]},"article293":{"pmid":"31921704","title":"Efficacy of Cold Plasma for Direct Deposition of Antibiotics as a Novel Approach for Localized Delivery and Retention of Effect.","abs":"Antimicrobial coating of medical devices has emerged as a potentially effective tool to prevent or ameliorate device-related infections. In this study the plasma deposition process for direct deposition of pharmaceutical drugs on to a range of surfaces and the retention of structure function relationship and antimicrobial efficacy against mono-species biofilms were investigated. Two selected sample antibiotics-ampicillin and gentamicin, were deposited onto two types of surfaces-polystyrene microtiter plates and stainless steel coupons. The antimicrobial efficacy of the antibiotic-coated surfaces was tested against challenge populations of both planktonic and sessile Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with responses monitored for up to 14 days. The plasma deposition process bonded the antibiotic to the surfaces, with localized retention of antibiotic activity. The antibiotics deposited on the test surfaces retained a good efficacy against planktonic cells, and importantly prevented biofilm formation of attached cells for up to 96 h. The antibiotic rapidly eluted from the surface of antibiotic-coated surfaces to the surrounding medium, with retention of effect in this surrounding milieu for up to 2 weeks. Control experiments established that there was no independent antimicrobial or growth promoting effect of the plasma deposition process, where there was no antibiotic in the helium plasma assisted delivery stream. Apart from the flexibility offered through deposition on material surfaces, there was no additive or destructive effect associated with the helium assisted plasma deposition process on the antibiotic. The plasma assisted process was a viable mean of coating clinically relevant materials and developing innovative functional materials with retention of antibiotic activity, without employing a linker or plasma modified polymer, thus minimizing bio-compatibility issues for medical device materials. This offers potential to prevent or control instrumented or non-permanent device associated infection localized to the surgical or implant site.","authors":[{"name":"Agata Los"},{"name":"Dana Ziuzina"},{"name":"Daniela Boehm"},{"name":"Lu Han"},{"name":"Denis O'Sullivan"},{"name":"Liam O'Neill"},{"name":"Paula Bourke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"E. coli"},{"word":"P. aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cold plasma"},{"word":"localized delivery"}]},"article294":{"pmid":"31921700","title":"Switching Lifestyles Is an in vivo Adaptive Strategy of Bacterial Pathogens.","abs":"Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens exist as planktonic cells only at limited times during their life cycle.

Using the Salmonella lifestyle switch as a paradigm, we herein compare how other pathogens alter their lifestyles to enable survival, colonization and persistence in response to different environmental cues.

Further, to ascertain if sub-lethal environmental stress conditions could influence L. monocytogenes survival and growth responses, atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) resistance was evaluated for the cultures exposed to cold (4°C) or acid (pH 4) stress for 1 h. The results demonstrate that both wild-type and knockout mutants were similarly affected after 1 min exposure to ACP (p > 0.05), with a difference in response noted only after 3 min of treatment. While all L. monocytogenes strains exposed to acid/cold stress were hypersensitive to ACP treatment and were significantly reduced or inactivated within 1 min of treatment (p < 0.05). The results indicate sigB and prfA are important for general stress resistance and biofilm, respectively, loss of these two genes significantly reduced bacterial resistance to ACP treatment. In addition, exposure to sub-lethal 1min ACP increased the gene expression of stress associated genes. SigB showed the highest gene expression, increasing by 15.60 fold, followed by gadD2 (7.19) and lmo0799 (8.6) after 1 min exposure.

Various in vitro and in vivo studies have established their antimicrobial spectrum against clinically significant Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic pathogens. The potent activity of levonadifloxacin against MRSA, quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and hetero-vancomycin-intermediate strains is an outcome of its well-differentiated mechanism of action involving preferential targeting to DNA gyrase. Potent anti-staphylococcal activity of levonadifloxacin was also observed in clinically relevant experimental conditions such as acidic pH, the intracellular environment, and biofilms, suggesting that the drug is bestowed with enabling features for the treatment of difficult-to-treat MRSA infections. Levonadifloxacin also retains clinically relevant activity against resistant respiratory pathogens such as macrolide- and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis and, in conjunction with clinically established best-in-class human epithelial lung fluid concentration, has promising potential in the management of recalcitrant respiratory infections. Attractive features, such as resistance to NorA efflux, divergent mechanism of action in S. aureus, cidality against high-inoculum cultures, and low mutant prevention concentration, are likely to confer favorable resistance-suppression features to both agents. In vivo studies have shown promising efficacy in models of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection, respiratory infections, pyelonephritis, and peritonitis at human-equivalent mouse doses. Both formulations were well tolerated in multiple phase I studies and overall showed a dose-dependent exposure. In particular, oral alalevonadifloxacin showed excellent bioavailability (~90%), almost mirroring the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous levonadifloxacin, indicating the prodrug's seamless absorption and efficient cleavage to release the active parent drug. Hepatic impairment studies showed that clinical doses of levonadifloxacin/alalevonadifloxacin are not required to be adjusted for various degrees of hepatic impairment. With the successful completion of phase II and phase III studies for both levonadifloxacin and alalevonadifloxacin, they represent clinically attractive therapeutic options for the treatment of infections caused by multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms. Herein, we review the current evidence on therapeutically appealing attributes of levonadifloxacin and alalevonadifloxacin, which are based on a range of non-clinical in vitro and in vivo investigations and clinical studies.","authors":[{"name":"Sachin S Bhagwat"},{"name":"Manohar Nandanwar"},{"name":"Atul Kansagara"},{"name":"Anusuya Patel"},{"name":"Swapna Takalkar"},{"name":"Rajesh Chavan"},{"name":"Hariharan Periasamy"},{"name":"Ravindra Yeole"},{"name":"Prasad K Deshpande"},{"name":"Satish Bhavsar"},{"name":"Ashima Bhatia"},{"name":"Jaishid Ahdal"},{"name":"Rishi Jain"},{"name":"Mahesh Patel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"WCK 2349"},{"word":"WCK 771"},{"word":"alalevonadifloxacin"},{"word":"broad﻿-spectrum antibiotic"},{"word":"levonadifloxacin"}]},"article307":{"pmid":"31920057","title":"Efficacy of a propolis solution for cleaning complete dentures.","abs":"The efficacy of a propolis solution against denture biofilm was evaluated by means of an in vitro assessment and a cross-over randomized clinical trial.","authors":[{"name":"Raphael Freitas de Souza"},{"name":"Claudia H Silva-Lovato"},{"name":"Carolina Nf de Arruda"},{"name":"Rômulo R Regis"},{"name":"Ana Paula Zanini"},{"name":"Daniele L Longo"},{"name":"Amanda Peracini"},{"name":"Ingrid M de Andrade"},{"name":"Evandro Watanabe"},{"name":"Helena de Fo Paranhos"}],"keywords":[]},"article308":{"pmid":"31920052","title":"Antibacterial properties of silver-loaded gelatin sponges prepared with silver diamine fluoride.","abs":"To evaluate the antibacterial efficiency of silver-loaded gelatin sponges prepared from gelatin and silver diamine fluoride, Ag(NH3)2F.","authors":[{"name":"Linfeng Wu"},{"name":"Shelly K Gareiss"},{"name":"Brian R Morrow"},{"name":"Jegdish P Babu"},{"name":"Timothy Hottel"},{"name":"Franklin Garcia-Godoy"},{"name":"Feng Li"},{"name":"Liang Hong"}],"keywords":[]},"article309":{"pmid":"31919364","title":"Inhibiting bacterial cooperation is an evolutionarily robust anti-biofilm strategy.","abs":"Bacteria commonly form dense biofilms encased in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS).

From the results, it was observed that the glnA mutant strain was attenuated and could reduce tissue damage. 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone (1-HAQ) is a kind of anthraquinones, it exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of S. xylosus and biofilm formation in vitro and provided anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. In addition, the rate at which it inhibits the biofilm, inflammatory factors, and CFU of wild-type strains were significantly higher than that of the mutant strains, indicating that 1-hAQ might have pharmacological effects against S. xylosus through the regulation of GS protein. The effect of 1-hAQ on GS was further confirmed by the down-regulation of glnA expression, reduced GS activity, Gln content and the results of molecular docking. Taken together, these findings suggest that 1-hAQ facilitated a significant attenuation of S. xylosus pathogenicity by regulating the GS protein: a vital virulence factor.

Here, we employ a soft-lithography approach to realize micro- and nanostructured silk fibroin substrates, with different geometries. We show that patterned silk film substrates support mammal cells (HEK-293) adhesion and proliferation, and at the same time, they intrinsically display remarkable antifouling properties. We employ Escherichia coli as representative Gram-negative bacteria, and we observe an up to 66% decrease in the number of bacteria that adhere to patterned silk surfaces as compared to control, flat silk samples. The mechanism leading to the inhibition of biofilm formation critically depends on the microstructure geometry, involving both a steric and a hydrophobic effect. We also couple silk fibroin patterned films to a biocompatible, optically responsive organic semiconductor, and we verify that the antifouling properties are very well preserved.

In order to identify opportunities to improve the efficiency of commercial cleaning solutions used in nanofiltration, we compared the in vitro efficacy of different commercial treatments, with or without the addition of polysaccharidases, to clean fouled membrane samples. The treatments were tested at two stages of biofilm development corresponding to 80 (D80) and 475 (D475) days of filtration in an industrial plant. The cleaning efficiency was evaluated by comparing the ATR-FTIR spectra before and after cleaning. At D80 and D475, all cleaning solutions led to a reduction of infrared signals from the biofilm. At D80, enzymatic alkaline detergent (AEDT) treatment was significantly more effective than alkaline detergent (ADT) treatment in removing proteins, but no significant difference in efficacy between the two treatments was observed for polysaccharides. The addition of polysaccharidases to AEDT did not bring any significant efficiency gain. At D475, ADT and AEDT treatments had the same efficacy, but the addition of polysaccharidases to the AEDT treatment significantly increased the removal of polysaccharides and proteins from the membrane surface. In conclusion, polysaccharidases can increase the in vitro efficacy of a commercially available alkaline enzymatic detergent cleaning solution against sufficiently developed biofilms. These results pave the way for the development of new cleaning solutions containing polysaccharide degrading enzymes for the cleaning of membranes used in the production of drinking water.

Periodontal diseases & dental caries are the most prevalent conditions in which biofilm has established as a primary causative factor. Managing poly-microbial biofilm is the mainstay of periodontal therapy. Plethora of antimicrobials have been used till date to combat biofilm, but the emergence of antibiotic tolerance and resistance in biofilms is a major cause of concern. Apart from use of antimicrobials, various anti-biofilm strategies have evolved which include the use of mechanical, and chemical means to disrupt biofilms. However, none of these approaches have led to desired or optimal biofilm control and hence search for novel approach continues. Shockwaves are used in medical practice for various therapeutic purposes and in local drug delivery, gene therapy, wound healing & regeneration. With this background, a study was designed with an attempt to explore the possibility of using the shockwave for their effect on multispecies oral biofilm development from subgingival plaque samples obtained from chronic periodontitis patients. Plaque samples from 25 patients were used to derive multispecies biofilm which were used to check the efficacy of shockwaves and antibacterial efficacy of four clinically relevant antimicrobials. Biofilms were analyzed by scanning electron microscope; atomic force microscope and their biomass was quantitated by crystal violet staining. Further, a humanized rat model of periodontitis was developed. Patient derived plaque was used to establish periodontitis in healthy rats. The model was validated by performing colony forming unit (CFU) analysis of the infected tissue. The animals were subjected to low intensity shockwaves using a hand-held shockwave generator at the site of infection. Shockwave treatment was done with or without antimicrobial application. The animals were monitored for clearance of infection and for mortality. The results show that shockwave treatment in combination with antimicrobials is significantly effective in clearing a multispecies biofilm. This also brings out the possibility of application of shockwaves in the management of oral biofilms either alone or in combination with established antimicrobial agents. With further research, safety profile validation and clinical trials, shockwaves can be an effective, novel approach in management of biofilm associated periodontal disease.","authors":[{"name":"Akshay Datey"},{"name":"C S Adeeb Thaha"},{"name":"Sudhir R Patil"},{"name":"Jagadeesh Gopalan"},{"name":"Dipshikha Chakravortty"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"humanized rat model"},{"word":"patient sample"},{"word":"periodontitis"},{"word":"shock waves"}]},"article335":{"pmid":"31911489","title":"Computational and Experimental Investigation of Biofilm Disruption Dynamics Induced by High-Velocity Gas Jet Impingement.","abs":"Experimental data showed that high-speed microsprays can effectively disrupt biofilms on their support substratum, producing a variety of dynamic reactions such as elongation, displacement, ripple formation, and fluidization. However, the mechanics underlying the impact of high-speed turbulent flows on biofilm structure is complex under such extreme conditions, since direct measurements of viscosity at these high shear rates are not possible using dynamic testing instruments. Here, we used computational fluid dynamics simulations to assess the complex fluid interactions of ripple patterning produced by high-speed turbulent air jets impacting perpendicular to the surface of Streptococcus mutans biofilms, a dental pathogen causing caries, captured by high-speed imaging. The numerical model involved a two-phase flow of air over a non-Newtonian biofilm, whose viscosity as a function of shear rate was estimated using the Herschel-Bulkley model. The simulation suggested that inertial, shear, and interfacial tension forces governed biofilm disruption by the air jet. Additionally, the high shear rates generated by the jet impacts coupled with shear-thinning biofilm property resulted in rapid liquefaction (within milliseconds) of the biofilm, followed by surface instability and traveling waves from the impact site. Our findings suggest that rapid shear thinning under very high shear flows causes the biofilm to behave like a fluid and elasticity can be neglected. A parametric sensitivity study confirmed that both applied force intensity (i.e., high jet nozzle air velocity) and biofilm properties (i.e., low viscosity and low air-biofilm surface tension and thickness) intensify biofilm disruption by generating large interfacial instabilities.","authors":[{"name":"Lledó Prades"},{"name":"Stefania Fabbri"},{"name":"Antonio D Dorado"},{"name":"Xavier Gamisans"},{"name":"Paul Stoodley"},{"name":"Cristian Picioreanu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"computational fluid dynamics"},{"word":"disruption"},{"word":"high-velocity air jets"},{"word":"non-Newtonian fluid flow"},{"word":"ripples"},{"word":"turbulence"}]},"article336":{"pmid":"31911464","title":"Comparative Transcriptomic and Functional Assessments of Linezolid-Responsive Small RNA Genes in Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus contains a repertoire of at least 50 and possibly 500 small RNAs (sRNAs).

The aim of this review is to highlight existing issues regarding probiotic production and their prescription. The review presents the most recent findings regarding advantages and efficacy of monostrain and multistrain probiotics, preservation of probiotic strains in capsules and microcapsules, production of probiotics in the form of biofilms for improved efficacy and survival, and results of clinical studies evaluating the benefits of probiotics against different pathologies. We believe that this work will be of interest to physicians and researchers alike and will promote the development of new probiotics and ensuing regimens aimed at the treatment of various diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Elizaveta A Trush"},{"name":"Elena A Poluektova"},{"name":"Allan G Beniashvilli"},{"name":"Oleg S Shifrin"},{"name":"Yuri M Poluektov"},{"name":"Vladimir T Ivashkin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Efficacy"},{"word":"Monostrain and multistrain probiotics"},{"word":"Planktonic cells"}]},"article348":{"pmid":"31907625","title":"Triclosan toothpaste as an adjunct therapy to plaque control in children from periodontitis families: a crossover clinical trial.","abs":"Studies have demonstrated that children from aggressive periodontitis (AgP) parents presented precocious alterations in their periodontal condition, and the use of chemical agents in association to plaque control could be useful to control these alterations.

The application of algal-bacterial consortia to treat wastewater has recently attracted considerable attention because mechanical aeration is unnecessary. Therefore, algal-bacterial bioreactors are emerging as alternatives to activated sludge-based bioprocesses. Most studies have used a plate substratum to support the growth of algal-bacterial biofilms, which results in low reactor efficiencies. Usually, 2-10 days are required for targeted pollutant removal effects. Substratum structures can significantly influence reactor efficiencies. Indeed, substratum-free biofilms (granules) generally achieve high reactor efficiencies that rapidly form. 7-12 h are sufficient for a high-level pollutant removal efficiency. However, granule stability must be validated during long-term experiments (>1 year) involving real wastewater. In addition, the application of algal-bacterial membrane bioreactors represents a novel treatment approach. In membrane bioreactors, good reactor efficiencies and stabilities can be achieved. However, the maximum capacity of algal-bacterial membrane bioreactors requires further investigation. In addition, an accurate model for pollutant removal kinetics in algal-bacterial reactors is not yet available but is necessary for reactor control and up-scaling. The microbial and physical structures of algal-bacterial biofilms require more studies to clarify the system. Finally, the operational costs of algal-bacterial systems must be kept low in order to enhance their potential for sewage treatment at large scales. Good illumination control and recycling biomass for biodiesel or methane production could be applied to reducing the operation cost.","authors":[{"name":"Jixiang Yang"},{"name":"Wenxin Shi"},{"name":"Fang Fang"},{"name":"Jinsong Guo"},{"name":"Lunhui Lu"},{"name":"Yan Xiao"},{"name":"Xin Jiang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Sewage"},{"word":"activated sludge"},{"word":"algae"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"granule"},{"word":"membrane bioreactor"},{"word":"wastewater"}]},"article353":{"pmid":"31906551","title":"In Vitro Evaluation of Antibacterial Properties and Smear Layer Removal/Sealer Penetration of a Novel Silver-Citrate Root Canal Irrigant.","abs":"This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a novel silver-citrate root canal irrigation solution (BioAKT) on smear layer removal, sealer penetration after root canal instrumentation and antibacterial activity.

In this work, 85 S. maltophilia strains isolated in several hospital of central Italy and from several clinical settings were evaluated for their genetic relatedness (by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, PFGE), biofilm formation (by microtiter plate assay), and planktonic antibiotic resistance (by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique). The S. maltophilia population showed a high genetic heterogeneity: 64 different PFGE types were identified, equally distributed in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF strains, and some consisted of multiple strains. Most of the strains (88.2%) were able to form biofilm, although non-CF strains were significantly more efficient than CF strains. CF strains produced lower biofilm amounts than non-CF strains, both those from respiratory tracts and blood. Non-CF PFGE types 3 and 27 consisted of strong-producers only. Cotrimoxazole and levofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics, being active respectively against 81.2% and 72.9% of strains. CF strains were significantly more resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam compared to non-CF strains (90% versus 53.3%), regardless of sample type. Among respiratory strains, cotrimoxazole was more active against non-CF than CF strains (susceptibility rates: 86.7% versus 75%). The multidrug resistant phenotype was significantly more prevalent in CF than non-CF strains (90% versus 66.7%). Overall, the multidrug-resistance level was negatively associated with efficiency in biofilm formation. Our results showed, for the first time, that in S. maltophilia both classical planktonic drug resistance and the ability of biofilm formation might favor its dissemination in the hospital setting.

Specifically, colony-type biofilms grown on media with decreased lysogeny broth content exhibited increased spatial expansion and more stable GFP production over the entire growth period. By modeling the surface morphology of colony-type biofilms using confocal and multiphoton microscopy, we analyzed the appearance of distinctive folds or wrinkles that form as a result of lysogeny broth content reduction in the solid agar growth media. When subjected to varying nutritional conditions, the channel-like folds were shown to alter their morphology; growth on nutrient-depleted media was found to trigger the formation of large and straight wrinkles connecting the colony core to its periphery.

We used 630 nm laser diode as an excitation source to enhance the penetration depth and diminish unwanted light scattering, additionally the experiments were performed in planktonic and biofilm cultures to differentiate the results obtained for cells showing various phenotypic characteristics. Based on performed experiments it became obvious that the incubation of C. albicans fungal cells with 5-ALA in the presence of glucose caused a significant increase in concentration of intracellular PpIX, resulting in a higher efficacy of photo-toxic effect. The observed results were rationalized by the role of glucose as an energy source, which supported the active transport of 5-ALA into cells. In contrary to glucose, the presence of human serum caused a significant reduction in PpIX concentration in C. albicans cells with exogenous delivery of 5-ALA, resulting in a less efficient photo-fungicidal effect.

The current study thus identifies and characterizes inhibitors by targeting the normal binding site and also reports the presence of the competo-allosteric site in the same binding tunnel as the normal site. Molecular docking studies proposed two chemical compounds that share a benzamide-benzimidazole (BB) backbone as potent inhibitors that can obstruct the mechanism of DSPI by targeting both the normal and proposed allosteric binding sites.

Furthermore, biofilm production was negatively correlated to the lung lesion scores and tonsillar isolates tended to be more susceptible to antimicrobial substances with high bioavailability than lung isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Doris Aper"},{"name":"Janna Frömbling"},{"name":"Murat Bağcıoğlu"},{"name":"Monika Ehling-Schulz"},{"name":"Isabel Hennig-Pauka"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy"},{"word":"Host adaptation"},{"word":"Persistence"},{"word":"Swine pleuropneumonia"}]},"article372":{"pmid":"31902494","title":"Characterization of the Riemerella anatipestifer M949_RS00050 gene.","abs":"Based on its causing ever-increasing heavy economic losses, Riemerella anatipestifer has been viewed as an important bacterial pathogen in the duck industry worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms regarding its pathogenicity are poorly understood. In our previous study, we have built a random mutagenesis library of Riemerella anatipestifer CH3 using transposon Tn4351. In this study, we screened the library by determining bacterial median lethal dose in ducklings. A mutant strain showed about 376-fold attenuated virulence in comparison with the wild-type strain CH3 was obtained. Subsequently, the Tn4351 inserted gene was identified as M949_RS00050, which encodes a putative protein containing an outer membrane protein beta-barrel domain by genome walking and sequence analyses. Southern blot analysis indicated a single Tn4351 insertion in the CH3 chromosomal DNA. Inactivation of M949_RS00050 gene did not affect bacterial metabolic activity and the silver stained lipopolysaccharide pattern. However, the bacterial sensitivity to normal duck sera killing and bacterial hydrophobicity were dramatically enhanced in the M949_RS00050 gene inactivated mutant strain, compared to its wild-type strain CH3. Moreover, bacterial adherence and invasion abilities, bacterial capsular polysaccharide quantity, biofilm formation capacity and the bacterial virulence of the mutant strain were obviously decreased, compared to the wild-type strain CH3.

Pre-clinical (animal) studies are indispensable for this development. Often, animal infection outcomes bear little relation to human clinical outcome. Here, we review conclusions from pathogen-inoculum dose-finding pilot studies for evaluation of novel infection-control strategies in murine models. Pathogen-inoculum doses are generally preferred that produce the largest differences in quantitative infection outcome parameters between a control and an experimental group, without death or termination of animals due to having reached an inhumane end-point during the study. However, animal death may represent a better end-point for evaluation than large differences in outcome parameters or number of days over which infection persists. The clinical relevance of lower pre-clinical outcomes, such as bioluminescence, colony forming units (CFUs) retrieved or more rapid clearance of infection is unknown, as most animals cure infection without intervention, depending on pathogen-species and pathogen-inoculum dose administered. In human clinical practice, patients suffering from infection present to hospital emergency wards, frequently in life-threatening conditions. Animal infection-models should therefore use prevention of death and recurrence of infection as primary efficacy targets to be addressed by novel strategies. To compensate for increased animal morbidity and mortality, animal experiments should solely be conducted for pre-clinical proof of principle and safety.

Estrogen (E2, 10 nM) significantly increased secretion of the virulence factor pyocyanin by 80% in PsA early infection isolates from female CF patients and by 280% in late infection PsA isolates. Estrogen also increased the swarming motility by up to 50% in all PsA isolates and strains tested in 0.5% agar. A significant increase of 110% in the twitching motility of all PsA isolates and strains tested was also observed with estrogen treatment. Treatment with E2 increased biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PsAO1 which became more adherent to, and invasive into, normal and CF bronchial epithelial cells. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), Tamoxifen and ICI 182780 inhibited P. aeruginosa motility. The potency of various steroid hormones to stimulate motility of P. aeruginosa was in the order; estradiol ≫ estrone > E3 estriol ≥ testosterone ≥ progesterone ≫ aldosterone, cortisol. Estrogen was also shown to reduce ciliary beat intensity in CF bronchial epithelium which would further exacerbate PsA trapping and virulence in the CF airways. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that estrogen exacerbates P. aeruginosa virulence factors and enhances bacterial interactions with CF bronchial epithelium which can be inhibited by tamoxifen.

In central Appalachia, surface coal mining is a common Se source to headwater streams, thus providing a useful system to investigate Se bioaccumulation in headwater food chains and possible longitudinal patterns in Se concentrations. Toward that end, we assessed Se bioaccumulation in 2 reference and 4 mining-influenced headwater streams. At each stream, we sampled ecosystem media, including streamwater, particulate matter (sediment, biofilm, leaf detritus), benthic macroinvertebrates, salamanders, and fish, every 400 m along 1.2- and 1.6-km reaches. We compared media Se concentrations within and among streams and evaluated longitudinal trends in media Se concentrations. Selenium concentrations in sampled media were higher in mining-influenced streams compared with reference streams. We found the highest Se concentrations in benthic macroinvertebrates; however, salamanders and fish bioaccumulated Se to potentially harmful levels in mining-influenced streams. Only one stream demonstrated dilution of streamwater Se with distance downstream, and few longitudinal patterns in Se bioaccumulation occurred along our study reaches. Collectively, our results provide a field-based assessment of Se bioaccumulation in headwater food chains, from streamwater to fish, and highlight the need for future assessments of Se effects in headwater streams and receiving downstream waters.

To study the effect of AhyI protein and its acetylation modification on the physiological traits of A. hydrophila, the site-directed mutagenesis strains including ΔahyI::ahyI-K7Q and ΔahyI::ahyI-K7R were made in this study. The mutation at K7 site of lysine acetylation in AhyI protein decreased the protease production, but the lysine acetylations do not affect the biofilm formation and hemolysin production. To further study the effect of lysine acetylation on AI-1 signal molecule production, the acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) extraction and bioluminescence quantification were performed.

However, local delivery of drug not only addresses these limitations but also provides better efficacy at the site of infection. In the present study, hydrogel preparations were developed for the topical delivery of moxifloxacin for the treatment of S. aureus-infected burn wound. Moxifloxacin was characterized by UV, FTIR, DSC, hot-stage microscopy, NMR, and HPLC and loaded into conventional and Boswellia-containing novel gels. Gels were characterized by visual examination, pH, UV spectroscopy, and release assays. In vivo studies showed that both gels were effective in eradicating the bacteria completely from the wound site when treatment was started during the early stage of infection. On the contrary, delayed treatment of planktonic and biofilm cells with novel gel showed better efficacy as compared with conventional gel in S. aureus-infected burn wound. Histopathological analysis also showed better skin healing efficacy of novel gel than conventional gel. Our results show that moxifloxacin can be efficiently used topically in the management of burn wound infections along with other antibacterial agents.

There are four SODs in Bacillus cereus 0-9, and this coexistence of multiple homologous enzymes is of great significance in the evolution of bacteria. We hypothesized that the four sod genes in B. cereus 0-9 constituted non-redundant protection against oxidative damage in vivo and played unique roles in the pathogenicity of B. cereus 0-9 during different phases or growth environments. To test this hypothesis, we constructed four single-knockout mutants (∆sodA1, ∆sodA2, ∆sodS, and ∆sodC) and a mutant lacking all four sod genes (∆sod-4) of B. cereus 0-9 and assessed their various phenotypes. Our results indicated that sodA1 plays a major role in tolerance to intracellular oxidative stress and spore formation. The ∆sodA1 and ∆sod-4 mutants were very sensitive to oxidants. The spore formation of the ∆sodA1 mutant was dramatically delayed, and the ∆sod-4 mutant did not form any spores under our experimental conditions. The sodA2 gene may play an important role in negative regulation of swarming motility, pathogenicity, and phospholipase and haemolytic activity of B. cereus but also a role in positive regulation of biofilm formation under our experimental conditions. The other two genes, sodS and sodC, were key to the pathogenicity of B. cereus. The lethal rates of Helicoverpa armigera infected by the ∆sodS and ∆sodC mutants were only 26.67%, while wild-type B. cereus 0-9 caused lethality in up to 86.67% of the insects at 24 h after injection. Moreover, the ∆sod-4 mutant caused a reduced death rate of H. armigera of 46.70%, which was slightly higher than that caused by the ∆sodS and ∆sodC strains. Thus, these four sod genes were non-redundant for oxidative stress and may play different additional roles in B. cereus 0-9.

Its ability to form biofilm can be affected by multiple environmental factors. In this study, the effect of salinity on biofilm formation by S. enterica was evaluated by using two recently isolated strains of Salmonella serotypes Enteritidis and Newport. Although supplementing the growth medium with a low concentration (0.5 to 2%) of sodium chloride (NaCl) slightly enhanced biofilm formation for the strain S. enterica serovar Enteritidis 110, it sharply reduced or abolished biofilm formation by the strain S. enterica serovar Newport 193. This differential effect of salinity on S. enterica strains of different serotypes was poorly correlated with inhibition of planktonic growth but strongly correlated with cell motility. Examining genes known to affect biofilm formation showed that the expression of adrA, csgD, and fliC, which encode proteins required for surface adhesion and cell motility, was significantly downregulated with salinity increase in Salmonella Newport 193 but not in Salmonella Enteritidis 110. Therefore, it is plausible that the differential effect of salinity on biofilm formation by Salmonella Enteritidis 110 and Salmonella Newport 193 resulted from the differential regulation to genes required for cell adherence and motility.","authors":[{"name":"Lihong Gu"},{"name":"Qian Chen"},{"name":"Ailing Guo"},{"name":"Wukang Liu"},{"name":"Yao Ruan"},{"name":"Xinshuai Zhang"},{"name":"Xiangwu Nou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cell motility"},{"word":"Gene expression regulation"},{"word":"Salinity"},{"word":"Salmonella enterica"}]},"article418":{"pmid":"31894974","title":"Plasticizer Degradation by Marine Bacterial Isolates: A Proteogenomic and Metabolomic Characterization.","abs":"Many commercial plasticizers are toxic endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are added to plastics during manufacturing and may leach out once they reach the environment. Traditional phthalic acid ester plasticizers (PAEs), such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), are now increasingly being replaced with more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC). While the metabolic pathways for PAE degradation have been established in the terrestrial environment, to our knowledge, the mechanisms for ATBC biodegradation have not been identified previously and plasticizer degradation in the marine environment remains underexplored. From marine plastic debris, we enriched and isolated microbes able to grow using a range of plasticizers and, for the first time, identified the pathways used by two phylogenetically distinct bacteria to degrade three different plasticizers (i.e., DBP, DEHP, and ATBC) via a comprehensive proteogenomic and metabolomic approach. This integrated multi-OMIC study also revealed the different mechanisms used for ester side-chain removal from the different plasticizers (esterases and enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway) as well as the molecular response to deal with toxic intermediates, that is, phthalate, and the lower biodegrading potential detected for ATBC than for PAE plasticizers. This study highlights the metabolic potential that exists in the biofilms that colonize plastics-the Plastisphere-to effectively biodegrade plastic additives and flags the inherent importance of microbes in reducing plastic toxicity in the environment.","authors":[{"name":"Robyn J Wright"},{"name":"Rafael Bosch"},{"name":"Matthew I Gibson"},{"name":"Joseph A Christie-Oleza"}],"keywords":[]},"article419":{"pmid":"31894496","title":"Description of the novel planctomycetal genus Bremerella, containing Bremerella volcania sp. nov., isolated from an active volcanic site, and reclassification of Blastopirellula cremea as Bremerella cremea comb. nov.","abs":"Planctomycetes are part of the PVC superphylum together with Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydiae and others.

Results showed that in P. aeruginosa isolated from burn wound, the expression of flagellar gene (flgK), pilin gene (pilA) and fimbriae gene (cupA1) was significantly down-regulated indicating that Peganum harmala antimicrobial peptides (PhAMP) damage locomotors of planktonic cells by affecting the gene expression while in resistant biofilm cells, the expression of flgK, cupA1 and polysaccharide synthesis gene (pslA) was enhanced in the presence of PhAMP.

Dysphagia, which is associated with malnutrition and dehydration, is recognized as one of the major pathophysiological mechanism leading to pneumonia and its screening is crucial for the pneumonia risk assessment. The impairment in the oropharyngeal reflexes results in stagnation of foreign material in the lateral cavities of the pharynx which may then get aspirated repeatedly in the lungs and cause pneumonia. Pneumonia prevention starts with lifestyle modifications such as alcohol and tobacco cessation. A careful review of the risk-benefit of the prescribed medication is critical and adaptation may be required in elders with multiple morbidities.

Current practices of physically blending high-dose antibiotics with bone cements is known for cytotoxicity while covalently tethering antibiotics to implant surfaces is ineffective in eradicating bacteria from the periprosthetic tissue environment due to the short-range bactericidal actions, which are limited to the implant surface. Here, we covalently functionalize poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate hydrogel coatings with vancomycin via an oligonucleotide linker sensitive to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) micrococcal nuclease (MN) (PEGDMA-Oligo-Vanco). This design enables the timely release of vancomycin in the presence of S. aureus to kill the bacteria both on the implant surface and within the periprosthetic tissue environment. Ti6Al4V intramedullary (IM) pins surface-tethered with dopamine methacrylamide (DopaMA) and uniformly coated with PEGDMA-Oligo-Vanco effectively prevented periprosthetic infections in mouse femoral canals inoculated with bioluminescent S. aureus. Longitudinal bioluminescence monitoring, μCT quantification of femoral bone changes, end point quantification of implant surface bacteria, and histological detection of S. aureus in the periprosthetic tissue environment confirmed rapid and sustained bacterial clearance by the PEGDMA-Oligo-Vanco coating. The observed eradication of bacteria was in stark contrast with the significant bacterial colonization on implants and osteomyelitis development found in the absence of the MN-sensitive bactericidal coating. The effective vancomycin tethering dose presented in this on-demand release strategy was >200 times lower than the typical prophylactic antibiotic contents used in bone cements and may be applied to medical implants and bone/dental cements to prevent periprosthetic infections in high-risk clinical scenarios.

Among a total of 18 high-affinity binding targets of YiaJ, the major regulatory target was identified to be the yiaLMNOPQRS operon for utilization of ascorbate from fruits and galacturonate from plant pectin. The targets of YiaJ also include the genes involved in the utilization for other plant-derived materials as nutrients such as fructose, sorbitol, glycerol and fructoselysine. Detailed in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that L-ascorbate and α-D-galacturonate are the effector ligands for regulation of YiaJ function. These findings altogether indicate that YiaJ plays a major regulatory role in expression of a set of the genes for the utilization of plant-derived materials as nutrients for survival.
