However, most of these natural habitats share plant-derived sucrose, which can be metabolized by some AAB via polyfructose building levansucrases (LS) known to be involved in biofilm formation. Here, we propose two LS types (T) encoded by AAB as determinants for habitat selection, which emerged from vertical (T1) and horizontal (T2) lines of evolution and differ in their genetic organization, structural features and secretion mechanism, as well as their occurrence in proteobacteria. T1-LS are secreted by plant-pathogenic α- and γ-proteobacteria, while T2-LS genes are common in diazotrophic, plant-growth-promoting α-, β- and γ-proteobacteria. This knowledge may be exploited for a better understanding of microbial ecology, plant health and biofilm formation by sucrase-secreting proteobacteria in eukaryotic hosts.","authors":[{"name":"Frank Jakob"},{"name":"Yamira Quintero"},{"name":"Alexis Musacchio"},{"name":"Paulina Estrada-de Los Santos"},{"name":"Lázaro Hernández"},{"name":"Rudi F Vogel"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"31373891","title":"Streptococcus mutans Biofilm Formation and Cell Viability on Polymer-infiltrated Ceramic and Yttria-stabilized Polycrystalline Zirconium Dioxide Ceramic.","abs":"The aim of this study was to investigate the biofilm formation and cell viability of a polymer-infiltrated ceramic (PIC) and an yttria-stabilized polycrystalline zirconium dioxide ceramic (Y-TZP).

Biofilm-forming rhizobacteria, which harbor multifarious plant growth promoting traits and tolerance to abiotic stress, are believed to benefit plant health and production even under environmental stresses. The primary objective of this study was to investigate indigenous biofilm-forming rhizobacteria (Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus sp., Pantoea sp., Brevibacterium sp. and Acinetobacter sp.) for their functional diversity relevant to plant growth promoting activities, biofilm development and tolerance to abiotic stress conditions. The most promising isolates among FAP1, FAP2, FAP3, FAP4, FAP5, FAP10, FAB1, FAB3 and FAA1 were selected. Rhizobacteria exhibited high tolerance to salinity (1.5 M NaCl) and drought stress (up to 55% PEG-6000) conditions in vitro. The isolates demonstrated varying levels of PGP activities (IAA production and phosphate solubilization), biofilm development, and production of alginate and exopolysaccharides in the presence of salinity, drought stress and elevated temperature. Further efficacy of the isolates was demonstrated by inoculating to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants in greenhouse conditions under both normal and drought stress for up to 30 days inoculation. The plant growth potential of the isolates was in the order of FAP3 > FAB3 > FAB1 > FAP10 > FAP5 > FAP4 > FAA1 > FAP2 > FAP1. The present study resulted in successful selection of promising PGPR as identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.

It has known that, in commensalism and coexistence between microorganisms and the host, homeostasis in the oral microbiome is preserved. Nonetheless, under some conditions, a parasitic relationship dominates the existing situation and the rise of cariogenic microorganisms results in dental caries. Utilizing advanced molecular biology techniques, new cariogenic microorganisms species have been discovered. The oral microbiome of each person is quite distinct. Consequently, commonly taken measures for disease prevention cannot be exactly the same for other individuals. The chance for developing tooth decay in individuals is dependent on factors such as immune system and oral microbiome which itself is affected by the environmental and genetic determinants. Early detection of dental caries, assessment of risk factors and designing personalized measure let dentists control the disease and obtain desired results.

To overcome these challenges, investigators should search for early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. More than 700 bacterial species reside in the oral cavity. The oral microbiome population varies by saliva and different habitats of oral cavity. Tobacco, alcohol, and betel nut, which are causative factors of oral cancer, may alter the oral microbiome composition. Both pathogenic and commensal strains of bacteria have significantly contributed to oral cancer. Numerous bacterial species in the oral cavity are involved in chronic inflammation that lead to development of oral carcinogenesis. Bacterial products and its metabolic by-products may induce permanent genetic alterations in epithelial cells of the host that drive proliferation and/or survival of epithelial cells. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum induce production of inflammatory cytokines, cell proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis, cellular invasion, and migration thorough host cell genomic alterations. Recent advancement in metagenomic technologies may be useful in identifying oral cancer-related microbiome, their genomes, virulence properties, and their interaction with host immunity. It is very important to address which bacterial species is responsible for driving oral carcinogenesis.

A step-by-step approach was used to determine the technological properties of the isolated yeast strains. The enzymatic activity (catalase, urease, β-glucosidase, protease, and lipase) under adverse conditions (pH, salt, and temperature) were evaluated. Principal component analysis was used to assess data. Twenty-five strains with desirable technological properties were selected for evaluation of probiotic traits (tolerance at pH 2.5 and 0.3% bile salts, antimicrobial activity, hydrophobic properties, and biofilm production). These isolates were identified by sequencing the D1/D2 region of 26S rDNA. Finally, seven isolates with desirable probiotic traits were analyzed for their ability to survive through gastric transit using a gastrointestinal simulation model. An In vitro test showed that isolates 3, 12, 19, 24, and 43 exhibited high survival levels (60%-70%), similar to those of the indicator strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The results suggest that five isolates (S. cerevisiae strains 3, 12, 19, 24, and 43) showed desirable technological properties and probiotic traits and therefore can be used as functional starter cultures to produce fermented fish products. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Researchers have investigated the activity of LAB as functional and probiotic microorganisms; however, information on the probiotic potential of yeasts remains limited. Yeasts are microorganisms that present and induce biochemical changes in several fermented meat and fish products. In the present study, the technological and probiotic properties of 52 isolates from Suan yu were investigated to identify potential probiotic strains for starter cultures. Our results suggest that five isolated S. cerevisiae strains showed desirable technological properties and probiotic traits and therefore can be used as functional starter cultures to produce fermented fish products, and other fermented foods. Functional yeast isolates are used to effectively improve the quality of fermented fish products for consumer acceptance. This study has focused on the possibility to produce a functional Suan yu using a potential probiotic S. cerevisiae as starter culture to enhance health benefits.","authors":[{"name":"Xuefeng Zeng"},{"name":"Jin Fan"},{"name":"Laping He"},{"name":"Zhenhua Duan"},{"name":"Wenshui Xia"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Suan yu"},{"word":"multivariate analyses"},{"word":"probiotic"},{"word":"yeasts"}]},"article25":{"pmid":"31368351","title":"Inactivation of oral biofilms using visible light and water-filtered infrared A radiation and indocyanine green.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Thomas Burchard"},{"name":"Lamprini Karygianni"},{"name":"Elmar Hellwig"},{"name":"Marie Follo"},{"name":"Thomas Wrbas"},{"name":"Annette Wittmer"},{"name":"Kirstin Vach"},{"name":"Ali Al-Ahmad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ICG"},{"word":"VIS+wIRA"},{"word":"aPDT"},{"word":"antimicrobial photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"indocyanine green"},{"word":"oral biofilm"},{"word":"visible light and water-filtered infrared A"}]},"article26":{"pmid":"31368074","title":"Optimized aeration strategies for nitrogen removal efficiency: application of end gas recirculation aeration in the fixed bed biofilm reactor.","abs":"Aeration strategy played an important role in reactor performance.

Recently, we have shown that distinct sets of residues in its periplasmic HmsP sensory domain are involved in the regulation of biofilm formation or antibiotic tolerance. Interestingly, the HmsP domain of the phosphodiesterase BifA shows great predicted structural similarity to that of SagS, despite moderate sequence conservation and only a number of residues involved in SagS signaling being conserved between both proteins. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that BifA and SagS may use similar mechanisms to sense and transduce signals perceived at their periplasmic HmsP domains and, therefore, may be interchangeable. To test this hypothesis, we constructed SagS hybrids in which the HmsP domain of SagS was replaced by that of BifA (and vice versa) or by the DISMED2 sensory domain of NicD. The SagS-BifA hybrid restored attachment and biofilm formation by the ΔbifA mutant. Likewise, while the NicD-SagS hybrid was nonfunctional, the BifA-SagS hybrid partially restored pathways leading to biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance in a ΔsagS mutant background. Furthermore, alanine substitution of key residues previously associated with the biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance pathways of SagS impaired signal transduction by the BifA-SagS hybrid in a similar way to SagS.

Effects of DEET exposure were assessed in microbial communities using a wide variety of measures. Communities developed in rotating annular reactors with either 100 or 500 ng/L DEET, verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. Microscale analyses indicated that both DEET concentrations resulted in significant (p < 0.05) declines in photosynthetic biomass, whereas bacterial biomass was unaffected. There was no detectable effect of DEET on the levels of chlorophyll a. However, pigment analyses indicated substantial shifts in algal-cyanobacterial community structure, with reductions of green algae and some cyanobacterial groups at 500 ng/L DEET. Protozoan/micrometazoan grazers increased in communities exposed to 500 ng/L, but not 100 ng/L, DEET. Based on thymidine incorporation or utilization of carbon sources, DEET had no significant effects on metabolic activities. Fluorescent lectin-binding analyses showed significant (p < 0.05) changes in glycoconjugate composition at both DEET concentrations, consistent with altered community structure. Principal component cluster analyses of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that DEET exposure at either concentration significantly changed the bacterial community (p < 0.05).

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of polyP3 against Porphyromonas gulae, Porphyromonas cansulci, and Porphyromonas cangingivalis were between 500 and 750 mg/L. PolyP3 significantly decreased viable planktonic cells as well as bacterial biofilm formation, even at sub-MIC concentrations. PolyP3 caused bacterial membrane disruption and this effect was most prominent in P. cangingivalis, which was demonstrated by measuring the amount of nucleotide leakage from the cells. To further investigate the mode of action of polyP3, high-throughput whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed using P. gulae. Approximately 30% of the total genes of P. gulae were differentially expressed by polyP3 (> 4-fold, adjusted p value < 0.01).

The low concentration of oxygen and nutrients in this environment leads to heterogeneous phenotypic changes in the bacteria, with antimicrobial tolerance being of paramount importance. As with other antibiotics, the activity of colistin is impaired by biofilm-embedded bacteria. Therefore, the recommendation for administering high doses in combination with a second drug, indicated for planktonic infections, remains valid in this setting. Notably, colistin has activity against metabolically inactive biofilm-embedded cells located in the inner layers of the biofilm structure. This is opposite and complementary to the activity of other antimicrobials that are able to kill metabolically active cells in the outer layers of the biofilm. Several experimental models have shown a higher activity of colistin when used in combination with other agents, and have reported that this can avoid the emergence of colistin-resistant subpopulations. Most experience of colistin in biofilm-associated infections comes from patients with cystic fibrosis, where the use of nebulized colistin allows high concentrations to reach the site of the infection. However, limited clinical experience is available in other scenarios, such as osteoarticular infections or device-related central nervous system infections caused by multi-drug resistant microorganisms. In the latter scenario, the use of intraventricular or intrathecal colistin also permits high local concentrations and good clinical results. Overall, the efficacy of intravenous colistin seems to be poor, but its association with a second antimicrobial significantly increases the response rate. Given its activity against inner bioflm-embedded cells, its possible role in combination with other antibiotics, beyond last-line therapy situations, should be further explored.","authors":[{"name":"Jaime Lora-Tamayo"},{"name":"Oscar Murillo"},{"name":"Javier Ariza"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"Implant-associated infection"},{"word":"Polymyxin"},{"word":"Prosthetic joint infection"}]},"article42":{"pmid":"31363941","title":"Mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptide P5 truncations against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"Rates of microbial drug resistance are increasing worldwide; therefore, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising alternative therapeutic agents to antibiotics.

Treatment of S. aureus with the antiseptic chloroxylenol alone did not decrease biofilm cell viability; however, the combination of chloroxylenol and P. aeruginosa supernatant led to a 4-log reduction in S. aureus biofilm viability compared to exposure to chloroxylenol alone. We found that the P. aeruginosa-produced small molecule 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) is responsible for the observed heightened sensitivity of S. aureus to chloroxylenol. Similarly, HQNO increased the susceptibility of S. aureus biofilms to other compounds, including both traditional and nontraditional antibiotics, which permeabilize bacterial membranes.

Our aim was to determine the role of chemical feedback in the dynamics. The feedback was applied through the enzymatic rate dependence on pH, as pH is an important parameter that controls the rates of processes in cells. We found that a switch in pH can be used to drive base-catalyzed gelation or precipitation of a substance in the external solution. A critical density of cells was required for gelation that was essentially independent of the pH-driven feedback. However, the cell pH reached a higher maximum as a result of the appearance of pH oscillations with feedback. Thus, we conclude that while feedback may not play a vital role in some density-dependent behavior in cellular systems, it nevertheless can be exploited to activate internally regulated cell processes at low cell densities.","authors":[{"name":"Tamás Bánsági"},{"name":"Annette F Taylor"}],"keywords":[{"word":"autocatalysis"},{"word":"bioinspired systems"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"reaction networks"},{"word":"systems chemistry"}]},"article48":{"pmid":"31362224","title":"Bio-carrier and operating temperature effect on ammonia removal from secondary wastewater effluents using moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR).","abs":"This study investigates the impact of bio-carriers' surface area and shape, wastewater chemistry and operating temperature on ammonia removal from real wastewater effluents using Moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) operated with three different AnoxKaldness bio-carriers (K","authors":[{"name":"Amal Ashkanani"},{"name":"Fares Almomani"},{"name":"Majeda Khraisheh"},{"name":"Rahul Bhosale"},{"name":"Muhammad Tawalbeh"},{"name":"Khaled AlJaml"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm growth"},{"word":"Clogging"},{"word":"Nitrification"},{"word":"Organic loading"},{"word":"Performance"},{"word":"Secondary effluents"},{"word":"Total nitrogen"}]},"article49":{"pmid":"31362210","title":"Enhanced microbial metabolism in one stage partial nitritation-anammox system treating low strength wastewater by novel composite carrier.","abs":"One stage partial nitritation-anammox (PN-A) process has attracted more and more attention due to the low investment cost but the instability in treating low strength wastewater.

In these social environments, microbes compete and cooperate for resources, such as living space and nutrients. The metabolic activities of bacteria can transform their microenvironment and dynamically influence the fitness and growth of cohabitating organisms. Biofilm communities are temporally and spatially organized largely due to cell-to-cell communication, which promotes synergistic interactions. Metabolic interactions maintain biofilm homeostasis through mutualistic cross-feeding, metabolic syntrophy, and cross-respiration. These interactions include reciprocal metabolite exchanges that promote the growth of physiologically compatible bacteria, processive catabolism of complex substrates, and unidirectional interactions that are globally important for the polymicrobial community. Additionally, oral bacterial interactions can lead to detoxification of oxidative compounds, which will provide protection to the community at large. It has also been established that specific organisms provide terminal electron acceptors to partner species that result in a shift from fermentation to respiration, thus increasing ATP yields and improving fitness. Indeed, many interspecies relationships are multidimensional, and the net outcome can be spatially and temporally dependent. Cross-kingdom interactions also occur as oral yeast are antagonistic to some oral bacteria, while numerous mutualistic interactions contribute to yeast-bacterial colonization, fitness in the oral community, and the pathogenesis of caries. Consideration of this social environment reveals behaviors and phenotypes that are not apparent through the study of microbes in isolation.

A potential method to treat such chronic infections is to combine agents which interfere with bacterial biofilm development together with an antibiotic in a single formulation. Here, we explore the use of a new bioresponsive polymer formulation derived from specifically modified alginate nanoparticles (NPs) in order to deliver ciprofloxacin (CIP) in combination with the quorum sensing inhibitor (QSI) 3-amino-7-chloro-2-nonylquinazolin-4(3H)-one (ACNQ) to mature Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The alginate NPs were engineered to incorporate a pH-responsive linker between the polysaccharide backbone and the QSI, and to encapsulate CIP via charge-charge interactions of the positively-charged drug with the carboxyl residues of the alginate matrix. In this way, a dual-action release of antibiotic and QSI was designed for the low-pH regions of a biofilm, involving cleavage of the QSI-linker to the alginate matrix and reduced charge-charge interactions between CIP and the polysaccharide as the alginate carboxyl side-chains protonated. When tested in a biofilm model the concomitant release of CIP + QSI from the pH-responsive nanoparticles significantly reduced the viability of the biofilm compared with CIP treatment alone. In addition, the alginate NPs were shown to penetrate deeply into P. aeruginosa biofilms, which we attribute in part to the charges of the NPs and the release of the QSI agent. Finally, we tested the formulation in both a 2D keratinocyte and a 3D ex vivo skin infection model. The dual-action bio-responsive QSI and CIP release nanoparticles effectively cleared the infection in the latter, suggesting considerable promise for combination therapeutics which prevent biofilm formation as well as effectively killing mature P. aeruginosa biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Nishant Singh"},{"name":"Manuel Romero"},{"name":"Alessandra Travanut"},{"name":"Patricia F Monteiro"},{"name":"Elena Jordana-Lluch"},{"name":"Kim R Hardie"},{"name":"Paul Williams"},{"name":"Morgan R Alexander"},{"name":"Cameron Alexander"}],"keywords":[]},"article86":{"pmid":"31355394","title":"Highly branched poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) functionalized with an inducer molecule suppresses quorum sensing in Chromobacterium violaceum.","abs":"Bacterial quorum sensing has been implicated in a number of pathogenic bacterial processes, such as biofilm formation, making it a crucial target for developing materials with a novel antibiotic mode of action.

Many studies have revealed the virulence traits of L. pneumophila using clinical strains and a number of studies for characterizing environmental strains are also reported. However, the association between the virulence and survivability in the environment is unclear. In the present study, L. pneumophila was isolated from environmental water sites (Ashiyu foot spa, water fountain, and public bath), and the serogroups of isolated strains were determined by serological tests. Isolated strains were found to belong to serogroups SG1, SG2, SG3, SG4, SG5, SG8, SG9, and SG13. Untypeable strains were also obtained. Isolated strains were used for intracellular growth assay in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1. Among these strains, only an untypeable strain, named AY3, failed to replicate in THP-1. In addition, AY3 was maintained for a long period in an environmental water site, Ashiyu foot spa 2. Further, we compared the characteristics of several strains isolated from Ashiyu foot spa 2 and a clinical strain, Togus-1. AY3 failed to replicate in THP-1 cells but replicated in an amoeba model, Dictyostelium discoideum. Compared with Togus-1, the culturable cell number of environmental strains under stress conditions was higher. Moreover, biofilm formation was assessed, and AY3 showed the same degree of biofilm formation as Togus-1. Biofilm formation, replication in amoebae, and resistance against stress factors would explain the predominance of AY3 at one environmental site. Although the mechanism underlying the difference in the ability of AY3 to replicate in THP-1 cells or amoebae is still unclear, AY3 may abandon the ability to replicate in THP-1 cells to survive in one environment for a long period. Understanding the mechanisms of L. pneumophila in replication within different hosts should help in the control of Legionnaires' disease, but further study is necessary.","authors":[{"name":"Takashi Nishida"},{"name":"Natsuko Nakagawa"},{"name":"Kenta Watanabe"},{"name":"Takashi Shimizu"},{"name":"Masahisa Watarai"}],"keywords":[]},"article88":{"pmid":"31355200","title":"Acne and Stress: Impact of Catecholamines on Cutibacterium acnes.","abs":"Cutibacterium acnes (former Propionibacterium acnes), is a bacterium characterized by high genomic variability, consisting of four subtypes and six major ribotypes.

We previously isolated and characterized two P. gingivalis strains, one from a patient exhibiting severe chronic periodontitis (CP3) and another from a periodontally healthy individual (H3). We previously showed that CP3 and H3 exhibit differences in virulence since H3 showed a lower resistance to cationic peptides compared with CP3, and a lower ability to induce proliferation in gingival epithelial cells. Here, we aimed to determine whether differences in virulence between these two strains are associated with the presence or absence of specific genes encoding virulence factors. We sequenced the whole genomes of both P. gingivalis CP3 and H3 and conducted a comparative analysis regarding P. gingivalis virulence genetic determinants. To do so, we performed a homology search of predicted protein sequences in CP3 and H3 genomes against the most characterized virulence genes for P. gingivalis available in the literature. In addition, we performed a genomic comparison of CP3 and H3 with all the 62 genomes of P. gingivalis found in NCBI's RefSeq database. This approach allowed us to determine the evolutionary relationships of CP3 and H3 with other virulent and avirulent strains; and additionally, to detect variability in presence/absence of virulence genes among P. gingivalis genomes. Our results show genetic variability in the hemagglutinin genes. While CP3 possesses one copy of hagA and two of hagC, H3 has no hagA and only one copy of hagC. Experimentally, this finding is related to lower in vitro hemmaglutination ability of H3 compared to CP3. Moreover, while CP3 encodes a gene for a major fimbrium subunit FimA type 4 (CP3_00160), H3 possess a FimA type 1 (H3_01400). Such genetic differences are in agreement with both lower biofilm formation ability and less intracellular invasion to oral epithelial cells exhibited by H3, compared with the virulent strain CP3. Therefore, here we provide new results on the genome sequences, comparative genomics analyses, and phenotypic analyses of two P. gingivalis strains. The genomics comparison of these two strains with the other 62 genomes included in the analysis provided relevant results regarding genetic determinants and their association with P. gingivalis virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Katterinne N Mendez"},{"name":"Anilei Hoare"},{"name":"Cristopher Soto"},{"name":"Isaac Bugueño"},{"name":"Marcela Olivera"},{"name":"Claudio Meneses"},{"name":"Jose Manuel Pérez-Donoso"},{"name":"Eduardo Castro-Nallar"},{"name":"Denisse Bravo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Porphyromonas gingivalis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"comparative genomics"},{"word":"fimbrium"},{"word":"hemagglutination"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article90":{"pmid":"31354823","title":"Effects of Active Oxygen Toothpaste in Supragingival Biofilm Reduction: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.","abs":"Gingivitis is still considered a major risk factor for the occurrence and progression of periodontal disease.

However, periodic outbreaks of bacterial diseases in the fish farms represent a large problem, both economically and ethically. Therefore it is important to obtain a better understanding of how microbial communities develop in these production facilities. Knowledge on the characteristics of microbial communities associated with healthy fish could also enable detection of changes associated with disease outbreaks at an early stage. In this study we have monitored microbial communities in a fish farm for lumpfish during normal operational conditions with no disease outbreak by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The study involved weekly samplings of water and biofilms from fish tanks, and fish. The results revealed that the microbial communities in fish tank water were different from the intake water. The water and biofilm in fish tanks were highly similar in regards to microbial community members, but with large differences in relative abundances for some taxa. The sampled fish were associated with mostly the same taxa as in tank water and biofilm, but more variation in relative abundances of different taxonomic groups occurred. The microbial communities in the fish farm seemed stable over time, and were dominated by marine bacteria and archaea within Alphaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Thaumarchaeota, Planctomycetes, Sphingobacteriia, and Verrucomicrobiae (>10% relative abundance). Bacterial genera known to include fish-pathogenic strains were detected in all types of sample materials, but with low relative abundances (<5%). Exceptions were some samples of fish, biofilm and water with high relative abundance of Tenacibaculum (<85.8%) and Moritella (<82%).

Aspergillus, Candida, Debaryomyces, Malassezia, Penicillium, Pichia, and Saccharomyces were the most recurrent and/or dominant fungal genera, according to metagenomic analysis. The biodiversity of fungal communities was lower and characterized by greater unevenness, when compared to bacterial microbiome. The dissimilarities both among subjects and over the time within the same subject suggested that most of the fungi passed through the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) without becoming stable colonizers. Certain genera, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium, were isolated in a minority of cases, although they recurred abundantly and frequently in the metagenomics survey, likely being environmental or food-borne fungi that do not inhabit the GIT. Candida genus was recurrently detected. Candida albicans isolates dominated among the cultivable mycobiota and longitudinally persisted, likely as commensals inhabiting the intestine or regularly reaching it from Candida-colonized districts, such as the oral cavity. Other putative colonizers belonged to Candida zeylanoides, Geotrichum candidum, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, with persisting biotypes being identified. Phenotyping of fungal isolates indicated that C. albicans adhered to human epithelial cells more efficiently and produced greater amounts of biofilm in vitro than non-albicans Candida (NAC) and non-Candida fungi (NCF). The C. albicans isolates also induced the highest release of HBD-2 by human epithelial cells, further differing from NAC and NCF. Nine representative isolates were administered to mice to evaluate the ability to colonize the intestine. Only two out of three C. albicans strains persisted in stools of animals 2 weeks after the end of the oral administration, whereas NAC and NCF did not. These results confirm the allochthonous nature of most the intestinal fungi, while C. albicans appears to be commonly involved in stable colonization. A combination of specific genetic features in the microbe and in the host likely allow colonization from fungi normally present solely as passengers. It remains to be established if other species identified as potential colonizers, in addition to Candida, are true inhabitants of the GIT or rather reach the intestine spreading from other body districts.","authors":[{"name":"Stefano Raimondi"},{"name":"Alberto Amaretti"},{"name":"Caterina Gozzoli"},{"name":"Marta Simone"},{"name":"Lucia Righini"},{"name":"Francesco Candeliere"},{"name":"Paola Brun"},{"name":"Andrea Ardizzoni"},{"name":"Bruna Colombari"},{"name":"Simona Paulone"},{"name":"Ignazio Castagliuolo"},{"name":"Duccio Cavalieri"},{"name":"Elisabetta Blasi"},{"name":"Maddalena Rossi"},{"name":"Samuele Peppoloni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"colonization"},{"word":"fungi"},{"word":"gut microbiota"},{"word":"metagenomics"}]},"article94":{"pmid":"31354667","title":"A Novel Two-Component System, Encoded by the sco5282/sco5283 Genes, Affects Streptomyces coelicolor Morphology in Liquid Culture.","abs":"Streptomyces are mycelial bacteria adapted to grow in soil. They have become important producers of biomolecules with medical applications, but their growth in industrial fermenters is challenged by their peculiar morphology in liquid culture: the hyphae tend to clump and grow as large pellets, which are oxygen- and nutrient-limited, grow slowly and present diminished protein production. Here, by implementing an experimental evolution strategy, a S. coelicolor strain, 2L12, with dispersed morphology and reduced pellet size in liquid culture and no defects in either differentiation or secondary metabolism was selected. Genome sequencing revealed a single amino acid substitution in a sensor kinase, Sco5282, of unknown function to be responsible for the morphological changes. Moreover, genetic and biochemical scrutiny identified Sco5283 as the cognate response regulator and demonstrated that the acquired mutation activates this two-component system. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of the mutant strain revealed changes in expression of genes involved in central processes such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, stress-signaling pathways, proteins secretion and cell envelope metabolism. Thus a novel two-component system is proposed to play a key role in the control of Streptomyces extracellular metabolism.","authors":[{"name":"Erick Eligio Arroyo-Pérez"},{"name":"Gabriela González-Cerón"},{"name":"Gloria Soberón-Chávez"},{"name":"Dimitris Georgellis"},{"name":"Luis Servín-González"}],"keywords":[{"word":"HAMP domain"},{"word":"Streptomyces"},{"word":"aggregation"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"morphology"},{"word":"two-component systems"}]},"article95":{"pmid":"31354661","title":"EtcABC, a Putative EII Complex, Regulates Type 3 Fimbriae via CRP-cAMP Signaling in Klebsiella pneumoniae.","abs":"Biofilm formation by Klebsiella pneumoniae on indwelling medical devices increases the risk of infection. Both type 1 and type 3 fimbriae are important factors in biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae. We found that a putative enzyme II (EII) complex of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS), etcA (EIIA)-etcB (EIIB)-etcC (EIIC), regulated biofilm and type 3 fimbriae formation by K. pneumoniae STU1. In this study, the regulatory mechanism of etcABC in K. pneumoniae type 3 fimbriae formation was investigated. We found via quantitative RT-PCR that overexpression of etcABC enhanced the transcription level of the mrk operon, which is involved in type 3 fimbriae synthesis, and reduced the transcription level of the fim operon, which is involved in type 1 fimbriae synthesis. To gain further insight into the role of etcABC in type 3 fimbriae synthesis, we analyzed the region upstream of the mrk operon and found the potential cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) binding site. After crp was deleted in K. pneumoniae STU1 and two clinical isolates, these three crp mutant strains could not express MrkA, the major subunit of the fimbrial shaft, indicating that CRP positively regulated type 3 fimbriae synthesis. Moreover, a crp mutant overexpressing etcABC could not express MrkA, indicating that the regulation of type 3 fimbriae by etcABC was dependent on CRP. In addition, deletion of cyaA, which encodes the adenylyl cyclase that synthesizes cAMP, and deletion of crr, which encodes the glucose-specific EIIA, led to a reduction in lac operon regulation and therefore bacterial lactose uptake in K. pneumoniae. Exogenous cAMP but not etcABC overexpression compensated for the role of cyaA in bacterial lactose uptake. However, either etcABC overexpression or exogenous cAMP compensated for the role of crr in bacterial lac operon regulation that would eventually restore lactose uptake. We also found via ELISA and the luxCDABE reporter system that overexpression of etcABC increased intracellular cAMP levels and the transcription level of crp, respectively, in K. pneumoniae. In conclusion, overexpression of etcABC positively regulated cAMP production and cAMP-CRP activity to activate the mrk operon, resulting in increased type 3 fimbriae synthesis in K. pneumoniae.","authors":[{"name":"Novaria Sari Dewi Panjaitan"},{"name":"Yu-Tze Horng"},{"name":"Shih-Wen Cheng"},{"name":"Wen-Ting Chung"},{"name":"Po-Chi Soo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CRP-cAMP"},{"word":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"carbohydrate phosphotransferase system"},{"word":"type 3 fimbriae"}]},"article96":{"pmid":"31354652","title":"Effects of Hardwood Biochar on Methane Production, Fermentation Characteristics, and the Rumen Microbiota Using Rumen Simulation.","abs":"Biochar is a novel carbonized feed additive sourced from pyrolyzed biomass.

Xoo produces a range of virulence-related factors to facilitate its pathogenesis in rice, however, the regulatory mechanisms of Xoo virulence expression have been not fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed that virulence factor production is regulated via cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) signaling pathway that is well-conserved in Xoo and other Xanthomonas species. A set of GGDEF, EAL, HD-GYP, and PilZ domain proteins with diverse signal sensory domains for c-di-GMP synthesis, hydrolysis, and binding is encoded in the Xoo genome. Bioinformatic, genetic, and biochemical analysis has identified an array of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), as well as degenerate GGDEF/EAL, PilZ domain proteins along with a transcription regulator. These signaling components have been characterized to regulate various bacterial cellular processes, such as virulence, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, biofilm formation, motility, and adaptation at the transcriptional, post-translational, and protein-protein interaction levels. This review summarized the recent progress in understanding the importance and complexity of c-di-GMP signaling in regulating bacterial virulence expression, highlighting the identified key signal elements and orthologs found in Xanthomonads, discussing the diverse functions of GGDEF/EAL/HD-GYP domains, existence of a complicated multifactorial network between DGCs, PDEs, and effectors, and further exploration of the new c-di-GMP receptor domains.

Ultrasmall epoxy group (oxirane)-functionalized organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of ≈31% are synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal treatment of an epoxy group-containing silane molecule, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, and an organic dye, rose bengal. The resultant OSiNDs can be employed as a universal imaging reagent for visualizing various bacteria/biofilms, including MRB and their biofilms. Moreover, the epoxy group-terminated OSiNDs can be conjugated with amine-containing reagents only via the simple stirring of the mixtures at an elevated temperature (e.g., 60 °C) for several hours (e.g., 3 h) without the addition of activating reagents. The amine-containing antibiotic vancomycin (Van) can thus be easily conjugated with the OSiNDs, and the obtained OSiNDs-Van can successfully inhibit the growth of MRB and even eliminate their biofilms.

The production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from the three biofilms initially decreased and then slightly increased after exposure to DEHP, consistent with the variation of the most dominant fluorescent compounds consisting of humic-acid-like organic substances. The MBBR and periphytic biofilms secreted more fluorescence compounds than the activated sludge during the exposure period. The organic matter in the EPS was converted into smaller molecules, while limited variation was observed in the functional groups and secondary protein structures. Acinetobacter and Bacillus demonstrated significant increases and were likely the key genera responsible for DEHP degradation. The combined use of spectral, chromatographic and sequencing analyses indicated that the periphytic biofilm was more resistant to DEHP, possibly owing to the presence of more mature assemblages, including cells with higher metabolic activity and a higher diversity within the bacterial community.

Combined treatments of bacteriophages and antibiotics have shown a promising antibiofilm activity, due to the profound differences in their mechanisms of action. In this study, 48 h old mono and dual-species biofilms were treated with a newly isolated P. aeruginosa infecting phage (EPA1) and seven different antibiotics (gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem), alone and in simultaneous or sequential combinations. The therapeutic efficacy of the tested antimicrobials was determined. Phage or antibiotics alone had a modest effect in reducing biofilm bacteria. However, when applied simultaneously, a profound improvement in the killing effect was observed. Moreover, an impressive biofilm reduction (below the detection limit) was observed when gentamicin or ciprofloxacin were added sequentially after 6 h of phage treatment. The effect observed does not depend on the type of antibiotic but is influenced by its concentration. Moreover, in dual-species biofilms it was necessary to increase gentamicin concentration to obtain a similar killing effect as occurs in mono-species. Overall, combining phages with antibiotics can be synergistic in reducing the bacterial density in biofilms.

We investigated the potential synergism of colistin in combination with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (a mucolytic agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties) against S. maltophilia grown in planktonic phase and biofilm. Eighteen S. maltophilia clinical isolates (comprising three isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) and two trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT)-resistant strains) were included. Checkerboard assays showed a synergism of colistin/NAC combinations against the strains with colistin Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) >2 µg/mL (n = 13), suggesting that NAC could antagonize the mechanisms involved in colistin resistance.

The process can be carried out on a variety of waste sludge ranging from human, animal, food, or pharmaceutical waste where the addition of air initiates aerobic digestion of the secondary treated sludge material. Digestion of the sludge substrates generates heat, which is retained within the reactor resulting in elevation of the reactor temperature to 70-75 °C. During the process, deamination of proteinaceous materials also occurs resulting in liberation of ammonia and elevation of pH to typically pH 8.4. These conditions result in a unique microbial consortium, which undergoes considerable dynamic change during the heat-up and holding phases. The change in pH and substrate as digestion occurs also contributes to this dynamic change. Because the large reactors are not optimized for aeration, and because low oxygen solubility at elevated temperatures occurs, there are considerable numbers of anaerobes recovered which also contributes to the overall digestion. As the reactors are operated in a semi-continuous mode, the reactors are rarely washed, resulting in considerable biofilm formation. Equally, because of the fibrous nature of the sludge, fiber adhering organisms are frequently found which play a major role in the overall digestion process. Here, we review molecular tools needed to examine the ATAD sludge consortia, what has been determined through phylogenetic analysis of the consortia and the nature of the dynamics occurring within this unique fermentation environment.","authors":[{"name":"J Tony Pembroke"},{"name":"Michael P Ryan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ATAD"},{"word":"Class A biosolids"},{"word":"digestion"}]},"article116":{"pmid":"31349530","title":"Antibiotics drug release controlling and osteoblast adhesion from Titania nanotubes arrays using silk fibroin coating.","abs":"Bacterial infection, wide inflammation, and osteoporosis are the most common factors in the failure of orthopedic implants.

We used acid-killing assays, glycolytic rate assessments, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) formation tests to detect whether srtA deletion influenced S. mutans acid tolerance/production and glucan formation. Comparisons between RNA-sequencing data from both the exponential and stationary phases of UA159 and the srtA-deleted strain were made to determine the impact of srtA knockout on S. mutans genomic transcription. Results of our assays indicated that S. mutans aciduricity was enhanced in the srtA deleted strain when bacterial cells were directly subjected to pH 2.8, but the enhancement was repressed when the acid tolerance response was induced in advance. The srtA mutation strain exhibited reduced EPS formation in mature biofilms. SrtA deletion led to pleiotropic changes in the S. mutans transcriptome with a growth phase-dependent pattern. The affected genes mainly included those involved in aciduricity, carbohydrate transport, and EPS formation. It was concluded that S. mutans srtA exhibited multiple effects on the virulence traits of this pathogen, including acid tolerance and glucan formation, and that these alterations could be partially due to transcriptional changes upon loss of srtA.","authors":[{"name":"Xuan Chen"},{"name":"Chengcheng Liu"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Yuanli He"},{"name":"Haixia Liu"},{"name":"Ying Song"},{"name":"Kaixin Xiong"},{"name":"Ling Zou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"srtA"},{"word":"Sortase A"},{"word":"acid tolerance"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides production"},{"word":"transcriptome"}]},"article144":{"pmid":"31342619","title":"Biofilm formation as a microbial strategy to assimilate particulate substrates.","abs":"In most ecosystems, a large part of the organic carbon is not solubilized in the water phase.

Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 is a model strain to study heavy metal resistance and bioremediation as it is able to deal with high heavy metal concentrations. Biofilm formation by bacteria is mediated by the second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). The aim of this study was to characterize the response of C. metallidurans CH34 planktonic and biofilm cells to cadmium including their c-di-GMP regulatory pathway. Inhibition of the initiation of biofilm formation and EPS production by C. metallidurans CH34 correlates with increased concentration of cadmium. Planktonic and biofilm cells showed similar tolerance to cadmium. During exposure to cadmium an acute decrease of c-di-GMP levels in planktonic and biofilm cells was observed. Transcription analysis by RT-qPCR showed that cadmium exposure to planktonic and biofilm cells induced the expression of the urf2 gene and the mercuric reductase encoding merA gene, which belong to the Tn501/Tn21 mer operon. After exposure to cadmium, the cadA gene involved in cadmium resistance was equally upregulated in both lifestyles. Bioinformatic analysis and complementation assays indicated that the protein encoded by the urf2 gene is a functional phosphodiesterase (PDE) involved in the c-di-GMP metabolism.

The P. aeruginosa clone C specific genomic island PACGI-1 harbors a xenolog of ftsH encoding a functionally diverse membrane-spanning ATP-dependent metalloprotease on the core genome. In the aquatic isolate P. aeruginosa SG17M, the core genome copy ftsH1 significantly affects growth and dominantly mediates a broad range of phenotypes, such as secretion of secondary metabolites, swimming and twitching motility and resistance to aminoglycosides, while the PACGI-1 xenolog ftsH2 backs up the phenotypes in the ftsH1 mutant background. The two proteins, with conserved motifs for disaggregase and protease activity present in FtsH1 and FtsH2, have the ability to form homo- and hetero-oligomers with ftsH2 distinctively expressed in the late stationary phase of growth. However, mainly FtsH1 degrades a major substrate, the heat shock transcription factor RpoH. Pull-down experiments with substrate trap-variants inactive in proteolytic activity indicate both FtsH1 and FtsH2 to interact with the inhibitory protein HflC, while the phenazine biosynthesis protein PhzC was identified as a substrate of FtsH1.

The aim of this study is to develop a novel antibacterial root canal sealer by incorporating DMADDM into EndoREZ and investigate the properties of the resulting material. Different mass fractions (0, 1.25%, 2.5%, and 5%) of DMADDM were incorporated into EndoREZ and the cytotoxicity, apical sealing ability and solubility of the resulting material were evaluated. Furthermore, a direct contact test, determination of colony-forming units, a crystal violet assay, scanning electronic microscopy and live/dead bacteria staining were performed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the sealer to multispecies bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Lactobacillus acidophilus), in planktonic cells or biofilms. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were carried out to assess the composition of the multispecies biofilms. No difference on the cytotoxicity, apical sealing ability and solubility between sealers containing DMADDM (1.25%, 2.5%) and EndoREZ (0%) could be determined. However, when the mass fraction of DMADDM increased to 5%, significantly different properties were found compared to the 0% (p < 0.05) group. Moreover, incorporating DMADDM into the sealer could greatly improve the antibacterial properties of EndoREZ. In addition, the composition ratio of E. faecalis could be decreased in multispecies microecology in sealers containing DMADDM. Therefore, a EndoREZ sealer material containing DMADDM could be considered useful in clinical applications for preventing and treating persistent apical periodontitis.","authors":[{"name":"Dan Liu"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Suping Wang"},{"name":"Qi Han"},{"name":"Bolei Li"},{"name":"Xinxuan Zhou"},{"name":"Biao Ren"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Mingyun Li"},{"name":"Xuedong Zhou"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"}],"keywords":[]},"article166":{"pmid":"31336838","title":"Candida albicans-Cell Interactions Activate Innate Immune Defense in Human Palate Epithelial Primary Cells via Nitric Oxide (NO) and β-Defensin 2 (hBD-2).","abs":"The presence of Candida albicans in the biofilm underlying the dental prosthesis is related to denture stomatitis (DS), an inflammatory reaction of the oral mucosa.

The results showed that, besides reducing biomass, heavy metals negatively affected physiological parameters such as chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange, while increasing ROS-scavenging enzyme activities. Inoculation of M. sativa with a bacterial consortium of heat- and metallo-resistant bacteria alleviated metal stress, as deduced from the improvement of growth, lower levels of antioxidant enzymes, and increased physiological parameters. The bacteria were able to effectively colonize and form biofilms onto the roots of plants cultivated in the presence of metals, as observed by scanning electron microscopy.

These outcomes showed that the interaction of metal-resistant rhizobacteria/legumes can be used as an instrument to remediate metal-contaminated soils, while cultivation of inoculated legumes on these soils is still safe for animal grazing, since inoculation with bacteria diminished the concentrations of heavy metals accumulated in the aboveground parts of the plants to below toxic levels.","authors":[{"name":"Anas Raklami"},{"name":"Khalid Oufdou"},{"name":"Abdel-Ilah Tahiri"},{"name":"Enrique Mateos-Naranjo"},{"name":"Salvadora Navarro-Torre"},{"name":"Ignacio D Rodríguez-Llorente"},{"name":"Abdelilah Meddich"},{"name":"Susana Redondo-Gómez"},{"name":"Eloísa Pajuelo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PGPR"},{"word":"ROS-scavenging enzymes"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"heavy metal stress"},{"word":"legumes"},{"word":"rhizobia"},{"word":"scanning electron microscopy"},{"word":"stress related genes"}]},"article169":{"pmid":"31336660","title":"Understanding Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Profiles of Salmonella Biofilm and Planktonic Bacteria Challenged with Disinfectants Commonly Used During Poultry Processing.","abs":"Foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella that survive cleaning and disinfection during poultry processing are a public health concern because pathogens that survive disinfectants have greater potential to exhibit resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants after their initial disinfectant challenge.

Over a period of 636 days, chemical oxygen demand removal over 90% and complete nitrification were achieved for both the control and tigecycline-exposed reactors, and effluent tigecycline concentrations in the tigecycline-exposed system were always <0.051 mg/L.

The increase of resistome in the tigecycline system was mainly attributed to the enrichment of tetX, one cooperative tetracycline degrading gene. Partial canonical correspondence analysis showed that the change of resistome was mainly driven by bacterial community shift (vertical pathway). Network and genome binning analyses further suggested that the proliferation of Flavobacterium harboring tetX contributed to a relatively low community-wide resistance development in the aerobic biofilm microbiota under tigecycline selection by reducing the antibiotic concentration.

Hence it is a challenging task for the food industry to control contamination of food ingredients and products through the entire production chain, since an increasing number of severe food-related outbreaks of C. sakazakii infections has been observed. The seemingly great capability of C. sakazakii to survive even strict countermeasures combined with its prevalence in many food ingredients requires a greater in depth understanding of its virulence factors to master the food safety issues related to this organism.

These are compared to other, already sequenced, C. sakazakii genomes. Sequencing of the fusA allele revealed that both isolates were C. sakazakii. We investigated the molecular characteristics of both isolates relevant for genes associated with pathogenesis and virulence factors, resistance to stressful environmental conditions (e.g., osmotic and heat), survival in desiccation as well as conducted a comparative genomic analysis. By using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), the genetic type of both isolates is assessed and the number of unique genes is determined.

Bacteria respond to daptomycin by altering their cell envelopes to either decrease antibiotic binding to the membrane or by diverting binding away from septal targets. In Enterococcus faecalis, daptomycin resistance is typically coordinated by the three-component cell envelope stress response system, LiaFSR. Here, studying a clinical strain of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium containing alleles associated with activation of the LiaFSR signaling pathway, we found that specific environments selected for different evolutionary trajectories, leading to high-level daptomycin resistance. Planktonic environments favored pathways that increased cell surface charge via yvcRS upregulation of dltABCD and mprF, causing a reduction in daptomycin binding. Alternatively, environments favoring complex structured communities, including biofilms, evolved both diversion and repulsion strategies via divIVA and oatA mutations, respectively. Both environments subsequently converged on cardiolipin synthase (cls) mutations, suggesting the importance of membrane modification across strategies. Our findings indicate that E. faecium can evolve diverse evolutionary trajectories to daptomycin resistance that are shaped by the environment to produce a combination of resistance strategies.

Cyclophilins catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of xaa-proline bonds, a rate-limiting step in protein folding which has been shown to be important for bacterial virulence.

This is reflected in the BALB/c mouse infection model, demonstrating the requirement of ppiB for in vivo disease dissemination and progression. Proteomic analysis demonstrates that the loss of PpiB leads to pleiotropic effects, supporting the role of PpiB in maintaining proteome homeostasis. The loss of PpiB leads to decreased abundance of multiple virulence determinants, including flagellar machinery and alterations in type VI secretion system proteins. In addition, the loss of ppiB leads to increased sensitivity toward multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and doxycycline, highlighting ppiB inhibition as a promising antivirulence target to both treat B. pseudomallei infections and increase antibiotic efficacy.","authors":[{"name":"Nicole M Bzdyl"},{"name":"Nichollas E Scott"},{"name":"Isobel H Norville"},{"name":"Andrew E Scott"},{"name":"Timothy Atkins"},{"name":"Stanley Pang"},{"name":"Derek S Sarovich"},{"name":"Geoffrey Coombs"},{"name":"Timothy J J Inglis"},{"name":"Charlene M Kahler"},{"name":"Mitali Sarkar-Tyson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia pseudomallei"},{"word":"cyclophilins"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article186":{"pmid":"31331920","title":"Antibiotics inhibit tumor and disease activity in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.","abs":"It has been proposed that CD4 T-cell responses to Staphylococcus aureus (SA) can inadvertently enhance neoplastic progression in models of skin cancer and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

All patients experienced significant decrease in clinical symptoms in response to aggressive, transient antibiotic treatment. In some patients, clinical improvements lasted for more than 8 months. In 6 of 8 patients, a malignant T-cell clone could be identified in lesional skin, and a significant decrease in the fraction of malignant T cells was observed following antibiotics but an otherwise unchanged treatment regimen.

Modulating the ratio between these three key players led to significant differences, not only in terms of ethanol and organic acid production, but also on the profile of volatile compounds, in comparison with natural communities. However, we observed that using an equal ratio of spores/cells of the three microbial strains during inoculation led to flavor profile and ethanol yield close to that obtained through the use of natural communities. Compartmentalization of metabolic tasks through the use of a biofilm cultivation device allows further improvement of the whole fermentation process, notably by increasing the amount of key components of the aroma profile of the fermented beverage (i.e., mainly phenylethyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, and 2-methyl-butanol) and reducing the amount of off-flavor compounds.

The ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB)-to-nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) activity ratios were determined for a series of granule sizes to understand the impact of mass diffusion limitation on the free ammonia (FA) inhibition of NOB. When dissolved oxygen (DO) limitation is the only mechanism for NOB suppression, the AOB:NOB ratio was usually found to increase with the granule size. However, the trend is reversed when FA has an inhibitory effect on NOB, as was observed in this study. The decrease in AOB:NOB ratio indicates that smaller granules, e.g. diameter <150 μm, are preferred for nitrite accumulation when high FA concentration is present, as in the partial nitritation process. The trend was further verified by observing the increase in the apparent inhibition coefficient as granule size increased. Indeed, this study for the first time quantified the effect of diffusion limitation on the apparent inhibition coefficient of NOB in aerobic granules. A mathematical model was then utilized to interpret the observed suppression of NOB and predicted that NOB suppression was only complete at the granule surface. The NOB that did survive in larger granules was forced to dwell within the granule interior, where the AOB growth declines due to DO diffusion limitation. This means FA inhibition can be taken advantage of as an effective means for NOB suppression in small granules or thin biofilms. Further, both FA inhibition and DO limitation were found to be required for the suppression of NOB in mainstream aerobic granules.","authors":[{"name":"Timothy R Kent"},{"name":"Yewei Sun"},{"name":"Zhaohui An"},{"name":"Charles B Bott"},{"name":"Zhi-Wu Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AOB:NOB"},{"word":"Continuous flow"},{"word":"Diffusion limitation"},{"word":"Free ammonia"},{"word":"Granule size"},{"word":"Partial nitritation"}]},"article192":{"pmid":"31330262","title":"Atractylodes lancea volatile oils attenuated helicobacter pylori NCTC11637 growth and biofilm.","abs":"Atractylodes lancea is a traditional Chinese perennial herb, which has been used for treating gastrointestinal diseases in traditional medicine.

Firstly, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the volatile oils against H. pylori were determined using broth dilution method. SPSS17.0 was used to account 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50). Moreover, the anti-biofilm activity of the volatile oils was determined by crystal violet measurement and fluorescence microscope. Finally, gastric epithelial cells (GES-1 cells) were co-incubated with H. pylori with or without volatile oils treated. Real-time PCR and western blot were performed to detect the translocation of virulence factor Cag A. We found that Atractylodes lancea volatile oils inhibited the growth of H. pylori in a concentration dependent manner. The MIC and IC50 of volatile oils against H. pylori were 7.5 mg/mL and 2.181 mg/mL respectively. Fluorescence microscopy and crystal violet measurement indicated that volatile oils at sub-MIC concentration could reduce biofilm formation of H. pylori.

These sRNAs recognize transcripts through base-pairing, and sRNA-mRNA annealing consequently alters the translation and/or stability of transcripts leading to changes in gene expression. We have previously found that the highly conserved 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) has an indispensable role in paradoxically stabilizing Hfq-bound sRNAs and promoting their function in gene regulation in Escherichia coli. Here, we report that PNPase contributes to the degradation of specific short mRNA fragments, the majority of which bind Hfq and are derived from targets of sRNAs. Specifically, we found that these mRNA-derived fragments accumulate in the absence of PNPase or its exoribonuclease activity and interact with PNPase. Additionally, we show that mutations in hfq or in the seed pairing region of some sRNAs eliminated the requirement of PNPase for their stability. Altogether, our results are consistent with a model that PNPase degrades mRNA-derived fragments that could otherwise deplete cells of Hfq-binding sRNAs through pairing-mediated decay.","authors":[{"name":"Todd A Cameron"},{"name":"Lisa M Matz"},{"name":"Dhriti Sinha"},{"name":"Nicholas R De Lay"}],"keywords":[]},"article194":{"pmid":"31329623","title":"Risk factors for tooth loss in adults: A population-based prospective cohort study.","abs":"The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for tooth loss in an extended age group of adults over 4 years.

Impact of the drug and peptide co-administration on biofilm at different stages, i.e., during adhesion and 1-day old biofilm was compared to each of the agents used alone. Results revealed that the killing effects of all AMPs range from 13-100%. In contrast, MH and DOX at 1 and 5 μM showed no killing activity and instead stimulated growth of bacteria. DOX has better killing activity than MH. LFchimera displayed the strongest killing amongst the peptides. Checkerboard technique revealed that combining DOX and LFchimera yielded synergism. Confocal laser scanning microscopy further showed that the combination of DOX and LFchimera caused significant reduction of bacterial adhesion and reduction of biomass, average biofilm thickness and substratum biofilm coverage of 1-day old biofilm compared to DOX and LFchimera alone. In conclusion, LFchimera alone and in combination with DOX exhibited strong antibacterial and anti-biofilm property against A. actinomycetemcomitans.

The bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen which has been reported to cause nosocomial and chronic infections through biofilm formation and synthesis of several toxins and virulence factors. Furthermore, the formation of biofilm by P. aeruginosa is known as one of the resistance mechanisms against conventional antibiotics. Natural compounds from marine resources have become one of the simple, cost-effective, biocompatible and non-toxicity for treating P. aeruginosa biofilm-related infections. Furthermore, hybrid formulation with nanomaterials such as nanoparticles becomes an effective alternative strategy to minimize the drug toxicity problem and cytotoxicity properties. For this reason, the present study has employed chitosan oligosaccharide for the synthesis of chitosan oligosaccharide-capped gold nanoparticles (COS-AuNPs). The synthesized COS-AuNPs were then characterized by using UV-Visible spectroscopy, Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), and Energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX). The synthesized COS-AuNPs were applied for inhibiting P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Results have shown that COS-AuNPs exhibited inhibition to biofilm as well as eradication to pre-existing mature biofilm. Simultaneously, COS-AuNPs were also able to reduce bacterial hemolysis and different virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. Overall, the present study concluded that the hybrid nanoformulation such as COS-AuNPs could act as a potential agent to exhibit inhibitory properties against the P. aeruginosa pathogenesis arisen from biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Fazlurrahman Khan"},{"name":"Jang-Won Lee"},{"name":"Panchanathan Manivasagan"},{"name":"Dung Thuy Nguyen Pham"},{"name":"Junghwan Oh"},{"name":"Young-Mog Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiofilm"},{"word":"Chitosan oligosaccharide"},{"word":"Nanoparticles"},{"word":"P. aeruginosa"},{"word":"Pathogen"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article210":{"pmid":"31324782","title":"Active thrombin produced by the intestinal epithelium controls mucosal biofilms.","abs":"Proteolytic homeostasis is important at mucosal surfaces, but its actors and their precise role in physiology are poorly understood.

Specific inhibition of luminal thrombin activity causes macroscopic and microscopic damage as well as transcriptomic alterations of genes involved in host-microbiota interactions. Further, luminal thrombin inhibition impairs the spatial segregation of microbiota biofilms, allowing bacteria to invade the mucus layer and to translocate across the epithelium. Thrombin cleaves the biofilm matrix of reconstituted mucosa-associated human microbiota. Our results indicate that thrombin constrains biofilms at the intestinal mucosa.

Biofilms exhibit high mechanical stiffness and are inherently tolerant to adverse conditions including the presence of antibiotics, pollutants, detergents, high temperature, changes in pH, etc. These features make biofilms resilient, which is beneficial for applications in dynamic environments such as bioleaching, bioremediation, materials production, and wastewater purification. We have recently described an easy and cost-effective method for 3D printing of bacteria and have extended this technology for 3D printing of genetically engineered Escherichia coli biofilms. Our 3D printing platform exploits simple alginate chemistry for printing of a bacteria-alginate bioink mixture onto calcium-containing agar surfaces, resulting in the formation of bacteria-encapsulating hydrogels with varying geometries. Bacteria in these hydrogels remain intact, spatially patterned, and viable for several days. Printing of engineered bacteria to produce inducible biofilms leads to formation of multilayered three-dimensional structures that can tolerate harsh chemical treatments. Synthetic biology and material science approaches provide the opportunity to append a wide range of useful functionalities to these 3D-printed biofilms.

To overcome these problems, in this study, a novel pilot-scale air-lift multilevel circulation membrane bioreactor (AMCMBR) was used to explore the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) while treating real ship sewage. Results indicated that the satisfactory removal efficiencies of COD and TN was achieved in the former stages (Re(COD) = 91.57% and 87.82%; Re(TN) = 77.17% and 81.19%). When HRT decreased to 4 h, the removal efficiencies of COD and TN was 86.93% and 70.49% respectively, which still met the strict IMO discharge standards. This mainly because the biofilm-assistant membrane filtration lead to the increase of physical removal rate. The high ratio of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)/mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) (i.e. 0.75) indicated a high biomass content in the attached sludge and resulted into perfect pollutants removal effort. The compliance rate of COD and TN was 100% and 89%, respectively, which indicated stable operation of the pilot-scale AMCMBR throughout the whole experiment.

Human innate immune peptide LL-37 can inhibit biofilm formation, but suffers from high cost due to a long peptide length and rapid protease degradation. To improve the peptide, we previously identified the major active region and changed the peptide backbone structure. This study designed two families of new peptides by altering peptide side chains. Interestingly, these peptides displayed differential potency against various ESKAPE pathogens in vitro and substantially reduced hemolysis. Further potency test in vivo revealed that 17tF-W eliminated the burden of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) USA300 in both mouse-embedded catheters and their surrounding tissues. In addition, peptide treatment suppressed the level of chemokine TNFα, and boosted the levels of chemokines MCP-1, IL-17A and IL-10 in the surrounding tissues of the infected catheter embedded in mice.

Interestingly, deoxyribonuclease-I (DNase-I) has been empirically proved to be efficacious in improving the antibiotic susceptibility against biofilm-associated infections. DNase-I hydrolyzes the extracellular DNA, a key component of the biofilm responsible for the cell adhesion and strength. Moreover, silver sulfadiazine, a frontline therapy in burn wound infections, exhibits delayed wound healing due to fibroblast toxicity. In this study, a chitosan gel loaded with solid lipid nanoparticles of silver sulfadiazine (SSD-SLNs) and supplemented with DNase-I has been developed to reduce the fibroblast cytotoxicity and overcome the biofilm-imposed resistance. The extensive optimization using the Box-Behnken design (BBD) resulted in the formation of SSD-SLNs with a smooth surface as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and controlled release (83%) for up to 24 h. The compatibility between the SSD and other formulation excipients was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared, differential scanning calorimetry, and powder X-ray diffraction studies. Developed SSD-SLNs in combination with DNase-I inhibited around 96.8% of biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as compared to SSD with DNase-I (82.9%). In line with our hypothesis, SSD-SLNs were found to be less toxic (cell viability 90.3 ± 3.8% at 100 μg/mL) in comparison with SSD (Cell viability 76.9 ± 4.2%) against human dermal fibroblast cell line. Eventually, the results of the in vivo wound healing study showed complete wound healing after 21 days' treatment with SSD-SLNs along with DNase-I, whereas marketed formulations SSD and SSD-LSNs showed incomplete healing after 21 days. Data in hand suggest that the combination of SSD-SLNs with DNase-I is an effective treatment strategy against the biofilm-associated wound infections and accelerates wound healing.","authors":[{"name":"Krishna Kumar Patel"},{"name":"D Bhavya Surekha"},{"name":"Muktanand Tripathi"},{"name":"Md Meraj Anjum"},{"name":"M S Muthu"},{"name":"Ragini Tilak"},{"name":"Ashish Kumar Agrawal"},{"name":"Sanjay Singh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNase-I"},{"word":"SLNs"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"burn wounds"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"silver sulfadiazine"}]},"article234":{"pmid":"31318043","title":"Comparison of yeast species in the subgingival oral biofilm of individuals with type 2 diabetes and peri-implantitis and individuals with peri-implantitis without diabetes.","abs":"There are no studies that have investigated the presence of yeasts in the subgingival oral biofilm (OB) of type-2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients with peri-implantitis.

It has a major impact on overall quality of life. Although, the etiology and pathogenesis of CRS are not clearly understood, there are several hypotheses on CRS etiology and pathogenesis. The presence of biofilms and bacterial infection, as well as fungal infection, allergy, environmental pollutants, and smoking are considered as a possible environmental factors which are involved in etiology of CRS. Over the past few years, the presence of biofilms is indicated in more than 65% of chronic infections in humans. The most important goals of treatment in CRS include suppression of the infection, reduction of sinonasal inflammation, and maintenance of patent sinonasal passage drainage. CRS is generally treated with medical and surgical therapy. Antibiotics play a major role in the treatment of CRS and are often used to reduce the infectious component of CRS. Macrolide antibiotics are considered as a choice of treatment option as they have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in addition to usual antimicrobial effects. Clarithromycin is one of the macrolide which has shown beneficial effects for treating CRS. Various studies indicated that long term use of clarithromycin is effective in the treatment of CRS with good tolerability profile The present review suggests that clarithromycin can be used as treatment of choice in the treatment of CRS.","authors":[{"name":"Samir K Bhargava"},{"name":"Kartik Peethambaran"}],"keywords":[]},"article236":{"pmid":"31317435","title":"Natural and non-toxic products from Fabaceae Brazilian plants as a replacement for traditional antifouling biocides: an inhibition potential against initial biofouling.","abs":"In this study, we screened for the antifouling activity of 15 species plant extracts from Brazilian the Brazilian Caatinga Fabaceae against the initial colonization of natural marine bacterial biofilm.

Antibacterials at the peak plasmatic concentration of each drug were tested against biofilms grown on polystyrene surfaces. Biofilms were evaluated for biomass production, metabolic activity, carbohydrate and protein contents, proteolytic activity, ultrastructure, and tolerance to antifungals. CEF and AMOX enhanced biofilm production by C. albicans ATCC 10231, stimulating biomass production, metabolic activity, viable cell counts, and proteolytic activity, as well as increased biovolume and thickness of these structures. Nevertheless, AMOX induced more significant changes in C. albicans biofilms than CEF. In addition, it was shown that AMOX increased the amount of chitin in these biofilms, making them more tolerant to caspofungin. Finally, it was seen that, in response to AMOX, C. albicans biofilms produce Hsp70 - a protein with chaperone function related to stressful conditions.

Surprisingly, a knowledge deficit exists in regards to understanding the whole genome processes underway in plant transforming bacteria, irrespective of the species. To begin to address the issue, we undertook a temporal RNAseq-based profiling study of E. adhaerens OV14 in the presence/absence of Arabidopsis thaliana tissues. Following co-cultivation with root tissues, 2333 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were noted. Meta-analysis of the RNAseq data sets identified a clear shift from plasmid-derived gene expression to chromosomal-based transcription within the early stages of bacterium-plant co-cultivation. During this time, the number of differentially expressed prokaryotic genes increased steadily out to 7 days co-cultivation, a time at which optimum rates of transformation were observed. Gene ontology evaluations indicated a role for both chromosomal and plasmid-based gene families linked specifically with quorum sensing, flagellin production and biofilm formation in the process of EMT. Transcriptional evaluation of vir genes, housed on the pCAMBIA 5105 plasmid in E. adhaerens OV14 confirmed the ability of E. adhaerens OV14 to perceive and activate its transcriptome in response to the presence of 200 µM of acetosyringone. Significantly, this is the first study to characterise the whole transcriptomic response of a plant engineering bacterium in the presence of plant tissues and provides a novel insight into prokaryotic genetic processes that support T-DNA transfer.","authors":[{"name":"Evelyn Zuniga-Soto"},{"name":"David A Fitzpatrick"},{"name":"Fiona M Doohan"},{"name":"Ewen Mullins"}],"keywords":[]},"article241":{"pmid":"31315967","title":"Observations of Shear Stress Effects on Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Formation.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus bacteria form biofilms and distinctive microcolony or tower structures that facilitate their ability to tolerate antibiotic treatment and to spread within the human body.

Our findings suggest that incorporating 5% DMAHDM into 20% NACP-containing sealants (1) imparts a detrimental biological effect on S. mutans by reducing colony-forming unit counts, metabolic activity and exopolysaccharide synthesis; and (2) reduces overall acid production and tolerance to oxygen stress, two major virulence factors of this microorganism.

In the present study, we sought to explore the mechanism via which insulin treatment affects cyclic di-GMP signaling in P. aeruginosa-infected chronic wounds in db/db diabetic mice. We found that the wounds of diabetic mice healed more slowly than those of nondiabetic mice. Moreover, wound healing in diabetic mice treated with insulin exhibited a considerable delay.

The resistance of Candida albicans to traditional antifungal drugs has been increasing rapidly in recent years, and it brings a great challenge in clinical treatment. N-butylphthalide is originally extracted from the seed of Apium graveolens and is currently used for the treatment of ischemic stroke in the clinic. This study demonstrated that n-butylphthalide exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 128 μg/ml; moreover, n-butylphthalide combined with fluconazole showed synergistic antifungal effects against resistant Candida albicans, resulting in a decrease in the minimum inhibitory concentrations of fluconazole from >512 to 0.25-1 μg/ml. Time-killing curves verified the antifungal activity in dynamic. Besides, n-butylphthalide exhibited anti-biofilm activity against Candida albicans, biofilms preformed <12 h with sessile minimum inhibitory concentrations of 128-256 μg/ml and synergism was observed when n-butylphthalide combined with fluconazole against resistant Candida albicans biofilms preformed <12 h, resulting in a decrease in the sessile minimum inhibitory concentrations of fluconazole from >1,024 to 0.5-8 μg/ml. Furthermore, in vitro antifungal effects of n-butylphthalide were confirmed in vivo. N-butylphthalide prolonged survival rate of larvae infected by Candida albicans, reduced the fungal burden in larvae and caused less damage to larval tissues. Notably, n-butylphthalide inhibited hyphal growth and induced intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation and a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, which was a potential antifungal mechanism. Besides, the synergistic effects between n-butylphthalide and fluconazole potentially relied on the mechanism that n-butylphthalide significantly promoted drug uptake, and suppressed drug efflux via down-regulating the drug transporter encoding genes CDR1 and CDR2. These findings demonstrated the antifungal effects and mechanisms of n-butylphthalide against Candida albicans for the first time, which might provide broad prospects for the identification of new potential antifungal targets.","authors":[{"name":"Ying Gong"},{"name":"Weiguo Liu"},{"name":"Xin Huang"},{"name":"Lina Hao"},{"name":"Yiman Li"},{"name":"Shujuan Sun"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"antifungal activity"},{"word":"fluconazole"},{"word":"n-butylphthalide"},{"word":"potential mechanism"}]},"article256":{"pmid":"31311876","title":"Endophytic Fungus Drives Nodulation and N","abs":"Endophytic fungi play important roles in the modification of ecosystem productivity; however, the underlying mechanisms are only partly understood.

To do that, biofilms corresponding to three S. aureus strains, which differed in biofilm-forming ability and composition of the extracellular matrix, were allowed to develop for 5 or 24 h, representing an active formation stage and mature biofilms, respectively. Spectral analysis of the samples, corresponding to three biological replicates of each condition, was then performed by using a portable device. The results of these experiments showed that partial least-squares discriminant analysis of the spectral profile could discriminate between surfaces containing attached bacterial biomass and noninoculated ones. In this model, the two first principal components accounted for 39 and 19% of the variance and the estimated error rate stabilized after four components.

The ability of pathogenic microorganisms to form biofilm matrix aggravate the situation due to the occurrence of antibiotic resistance phenomenon resulting in resistance against conventional antibiotic therapy and become a public health concern. The canonical quorum sensing (QS) signaling system hierarchially regulates the expression of an array of virulence phenotypes and controls the development of biofilm dynamics. It is imperative to develop an alternative, yet effective and non-conventional therapeutic approach, popularly known as anti-infective therapy seems to be interesting. In this regard, targeting microbial QS associated virulence and biofilm development proves to be quite astonishing approach in counteracting the paucity of traditional antibiotics. A number of synthetic and natural compounds are exploited for their efficacy in combating QS associated microbial infections but the bioavailability and biocompatibility limit their widespread applications. In this context, the nanotechnological intervention offers a new paradigm for widespread biomedical applications starting from targeted drug delivery to diagnostics for the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, particularly to fight against microbial infections and antibiotics resistant biofilms. A wide range of nanomaterials starting from metallic nanoparticles to polymeric nanoparticles and recent advances in the development of carbon-based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), grapheme oxide (GO) also immensely exhibited intrinsic anti-infective properties when targeted towards microbial infections and associated MDR phenomenon.

Shotgun proteomics methods to determine the extent of inflammation and types of immune cell effectors in urine have not become part of routine clinical tests.

A position indicator stain was placed on the lingual mucosal surface, and sliding images were captured and then reconstructed.

There were two morphological features among clinically healthy subjects involving the filiform papillae: the length of the papillae and the degree of biofilm (tongue coat) deposition. We defined a modified tongue coat index (mTCI) with scores ranging from 0 (tongue coating not visible) to 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 (thick tongue coating) for six sections of the tongue dorsum.

Here, we introduce a new generation of anti-biofouling coatings with superior characteristics and high mechanical, chemical and environmental durability. In these surfaces, we have implemented the new physics of stress localization to minimize the adhesion of bio-species on the coatings. This polymeric material contains dispersed organogels in a high shear modulus matrix. Interfacial cavitation induced at the interface of bio-species and organogel particles leads to stress localization and detachment of bio-species from these surfaces with minimal shear stress. In a comprehensive study, the performance of these surfaces is assessed for both soft and hard biofouling including Ulva, bacteria, diatoms, barnacles and mussels, and is compared with that of state-of-the-art surfaces. These surfaces show Ulva accumulation of less than 1%, minimal bacterial biofilm growth, diatom attachment of 2%, barnacle adhesion of 0.02 MPa and mussel adhesion of 7.5 N.

As reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mutagenic, the evolution of resistance to ciprofloxacin (CIP) in biofilms under oxidative stress conditions was investigated. We experimentally evolved six replicate populations of P. aeruginosa lacking the major catalase KatA in colony biofilms and stationary-phase cultures for seven passages in the presence of subinhibitory levels (0.1 mg/liter) of CIP or without CIP (eight replicate lineages for controls) under aerobic conditions. In CIP-evolved biofilms, a larger CIP-resistant subpopulation was isolated in the ΔkatA strain than in the wild-type (WT) PAO1 population, suggesting oxidative stress as a promoter of the development of antibiotic resistance. A higher number of mutations identified by population sequencing were observed in evolved ΔkatA biofilm populations (CIP and control) than in WT PAO1 populations evolved under the same conditions. Genes involved in iron assimilation were found to be exclusively mutated in CIP-evolved ΔkatA biofilm populations, probably as a defense mechanism against ROS formation resulting from Fenton reactions.

Resistant bacteria are spreading even in first-world nations, being found not only in healthcare-related settings, but also in food and in the environment. In this minireview, the impact of AMR in healthcare systems and the major bacteria behind it are highlighted. Ecological aspects of AMR evolution and the complexity of its molecular mechanisms are explained. Major concepts, such as intrinsic, acquired and adaptive resistance, as well as tolerance and heteroresistance, are also clarified. More importantly, the problematic of biofilms and their role in AMR, namely their main resistance and tolerance mechanisms, are elucidated. Finally, some of the most promising anti-biofilm strategies being investigated are reviewed. Much is still to be done regarding the study of AMR and the discovery of new anti-biofilm strategies.

It is regulated by the synthesis of highly phosphorylated signaling nucleotides, (p)ppGpp or alarmone. (p)ppGpp is synthesized by ppGpp synthetases, and these proteins are classified as RelA/SpoT homolog (RSH) proteins. Subsequently, (p)ppGpp modulate several molecular and biochemical processes ranging from transcription to metabolism. Imperativeness of (p)ppGpp synthetases has been investigated by numerous approaches including microbiology and animal studies, thereby establishing that Rel enzyme deleted strains of pathogenic bacteria were unable to transform in persister form. In this review, we summarize recent findings to corroborate the rationality to consider (p)ppGpp synthetase as a potential target in discovering a novel class of antimicrobial agents to combat persistent infections. Moreover, inhibition studies on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (p)ppGpp synthetase shows that these inhibitors prevent dormant state transition and biofilm formation.

Beach sand, biofilms, and water all present unique advantages and challenges to pathogen introduction, growth, and persistence. These dynamics are further complicated by continuous exchange between sand and water habitats. Models of FIB and pathogen fate and transport at beaches can help predict the risk of infectious disease from beach use, but knowledge gaps with respect to decay and growth rates of pathogens in beach habitats impede robust modeling. Climatic variability adds further complexity to predictive modeling because extreme weather events, warming water, and sea level change may increase human exposure to waterborne pathogens and alter relationships between FIB and pathogens. In addition, population growth and urbanization will exacerbate contamination events and increase the potential for human exposure. The cumulative effects of anthropogenic changes will alter microbial population dynamics in beach habitats and the assumptions and relationships used in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and process-based models.

In conclusion, eltrombopag exhibited excellent antifungal activity against Cryptococcus species potentially via a mode of action which interferes with virulence factors and the calcineurin pathway, indicating that eltrombopag might be usefully repurposed as an antifungal agent for treating cryptococcosis.","authors":[{"name":"Hao-Tai Ko"},{"name":"Li-Hang Hsu"},{"name":"Sheng-Yung Yang"},{"name":"Ying-Lien Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Cryptococcus        "},{"word":"Antifungal agent"},{"word":"Calcineurin"},{"word":"Eltrombopag"}]},"article304":{"pmid":"31297368","title":"Sustained Release of Phosphates From Hydrogel Nanoparticles Suppresses Bacterial Collagenase and Biofilm Formation in vitro.","abs":"Intestinal disease or surgical intervention results in local changes in tissue and host-derived factors triggering bacterial virulence. A key phenotype involved in impaired tissue healing is increased bacterial collagenase expression which degrades intestinal collagen. Antibiotic administration is ineffective in addressing this issue as it inadvertently eliminates normal flora while allowing pathogenic bacteria to bloom and acquire antibiotic resistance. Compounds that could attenuate collagenase production while allowing commensal bacteria to proliferate normally would offer major advantages without the risk of the emergence of resistance. We have previously shown that intestinal phosphate depletion in the surgically stressed host is a major cue that triggers P. aeruginosa virulence which is suppressed under phosphate abundant conditions. Recent findings indicate that orally administered polyphosphate, hexametaphosphate, (PPi) suppresses collagenase, and biofilm production of P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens in animal models of intestinal injury but does not attenuate E. faecalis induced collagenolytic activity (Hyoju et al., 2017). Systemic administration of phosphates, however, is susceptible to rapid clearance. Given the diversity of collagenase producing bacteria and the variation of phosphate metabolism among microbial species, a combination therapy involving different phosphate compounds may be required to attenuate pathogenic phenotypes. To address these barriers, we present a drug delivery approach for sustained release of phosphates from poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) hydrogel nanoparticles. The efficacy of monophosphate (Pi)- and PPi-loaded NPs (NP-Pi and NP-PPi, respectively) and a combination treatment (NP-Pi + NP-PPi) in mitigating collagenase and biofilm production of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens expressing high collagenolytic activity was investigated. NP-PPi was found to significantly decrease collagenase and biofilm production of S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Treatment with either NP-Pi or NP-Pi + NP-PPi resulted in more prominent decreases in E. faecalis collagenase compared to NP-PPi alone. The combination treatment was also found to significantly reduce P. aeruginosa collagenase production. Finally, significant attenuation in biofilm dispersal was observed with NP-PPi or NP-Pi + NP-PPi treatment across all test pathogens. These findings suggest that sustained release of different forms of phosphate confers protection against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, thereby providing a promising treatment to attenuate expression of tissue-disruptive bacterial phenotypes without eradicating protective flora over the course of intestinal healing.","authors":[{"name":"Dylan Nichols"},{"name":"Marja B Pimentel"},{"name":"Fernando T P Borges"},{"name":"Sanjiv K Hyoju"},{"name":"Fouad Teymour"},{"name":"Seok Hoon Hong"},{"name":"Olga Y Zaborina"},{"name":"John C Alverdy"},{"name":"Georgia Papavasiliou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"collagenase"},{"word":"hydrogel"},{"word":"intestinal epithelium"},{"word":"microbes"},{"word":"monophosphate"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"polyphosphate"}]},"article305":{"pmid":"31297098","title":"Preventing Biofilm Formation by Dairy-Associated Bacteria Using Peptide-Coated Surfaces.","abs":"Biofilm-forming bacteria, which colonize the surfaces of equipment in the dairy industry, may adversely affect the safety and quality of the milk and its products.

Acneic strains of C. acnes form biofilms inside skin-gland hollows, inducing inflammation and skin disorders. The essential exogenous products of C. acnes accumulate in the extracellular matrix of the biofilm, conferring essential bacterial functions to this structure. However, little is known about the actual composition of the biofilm matrix of C. acnes. Here, we developed a new technique for the extraction of the biofilm matrix of Gram-positive bacteria without the use of chemical or enzymatic digestion, known to be a source of artifacts. Our method is based on the physical separation of the cells and matrix of sonicated biofilms by ultracentrifugation through a CsCl gradient. Biofilms were grown on the surface of cellulose acetate filters, and the biomass was collected without contamination by the growth medium. The biofilm matrix of the acneic C. acnes RT5 strain appears to consist mainly of polysaccharides. The following is the ratio of the main matrix components: 62.6% polysaccharides, 9.6% proteins, 4.0% DNA, and 23.8% other compounds (porphyrins precursors and other). The chemical structure of the major polysaccharide was determined using a nuclear magnetic resonance technique, the formula being →6)-α-D-Galp-(1→4)-β-D-ManpNAc3NAcA-(1→6)-α-D-Glcp-(1→4)-β-D-ManpNAc3NAcA-(1→3)-β-GalpNAc-(1→.

Due to this, attempts are being made to develop new techniques to combat resistant bacteria, among them the use of strictly lytic bacteriophage particles, CRISPR-Cas, and nanotechnology. The use of these technologies, alone or in combination, is promising for solving a problem that humanity faces today and that could lead to human extinction: the domination of pathogenic bacteria resistant to artificial drugs. This prospective paper discusses the potential of bacteriophage particles, CRISPR-Cas, and nanotechnology for use in combating human (bacterial) infections.","authors":[{"name":"Renata Lima"},{"name":"Fernando Sá Del Fiol"},{"name":"Victor M Balcão"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CRISPR–Cas"},{"word":"bacteriophage particles"},{"word":"multidrug-resistant bacteria"},{"word":"nanotechnology"},{"word":"phage therapy"}]},"article326":{"pmid":"31293118","title":"Blue light emitting diodes cripple Helicobacter pylori by targeting its virulence factors.","abs":"The endogenous photosensitizing porphyrins in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), make blue light therapy an attractive addition to the armamentarium in the war against this very prevalent and difficult to treat infectious agent.","authors":[{"name":"Homa Darmani"},{"name":"Ehda Am Smadi"},{"name":"Sereen Mb Bataineh"}],"keywords":[]},"article327":{"pmid":"31292867","title":"Sewage contamination under water scarcity effects on stream biota: biofilm, grazers, and their interaction.","abs":"One of the most common anthropogenic impacts on river ecosystems is the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants. The effects of this contamination on stream biota may be intensified in Mediterranean climate regions, which comprise a drought period that leads to flow reduction, and ultimately to stagnant pools. To assess individual and combined effects of flow stagnation and sewage contamination, biofilm and gastropod grazers were used in a 5-week experiment with artificial channels to test two flow velocity treatments (stagnant flow/basal flow) and two levels of organic contamination using artificial sewage (no sewage input/sewage input). Stressors' effects were determined on biofilm total biomass and chlorophyll (Chl) content, on oxygen consumption and growth rate of the grazers (Theodoxus fluviatilis), and on the interaction grazer-biofilm given by grazer's feeding activity (i.e., biofilm consumption rate). The single effect of sewage induced an increase in biofilm biomass and Chl-a content, simultaneously increasing both grazers' oxygen consumption and their feeding activity. Diatoms showed a higher sensitivity to flow stagnation, resulting in a lower content of Chl-c. Combined stressors interacted antagonistically for biofilm total biomass, Chl-b contents, and grazers's feeding rate. The effect of sewage increasing biofilm biomass and grazing activity was reduced by the presence of flow stagnation (antagonist factor). Our findings suggest that sewage contamination has a direct effect on the functional response of primary producers and an indirect effect on primary consumers, and this effect is influenced by water flow stagnation.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Raquel Calapez"},{"name":"Carmen L Elias"},{"name":"Salomé F P Almeida"},{"name":"António G Brito"},{"name":"Maria João Feio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chlorophyll, Mesocosms"},{"word":"Flow velocity"},{"word":"Grazing"},{"word":"Multiple stressors"},{"word":"Nutrients"},{"word":"Organic load"},{"word":"Primary productivity"}]},"article328":{"pmid":"31292785","title":"Antimicrobial efficacy of copper-doped titanium surfaces for dental implants.","abs":"The aim of this in vitro study was to quantify the antibacterial effect of a copper-deposited titanium surface as a model for dental implants on the peri-implantitis-associated strain Porphyromonas gingivalis (DSM 20709). A spark-assisted anodization method in a combined deposition-anodization process was applied to deposit copper on discs made of titanium. This method allows the deposition of different concentrations of copper on the surface by varying the process time. Conventional culturing was used to investigate the adhesion of P. gingivalis onto the discs over 2, 4, and 6 h as well as to study the antibacterial effect of copper released in solution. The viability of the bacterial cells is strongly inhibited on copper-deposited discs and reaches a CFU reduction of 3 log-units after 6 h in comparison to the reference. The copper released in solution causes a reduction of 4 log-units after a 6 h incubation time. With a 6 h incubation time, the CFU count decreases with increasing copper concentrations on the disc (by 2% for the 1.3 µg/disc; 32% for the 5.6 µg/disc; and 34% for the 9.5 µg/disc). However, at a higher copper concentration of 17.7 µg/disc, after 6 h, the decrease in the CFU count is less pronounced than that observed in solution, where a further decrease is observed. In conclusion, copper-functionalized titanium significantly reduces the survival of adhered bacteria and decreases the viable bacterial count in the environment surrounding the titanium. Thus, the area surrounding implants is being protected by copper released from the surface, forming a safe zone for improved implant healing.","authors":[{"name":"Monika Astasov-Frauenhoffer"},{"name":"Sally Koegel"},{"name":"Tuomas Waltimo"},{"name":"Andrea Zimmermann"},{"name":"Cyril Walker"},{"name":"Irmgard Hauser-Gerspach"},{"name":"Christiane Jung"}],"keywords":[]},"article329":{"pmid":"31291978","title":"Comparative efficacy of linezolid and vancomycin for endotracheal tube MRSA biofilms from ICU patients.","abs":"To compare the efficacy of systemic treatment with linezolid (LNZ) versus vancomycin (VAN) on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) burden and eradication in endotracheal tube (ETT) biofilm and ETT cuff from orotracheally intubated patients with MRSA respiratory infection.","authors":[{"name":"Laia Fernández-Barat"},{"name":"Ana Motos"},{"name":"Mauro Panigada"},{"name":"Francisco Álvarez-Lerma"},{"name":"Lucía Viña"},{"name":"Ruben Lopez-Aladid"},{"name":"Adrian Ceccato"},{"name":"Gianluigi Li Bassi"},{"name":"David P Nicolau"},{"name":"Yuli Lopez"},{"name":"Laura Muñoz"},{"name":"Laura Guerrero"},{"name":"Dolors Soy"},{"name":"Trinidad Israel"},{"name":"Pedro Castro"},{"name":"Antoni Torres"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Endotracheal tube"},{"word":"Linezolid"},{"word":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Respiratory infection"},{"word":"Vancomycin"}]},"article330":{"pmid":"31291645","title":"Phages in a thermoreversible sustained-release formulation targeting E. faecalis in vitro and in vivo.","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis is a key pathogen recovered from root canals when conventional treatment fails.

The nonsteady-state model predicts conditions that evolve to a steady state that is within 0.02-1% of the solution of the steady-state model, depending on the number of grid points used, confirming the algorithms are valid. Multiple steady states occur if, (1) a biofilm is exposed to a constant gas-phase pollution concentration, which exceeds or undershoots a certain threshold, (2) in a narrow range of parameter values and (3) provided that the pollutant degradation follows Haldane kinetics. Such a biofilm displays half-saturation (i.e., Michaelis-Menten)-like apparent (falsified) kinetics from a concentration range starting at zero up to the occurrence of a second steady state. Multiple steady states and falsified kinetics can negatively affect a biofilter and the experimental determination of kinetic parameters, respectively. Implications: The occurrence of multiple steady states in a VOC treating biofilm, shows the significant impact of degradation kinetics and diffusion limitation on the biofilm behavior. Moreover, the implied possible sudden drop of removal efficiency of a biofilter, based on the occurrence of multiple steady states lead to possible bottle-necks in biofilter application and operation.","authors":[{"name":"Michael Süß"},{"name":"Alex De Visscher"}],"keywords":[]},"article334":{"pmid":"31290730","title":"The Role of a Host-Induced Arginase of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in Promoting Virulence on Rice.","abs":"The plant bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae causes bacterial blight of rice, which is one of the most destructive rice diseases prevalent in Asia and parts of Africa.

The mechanisms underlying C. difficile community formation and inter-bacterial interactions are nevertheless poorly understood. C. difficile produces AI-2, a quorum sensing molecule that modulates biofilm formation across many bacterial species. We found that a strain defective in LuxS, the enzyme that mediates AI-2 production, is defective in biofilm development in vitro. Transcriptomic analyses of biofilms formed by wild type (WT) and luxS mutant (luxS) strains revealed a downregulation of prophage loci in the luxS mutant biofilms compared to the WT. Detection of phages and eDNA within biofilms may suggest that DNA release by phage-mediated cell lysis contributes to C. difficile biofilm formation. In order to understand if LuxS mediates C. difficile crosstalk with other gut species, C. difficile interactions with a common gut bacterium, Bacteroides fragilis, were studied. We demonstrate that C. difficile growth is significantly reduced when co-cultured with B. fragilis in mixed biofilms. Interestingly, the absence of C. difficile LuxS alleviates the B. fragilis-mediated growth inhibition. Dual species RNA-sequencing analyses from single and mixed biofilms revealed differential modulation of distinct metabolic pathways for C. difficile WT, luxS and B. fragilis upon co-culture, indicating that AI-2 may be involved in induction of selective metabolic responses in B. fragilis. Overall, our data suggest that C. difficile LuxS/AI-2 utilises different mechanisms to mediate formation of single and mixed species communities.","authors":[{"name":"Ross T Slater"},{"name":"Lucy R Frost"},{"name":"Sian E Jossi"},{"name":"Andrew D Millard"},{"name":"Meera Unnikrishnan"}],"keywords":[]},"article339":{"pmid":"31288991","title":"An evaluation of buffered peracetic acid as an alternative to chlorine and hydrogen peroxide based disinfectants.","abs":"This short report documents an in-use evaluation of three disinfectant solutions that was conducted within the operating theatre of a South Australian hospital to address a high occurrence of Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI).

Many studies have characterized the response of genetically identical cells to nutrient switches in homogeneous cultures; however, in nature, microbes often live in spatially structured groups such as biofilms where cells can create metabolic gradients by consuming and releasing nutrients. Consequently, cells experience different local microenvironments and vary in their phenotype. How does this phenotypic variation affect the ability of cells to cope with nutrient switches? Here, we address this question by growing dense populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers and studying a switch from glucose to acetate at the single-cell level. Before the switch, cells vary in their metabolic activity: some grow on glucose, while others cross-feed on acetate. After the switch, only few cells can resume growth after a period of lag. The probability to resume growth depends on a cells' phenotype prior to the switch: it is highest for cells cross-feeding on acetate, while it depends in a non-monotonic way on the growth rate for cells growing on glucose. Our results suggest that the strong phenotypic variation in spatially structured populations might enhance their ability to cope with fluctuating environments.","authors":[{"name":"Alma Dal Co"},{"name":"Martin Ackermann"},{"name":"Simon van Vliet"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial biofilms"},{"word":"emergent metabolic gradients"},{"word":"gluconeogenic nutrient switch"},{"word":"lag time"},{"word":"phenotypic variation in clonal populations"},{"word":"spatially structured populations"}]},"article343":{"pmid":"31288325","title":"[Influence of environmental factors on the two-species biofilm formed by Streptococcus oligofermentans and Streptococcus mutans].","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"F Wu"},{"name":"M C Li"},{"name":"C C Sun"},{"name":"Y Liu"},{"name":"L G Wu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Oxygen"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"Streptococcus oligofermentans"},{"word":"Streptococcus sanguinis"},{"word":"Sucrose"},{"word":"pH values"}]},"article344":{"pmid":"31287948","title":"Nontuberculous Mycobacteria in Two Drinking Water Distribution Systems and the Role of Residual Disinfection.","abs":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are frequently found in chloraminated drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) due to their chloramine tolerance.

We further examine how diet may impact these relationships. This work suggests that gut microbiota phenotypes of obesity may differ with race/ethnicity or its correlates, such as dietary components or socioeconomic status.

M. tuberculosis and other mycobacterial species, such as M. smegmatis, are known to generate an inadequate amount of energy by substrate-level phosphorylation and mandatorily require oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for their growth and metabolism. Hence, antibacterial drugs, such as bedaquiline, targeting the multisubunit ATP synthase complex, which is required for OXPHOS, have been developed with the aim of eliminating pathogenic mycobacteria. Here, we explored the influence of suboptimal OXPHOS on the physiology and metabolism of M. smegmatisM. smegmatis harbors two identical copies of atpD, which codes for the β subunit of ATP synthase. We show that upon deletion of one copy of atpD (M. smegmatis ΔatpD), M. smegmatis synthesizes smaller amounts of ATP and enters into an energy-compromised state. The mutant displays remarkable phenotypic and physiological differences from the wild type, such as respiratory slowdown, reduced biofilm formation, lesser amounts of cell envelope polar lipids, and increased antibiotic sensitivity compared to the wild type. Additionally, M. smegmatis ΔatpD overexpresses genes belonging to the dormancy operon, the β-oxidation pathway, and the glyoxylate shunt, suggesting that the mutant adapts to a low energy state by switching to alternative pathways to produce energy. Interestingly, M. smegmatis ΔatpD shows significant phenotypic, metabolic, and physiological similarities with bedaquiline-treated wild-type M. smegmatis We believe that the identification and characterization of key metabolic pathways functioning during an energy-compromised state will enhance our understanding of bacterial adaptation and survival and will open newer avenues in the form of drug targets that may be used in the treatment of mycobacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Varsha Patil"},{"name":"Vikas Jain"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ATP synthase"},{"word":"Mycobacterium smegmatis"},{"word":"atpD"},{"word":"bedaquiline"},{"word":"electron transport chain"},{"word":"energy metabolism"},{"word":"mycobacteria"},{"word":"oxidative phosphorylation"}]},"article357":{"pmid":"31284989","title":"None","abs":"The main goal of this work was to approach food industry conditions in the comparison of the susceptibility of biofilms of Listeria monocytogenes to the biocides benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and peracetic acid (PAA).

In addition, the effect of Lactobacillus kefiri strains 8321 and 83113 and Lactobacillus plantarum 83114 and their surface proteins on biofilm development of Salmonella Enteritidis 115 was studied. The relationship between surface properties of bacteria (hydrophobicity, autoaggregation and coaggregation with lactobacilli) and biofilm formation was also investigated. Most of Salmonella strains were hydrophilic and five strains were moderately hydrophobic. In general, Salmonella strains showed high aggregation abilities (27-54%). S. Enteritidis 106 and S. Typhimurium 102 and 108 showed the highest percentages of autoaggregation. All Salmonella strains tested showed aggregation abilities with the three lactobacilli studied, but the percentage of coaggregation proved to be strain-specific. When comparing stainless steel, glass and polystyrene surfaces, higher levels of biofilm formation occurred on polystyrene plate than on glass surfaces or stainless steel. S. Enteritidis 115 exhibited the greatest attachment to polyestyrene surface. The preincubation or coincubation with the three lactobacilli strains significantly reduced (about 1 log CFU/ml of reduction) the ability of S. Enteritidis 115 to form biofilm compared to the control without lactobacilli. These results were confirmed by confocal microscopy. In the same way, when surface proteins extracted from lactobacilli strains were preincubated or coincubated with S. Enteritidis 115, biofilm formation of this strain was significantly decreased compared to the control. The results obtained showed that these Lactobacillus strains and their surface proteins can be used as alternatives for control of biofilm formation by Salmonella in the poultry industry.","authors":[{"name":"Lina Merino"},{"name":"Fernando M Trejo"},{"name":"Graciela De Antoni"},{"name":"Marina A Golowczyc"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aggregation"},{"word":"Biocontrol"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Surface proteins"}]},"article359":{"pmid":"31284940","title":"Anti-quorum sensing and anti-biofilm activity of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural against Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1: Insights from in vitro, in vivo and in silico studies.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common pathogens associated with nosocomial infections and a great concern to immunocompromised individuals especially in the cases of cystic fibrosis, AIDS and burn wounds.

Among the approaches reported to deal with this problem, surfaces functionalization to render them with antimicrobial characteristics, comprises the most promising one. Most of these strategies, however, are designed to target bacterial biofilms, while fungal biofilms are much less taken into account. In real-life settings, fungi will be inevitably found in consortium with bacteria, especially in the field of biomaterials. The development of antifungal coating strategies to be combined with antibacterial approaches will be pivotal for the fight of biomaterial-associated infections. The main goal of the present study was, therefore, to engineer an effective strategy for the immobilization of liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces to prevent Candida albicans colonization. Immobilization was performed using a two-step mussel-inspired coating strategy, in which PDMS is first immersed in dopamine solution. Its polymerization results in the deposition of a thin adherent film, called polydopamine (pDA), which allowed the incorporation of LAmB, afterwards. Different concentrations of LAmB were screened in order to obtain a contact-killing surface with no release of LAmB. Surface characterization confirmed the polymerization of dopamine and further functionalization with LAmB yielded surfaces with less roughness and more hydrophilic features. The proposed coating strategy rendered the surfaces of PDMS with the ability to prevent the attachment of C. albicans and kill the adherent cells, without toxicity toward mammalian cells. Overall results showed that LAmB immobilization on a surface retained its antifungal activity and reduced toxicity, holding therefore a great potential to be applied for the design of urinary catheters. Since the sessile communities commonly found associated to these devices exhibit a polymicrobial nature, the next challenge will be to co-immobilize LAmB with antibacterial agents to prevent the establishment of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).","authors":[{"name":"Diana Alves"},{"name":"Ana Teresa Vaz"},{"name":"Tânia Grainha"},{"name":"Célia F Rodrigues"},{"name":"Maria Olívia Pereira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"antifungal coating"},{"word":"catheter-associated urinary tract infections"},{"word":"dopamine chemistry"},{"word":"liposomal amphotericin B"}]},"article407":{"pmid":"31275921","title":"Pyro-Electrification of Freestanding Polymer Sheets: A New Tool for Cation-Free Manipulation of Cell Adhesion in vitro.","abs":"Localized electric fields have become, in recent years, a source of inspiration to researchers and laboratories thanks to a huge amount of applications derived from it, including positioning of microparticles as building blocks for electrical, optical, and magnetic devices. The possibility of producing polymeric materials with surface charge thus opens new perspectives for applications where process simplicity and cost-effectiveness of flexible electronics are of fundamental importance. In particular, the influence of surface charges is widely studied and is a critical issue especially when new materials and functional technologies are introduced. Here, we report a voltage-free pyro-electrification (PE) process able to induce a permanent dipole orientation into polymer sheets under both mono- and bipolar distribution. The technique makes use of the pyroelectric effect for generating electric potentials on the order of kilovolts by an easy-to-accomplish thermal treatment of ferroelectric lithium niobate (LN) crystals. The PE allows us to avoid the expensive and time-consuming fabrication of high-power electrical circuits, as occurs in traditional generator-based techniques. Since the technique is fully compatible with spin-coating-based procedures, the pyro-electrified polymer sheets are easily peeled off the surface of the LN crystal after PE completion, thus providing highly stable and freestanding charged sheets. We show the reliability of the technique for different polymers and for different applications ranging from live cell patterning to biofilm formation tests for bacteria linked to food-processing environments.","authors":[{"name":"Romina Rega"},{"name":"Oriella Gennari"},{"name":"Laura Mecozzi"},{"name":"Vito Pagliarulo"},{"name":"Martina Mugnano"},{"name":"Emilia Oleandro"},{"name":"Filomena Nazzaro"},{"name":"Pietro Ferraro"},{"name":"Simonetta Grilli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria biofilm"},{"word":"cell patterning and manipulation"},{"word":"dipoles orientation"},{"word":"lithium niobate"},{"word":"pyro-electrification"},{"word":"pyroelectric effect"}]},"article408":{"pmid":"31275531","title":"Bacterial biofilm composition in healthy subjects with and without caries experience.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Kyrill Schoilew"},{"name":"Helena Ueffing"},{"name":"Alexander Dalpke"},{"name":"Björn Wolff"},{"name":"Cornelia Frese"},{"name":"Diana Wolff"},{"name":"Sébastien Boutin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA"},{"word":"Dental caries"},{"word":"dental health"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"oral microbiome"}]},"article409":{"pmid":"31275529","title":"Killing mechanism of bacteria within multi-species biofilm by blue light.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Sharon Shany-Kdoshim"},{"name":"David Polak"},{"name":"Yael Houri-Haddad"},{"name":"Osnat Feuerstein"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Polymicrobial biofilm"},{"word":"blue light"},{"word":"periodontal disease"}]},"article410":{"pmid":"31275291","title":"A Multicolor Fluorescence in situ Hybridization Approach Using an Extended Set of Fluorophores to Visualize Microorganisms.","abs":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes is a key method for the detection of (uncultured) microorganisms in environmental and medical samples. A major limitation of standard FISH protocols, however, is the small number of phylogenetically distinct target organisms that can be detected simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a multicolor FISH approach that uses eight fluorophores with distinct spectral properties, which can unambiguously be distinguished by confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with white light laser technology. Hybridization of rRNA-targeted DNA oligonucleotide probes, which were mono-labeled with these fluorophores, to Escherichia coli cultures confirmed that the fluorophores did not affect probe melting behavior. Application of the new multicolor FISH method enabled the differentiation of seven (potentially up to eight) phylogenetically distinct microbial populations in an artificial community of mixed pure cultures (five bacteria, one archaeon, and one yeast strain) and in activated sludge from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. In contrast to previously published multicolor FISH approaches, this method does not rely on combinatorial labeling of the same microorganisms with different fluorophores, which is prone to biases. Furthermore, images acquired by this method do not require elaborate post-processing prior to analysis. We also demonstrate that the newly developed multicolor FISH method is compatible with an improved cell fixation protocol for FISH targeting Gram-negative bacterial populations. This fixation approach uses agarose embedding during formaldehyde fixation to better preserve the three-dimensional structure of spatially complex samples such as biofilms and activated sludge flocs. The new multicolor FISH approach should be highly suitable for studying structural and functional aspects of microbial communities in virtually all types of samples that can be analyzed by conventional FISH methods.","authors":[{"name":"Michael Lukumbuzya"},{"name":"Markus Schmid"},{"name":"Petra Pjevac"},{"name":"Holger Daims"}],"keywords":[{"word":"activated sludge"},{"word":"confocal laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"fluorescence in situ hybridization"},{"word":"fluorophores"},{"word":"microorganisms"},{"word":"three-dimensional structure"},{"word":"white light laser"}]},"article411":{"pmid":"31275288","title":"Genetic and Phenotypic Features of a Novel Acinetobacter Species, Strain A47, Isolated From the Clinical Setting.","abs":"In 2014, a novel species of Acinetobacter, strain A47, determined to be hospital-acquired was recovered from a single patient soft tissue sample following a traumatic accident. The complexity of the Acinetobacter genus has been established, and every year novel species are identified. However, specific features and virulence factors that allow members of this genus to be successful pathogens are not well understood. Utilizing both genomic and phenotypic approaches, we identified distinct features and potential virulence factors of the A47 strain to understand its pathobiology. In silico analyses confirmed the uniqueness of this strain and other comparative and sequence analyses were used to study the evolution of relevant features identified in this isolate. The A47 genome was further analyzed for genes associated with virulence and genes involved in type IV pili (T4P) biogenesis, hemolysis, type VI secretion system (T6SS), and novel antibiotic resistance determinants were identified. A47 exhibited natural transformation with both genomic and plasmid DNA. It was able to form biofilms on different surfaces, to cause hemolysis of sheep and rabbit erythrocytes, and to kill competitor bacteria. Additionally, surface structures with non-uniform length were visualized with scanning electron microscopy and proposed as pili-like structures. Furthermore, the A47 genome revealed the presence of two putative BLUF type photoreceptors, and phenotypic assays confirmed the modulation by light of different virulence traits. Taken together, these results provide insight into the pathobiology of A47, which exhibits multiple virulence factors, natural transformation, and the ability to sense and respond to light, which may contribute to the success of an A47 as a hospital dwelling pathogen.","authors":[{"name":"Sareda T J Schramm"},{"name":"Kori Place"},{"name":"Sabrina Montaña"},{"name":"Marisa Almuzara"},{"name":"Sammie Fung"},{"name":"Jennifer S Fernandez"},{"name":"Marisel R Tuttobene"},{"name":"Adrián Golic"},{"name":"Matías Altilio"},{"name":"German M Traglia"},{"name":"Carlos Vay"},{"name":"Maria Alejandra Mussi"},{"name":"Andres Iriarte"},{"name":"Maria Soledad Ramirez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acinetobacter spp."},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"natural transformation"},{"word":"virulence traits"}]},"article412":{"pmid":"31275267","title":"AHLs Regulate Biofilm Formation and Swimming Motility of Hafnia alvei H4.","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) in the regulation of swimming motility of Hafnia alvei H4 and its biofilm formation on 96-well plate, glass and stainless-steel surfaces. The luxI gene, which codes for an enzyme involved in AHL synthesis, was deleted to generate a luxI mutant (ΔluxI). The mutant produced no AHL, and the relative expression of the luxR gene was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. In addition, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the relative expression of the luxR gene in ΔluxI was stimulated by the presence of exogenous AHLs (C4-HSL, C6-HSL, and 3-o-C8-HSL) added at concentrations ranging from of 50-250 μg/ml. Among the three AHLs, C6-HSL had the strongest effect. The ability of ΔluxI to form biofilm on 96-well plate, glass and stainless-steel surfaces was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) compared with the wild type (WT), but was increased when provided with 150 μg/ml C4-HSL, whereas C6-HSL and 3-o-C8-HSL had no effect. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the biofilm revealed less bacteria adhering to the surface of stainless-steel and fewer filaments were found binding to the cells compared with the WT. Furthermore, ΔluxI also exhibited significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the expression of biofilm- and swimming motility-related genes, flgA, motA and cheA, consistent with the results observed for biofilm formation and swimming motility.

These contaminants have widespread negative effects on human health and ecosystem functioning. Natural attenuation of long chain and polyaromatic hydrocarbons is slow and often incomplete. Bioaugmentation of polluted soils with indigenous bacteria that naturally consume petroleum hydrocarbons could speed up this process. However, the characterization of bacterial crude oil degradation efficiency - which often relies upon expensive, highly specialized gas-chromatography mass spectrometry analyses - can present a substantial bottleneck in developing and implementing these bioremediation strategies. Here, we develop a low-cost, rapid, high-throughput fluorescence-based assay for identifying wild-type bacteria that degrade crude oil using the dye Nile Red. We show that Nile Red fluoresces when in contact with crude oil and developed a robust linear model to calculate crude oil content in liquid cell cultures based on fluorescence intensity (FI). To test whether this assay could identify bacteria with enhanced metabolic capacities to break down crude oil, we screened bacteria isolated from a former Shell Oil refinery in Bay Point, CA, and identified one strain (Cupriavidus sp. OPK) with superior crude oil depletion efficiencies (up to 83%) in only 3 days. We further illustrate that this assay can be combined with fluorescence microscopy to study how bacteria interact with crude oil and the strategies they use to degrade this complex substance. We show for the first time that bacteria use three key strategies for degrading crude oil: biofilm formation, direct adherence to oil droplets, and vesicle encapsulation of oil. We propose that the quantitative and qualitative data from this assay can be used to develop new bioremediation strategies based on bioaugmentation and/or biomimetic materials that imitate the natural ability of bacteria to degrade crude oil.","authors":[{"name":"Katherine E French"},{"name":"Norman Terry"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioaugmentation"},{"word":"biomimicry"},{"word":"bioremediation"},{"word":"fluorescence microscopy"},{"word":"petroleum hydrocarbons"}]},"article414":{"pmid":"31274401","title":"Umbilical catheters as vectors for generalized bacterial infection in premature infants regardless of antibiotic use.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Alina Sobczak"},{"name":"Joanna Klepacka"},{"name":"Dalia Amrom"},{"name":"Iwona Żak"},{"name":"Piotr Kruczek"},{"name":"Przemko Kwinta"}],"keywords":[{"word":"catheter-related infections"},{"word":"central venous catheterization"},{"word":"cross infection"},{"word":"infant, newborn, low birth weight, extremely premature"},{"word":"intensive care units, neonatal"},{"word":"risk factors"},{"word":"umbilicus"}]},"article415":{"pmid":"31274149","title":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization for identification and visualization of microorganisms in infected heart valve tissue as addition to standard diagnostic tests improves diagnosis of endocarditis.","abs":"In infective endocarditis (IE), identification of the causative organism and consecutive treatment are crucial for patient survival.

The loss of hydraulic conductivity could be attributed to vessel occlusions induced both by the bacteria biofilm and by plant responses (tyloses, gums, etc.) that could trigger embolism. The ability of the infected plants to detect embolism and to respond, by activating mechanisms to restore the hydraulic conductivity, can influence the severity of the disease symptomatology. In order to investigate these mechanisms in the X. fastidiosa-resistant olive cultivar Leccino and in the susceptible Cellina di Nardò, sections of healthy olive stems were analysed by laser scanning microscope to calculate the cavitation vulnerability index. Findings indicated that the cultivar Leccino seems to be constitutively less susceptible to cavitation than the susceptible one. Among the vascular refilling mechanisms, starch hydrolysis is a well-known strategy to refill xylem vessels that suffered cavitation and it is characterized by a dense accumulation of starch grains in the xylem parenchima; SEM-EDX analysis of stem cross-sections of infected plants revealed an aggregation of starch grains in the Leccino xylem vessels. These observations could indicate that this cultivar, as well as being anatomically less susceptible to cavitation, it also could be able to activate more efficient refilling mechanisms, restoring vessel's hydraulic conductivity. In order to verify this hypothesis, we analysed the expression levels of some genes belonging to families involved in embolism sensing and refilling mechanisms: aquaporins, sucrose transporters, carbohydrate metabolism and enzymes related to starch breakdown, alpha and beta-amylase.

Quantitative measurements revealed that PA2121 repressed biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides (alginate, psl and pel). Furthermore, it was observed that PA2121 was self-regulated, highly expressed in the early phase of biofilm development, and subject to the negative regulation by a biofilm synthesis regulator SrpA that binds directly to the PA2121 gene promoter. Collectively, this study proposes that PA2121 is a novel biofilm synthesis repressor (BsrA) in P. aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaojing Yang"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Zhang"},{"name":"Zhiwei Huang"},{"name":"Xixi Zhang"},{"name":"Donghang Li"},{"name":"Li Sun"},{"name":"Jiajia You"},{"name":"Xuewei Pan"},{"name":"Hongjiang Yang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BsrA"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm synthesis"},{"word":"repressor"}]},"article432":{"pmid":"31268675","title":"Novel Oleanolic and Maslinic Acid Derivatives as a Promising Treatment against Bacterial Biofilm in Nosocomial Infections: An in Vitro and in Vivo Study.","abs":"Oleanolic acid (OA) and maslinic acid (MA) are pentacyclic triterpenic compounds that abound in industrial olive oil waste.

In this work, a set of 14 OA and MA C-28 amide derivatives have been synthesized. Two of these derivatives, MA-HDA and OA-HDA, increase the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the parent compounds while reducing their toxicity in most of the Gram-positive bacteria tested, including a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-MRSA. MA-HDA also shows an enhanced in vivo efficacy in a Galleria mellonella invertebrate animal model of infection. A preliminary attempt to elucidate their mechanism of action revealed that these compounds are able to penetrate and damage the bacterial cell membrane.

These cell wall-anchored (CWA) proteins can be classified into several structural and functional groups. The largest is the MSCRAMM family, which is characterized by tandemly repeated IgG-like folded domains that bind peptide ligands by the dock lock latch mechanism or the collagen triple helix by the collagen hug. Several CWA proteins comprise modules that have different functions, and some individual domains can bind different ligands, sometimes by different mechanisms. For example, the N-terminus of the fibronectin binding proteins comprises an MSCRAMM domain which binds several ligands, while the C-terminus is composed of tandem fibronectin binding repeats. Surface proteins promote adhesion to host cells and tissue, including components of the extracellular matrix, contribute to biofilm formation by stimulating attachment to the host or indwelling medical devices followed by cell-cell accumulation via homophilic interactions between proteins on neighboring cells, help bacteria evade host innate immune responses, participate in iron acquisition from host hemoglobin, and trigger invasion of bacteria into cells that are not normally phagocytic. The study of genetically manipulated strains using animal infection models has shown that many CWA proteins contribute to pathogenesis. Fragments of CWA proteins have the potential to be used in multicomponent vaccines to prevent S. aureus infections.","authors":[{"name":"Timothy J Foster"}],"keywords":[]},"article435":{"pmid":"31267736","title":"Tailoring Bacteria Response by Piezoelectric Stimulation.","abs":"Bacteria are simple organisms with a remarkable capacity for survival by adapting to different environments, which is a result of their long evolutionary history. Taking into consideration these adapting mechanisms, this work now investigates the effect of electrically active microenvironments on bacteria and on how this stimulation may trigger bacteria growth inhibition or proliferation. Electrical microenvironments are generated via stimulation of a piezoelectric polymer with a mechanical cue, thus developing an electrical response and a variation on the surface charge of the polymeric material. Specifically, Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli were grown overnight under static and dynamic conditions on piezoelectric poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) films to further study bacteria behavior under: (i) the effect of the material surface charge in static conditions, (ii) the mechanical effect, and (iii) the piezoelectric effect, the last two performed under dynamic conditions. Bacteria viability in planktonic and biofilm forms was measured, and the microorganism morphology was characterized. Whereas E. coli responds little to any of the stimuli application, S. epidermidis growth can be regulated through the material surface charge and by the applied frequency. Positively charged PVDF induces bacterial growth inhibition in planktonic and adhered cells in static conditions, whereas antifouling properties are obtained when a mechanical or piezoelectric effect at 4 Hz stimuli is applied. By increasing the stimuli to 40 Hz, however, the adhesion of bacteria is promoted. In conclusion, the behavior of certain bacteria species is tailored through the application of piezoelectric materials, which provide sufficient mechanoelectrical stimuli for growth or inhibition of bacteria, allowing for the design of suitable anti- and promicrobial strategies. Such strategies are only found in studies related to mammalian cells, whereas in bacterial cells this type of stimuli are still unknown. Thus, this work provides one of the first insights on the effect of piezoelectric stimuli on bacterial cells.","authors":[{"name":"Estela O Carvalho"},{"name":"Margarida M Fernandes"},{"name":"Jorge Padrao"},{"name":"Ana Nicolau"},{"name":"Jorge Marqués-Marchán"},{"name":"Agustina Asenjo"},{"name":"Francisco M Gama"},{"name":"Clarisse Ribeiro"},{"name":"Senentxu Lanceros-Mendez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Gram-negative bacteria"},{"word":"Gram-positive bacteria"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"mechanoelectric effect"},{"word":"piezoelectric material"},{"word":"promicrobial"},{"word":"surface charge"}]},"article436":{"pmid":"31267396","title":"Pilot-scale application of a single-stage hybrid airlift BioCAST bioreactor for treatment of ammonium from nitrite-limited wastewater by a partial nitrification/anammox process.","abs":"This paper presents the treatment of a nitrite-limited wastewater by partial nitrification/anammox process under different dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of < 1.2 mg/L, < 0.5 mg/L, and 0 mg/L, and at temperatures of 35 to 27 °C in a pilot-scale single-stage hybrid bioreactor (BioCAST).

As conventional treatment is not effective against infections by persisters and MDR-Mtb, novel therapeutics are needed. Several approaches were proposed to kill persisters by altering their metabolism, obviating the need to target active processes. Here, we adapted a biofilm culture to model Mtb persister-like bacilli (PLB) and demonstrated that PLB underwent trehalose metabolism remodeling. PLB use trehalose as an internal carbon to biosynthesize central carbon metabolism intermediates instead of cell surface glycolipids, thus maintaining levels of ATP and antioxidants. Similar changes were identified in Mtb following antibiotic-treatment, and MDR-Mtb as mechanisms to circumvent antibiotic effects. This suggests that trehalose metabolism is associated not only with transient drug-tolerance but also permanent drug-resistance, and serves as a source of adjunctive therapeutic options, potentiating antibiotic efficacy by interfering with adaptive strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Jae Jin Lee"},{"name":"Sun-Kyung Lee"},{"name":"Naomi Song"},{"name":"Temitope O Nathan"},{"name":"Benjamin M Swarts"},{"name":"Seok-Yong Eum"},{"name":"Sabine Ehrt"},{"name":"Sang-Nae Cho"},{"name":"Hyungjin Eoh"}],"keywords":[]},"article438":{"pmid":"31266876","title":"Antifungal Activity of the Enterococcus faecalis Peptide EntV Requires Protease Cleavage and Disulfide Bond Formation.","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis, a Gram-positive bacterium, and Candida albicans, a polymorphic fungus, are common constituents of the microbiome as well as increasingly problematic causes of infections. Interestingly, we previously showed that these two species antagonize each other's virulence and that E. faecalis inhibition of C. albicans was specifically mediated by EntV. EntV is a bacteriocin encoded by the entV (ef1097) locus that reduces C. albicans virulence and biofilm formation by inhibiting hyphal morphogenesis. In this report, we studied the posttranslational modifications necessary for EntV antifungal activity. First, we show that the E. faecalis secreted enzyme gelatinase (GelE) is responsible for cleaving EntV into its 68-amino-acid, active form and that this process does not require the serine protease SprE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a disulfide bond that forms within EntV is necessary for antifungal activity. Abrogating this bond by chemical treatment or genetic modification rendered EntV inactive against C. albicans Moreover, we identified the likely catalyst of this disulfide bond, a previously uncharacterized thioredoxin within the E. faecalis genome called DsbA. Loss of DsbA, or disruption of its redox-active cysteines, resulted in loss of EntV antifungal activity. Finally, we show that disulfide bond formation is not a prerequisite for cleavage; EntV cleavage proceeded normally in the absence of DsbA. In conclusion, we present a model in which following secretion, EntV undergoes disulfide bond formation by DsbA and cleavage by GelE in order to generate a peptide capable of inhibiting C. albicans","authors":[{"name":"Armand O Brown"},{"name":"Carrie E Graham"},{"name":"Melissa R Cruz"},{"name":"Kavindra V Singh"},{"name":"Barbara E Murray"},{"name":"Michael C Lorenz"},{"name":"Danielle A Garsin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"Enterococcus"},{"word":"antifungals"},{"word":"bacteriocins"}]},"article439":{"pmid":"31266165","title":"Antibacterial Additives in Epoxy Resin-Based Root Canal Sealers: A Focused Review.","abs":"Dental materials used in root canal treatment have undergone substantial improvements over the past decade. However, one area that still remains to be addressed is the ability of root canal fillings to effectively entomb, kill bacteria, and prevent the formation of a biofilm, all of which will prevent reinfection of the root canal system. Thus far, no published review has analysed the literature on antimicrobial additives to root canal sealers and their influence on physicochemical properties. The aim of this paper was to systematically review the current literature on antimicrobial additives in root canal sealers, their anti-fouling effects, and influence on physicochemical properties. A systematic search was performed in two databases (PubMed and Scopus) to identify studies that investigated the effect of antimicrobial additives in epoxy resin-based root canal sealers. The nature of additives, their antimicrobial effects, methods of antimicrobial testing are critically discussed. The effects on sealer properties have also been reviewed. A total of 31 research papers were reviewed in this work. A variety of antimicrobial agents have been evaluated as additives to epoxy resin-based sealers, including quaternary ammonium compounds, chlorhexidine, calcium hydroxide, iodoform, natural extracts, antibiotics, antifungal drugs, and antimicrobial agent-functionalised nanoparticles. Antimicrobial additives generally improved the antimicrobial effect of epoxy resin-based sealers mainly without deteriorating the physicochemical properties, which mostly remained in accordance with ISO and ANSI/ADA specifications.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander Brezhnev"},{"name":"Prasanna Neelakantan"},{"name":"Ray Tanaka"},{"name":"Sergey Brezhnev"},{"name":"George Fokas"},{"name":"Jukka P Matinlinna"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"endodontics"},{"word":"epoxy resin"},{"word":"nanoparticle"},{"word":"obturation"},{"word":"quaternary ammonium"},{"word":"root canal"},{"word":"sealer"}]}}
