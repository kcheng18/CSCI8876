However, ARGs harbored in drinking water remain largely unexplored. In this study, a simulated water supply system was designed to study the effects of different pipe flow rates on the transmission of antibiotic resistance in water supply systems. We observed that the biofilm in low flow rate pipeline (0.1 m/s, 0.3 m/s) had higher concentration of both antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARGs, while high flow rate (0.5 m/s and 0.7 m/s) resulted in low relative abundance of ARB and high relative abundance of ARGs in biofilms. The results showed that the high flow rate led to an abundance in non-culturable bacteria and a scarcity of nutrients in the biofilm, giving rise to its antibiotic resistance. High-throughput sequencing pointed out that the high content of Caulobacteraceae and Paenibacillus were determined in biofilms of high flow rate pipelines. Similarity analysis of microbial community composition of inlet water (IW), biofilms and outlet water (OW) showed that the composition of microbial community in OW was more similar to that in biofilms than in IW. Genera of bacteria in biofilms and OW (Brevundimonas, Brevibacillus and Pseudomonas) which had relationship with sulⅠ, sulⅡ in biofilms (P < 0.05) had higher relative abundance than that in IW. Different flow rate conditions had an impact on the biomass, microbial community, ARB and ARGs composition of biofilms. Thus, the detachment of biofilms can increased the antibiotic resistance of the water.","authors":[{"name":"Junpeng Zhang"},{"name":"Weiying Li"},{"name":"Jiping Chen"},{"name":"Feng Wang"},{"name":"Wanqi Qi"},{"name":"Yue Li"},{"name":"Bing Xie"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Hydraulic conditions"},{"word":"Simulated water supply system"},{"word":"Tap water"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"31265978","title":"Prolonged exposure of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia biofilms to trace levels of clofibric acid alters antimicrobial tolerance and virulence.","abs":"The presence of pharmaceuticals in water sources, including in drinking water (DW), is increasingly being recognized as an emerging and global concern for the environment and public health. Based on the principles of the One Health initiative, the present work aims to understand the effects of clofibric acid (CA), a lipid regulator, on the behavior of a selected bacterium isolated from drinking water (DW). Biofilms of the opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were exposed to CA for 12 weeks at 170 and 17000 ng/L. The effects of CA were evaluated on planktonic S. maltophilia susceptibility to chlorine and antibiotics (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, kanamycin, levofloxacin, oxacillin, spectinomycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), biofilm formation, motility, siderophores production and on the adhesion and internalization of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29). It was found that CA did not affect planktonic S. maltophilia tolerance to chlorine exposure. Additionally, no effects were observed on biofilm formation, motility and siderophores production. However, biofilms formed after CA exposure were more tolerant to chlorine disinfection and lower CFU reductions were obtained. Of additional concern was the effect of CA exposure on S. maltophilia increased tolerance to erythromycin. CA exposure also slightly reduced S. maltophilia ability to invade HT-29 cells.

This study aims to explore the role of thioredoxin-A protein (TrxA) in A. baumannii virulence. We determined that deletion of the TrxA gene did not significantly affect resistance to environmental stressors such as temperature, salt, and pH.

Coaggregation is a process that facilitates the formation of biofilm. In a preliminary in vitro study, high coaggregation index and biofilm production were found between V. cholerae with human commensals namely Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Building upon these results, the effects of coaggregation were further evaluated using adult BALB/c mouse model. The animal study showed no significant differences in mortality and fluid accumulation ratio between treatment groups infected with V. cholerae alone and those infected with coaggregation partnership (V. cholerae with E. coli or V. cholerae with E. cloacae). However, mild inflammation was detected in both partnering pairs. Higher density of V. cholerae was recovered from faecal samples of mice co-infected with E. coli and V. cholerae in comparison with other groups at 24 h post-infection.

This study adopts an integrative workflow that permits the characterisation of previously unclassified bacterial taxa from microbiomes through: (1) imaging of the spatial structure; (2) taxonomic classification and (3) genome recovery. Our study attempts to bridge the gaps between metagenomics/metatranscriptomics and high-resolution biomass imaging methods by developing new fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) probes-termed as R-Probes-from shotgun reads that harbour hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. The sample-centric design of R-Probes means that probes can directly hybridise to OTUs as detected in shotgun sequencing surveys. The primer-free probe design captures larger microbial diversity as compared to canonical probes. R-Probes were designed from deep-sequenced RNA-Seq datasets for both FISH imaging and FISH-Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FISH-FACS). FISH-FACS was used for target enrichment of previously unclassified bacterial taxa prior to downstream multiple displacement amplification (MDA), genomic sequencing and genome recovery. After validation of the workflow on an axenic isolate of Thauera species, the techniques were applied to investigate two previously uncharacterised taxa from a tropical full-scale activated sludge community. In some instances, probe design on the hypervariable region allowed differentiation to the species level.

In phytopathogens, intracellular fluctuations in the concentration of this molecule contribute to the lifestyle switching from a motile and virulent stage to a sessile and biofilm-forming phase. Among the virulence mechanisms used by bacterial pathogens, different specific type secretion systems (TSSs) and the effector proteins that they translocate are included. Some of these TSS are conceived to suppress host immune responses during bacterial colonization. The modulation of the expression of secretion systems components and/or effector proteins can be influenced by c-di-GMP levels at transcriptional, translational, or post-translational levels and can take place directly by binding to specific or global regulators, or via transducer proteins. Different genera of plant-interacting bacteria have been analyzed to shed some light in the implications of c-di-GMP in the regulation of host plant colonization through protein secretion systems. Expression of (1) adhesins secreted by Type 1 secretion systems to bind the host plant in Pectobacterium (formerly Erwinia) and some beneficial Pseudomonas strains; (2) catalytic exoproteins delivered by Type 2 secretion systems to break plant cell wall in Dickeya; (3) effectors secreted by Type 3 secretion systems to suppress plant immunity in Xanthomonas; or (4) the activity of Type 6 secretion systems to export an ATPase in Pseudomonas, are finely tuned by c-di-GMP levels.

As described here, we used confocal imaging to probe the structure of these flocs, and we developed a quantitative assay for floc formation based on fluorescence imaging of 6-well plates. The flocs are formed from strands of linked cells, sometimes packed into dense clusters but also containing voids with very few cells. Cells within the dense clusters show signs of nutrient stress, as judged by the subcellular distribution of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Vipp1 protein. We analyzed the effects on flocculation of a series of mutations that alter piliation and motility, including Δhfq, ΔpilB1, ΔpilT1, and ΔushA mutations and deletion mutations affecting major and minor pilins. The extent of flocculation is increased in the hyperpiliated ΔpilT1 mutant, but active cycles of pilus extension and retraction are not required for flocculation. Deletion of PilA1, the major subunit of type IV pili, has no effect on flocculation; however, flocculation is lost in mutants lacking an operon coding for the minor pilins PilA9 to -11. Therefore, minor pilins appear crucial for flocculation. We show that flocculation is a tightly regulated process that is promoted by blue light perception by the cyanobacteriochrome Cph2. Floc formation also seems to be a highly cooperative process. A proportion of nonflocculating Δhfq cells can be incorporated into wild-type flocs, but the presence of a high proportion of Δhfq cells disrupts the large-scale architecture of the floc.","authors":[{"name":"Fabian D Conradi"},{"name":"Rui-Qian Zhou"},{"name":"Sabrina Oeser"},{"name":"Nils Schuergers"},{"name":"Annegret Wilde"},{"name":"Conrad W Mullineaux"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cell adhesion"},{"word":"cyanobacteria"},{"word":"cyanobacteriochrome"},{"word":"flocculation"},{"word":"photoreceptors"},{"word":"type IV pili"}]},"article16":{"pmid":"31262835","title":"Regulation of waaH by PhoB during P","abs":"In open environments such as water, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 responds to inorganic phosphate (P","authors":[{"name":"Philippe Vogeleer"},{"name":"Antony T Vincent"},{"name":"Samuel M Chekabab"},{"name":"Steve J Charette"},{"name":"Alexey Novikov"},{"name":"Martine Caroff"},{"name":"Francis Beaudry"},{"name":"Mario Jacques"},{"name":"Josée Harel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EHEC"},{"word":"Pho regulon"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"lipopolysaccharide"},{"word":"phosphate"}]},"article17":{"pmid":"31262758","title":"Thiostrepton Hijacks Pyoverdine Receptors To Inhibit Growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a biofilm-forming opportunistic pathogen and is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. In a high-throughput screen for molecules that modulate biofilm formation, we discovered that the thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton (TS), which is considered to be inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, stimulated P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. This phenotype is characteristic of exposure to antimicrobial compounds at subinhibitory concentrations, suggesting that TS was active against P. aeruginosa Supporting this observation, TS inhibited the growth of a panel of 96 multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa clinical isolates at low-micromolar concentrations. TS also had activity against Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. The expression of Tsr, a 23S rRNA-modifying methyltransferase from TS producer Streptomyces azureus, in trans conferred TS resistance, confirming that the drug acted via its canonical mode of action, inhibition of ribosome function. The deletion of oligopeptide permease systems used by other peptide antibiotics for uptake failed to confer TS resistance. TS susceptibility was inversely proportional to iron availability, suggesting that TS exploits uptake pathways whose expression is increased under iron starvation. Consistent with this finding, TS activity against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was potentiated by the FDA-approved iron chelators deferiprone and deferasirox and by heat-inactivated serum. Screening of P. aeruginosa mutants for TS resistance revealed that it exploits pyoverdine receptors FpvA and FpvB to cross the outer membrane. We show that the biofilm stimulation phenotype can reveal cryptic subinhibitory antibiotic activity, and that TS has activity against select multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens under iron-limited growth conditions, similar to those encountered at sites of infection.","authors":[{"name":"Michael R M Ranieri"},{"name":"Derek C K Chan"},{"name":"Luke N Yaeger"},{"name":"Madeleine Rudolph"},{"name":"Sawyer Karabelas-Pittman"},{"name":"Hamdi Abdo"},{"name":"Jessica Chee"},{"name":"Hanjeong Harvey"},{"name":"Uyen Nguyen"},{"name":"Lori L Burrows"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acinetobacter"},{"word":"antibiotic"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"iron uptake"},{"word":"subinhibitory"},{"word":"thiopeptide"},{"word":"thiostrepton"}]},"article18":{"pmid":"31262523","title":"Combined Confocal Microscope and Brandaris 128 Ultra-High-Speed Camera.","abs":"Controlling microbubble-mediated drug delivery requires the underlying biological and physical mechanisms to be unraveled.

Mechanistically, this includes a direct inhibition of the fibre assembly, but also triggers a cell envelope stress response that down-regulates the synthesis of these widely occurring biofilm matrix polymers. Based on its anti-amyloidogenic properties, EGCG seems useful against biofilms involved in cariogenesis or chronic wound infection. However, EGCG seems inefficient against or may even sometimes promote biofilms which rely on other types of matrix polymers, suggesting that searching for 'magic bullet' anti-biofilm agents is an unrealistic goal. Combining molecular and ecophysiological aspects in this review also illustrates why plants control the formation of biofilms on their surfaces by producing anti-amyloidogenic compounds such as EGCG.

Indeed, flexible carbon assimilation enhances pathogenicity and affects the immunogenicity of Candida albicans. Over the last decade, Candida glabrata has emerged as one of the most common and problematic causes of invasive candidiasis. Despite this, the links between carbon metabolism, fitness, and pathogenicity in C. glabrata are largely unexplored. Therefore, this study has investigated the impact of alternative carbon metabolism on the fitness and pathogenic attributes of C. glabrata. We confirm our previous observation that growth on carbon sources other than glucose, namely acetate, lactate, ethanol, or oleate, attenuates both the planktonic and biofilm growth of C. glabrata, but that biofilms are not significantly affected by growth on glycerol. We extend this by showing that C. glabrata cells grown on these alternative carbon sources undergo cell wall remodeling, which reduces the thickness of their β-glucan and chitin inner layer while increasing their outer mannan layer. Furthermore, alternative carbon sources modulated the oxidative stress resistance of C. glabrata as well as the resistance of C. glabrata to an antifungal drug. In short, key fitness and pathogenic attributes of C. glabrata are shown to be dependent on carbon source.

Among them, the most clinically relevant species is Mycobacterium abscessus. Multiple resistance to antibiotics and the ability to form biofilm contributes considerably to the treatment failure. The search of novel anti-mycobacterial agents for the control of biofilm growth mode is crucial. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the activity of carvacrol (CAR) against planktonic and biofilm cells of resistant RGM strains. The susceptibility of RGM strains (n = 11) to antibiotics and CAR was assessed by MIC/MBC evaluation. The CAR activity was estimated by also vapour contact assay. The effect on biofilm formation and preformed biofilm was measured by evaluation of bacterial growth, biofilm biomass and biofilm metabolic activity. MIC values were equal to 64 μg/mL for most of RGM isolates (32-512 μg/mL), MBCs were 2-4 times higher than MICs, and MICs of vapours were lower (16 μg/mL for most RGM isolates) than MICs in liquid phase. Regarding the biofilm, CAR at concentrations of 1/2 × MIC and 1/4 × MIC showed a strong inhibition of biofilm formation (61-77%) and at concentration above the MIC (2-8 × MIC) produced significant inhibition of 4- and 8-day preformed biofilms.

However, despite the extensive work in this area, there are no studies which directly assess the biofilm formation (biofouling) capabilities of the material, which is an essential consideration because biofouling often causes deterioration in the sensor performance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most prevalent bacterial pathogens linked to water-related diseases, with a strong capacity for forming biofilms on surfaces that are exposed to aquatic environments. In this study, we comparatively evaluate the biofouling capabilities of oxygen-terminated (O-)BDD against materials commonly employed as either the packaging or sensing element in water quality sensors, with an aim to identify factors which control biofilm formation on BDD. We assess the monospecies biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in two different growth media, Luria-Bertani, a high nutrient source and drinking water, a low nutrient source, at two different temperatures (20 and 37 °C). Multispecies biofilm formation is also investigated. The performance of O-BDD, when tested against all other materials, promotes the lowest extent of P. aeruginosa monospecies biofilm formation, even with corrections made for total surface area (roughness). Importantly, O-BDD shows the lowest water contact angle of all materials tested, that is, greatest hydrophilicity, strongly suggesting that for these bacterial species, the factors controlling the hydrophilicity of the surface are important in reducing bacterial adhesion. This was further proven by keeping the surface topography fixed and changing surface termination to hydrogen (H-), to produce a strongly hydrophobic surface. A noticeable increase in biofilm formation was found. Doping with boron also results in changes in hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity compared to the undoped counterpart, which in turn affects the bacterial growth. For practical electrochemical sensing applications in aquatic environments, this study highlights the extremely beneficial effects of employing smooth, O-terminated (hydrophilic) BDD electrodes.","authors":[{"name":"Lee J Simcox"},{"name":"Rui P A Pereira"},{"name":"Elizabeth M H Wellington"},{"name":"Julie V Macpherson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofouling"},{"word":"boron doped diamond"},{"word":"diamond"},{"word":"hydrophobicity"},{"word":"roughness"},{"word":"sensor"}]},"article28":{"pmid":"31260145","title":"Evaluating the antibacterial and antibiofilm potential of sulphated polysaccharides extracted from green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.","abs":"In this study, antibacterial and antibiofilm potential of sulphated polysaccharides (SPs) extracted from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr) was evaluated against Neisseria mucosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp. and Bacillus subtilis.","authors":[{"name":"J Vishwakarma"},{"name":"S L Vavilala"}],"keywords":[{"word":"algae"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"bacterial infections"},{"word":"natural compounds"},{"word":"sulphated polysaccharides"}]},"article29":{"pmid":"31260122","title":"Biological activity of glycine and alanine derivatives of quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) against micro-organisms.","abs":"Quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) are commonly used in medicine, agriculture and industry and their wide usage caused the development of microbial resistance, thus there is still a need for new effective antimicrobial agents.

Stable aqueous ozone ultrafine bubble water (OUFBW) has recently begun to be used as an antiseptic in the treatment of periodontitis. The effectiveness of OUFBW is thought to depend on the bactericidal actions of dissolved ozone exerted via its oxidizing effect. On the other hand, the effects of ozone on the periodontal tissues are largely unknown. In this paper we examined the cellular responses after OUFBW treatment. Human primary periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLFs) or Ca9-22 human gingival epithelial cells were treated with OUFBW or UV-inactivated OUFBW. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation were analyzed. The transcript profiles of hPDLFs after OUFBW treatment were also analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our results showed that OUFBW induces oxidative stress by generating ROS, which, in turn, activated the MAPK pathway. OUFBW triggered activation of c-Fos, a major component of the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1), and also nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which possessed a high sensitivity to oxidative stress. The results of RNA-seq analysis revealed that the numerous genes involved in oxidative stress responses or MAPK signaling pathway were up-regulated after OUFBW treatment.

Candidemia has significant mortality globally. No epidemiological study of C. albicans based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been conducted in Thailand. Therefore, MLST was used to study the molecular epidemiology of C. albicans blood strains in a large Thai teaching hospital. In vitro virulence phenotypes and antifungal susceptibility testing by broth microdilution were also conducted. Forty-six C. albicans blood strains from 37 patients were collected from the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital, in 2016 and 2017. Most patients (71.8%) were more than 60 years old, and the case fatality rate was 54.8%. The male-to-female ratio was 5:3. Thirty-four diploid sequence types (DSTs), including six new DSTs, were identified, with DST2514 (8.7%) and DST2876 (8.7%) as the most common DSTs. Strains were clustered into nine clades. Unlike other studies of C. albicans blood strains in Asia, clade 17 was the most common (13 strains, 28.3%). Sequential allelic changes were evident in sequential strains from one patient. All strains produced phospholipase and hemolysin, while none produced proteinase. The ability to form biofilm was found in 82.6% of the strains. Clade 17 strains showed significantly stronger hemolytic activity than non-clade 17 strains (69.2% versus 27.3%; p = 0.022). However, no significant association existed between clades and patient mortalities. All were susceptible or wild type to anidulafungin (MIC range = 0.015-0.12 and GM = 0.030), micafungin (MIC range = ≤ 0.008-0.015 and GM = 0.008), caspofungin (MIC range = 0.008-0.12 and GM = 0.036), and amphotericin B (MIC range = 0.25-0.5 and GM = 0.381). Only one strain was resistant to voriconazole (MIC range = ≤ 0.008 to ≥ 8 and GM = 0.010) and fluconazole (MIC range = 0.12-16 and GM = 0.398).

Additionally, hormones impaired the susceptibility of C. albicans and C. glabrata cells to azoles, with potential clinical significance in the presence of pregnancy hormone levels. A similar result was obtained for the susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide, a biological vaginal barrier against Candida growth. Overall, the results of this study suggest that hormones may act as environmental cues promoting Candida protection from vaginal defenses and harmful conditions, what may have implications in Candida vaginal pathogenicity and treatment of VVC, especially in C. glabrata infections due to its high adaptability to vaginal conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Bruna Gonçalves"},{"name":"Nuno Miguel Azevedo"},{"name":"Mariana Henriques"},{"name":"Sónia Silva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Candida spp"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"progesterone"},{"word":"vulvovaginal candidiasis"},{"word":"β-estradiol"}]},"article48":{"pmid":"31253827","title":"Complex general stress response regulation in Sphingomonas melonis Fr1 revealed by transcriptional analyses.","abs":"The general stress response (GSR) represents an important trait to survive in the environment by leading to multiple stress resistance. In alphaproteobacteria, the GSR is under the transcriptional control of the alternative sigma factor EcfG. Here we performed transcriptome analyses to investigate the genes controlled by EcfG of Sphingomonas melonis Fr1 and the plasticity of this regulation under stress conditions. We found that EcfG regulates genes for proteins that are typically associated with stress responses. Moreover, EcfG controls regulatory proteins, which likely fine-tune the GSR. Among these, we identified a novel negative GSR feedback regulator, termed NepR2, on the basis of gene reporter assays, phenotypic analyses, and biochemical assays. Transcriptional profiling of signaling components upstream of EcfG under complex stress conditions showed an overall congruence with EcfG-regulated genes. Interestingly however, we found that the GSR is transcriptionally linked to the regulation of motility and biofilm formation via the single domain response regulator SdrG and GSR-activating histidine kinases. Altogether, our findings indicate that the GSR in S. melonis Fr1 underlies a complex regulation to optimize resource allocation and resilience in stressful and changing environments.","authors":[{"name":"Lisa Gottschlich"},{"name":"Petra Geiser"},{"name":"Miriam Bortfeld-Miller"},{"name":"Christopher M Field"},{"name":"Julia A Vorholt"}],"keywords":[]},"article49":{"pmid":"31253683","title":"Facultative Anaerobes Shape Multispecies Biofilms Composed of Meat Processing Surface Bacteria and Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium.","abs":"This study investigated the microbial dynamics in multispecies biofilms of Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain 1934 (O157) or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (ST) and 40 strains of meat processing surface bacteria (MPB).

Prior research has shown that environmental biofilms immobilize oocysts from the water column, but the biophysical mechanisms driving this attraction are still under investigation. This study investigates the affinity of C. parvum oocysts to silanized surfaces. Surfaces were prepared with hydroxyl, amine, and carboxyl moieties. Binding forces between the oocysts and these engineered substrates were analyzed, with and without divalent ions, using atomic force microscopy. Binding forces were measured over several weeks to investigate the influence of age on adhesion. C. parvum oocysts bind most strongly to carboxylic acid functional groups, with rupture forces greater than that required to break noncovalent molecular bonds, regardless of oocyst age. This adhesion is shown to be due to divalent cation bridging mechanisms. In addition, the binding strength increases over a 5-week period as the oocysts age, followed by a decrease in the binding strength, which may be related to structural or biochemical changes in the outer wall-bound glycosylated proteins. This study sheds new light on the biochemical parameters that influence C. parvum oocyst binding to surfaces. Increased understanding of how age and water chemistry influence the binding strength of oocysts may inform future developments in environmental detection and drinking water treatment, such as with the development of oocyst-specific sensors that allow for more frequent tracking of oocysts in the environment.","authors":[{"name":"Tooba Sarkhosh"},{"name":"X Frank Zhang"},{"name":"Kristen L Jellison"},{"name":"Sabrina S Jedlicka"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cryptosporidium"},{"word":"atomic force microscopy"},{"word":"biophysical binding"}]},"article51":{"pmid":"31253082","title":"Decoding the proteomic changes involved in the biofilm formation of Enterococcus faecalis SK460 to elucidate potential biofilm determinants.","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis is a major clinically relevant nosocomial bacterial pathogen frequently isolated from polymicrobial infections.

As the dispersal enhancement by QQ counteracted the ecological drift, it eliminated the distance-decay relationship, reflecting a neutral theory archetype of metacommunity. Network analyses showed that QQ substantially reduced the amount and magnitude of interactions, e.g., competition and cooperation, for bacteria and fungi, and weakened their network structures, irrespective of time. Additionally, QQ suppressed the growth of specific microbial species (e.g., Acinetobacter), abundant and widespread at the early stage. These findings suggest that QQ influenced the community dynamics at the regional and local levels, correspondingly the ecological selection and dispersal processes, during the biofilm development.","authors":[{"name":"So-Yeon Jeong"},{"name":"Chung-Hak Lee"},{"name":"Taewoo Yi"},{"name":"Tae Gwan Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Membrane bioreactor"},{"word":"Metacommunity"},{"word":"Quorum quenching"}]},"article70":{"pmid":"31249695","title":"Why viruses sometimes disperse in groups?","abs":"Many organisms disperse in groups, yet this process is understudied in viruses. Recent work, however, has uncovered different types of collective infectious units, all of which lead to the joint delivery of multiple viral genome copies to target cells, favoring co-infections. Collective spread of viruses can occur through widely different mechanisms, including virion aggregation driven by specific extracellular components, cloaking inside lipid vesicles, encasement in protein matrices, or binding to cell surfaces. Cell-to-cell viral spread, which allows the transmission of individual virions in a confined environment, is yet another mode of clustered virus dissemination. Nevertheless, the selective advantages of dispersing in groups remain poorly understood in most cases. Collective dispersal might have emerged as a means of sharing efficacious viral transmission vehicles. Alternatively, increasing the cellular multiplicity of infection may confer certain short-term benefits to viruses, such as overwhelming antiviral responses, avoiding early stochastic loss of viral components required for initiating infection, or complementing genetic defects present in different viral genomes. However, increasing infection multiplicity may also entail long-term costs, such as mutation accumulation and the evolution of defective particles or other types of cheater viruses. These costs and benefits, in turn, should depend on the genetic relatedness among collective infectious unit members. Establishing the genetic basis of collective viral dispersal and performing controlled experiments to pinpoint fitness effects at different spatial and temporal scales should help us clarify the implications of these spread modes for viral fitness, pathogenicity, and evolution.","authors":[{"name":"Rafael Sanjuán"},{"name":"María-Isabel Thoulouze"}],"keywords":[{"word":"collective infectious unit"},{"word":"dispersal"},{"word":"multiplicity of infection"},{"word":"viral spread"},{"word":"viral transmission"}]},"article71":{"pmid":"31248162","title":"The Antibiofilm Effect of a Medical Device Containing TIAB on Microorganisms Associated with Surgical Site Infection.","abs":"Surgical site infections (SSIs) represent the most common nosocomial infections, and surgical sutures are optimal surfaces for bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.

Herein, we made an attempt to identify the genes involved in biofilm formation in the strain K. pneumoniae ATCC13883. To achieve this, we constructed mini-Tn5 transposon insertion mutants and screened them for biofilm production. We observed that the biofilm formation was enhanced in the mutant where the wcaJ gene was disrupted. WcaJ is the initiating enzyme of colanic acid synthesis and loads the first sugar (glucose-1-P) on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate. The absence of this glycosyltransferase results in the absence of colanic acid, which renders a non-mucoid phenotype to the mutant. Further, to determine the effect of mucoidy on antibiotic susceptibility, we tested the sensitivity of the strains towards different groups of antibiotics. Unlike the mucoid strains, the resistance of the non-mucoid cells was greater for polymyxins, but less for quinolones. Capsular polysaccharides are known to have a protective effect against phagocytosis, therefore we assessed the role of colanic acid in virulence by conducting infection studies on murine macrophages. Surprisingly, the ΔwcaJ strain was less efficient in macrophage activation and was not readily phagocytosed. Thus, the presence of colanic acid appeared to increase the immunogenicity of K. pneumoniae. Overall, the results indicate that the presence of colanic acid increases the vulnerability of K. pneumoniae towards both polymyxins and macrophages, implying that the mucoid strains are less threatening as compared to their high biofilm forming non-mucoid counterparts.","authors":[{"name":"Shilpa Pal"},{"name":"Jyoti Verma"},{"name":"Sathi Mallick"},{"name":"Sumit Kumar Rastogi"},{"name":"Akash Kumar"},{"name":"Anindya S Ghosh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"colanic acid"},{"word":"colistin"},{"word":"glycosyltransferase"},{"word":"macrophage"},{"word":"wcaJ"}]},"article79":{"pmid":"31245043","title":"New insights link low-virulent disc infections to the etiology of severe disc degeneration and Modic changes.","abs":"Within the last 5 years, international research collaborations including those of several research groups skilled in microbiology, immunology and pathophysiology, have identified a low-virulent intradiscal infection with the ability to provoke gradual and progressive disc degeneration, end-plate disruption, Modic changes and persistent clinical lower-back pain.

An average of 2,546 prokaryotic gDNA operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 585 cDNA OTUs were identified across the perennial cave ice block and analyzed in relation to the geochemical composition of ice layers. The total microbial community and the putative active fraction displayed dissimilar taxa profiles. The ice-contained microbiome was dominated by Actinobacteria with a variable representation of Proteobacteria, while the putative active microbial community was equally shared between Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Accordingly, a major presence of Cryobacterium, Lysinomonas, Pedobacter, and Aeromicrobium phylotypes homologous to psychrotrophic and psychrophilic bacteria from various cold environments were noted in the total community, while the prevalent putative active bacteria belonged to Clostridium, Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, and Massilia genera. Variation in the microbial cell density of ice strata with the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and the strong correlation of DOC and silicon concentrations revealed a major impact of depositional processes on microbial abundance throughout the ice block. Post-depositional processes appeared to occur mostly during the 4,000-7,000 years BP interval. A major bacterial composition shift was observed in 4,500-5,000-year-old ice, leading to a high representation of Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria in the potentially active community in response to the increased concentrations of DOC and major chemical elements.

Additionally, we found that while deletion of lipoproteins had a minimal impact on biofilm accumulation, these lipoprotein mutations increased biofilm porosity, suggesting that lipoproteins and their associated interactions contribute to biofilm structure. For one of the lipoproteins, SaeP, we showed that the biofilm phenotype requires the lipoprotein to be anchored to the outside of the cellular membrane, and we further showed that increased SaeP expression correlates with more retention of high-molecular-weight DNA on the bacterial cell surface. SaeP is a known auxiliary protein of the SaeRS system, and we also demonstrated that the levels of SaeP correlate with nuclease production, which can further impact biofilm development. It has been reported that S. aureus biofilms are stabilized by positively charged cytoplasmic proteins that are released into the extracellular environment, where they make favorable electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged cell surface and eDNA.

Here we use single-cell-resolution confocal microscopy to explore biofilms of the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae in conditions mimicking its marine habitat. Prior reports have noted the occurrence of cellular filamentation in V. cholerae, with variable propensity to filament among both toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains. Using a filamenting strain of V. cholerae O139, we show that cells with this morphotype gain a profound competitive advantage in colonizing and spreading on particles of chitin, the material many marine Vibrio species depend on for growth in seawater. Furthermore, filamentous cells can produce biofilms that are independent of primary secreted components of the V. cholerae biofilm matrix; instead, filamentous biofilm architectural strength appears to derive at least in part from the entangled mesh of cells themselves. The advantage gained by filamentous cells in early chitin colonization and growth is countered in long-term competition experiments with matrix-secreting V. cholerae variants, whose densely packed biofilm structures displace competitors from surfaces. Overall, our results reveal an alternative mode of biofilm architecture that is dependent on filamentous cell morphology and advantageous in environments with rapid chitin particle turnover.

Among these 21 strains, three were lytA-negative and, therefore, not S. pneumoniae. The remaining 18 strains were positive for lytA, ply, pspK, and bile solubility and were confirmed as NESp. Therefore, the isolation rate of NESp in the S. pneumoniae strains in this study was 12.0% (18/149). Molecular-typing analyses classified five strains as two existing sequence types (STs; ST7502 and ST7786), and 13 strains formed four novel STs. Horizontal spread was suspected, because strains with the same ST were often isolated from the same nursery school. The NESp isolates were generally susceptible to most antimicrobials, with the exception of macrolides; however, all isolates possessed more than one abnormal penicillin-binding protein gene. Furthermore, NESp strains were more effective than encapsulated counterparts at forming biofilms, which showed obvious differences in morphology. These data indicated that NESp strains should be continuously monitored as emerging respiratory pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Noriko Takeuchi"},{"name":"Misako Ohkusu"},{"name":"Noriyuki Wada"},{"name":"Satoko Kurosawa"},{"name":"Akiko Miyabe"},{"name":"Masashi Yamaguchi"},{"name":"Moon H Nahm"},{"name":"Naruhiko Ishiwada"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Drug resistant gene"},{"word":"Multi-locus sequence typing"},{"word":"Nonencapsulated"},{"word":"Pneumococcal surface protein K"},{"word":"Streptococcus pneumoniae"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"31235209","title":"Interactions between oral commensal Candida and oral bacterial communities in immunocompromised and healthy children.","abs":"Candida species are usually found as commensal microorganisms in the oral cavity of healthy people. During chemotherapy, cytostatic drugs lead to depletion of the oral flora with the emergence of a dominant bacterial species. The transition from commensal to pathogenic state, further associated with yeast colonization and oral mucositis implies a replacement of the dominant microorganism by Candida albicans. This process goes plausibly through cooperation between C. albicans and bacteria. This study focused on the first step of cooperation between microorganisms isolated from the same oral flora either of leukemic or healthy children. C. albicans isolated from 8/20 children were cultured to display their noninvasive blastosporic yeast form and mixed with their dominant bacteria to study the capacity of planktonic aggregation and the early state of biofilm formation. None of the dominant bacteria opposed the presence of yeast, on the contrary, an interesting cooperation was observed. This behavior is apparently different from that observed when mixing the type strains. In fact, three mutated C. albicans strains display, by their spontaneous ability to form filament, enhanced risks of virulence for leukemic ill carriers. Despite such risks, neither oral nor systemic pathology were observed in ill patients probably because the study was conducted during the first course of chemotherapy and Candida colonization is related to the number of chemotherapeutic cycles. The presence of C. albicans during the initial cycle represents, by its ability to interact with oral bacteria, an actual threat for further cures.","authors":[{"name":"L Bunetel"},{"name":"Z Tamanai-Shacoori"},{"name":"B Martin"},{"name":"B Autier"},{"name":"A Guiller"},{"name":"M Bonnaure-Mallet"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ALS genes"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Coaggregation"},{"word":"Oral bacteria"}]},"article118":{"pmid":"31234908","title":"Biofilm and hemagglutinin formation: a Hallmark for drug resistant uropathogenic Escherichia coli.","abs":"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent disease encounters in pregnant mothers, and the most drug resistant, biofilm and hemagglutinin producer Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the major etiologic agent.

Earlier we demonstrated the ability of a potato polysaccharide galactan to inhibit biofilm formation by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate. Here we investigate the effect of potato galactan on P. aeruginosa biofilms in more detail. Microscopic analysis indicated that the galactan did not interfere with the adhesion of bacterial cells to the substrate but prevented the build-up of bacterial biomass. Moreover, the galactan not only inhibited biofilm formation, but partially destroyed pre-formed biofilms. Presumably, this activity of the galactan was due to the excessive aggregation of bacterial cells, which prohibited the formation and maintenance of proper biofilm architecture, or due to some other mechanisms of biofilm structure remodeling. This led to an unexpected effect, i.e., P. aeruginosa biofilms treated with an antibiotic and the galactan retained more viable bacterial cells compared to biofilms treated with the antibiotic alone. Galactan is the first polysaccharide demonstrated to exert such effect on bacterial biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"A V Grishin"},{"name":"A S Karyagina"}],"keywords":[]},"article120":{"pmid":"31234568","title":"Evaluation of Predation Capability of Periodontopathogens Bacteria by Bdellovibrio Bacteriovorus HD100.

Predatory bacteria that selectively predate solely on Gram-negative bacteria might be a viable therapeutic alternative. Therefore, the aim of this study is to in vitro evaluate the susceptibility of some oral pathogens to predation by B. bacteriovorus HD100 in liquid suspension. Cultures of prey cell were prepared in brain heart infusion broth (BHI) broth incubating overnight at the appropriate conditions for each organism to reach log phase of growth. Predatory activity was assessed by measuring optical density at 600 nm after 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The study demonstrated that B. bacteriovorus is able to predate on aerobic species and on microaerophilic ones (p < 0.05) but also that its predatory capacity is strongly compromised by the conditions of anaerobiosis. B. bacteriovorus, in fact, was unable to predate the anaerobic species involved in the present study (F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis). The findings of the study suggest that B. bacteriovorus is able to tolerate microaerophilic conditions and that in anaerobiosis it cannot exert its predatory capacity. Such evidence could lead to its use as an agent to prevent recolonization of the periodontal pocket following therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate the activity of B. bacteriovorus against recently recognized periodontopathogens, alone or organized in biofilms of multi-species communities.","authors":[{"name":"Romeo Patini"},{"name":"Paola Cattani"},{"name":"Simona Marchetti"},{"name":"Gaetano Isola"},{"name":"Gianluca Quaranta"},{"name":"Patrizia Gallenzi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Local antimicrobial therapy"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"periodontal medicine"},{"word":"periodontitis"},{"word":"plaque control"}]},"article121":{"pmid":"31234513","title":"Special Issue: Microbial Biofilms in Healthcare: Formation, Prevention and Treatment.","abs":"Biofilms are a structured community of microorganisms that are attached to a surface.

The use of non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasmas is a good alternative as plasmas contain reactive species, free radicals, and UV photons well-known for their decontamination potential against free microorganisms.

We report a reduction in the amount of the biofilm matrix, the loss of its tridimensional structure, and morphological changes in sessile cells at long exposure times. We show chemical and structural changes on the biofilm matrix (mostly on carbohydrates and eDNA) and cells (mostly on proteins and lipids) that are more profound with longer plasma exposure times.

Surfaceomes (all cell surface-associated proteins) of GG cells grown with glucose and fructose in planktonic and biofilm cultures were identified and compared, which indicated carbohydrate source-dependent variations, especially during biofilm growth. The most distinctive differences under these conditions were detected with several surface adhesins (e.g., MBF, SpaC pilus protein and penicillin-binding proteins), enzymes (glycoside hydrolases, PrsA, PrtP, PrtR, and HtrA) and moonlighting proteins (glycolytic, transcription/translation and stress-associated proteins, r-proteins, tRNA synthetases, Clp family proteins, PepC, PepN, and PepA). The abundance of several known adhesins and candidate moonlighters, including enzymes acting on casein-derived peptides (ClpP, PepC, and PepN), increased in the biofilm cells grown on fructose, from which the surface-associated aminopeptidase activity mediated by PepC and PepN was further confirmed by an enzymatic assay. The mucus binding factor (MBF) was found most abundant in fructose grown biofilm cells whereas SpaC adhesin was identified specifically from planktonic cells growing on fructose. An additional indirect ELISA indicated both growth mode- and carbohydrate-dependent differences in abundance of SpaC, whereas the overall adherence of GG assessed with porcine mucus indicated that the carbon source and the growth mode affected mucus adhesion. The adherence of GG cells to mucus was almost completely inhibited by anti-SpaC antibodies regardless of growth mode and/or carbohydrate source, indicating the key role of the SpaCBA pilus in adherence under the tested conditions. Altogether, our results suggest that carbon source and growth mode coordinate mechanisms shaping the proteinaceous composition of GG cell surface, which potentially contributes to resistance, nutrient acquisition and cell-cell interactions under different conditions.

The potentially active QSI compound identified in the SJ16 extract was 3-Benzyl-hexahydro-pyrrolo[1, 2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione. The SJ16 extract containing this active compound showed significant anti-quorum sensing activity against a model quorum sensing bacterium strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and a clinical isolate P. aeruginosa PAH by preventing biofilm formation without attenuating the cell growth within the biofilm. More specifically, the SJ16 extract changed the topography and architecture of the biofilm, thus preventing bacterial adherence and further development of the biofilm. Furthermore, it decreased virulence factors (rhamnolipid and pyocyanin), the bacterial motility, as well as the elastase, and protease activities in P. aeruginosa. Microarray analysis revealed the differential expression of quorum sensing regulatory genes.

Here, we investigated whether bacteria can affect diatom community composition and vice versa, and how this could influence the biodiversity-productivity relation. Using axenic experimental communities with three common benthic diatoms (Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula phyllepta, and Seminavis robusta), we observed an increase in algal biomass production in diatom co-cultures in comparison to monocultures. The presence of bacteria decreased the productivity of diatom monocultures while bacteria did not seem to affect the overall productivity of diatoms grown in co-cultures.

The effect of the diatoms on the bacteria also proved to be species-specific as each diatom species developed a bacterial community that differed in its composition.

This study reports the shotgun metagenomic sequencing of biofilms fouling plastic and bioplastic microcosms staged at the sediment-water interface of a coastal lagoon. Community composition analysis revealed that plastic biofilms were indistinguishable in comparison to a ceramic biofilm control. By contrast, bioplastic biofilms were distinct and dominated by sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM). Analysis of bioplastic gene pools revealed the enrichment of esterases, depolymerases, adenylyl sulfate reductases (aprBA), and dissimilatory sulfite reductases (dsrAB). The nearly 20-fold enrichment of a phylogenetically diverse polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) depolymerase suggests this gene was distributed across a mixed microbial assemblage. The metagenomic reconstruction of genomes identified novel species of Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacteraceae, and Desulfobulbaceae among the abundant SRM, and these genomes contained genes integral to both bioplastic degradation and sulfate reduction. Findings indicate that bioplastic promoted a rapid and significant shift in benthic microbial diversity and gene pools, selecting for microbes that participate in bioplastic degradation and sulfate reduction. If plastic pollution is traded for bioplastic pollution and sedimentary inputs are large, the microbial response could unintentionally affect benthic biogeochemical activities through the stimulation of sulfate reducers.","authors":[{"name":"Lee J Pinnell"},{"name":"Jeffrey W Turner"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biodegradation"},{"word":"bioplastic"},{"word":"coastal sediments"},{"word":"metagenomics"},{"word":"plastic"},{"word":"sulfur cycling"}]},"article139":{"pmid":"31231338","title":"Synergy Between Two Chimeric Lysins to Kill Streptococcus pneumoniae.","abs":"Phage lysins constitute a new generation of antimicrobials that are becoming a promising alternative and complementation to current antibiotic therapies, which are nowadays called into question by the increasing numbers of multiresistant bacteria.

C. albicans readily forms biofilms in conjunction with other oral microbiota including both bacteria and yeast. Adhesion between species is important to the establishment of these mixed biofilms, but interactions between C. albicans and many NACS are not well-characterized. We adapted a real-time flow biofilm model to study adhesion interactions and biofilm establishment in C. albicans and NACS in mono- and co-culture. Out of five NACS studied, only the filamenting species C. tropicalis and C. dubliniensis were capable of adhesion with C. albicans, while C. parapsilosis, C. lusitaniae, and C. krusei were not. Over the early phase (0-4 h) of biofilm development, both mono- and co-culture followed similar kinetics of attachment and detachment events, indicating that initial biofilm formation is not influenced by inter-species interactions. However, the NACS showed a preference for inter-species cell-cell interactions with C. albicans, and at later time points (5-11 h) we found that dual-species interactions impacted biofilm surface coverage. Dual-species biofilms of C. tropicalis and C. albicans grew more slowly than C. albicans alone, but achieved higher surface coverage than C. tropicalis alone. Biofilms of C. dubliniensis with C. albicans increased surface coverage more rapidly than either species alone. We conclude that dual culture biofilm of C. albicans with C. tropicalis or C. dubliniensis offers a growth advantage for both NACS.

Low MW components of EPS were preferentially degraded prior to the disruption of high MW components.

However, little is known about microbial chromate (Cr(VI)) reduction coupling with AOM. In this study, a microbial consortium was enriched via switching nitrate dosing to chromate feeding as the sole electron acceptor under anaerobic condition in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR), in which methane was continuously provided as the electron donor through bubble-less hollow fiber membranes. According to long-term reactor operation and chromium speciation analysis, soluble chromate could be reduced into Cr(III) compounds by using methane as electron donor. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon profiling further indicated that after feeding chromate Candidatus 'Methanoperedens' (a known nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation archaeon) became sole anaerobic methanotroph in the biofilm, potentially responsible for the chromate bio-reduction driven by methane. Two potential pathways of the microbial AOM-coupled chromate reduction were proposed: (i) Candidatus 'Methanoperedens' independently utilizes chromate as electron acceptor to form Cr(III) compounds, or (ii) Candidatus 'Methanoperedens' oxidizes methane to generate intermediates or electrons, which will be utilized to reduce chromate to Cr(III) compounds by unknown chromate reducers synergistically.

Each starvation period resulted in a 4.2 ± 1.4% reduction in electrical current in the acetate-fed MFCs and a 10.8 ± 3.9% reduction in the glucose-fed MFCs.

The acetate-fed bioanodes were dominated by Desulfuromonas spp. converting acetate into electrical current. The glucose-fed bioanodes were dominated by Trichococcus sp., functioning as a fermenter, and a member of Desulfuromonadales, using the fermentation products to generate electrical current. Suspended biomass and biofilm growing on non-conductive regions within the MFCs had different community composition than the bioanodes. However, null models showed that homogenizing dispersal of microorganisms within the MFCs affected the community composition, and in the glucose-fed MFCs, the Trichococcus sp. was abundant in all locations. The different responses to starvation can be explained by the more complex pathway requiring microbial interactions to convert glucose into electrical current.","authors":[{"name":"Soroush Saheb-Alam"},{"name":"Frank Persson"},{"name":"Britt-Marie Wilén"},{"name":"Malte Hermansson"},{"name":"Oskar Modin"}],"keywords":[]},"article162":{"pmid":"31227552","title":"Bacterial Nucleobases Synergistically Induce Larval Settlement and Metamorphosis in the Invasive Mussel Mytilopsis sallei.","abs":"Marine bacterial biofilms have long been recognized as potential inducers of larval settlement and metamorphosis in marine invertebrates, but few chemical cues from bacteria have been identified. Here, we show that larval settlement and metamorphosis of an invasive fouling mussel, Mytilopsis sallei, could be induced by biofilms of bacteria isolated from its adult shells and other substrates from the natural environment. One of the strains isolated, Vibrio owensii MS-9, showed strong inducing activity which was attributed to the release of a mixture of nucleobases including uracil, thymine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, and guanine into seawater. In particular, the synergistic effect of hypoxanthine and guanine was sufficient for the inducing activity of V. owensii MS-9. The presence of two or three other nucleobases could enhance, to some extent, the activity of the mixture of hypoxanthine and guanine. Furthermore, we determined that bacteria producing higher concentrations of nucleobases were more likely to induce larval settlement and metamorphosis of M. sallei than were bacteria producing lower concentrations of nucleobases. The present study demonstrates that bacterial nucleobases play an important role in larval settlement and metamorphosis of marine invertebrates. This provides new insights into our understanding of the role of environmental bacteria in the colonization and aggregation of invasive fouling organisms and of the metabolites used as chemical mediators in cross-kingdom communication within aquatic systems.","authors":[{"name":"Jian He"},{"name":"Qi Dai"},{"name":"Yuxuan Qi"},{"name":"Pei Su"},{"name":"Miaoqin Huang"},{"name":"Caihuan Ke"},{"name":"Danqing Feng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mytilopsis sallei"},{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"invasive fouling mussels"},{"word":"larval settlement"},{"word":"nucleobases"}]},"article163":{"pmid":"31227461","title":"Is surface modification effective to prevent periprosthetic joint infection?

Research in this field has focused on three main areas: (a) the establishment of plastic-specific biofilms (the so-called plastisphere); (b) enrichment of pathogenic bacteria, particularly members of the genus Vibrio, coupled to a vector function of microplastics; and (c) the microbial degradation of microplastics in the marine environment. Nevertheless, the relationships between marine microorganisms and microplastics remain unclear. In this review, we deduce from the current literature, new comparative analyses, and considerations of microbial adaptation concerning plastic degradation that interactions between microorganisms and microplastic particles should have rather limited effects on the ocean ecosystems. The majority of microorganisms growing on microplastics seem to belong to opportunistic colonists that do not distinguish between natural and artificial surfaces. Thus, microplastics do not pose a higher risk than natural particles to higher life forms by potentially harboring pathogenic bacteria. On the other hand, microplastics in the ocean represent recalcitrant substances for microorganisms that are insufficient to support prokaryotic metabolism and will probably not be microbially degraded in any period of time relevant to human society. Because we cannot remove microplastics from the ocean, proactive action regarding research on plastic alternatives and strategies to prevent plastic entering the environment should be taken promptly.","authors":[{"name":"Sonja Oberbeckmann"},{"name":"Matthias Labrenz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biodegradation"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"evolution"},{"word":"microplastics"},{"word":"ocean"},{"word":"plastisphere"}]},"article169":{"pmid":"31226024","title":"Small Is Mighty-Chemical Communication Systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of acute and chronic infections.

The goal of this study was to examine whether nitrite affects S. mutans virulence during polymicrobial infections with the commensal Streptococcus parasanguinis. Here, we report that the combination of S. parasanguinis and nitrite inhibited S. mutans growth and biofilm formation in vitro. Glucan production, which is critical for S. mutans biofilm formation, was also inhibited in 2-species biofilms with S. parasanguinis containing nitrite as compared with biofilms that contained no nitrite. In the in vivo caries model, enamel and dentin carious lesions were significantly reduced in rats that were colonized with S. parasanguinis prior to infection with S. mutans and received nitrite in the drinking water, as compared with animals that had a single S. mutans infection or were co-colonized with both bacteria and received no nitrite.

The complexity of biological activities during an inflammatory response depends on genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. To characterize the epigenetic changes in response to periodontal pathogens we have focused on histone lysine methylation as a relatively stable chromatin modification involved in the epigenetic activation and repression of transcription and a prime candidate mechanism responsible for the exacerbated and prolonged response of periodontal cells and tissues to dental plaque biofilm. To determine the effect of inflammatory conditions on histone methylation profiles, related gene expression and cellular functions of human periodontal ligament (hPDL) progenitor cells, a hPDL cell culture system was subjected to bacterial cell wall toxin exposure [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis revealed that healthy PDL cells featured high enrichment levels for the active H3K4me3 mark at COL1A1, COL3, and RUNX2 gene promoters, whereas there were high occupancy levels for the repressive H3K27me3 marks at DEFA4, CCL5, and IL-1β gene promoters. In response to LPS, H3K27me3 enrichment increased on extracellular matrix and osteogenesis lineage gene promoters, whereas H3K4me3 enrichment increased on the promoters of inflammatory response genes, suggestive of an involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in periodontal lineage differentiation and in the coordination of the periodontal inflammatory response. On a gene expression level, LPS treatment downregulated COL1A1, COL3A1, and RUNX2 expression and upregulated CCL5, DEFA4, and IL-1β gene expression. LPS also greatly affected PDL progenitor function, including a reduction in proliferation and differentiation potential and an increase in cell migration capacity.

In particular, poultry colonized with Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), a dominant serotype responsible for human infections, do not exhibit overt signs and symptoms, thereby posing a potential health risk to humans. In this study, comparative genomics approaches were applied to two S.

ST1539 containing a chromosome (4,905,039 bp; 4,403 CDSs) and a plasmid (93,876 bp; 96 CDSs) was phylogenetically distinct from other S. Typhimurium strains such as ST1120 and LT2.

The main aim of this study was to determine the anti-biofilm properties of certain compounds and bacteriophages on F. psychrophilum biofilms under static conditions using a standard 96-well microtiter plate biofilm assay in vitro. Eight compounds (A-type proanthocyanidins, D-leucine, EDTA, emodin, fucoidan, L-alliin, parthenolide, and 2-aminoimidazole) at three sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs), four bacteriophages (Fpv-3, Fpv-9, Fpv-10, and Fpv-21), and a phage combination (Fpv-9 + Fpv-10) were tested for inhibition of biofilm formation and reduction of the biomass of mature biofilms formed by two smooth isolates (P7-9/10 and P1-10B/10) and two rough isolates (P7-9/2R/10 and P1-10B/2R/10) of F. psychrophilum. The crystal violet staining method was used to stain the biofilms. Most of the compounds at sub-MICs inhibited the biofilm formation of mainly smooth isolates, attaining up to 80% inhibition. Additionally, the same reduction trend was also observed for 2-aminoimidazole, emodin, parthenolide, and D-leucine on the biomass of mature biofilms in a concentration-dependent manner. The anti-biofilm properties of the compounds are believed to lie in their ability to disturb the cellular interactions during biofilm formation and probably to cause cell dispersal in already formed biofilms. Lytic bacteriophages efficiently inhibited biofilm formation of F. psychrophilum, while they partially reduced the biomass of mature biofilms. However, the phage combination (Fpv-9 + Fpv-10) showed a successful reduction in the biomass of F. psychrophilum mature biofilms. We conclude that inhibiting compounds together with bacteriophages may supplement the use of disinfectants against bacterial biofilms (e.g., F. psychrophilum biofilms), leading to a reduced occurrence of bacterial coldwater disease outbreaks at fish farms.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Papadopoulou"},{"name":"Inger Dalsgaard"},{"name":"Tom Wiklund"}],"keywords":[]},"article208":{"pmid":"31216375","title":"Targeting Bacterial Biofilm: A New LecA Multivalent Ligand with Inhibitory Activity.","abs":"Biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens is a hallmark of chronic infections and is associated to increased antibiotic tolerance that makes pathogens difficult to eradicate with conventional antibiotic therapies.

The interface between fibrinogen and bacterial pathogens is an important determinant of the outcome of infection. Here, we demonstrate that a canine host-restricted skin pathogen, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, produces a cell wall-associated protein (SpsL) that has evolved the capacity for high strength binding to canine fibrinogen, with reduced binding to fibrinogen of other mammalian species including humans. Binding occurs via the surface-expressed N2N3 subdomains, of the SpsL A-domain, to multiple sites in the fibrinogen α-chain C-domain by a mechanism analogous to the classical dock, lock, and latch binding model. Host-specific binding is dependent on a tandem repeat region of the fibrinogen α-chain, a region highly divergent between mammals. Of note, we discovered that the tandem repeat region is also polymorphic in different canine breeds suggesting a potential influence on canine host susceptibility to S. pseudintermedius infection. Importantly, the strong host-specific fibrinogen-binding interaction of SpsL to canine fibrinogen is essential for bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation, and promotes resistance to neutrophil phagocytosis, suggesting a key role for the interaction during pathogenesis. Taken together, we have dissected a bacterial surface protein-ligand interaction resulting from the co-evolution of host and pathogen that promotes host-specific innate immune evasion and may contribute to its host-restricted ecology.","authors":[{"name":"Amy C Pickering"},{"name":"Pauline Vitry"},{"name":"Valeriia Prystopiuk"},{"name":"Brandon Garcia"},{"name":"Magnus Höök"},{"name":"Jeffrey Schoenebeck"},{"name":"Joan A Geoghegan"},{"name":"Yves F Dufrêne"},{"name":"J Ross Fitzgerald"}],"keywords":[]},"article210":{"pmid":"31216300","title":"Fretibacterium sp. human oral taxon 360 is a novel biomarker for periodontitis screening in the Japanese population.","abs":"Periodontitis is a common inflammatory disease, leading to bone destruction and tooth loss.

There is a significant amount of literature that indicates that this opportunistic commensal fungus has components that can be considered virulence factors related to the stage of the infectious process. Among the virulence factors of this fungus can be mentioned the adherence to cell surfaces, the formation of biofilms and the production of hydrolytic enzymes. The most studied hydrolases secreted by C. albicans are aspartyl proteinases, phospholipases and esterases, while lipases have been the least studied. These enzymes would have the function to facilitate active penetration into the cells, participating in the digestion and synthesis of lipid esters for their nutrition and contributing to the invasion of the tissue by hydrolyzing the lipid components of the host cell membranes.

Additionally, we examined the gastrointestinal resistance of the strains after skim milk fermentation and successive storage of the product for 20 and 40 days at refrigeration temperature, to see whether prolonged storage could weaken cell resistance to GIT.

SDS and RHL effectively inhibited formation of five bacterial biofilms in a dose-dependent manner, even at concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), suggesting that their antibiofilm activities are unrelated to their antibacterial activities. In contrast, NAC at certain concentrations promoted biofilm formation by all bacteria except P. aeruginosa, whereas at supra-MIC concentrations, it inhibited biofilm formation against the four bacteria, suggesting that its antibiofilm activity depends on its antibacterial activity. NAC was ineffective at eradicating mature H. pylori biofilms, and it actually promoted their formation at concentrations >10 mg/mL. Our results suggest that RHL is superior at eradicating biofilms of H. pylori, E. coli, and S. mutans; SDS is more effective against S. aureus biofilms; and NAC is more effective against P. aeruginosa biofilms.

These chemical substances can have additional roles, i.e. defence against various pathogens. We evaluated the efficacy of the defensive secretion of Apfelbeckia insculpta (L.

The tested secretion consisted of two compounds, p-cresol and phenol, and showed antibacterial, antibiofilm, and antifungal potential against all selected microorganisms. The most sensitive bacterium in our study was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the tested defensive secretion manifested the lowest activity against Escherichia coli. The defensive secretion of A. insculpta also showed an ability, albeit mild, to suppress biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa. Among the tested yeasts, Candida albicans and C. krusei were the most susceptible and most resistant species, respectively. Finally, the concentration of extracts obtained from the tested defensive secretion needed to achieve an antifungal effect was lowest in the case of Cladosporium cladosporioides. Fusarium verticillioides and Penicillium rubens were the micromycetes most resistant to the tested secretion. Our results indicate that antibacterial activity of the defensive secretion of A. insculpta is similar to or slightly weaker than that of streptomycin, while comparison with antimycotics showed that the tested millipede secretion has stronger activity than fluconazole, but weaker activity than nystatin and ketoconazole.

The genes required for holdfast biosynthesis have been analyzed in detail, but difficulties in isolating analytical quantities of the adhesin have limited efforts to characterize its chemical structure. In this report, we describe a method to extract the holdfast from C. crescentus cultures and present a survey of its carbohydrate content.

Our results provide evidence that the holdfast contains a 1,4-linked backbone of glucose, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and xylose that is decorated with branches at the C-6 positions of glucose and mannose.

The transition between these lifestyles can be regulated by a second messenger, cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). High intracellular c-di-GMP concentration correlates with biofilm formation and motility inhibition in most bacteria, including Bordetella bronchiseptica, which causes respiratory tract infections in mammals and forms biofilms in infected mice. We previously described the diguanylate cyclase BdcA as involved in c-di-GMP synthesis and motility regulation in B. bronchiseptica; here, we further describe the mechanism whereby BdcA is able to regulate motility and biofilm formation. Amino acid replacement of GGDEF with GGAAF in BdcA is consistent with the conclusion that diguanylate cyclase activity is necessary for biofilm formation and motility regulation, although we were unable to confirm the stability of the mutant protein. In the absence of the bdcA gene, B. bronchiseptica showed enhanced motility, strengthening the hypothesis that BdcA regulates motility in B. bronchiseptica We showed that c-di-GMP-mediated motility inhibition involved regulation of flagellin expression, as high c-di-GMP levels achieved by expressing BdcA significantly reduced the level of flagellin protein. We also demonstrated that protein BB2109 is necessary for BdcA activity, motility inhibition, and biofilm formation. Finally, absence of the bdcA gene affected bacterial infection, implicating BdcA-regulated functions as important for bacterium-host interactions.

Often, these infections are associated with the formation of drug-resistant biofilms on the surfaces of tissues or medical devices. Increased incidence of C. albicans resistance to current antifungals has heightened the need for new strategies to prevent or eliminate biofilm-related fungal infections. In prior studies, we designed 14-helical β-peptides to mimic the structural properties of natural antimicrobial α-peptides (AMPs) in an effort to develop active and selective antifungal compounds. These amphiphilic, cationic, helical β-peptides exhibited antifungal activity against planktonic C. albicans cells and inhibited biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo Recent studies have suggested the use of antivirulence agents in combination with antifungals. In this study, we investigated the use of compounds that target C. albicans polymorphism, such as 1-dodecanol, isoamyl alcohol, and farnesol, to attempt to improve β-peptide efficacy for preventing C. albicans biofilms. Isoamyl alcohol, which prevents hyphal formation, reduced the minimum biofilm prevention concentrations (MBPCs) of β-peptides by up to 128-fold. Combinations of isoamyl alcohol and antifungal β-peptides resulted in less than 10% hemolysis at the antifungal MBPCs.

Although pathogenicity in these bacteria is complex, virulence levels are proportional to the levels of plant cell wall-degrading exoenzymes (PCWDEs) secreted. Two low enzyme-producing transposon Tn5 mutants were isolated, and compared to their parent KD100, the mutants were less virulent on celery petioles and carrot disks. The inactivated gene responsible for the reduced virulence phenotype in both mutants was identified as wcaG. The gene, wcaG (previously denoted fcl) encodes NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase, a homologue of GDP-fucose synthetase of Escherichia coli. In Escherichia coli, GDP-fucose synthetase is involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide, colanic acid (CA). The wcaG mutants of P. carotovorum formed an enhanced level of biofilm in comparison to their parent. In the hydrophobicity test the mutants showed more hydrophobicity than the parent in hexane and hexadecane as solvents.

The ability of P. aeruginosa to produce multiple virulence factors and in particular to form biofilms makes this bacterium resistant to all known antibiotics. As a consequence, standard antibiotic therapy are increasingly become ineffective to clear such infections associated with biofilms. In search for novel effective agents to combat P. aeruginosa biofilm infections, a series of the BmKn‒2 scorpion venom peptide and its truncated derivatives were synthesized and their antibiofilm activities assessed. Among the peptides tested, BmKn‒22 peptide, which was a modified peptide of the parental BmKn‒2 scorpion venom peptide, clearly demonstrated the most potential inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms without affecting the bacterial growth. This peptide was not only capable of inhibiting the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilms, but also disrupting the established biofilms of P. aeruginosa. Additionally, BmKn‒22 peptide was able to inhibit the production of key virulence factor pyocyanin of P. aeruginosa. Our results also showed that BmKn‒22 peptide significantly reduced lasI and rhlR expression, and suggested that BmKn‒22 peptide-mediated inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilms and virulence factors was achieved through the components of quorum-sensing systems. Combination of BmKn‒22 peptide with azithromycin resulted in a remarkable reduction P. aeruginosa biofilms. Since this peptide exhibited low toxicity to mammalian cells, all our results therefore indicate that the BmKn‒22 peptide is a promising antibiofilm agent against P. aeruginosa and warrant further development of this peptide as a novel therapeutic for treatment of P. aeruginosa‒associated biofilm infections.","authors":[{"name":"Kittitat Teerapo"},{"name":"Sittiruk Roytrakul"},{"name":"Anchalee Sistayanarain"},{"name":"Duangkamol Kunthalert"}],"keywords":[]},"article284":{"pmid":"31198578","title":"Increasing access to microfluidics for studying fungi and other branched biological structures.","abs":"Microfluidic systems are well-suited for studying mixed biological communities for improving industrial processes of fermentation, biofuel production, and pharmaceutical production.

Due to enormous plasticity and heterogeneity, intrinsically disordered proteins or regions in proteins can perform myriad of functions. The flexibility in disordered proteins allows them to undergo conformation transition to form homopolymers of proteins called amyloids. Amyloids are highly structured protein aggregates associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. However, amyloids have gained much appreciation in recent years due to their functional roles. A functional amyloid fiber called curli is assembled on the bacterial cell surface as a part of the extracellular matrix during biofilm formation. The extracellular matrix that encases cells in a biofilm protects the cells and provides resistance against many environmental stresses. Several of the Csg (curli specific genes) proteins that are required for curli amyloid assembly are predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Therefore, curli amyloid formation is highly orchestrated so that these intrinsically disordered proteins do not inappropriately aggregate at the wrong time or place. The curli proteins are compartmentalized and there are chaperone-like proteins that prevent inappropriate aggregation and allow the controlled assembly of curli amyloids.

One P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing receptor, called RhlR, binds the cognate autoinducer N-butryl-homoserine lactone (C4HSL), and the RhlR:C4HSL complex activates transcription of target quorum-sensing genes. Here, we use a genetic screen to identify RhlR mutants that function independently of the autoinducer.

RhlR* can drive wildtype biofilm formation and infection in a nematode animal model.

Likewise, RhlR* requires PqsE for pyocyanin production in planktonic cultures, however, PqsE is dispensable for RhlR*-driven pyocyanin production on surfaces. Finally, wildtype RhlR protein is not sufficiently stabilized by C4HSL to allow purification. However, wildtype RhlR can be stabilized by the synthetic ligand mBTL (meta-bromo-thiolactone) and RhlR* is stable without a ligand.

Using culture-dependent and -independent techniques, we examined the changes in microbial water quality between communal tap water and household water storage in a rural area of Cameroon, Africa. The culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) were used to assess the potential health risks associated with different household water storage conditions (e.g., type of container and open vs. closed container) and interventions (e.g., water storage days, cleaned on the last day of use, and hygiene practices). Only the amount of days the water was stored significantly differed (p-value < 0.05), which showed that potential health risks increased when water was stored for more than 3 days. The higher abundance of molecular FIB in biofilm than household water suggested that omnipresent biofilm in household water could potential health risk. The high-throughput sequencing revealed that the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in both the water and the biofilm samples. Bacterial genera seen in biofilm bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Comamonas. Acinetobacter, Chryseobacterium, Stenotrophomonas and Corynebacterium, were relatively more abundant in the biofilm than in the water. Potential bacterial pathogens including Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Haemophilus influenza, were detected in household water and biofilm. The microbial quality might be affected by water-storage time and households repeatedly using the same water storage containers without proper sanitization, triggering microbial regrowth and biofilm formation on water containers. Higher bacterial diversity and potentially pathogenic bacteria found in the biofilm samples of a household water supply are unhealthy for the house's inhabitants. It is important to develop interventions aimed at preventing the formation of these dangerous biofilms in a communal water supply.","authors":[{"name":"Sungwoo Bae"},{"name":"Colleen Lyons"},{"name":"Nora Onstad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Developing country"},{"word":"Drinking water"},{"word":"Household water"},{"word":"Metagenomics"}]},"article307":{"pmid":"31194033","title":"Natural freeze-thaw cycles may increase the risk associated with Salmonella contamination in surface and groundwater environments.","abs":"Groundwater contamination by bacteria poses a serious threat to our drinking water supplies.

Moreover, the effects of FT on the transport characteristics of S. typhimurium in quartz sand were monitored in model porewater solutions of two different ionic strengths (IS: 10 and 100 mM KCl) and two different humic acid (HA) concentrations (1 and 5 mg/L). Increasing numbers of FT cycles were found to decrease the deposition of S. typhimurium onto quartz sand and increase the percentage of detached cells in sand-packed column experiments. Based on the calculated bacterial attachment efficiencies, the predicted minimum setback distances between the location of water supply wells and manure spreading activities are higher when the effects of FT are taken into consideration. While FT treatment significantly affected cell viability (in the presence of HA), most cells were in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state with compromised ability to form biofilm.

We determined whether the genome of each strain harbored prophages, and identified the insertion site of each of the prophages identified. We found that 71.7% of the strains carried at least one prophage, and that prophages genetically similar to livestock-associated phiD12, carrying genes potentially involved in GBS pathogenesis (e.g., genes encoding putative virulence factors and factors involved in biofilm formation, bacterial persistence, or adaptation to challenging environments) predominated.

Our data provide evidence for a recent increase in lysogeny in GBS, characterized by the acquisition, within the genome, of genetic features typical of animal-associated mobile genetic elements by GBS strains causing neonatal infection. We suggest that lysogeny and phiD12-like prophage genetic elements may have conferred an advantage on GBS strains for adaptation to or colonization of the maternal vaginal tract, or for pathogenicity, and that these factors are currently playing a key role in the increasing ability of GBS strains to infect neonates.","authors":[{"name":"Adélaïde Renard"},{"name":"Laurie Barbera"},{"name":"Luka Courtier-Martinez"},{"name":"Sandra Dos Santos"},{"name":"Anne-Sophie Valentin"},{"name":"Laurent Mereghetti"},{"name":"Roland Quentin"},{"name":"Nathalie L van der Mee-Marquet"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus agalactiae"},{"word":"adaptation"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"lysogeny"},{"word":"neonates"},{"word":"phiD12-like prophage"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article317":{"pmid":"31192112","title":"Clinical Experience with Tigecycline in the Treatment of Prosthetic Joint Infections.","abs":"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the use of tigecycline in the treatment of prosthetic joint infection (PJI).

Five proteins had ST131-specific amino acid substitutions: uncharacterized protein YahO with E34A (m/z 7655); UPF0337 protein YjbJ with V59D, D60S and T63K (m/z 8351); uncharacterized protein YnfD with S106T (m/z 8448); and acid stress chaperone HdeA with Q92K and N94S (m/z 9714). Soluble cytochrome b562 (m/z 11783) showed seven amino acid substitutions, and the sequence differed between clade C of the pandemic clade and non-C. In silico analysis showed YahO protein-protein interaction with YjbJ, possibly related to biofilm formation. Although the function of soluble cytochrome b562 is electron transport of unknown function, its involvement in biofilm formation was predicted. HdeA was a gastric acid resistance-related protein. The function of YnfD was completely unclear. In conclusion, ST131-specific protein amino acid substitutions consisted mainly of a gastric acid resistance protein and proteins of unknown function (possibly involved in biofilm formation), which might be mechanisms for long-term colonization in the human intestinal tract.","authors":[{"name":"Akihiro Nakamura"},{"name":"Masaru Komatsu"},{"name":"Yuki Ohno"},{"name":"Nobuyoshi Noguchi"},{"name":"Akira Kondo"},{"name":"Naoya Hatano"}],"keywords":[]},"article327":{"pmid":"31189796","title":"Investigation of a novel sterilization method for biofilms formed on titanium surfaces.","abs":"The development of effective methods to disinfect biofilms on dental materials is medically important.

V. cholerae can switch between planktonic and biofilm lifestyles. Biofilm formation is determinant for transmission, virulence and antibiotic resistance. Due to the enhanced antibiotic resistance observed by bacterial pathogens, antimicrobial nanomaterials have been used to combat infections by stopping bacterial growth and preventing biofilm formation. In this study, the effect of the nanocomposites zeolite-embedded silver (Ag), copper (Cu), or zinc (Zn) nanoparticles (NPs) was evaluated in V. cholerae planktonic cells, and in two biofilm states: pellicle biofilm (PB), formed between air-liquid interphase, and surface-attached biofilm (SB), formed at solid-liquid interfaces. Each nanocomposite type had a distinctive antimicrobial effect altering each V. cholerae lifestyles differently. The ZEO-AgNPs nanocomposite inhibited PB formation at 4 μg/ml, and prevented SB formation and eliminated planktonic cells at 8 μg/ml. In contrast, the nanocomposites ZEO-CuNPs and ZEO-ZnNPs affect V. cholerae viability but did not completely avoid bacterial growth. At transcriptional level, depending on the nanoparticles and biofilm type, nanocomposites modified the relative expression of the vpsL, rbmA and bap1, genes involved in biofilm formation. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the outer membrane proteins OmpT, OmpU, OmpA and OmpW also differs among treatments in PB and SB.

Oral microbiome is comprised of inter-kingdom microorganisms, including yeasts such as Candida albicans, bacteria, archaea and viruses. These microorganisms can interact synergistically, mutualistically and antagonistically, wherein the sum of these interactions dictates the composition of the oral microbiome. For instance, polymicrobial interactions can improve the ability of C albicans to form biofilm, which subsequently increases the colonisation of oral mucosa by the yeast. Polymicrobial interactions of C albicans with other members of the oral microbiome have been reported to enhance the malignant phenotype of oral cancer cells, such as the attachment to extracellular matrix molecules (ECM) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Polymicrobial interactions may also exacerbate an inflammatory response in oral epithelial cells, which may play a role in carcinogenesis. This review focuses on the role of polymicrobial interactions between C albicans and other oral microorganisms, including its role in promoting oral carcinogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Mohd Hafiz Arzmi"},{"name":"Stuart Dashper"},{"name":"Michael McCullough"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"oral carcinogenesis"},{"word":"oral microbiome"},{"word":"polymicrobial interactions"}]},"article350":{"pmid":"31183761","title":"Nitrous oxide emission mitigation during low-carbon source wastewater treatment: effect of external carbon source supply strategy.","abs":"Nitrous oxide (N","authors":[{"name":"Hongxiang Chai"},{"name":"Siping Deng"},{"name":"Xiaoyuan Zhou"},{"name":"Chuanrong Su"},{"name":"Yu Xiang"},{"name":"Yan Yang"},{"name":"Zhiyu Shao"},{"name":"Li Gu"},{"name":"Xuan Xu"},{"name":"Fangying Ji"},{"name":"Qiang He"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Carbon source"},{"word":"Methanol"},{"word":"Nitrogen removal"},{"word":"Nitrous oxide"},{"word":"Sequencing batch biofilm reactor"},{"word":"Wastewater treatment"}]},"article351":{"pmid":"31182718","title":"The combined antimicrobial effect of arginine and fluoride toothpaste.","abs":"The aim of the study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of arginine (Arg) in NaF toothpaste. 24-h mono-/3-species biofilm cultures of S. mutans, S. sanguis and S. gordonii inoculated sHA discs were subjected to treatment with toothpaste supernatants prepared as - [1]:2% Arg -NaF (0.147% F), [2]:4% Arg-NaF (0.144% F), [3]:8% Arg - NaF (0.138% F), [4]:NaF (0.15%) and [5]:deionized water.

The mono-/3-species biofilm imaging depicted that the 2% Arg-NaF and 4% Arg-NaF had a biofilm disrupting effect. The 3-species biofilm bacterial composition indicated that the 2% Arg-NaF group maintained an ecological homeostasis by inhibiting S. mutans growth and enriching the growth of S. sanguis and S. gordonii. The 2% Arg-NaF group significantly downregulated the expression of virulent gtfB gene and upregulated the expression of sagP with relative dominance of arcA.

In these scenarios, biofilms are subjected to shear forces, but the mechanical integrity of these aggregates often prevents their disruption or dispersal. Their physical robustness is the result of the multiple bio-polymers secreted by constituent microbial cells which are also responsible for numerous biological functions. A better understanding of the role of these bio-polymers and their response to dynamic forces is therefore crucial for understanding the interplay between biofilm structure and function. In this manuscript, we review experimental techniques in rheology, which help quantify the viscoelasticity of biofilms, and modelling approaches from soft matter physics, that can assist our understanding of the rheological properties. We describe how these methods could be combined with synthetic biology approaches to control and investigate the effects of secreted polymers on the physical properties of biofilms. We argue that without an integrated approach of the three disciplines the links between genetics, composition and interaction of matrix biopolymers and the viscoelastic properties of biofilms will be much harder to uncover.","authors":[{"name":"Samuel G V Charlton"},{"name":"Michael A White"},{"name":"Saikat Jana"},{"name":"Lucy E Eland"},{"name":"Pahala Gedara Jayathilake"},{"name":"J Grant Burgess"},{"name":"Jinju Chen"},{"name":"Anil Wipat"},{"name":"Thomas P Curtis"}],"keywords":[]},"article353":{"pmid":"31182496","title":"Cytotoxic Curli Intermediates Form during Salmonella Biofilm Development.","abs":"Enterobacteriaceae produce amyloid proteins called curli that are the major proteinaceous component of biofilms. Amyloids are also produced by humans and are associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's. During the multistep process of amyloid formation, monomeric subunits form oligomers, protofibrils, and finally mature fibrils. Amyloid β oligomers are more cytotoxic to cells than the mature amyloid fibrils. Oligomeric intermediates of curli had not been previously detected. We determined that turbulence inhibited biofilm formation and that, intriguingly, curli aggregates purified from cultures grown under high-turbulence conditions were structurally smaller and contained less DNA than curli preparations from cultures grown with less turbulence. Using flow cytometry analysis, we demonstrated that CsgA was expressed in cultures exposed to higher turbulence but that these cultures had lower levels of cell death than less-turbulent cultures. Our data suggest that the DNA released during cell death drives the formation of larger fibrillar structures. Consistent with this idea, addition of exogenous genomic DNA increased the size of the curli intermediates and led to binding to thioflavin T at levels observed with mature aggregates. Similar to the intermediate oligomers of amyloid β, intermediate curli aggregates were more cytotoxic than the mature curli fibrils when incubated with bone marrow-derived macrophages. The discovery of cytotoxic curli intermediates will enable research into the roles of amyloid intermediates in the pathogenesis of Salmonella and other bacteria that cause enteric infections.","authors":[{"name":"Lauren K Nicastro"},{"name":"Sarah A Tursi"},{"name":"Long S Le"},{"name":"Amanda L Miller"},{"name":"Andrey Efimov"},{"name":"Bettina Buttaro"},{"name":"Vincent Tam"},{"name":"Çağla Tükel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"Salmonella"},{"word":"amyloid"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"curli"}]},"article354":{"pmid":"31182331","title":"Management of abdominal aortic prosthetic graft and endograft infections.

For patients unable to undergo major surgery, the outcome of conservative approach remains uncertain but usually provides for life-long suppressive therapy. However, in selected cases an attempt of stopping antibiotic treatment after 3-6 months can be done.

This resistance introduces a critical clinical challenge, particularly in cases associated with implants increasing the predisposition for bacterial infections. Preventing such infections requires the development of novel antimicrobials or compounds that enhance bactericidal effect of currently available antibiotics. We have synthesized and characterized twelve novel silver(I) cyanoximates designated as Ag(ACO), Ag(BCO), Ag(CCO), Ag(ECO), Ag(PiCO), Ag(PICO) (yellow and red polymorphs), Ag(BIHCO), Ag(BIMCO), Ag(BOCO), Ag(BTCO), Ag(MCO) and Ag(PiPCO). The compounds exhibit a remarkable resistance to high intensity visible light, UV radiation and heat and have poor solubility in water. All these compounds can be well incorporated into the light-curable acrylate polymeric composites that are currently used as dental fillers or adhesives of indwelling medical devices. A range of dry weight % from 0.5 to 5.0 of the compounds was tested in this study. To study the potential of these compounds in preventing planktonic and biofilm growth of bacteria, we selected two human pathogens (Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-positive environmental isolate Bacillus aryabhattai. Both planktonic and biofilm growth was abolished completely in the presence of 0.5% to 5% of the compounds. The most efficient inhibition was shown by Ag(PiCO), Ag(BIHCO) and Ag(BTCO). The inhibition of biofilm growth by Ag(PiCO)-yellow was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Application of Ag(BTCO) and Ag(PiCO)-red in combination with tobramycin, the antibiotic commonly used to treat P. aeruginosa infections, showed a significant synergistic effect. Finally, the inhibitory effect lasted for at least 120 h in P. aeruginosa and 36 h in S. aureus and B. aryabhattai.

In total, 42 bismuth-associated proteins were identified including its major virulent factors (e.g., gingipains, hemagglutinin HagA, and fimbriae). Bismuth perturbed its iron acquisition, disturbed the energy metabolism and virulence, and deactivated multiple key enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase and thioredoxins). Moreover, bismuth inhibited its biofilm formation and disrupted the 3-day matured biofilms. Notably, the internalized P. gingivalis in various human cells (e.g., human gingival epithelium progenitors, HGEPs) was oppressed by bismuth but not the commonly used antibiotic metronidazole. Importantly, bismuth drugs enabled the counteraction of immuno-inflammatory responses in different host cells perturbed by P. gingivalis.

Strain H5 increased its biopolymer brush thickness, adhesion and biofilm formation and kept its roughness, surface area and cell elasticity unchanged upon exposure to ampicillin.

In this review, we will summarize what is known about the interplay between both the bacterial and the viral components of the microbiome on cancer and HIV pathogenesis. Bacterial dysbiosis has been associated with carcinogenesis such as colorectal cancer (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer. The dysbiotic pathogenesis may be species-based or community-based and can have varying mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The human virome was also associated with certain cancers. Viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human papilloma virus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), all had associations with cancers. It was also reported that an altered bacteriophage community may lead to carcinogenesis by allowing opportunistic, oncogenic bacteria to proliferate in a gastrointestinal biofilm. This mechanism shows the importance of analyzing the bacteriome and the virome concurrently as their interactions can provide insight into new mechanisms in the pathogenesis of not only cancer, but other diseases as well. The enteric bacteriome was shown to be distinctly altered in immunocompromised HIV-infected individuals, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was shown to at least partially reverse the alterations that HIV causes in the bacteriome. Studies have shown that the progression to HIV is associated with changes in the plasma concentration of commensal viruses. HIV also acts synergistically with multiple other viruses, such as HPV, EBV, varicella zoster virus (VZV), and HHV-8. Although it has been shown that HIV infection leads to enteric virome expansion in humans, most of the research on HIV's effect on the virome was conducted in non-human primates, and there is a lack of research on the effect of HAART on the virome. Virome-wide analysis is necessary for identifying novel viral etiologies. There is currently a wealth of information on the bacteriome and its associations with cancer and HIV, but more research should be conducted on the virome's associations and reaction to HAART as well as the bacteriome-virome interactions that may play a major role in pathogenesis and recovery.","authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Stern"},{"name":"George Miller"},{"name":"Xin Li"},{"name":"Deepak Saxena"}],"keywords":[]},"article377":{"pmid":"31177008","title":"A surface spectroscopy study of a Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm in the presence of an immobilized air bubble.","abs":"A linear spectral mapping technique was applied to monitor the growth of biomolecular absorption bands at the bio-interface of a nascent Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm during and after interaction with a surface-adhered air bubble.

Quorum sensing (QS) is a promising target for next-generation anti-infective agents designed to address the evolving drug resistance in bacterial pathogens. Given that the LuxS/autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum-sensing system regulates microbial group behaviors, we hypothesized that this system influences the FQ susceptibility in Streptococcus suis. It was found that a luxS mutant (ΔluxS) of S. suis possesses an increased susceptibility to FQs compared to the wild type strain. When grown in the presence of sub-MIC of antibiotics, the ΔluxS strain showed a significant decrease in growth rate and biofilm formation. These results suggest that the FQ resistance in S. suis could involve a signaling mechanism associated with the LuxS/AI-2 quorum-sensing system. HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analyses showed a signiﬁcant increase in the intracellular accumulation of enrofloxacin in the ΔluxS strain compared to the wild type strain. This increase was less pronounced in the presence of exogenous AI-2. Moreover, the expression of satA and satB genes was decreased in the ΔluxS strain. Exogenous AI-2 reversed the down-regulated gene expression observed in the ΔluxS strain. Our study brought strong evidence that the LuxS/AI-2 system in S. suis is involved in FQ susceptibility by regulating the efflux pump SatAB.

In this work, the biodegradation of metaldehyde was monitored, and assessed, in an operational slow sand filter. Long-term data showed that metaldehyde degradation improved when inlet concentrations increased. A comparison of inactive and active sand batch reactors showed that metaldehyde removal happened mainly through biodegradation and that the removal rates were greater after the biofilm was acclimated through exposure to high metaldehyde concentrations. This suggested that metaldehyde removal was reliant on enrichment and that the process could be engineered to decrease treatment times (from days to hours). Through-flow experiments using fluidised bed reactors, showed the same behaviour following metaldehyde acclimation.

Hexane extracted the major lipids present in the microalgae during the stationary phase of growth, which correspond to storage lipids. Triacylglycerols (TGs) were the only storage lipids produced by Dunaliella and Chaetoceros. In contrast, T. lutea predominantly stored polyunsaturated long-chain alkenones, with sterols also detected as minor components of the hexane extract. The molecular structure of brassicasterol was determined in T. lutea and the presence of squalene in this sample was also unequivocally detected. Monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDGs) and pigments were concentrated in the AcOEt extracts. C. calcitrans and D. salina constituted an exception due to the high amount of TGs and glycerol produced, respectively, by these two strains.

Gene expression patterns in biofilms on SLIPS, on control surfaces, and expression patterns of planktonic cultures were also compared. For this purpose, the genome of S. oralis strain ATCC 9811 was sequenced using PacBio Sequel technology. Even though biofilm cells showed clear changes in gene expression compared to planktonic cells, no differences could be detected between bacteria on SLIPS and on control surfaces. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ability of liquid-infused titanium to repel S. oralis biofilms is mainly due to weakened bacterial adhesion to the underlying liquid interface.","authors":[{"name":"Katharina Doll"},{"name":"Ines Yang"},{"name":"Elena Fadeeva"},{"name":"Nadine Kommerein"},{"name":"Szymon P Szafrański"},{"name":"Gesa Bei der Wieden"},{"name":"Andreas Greuling"},{"name":"Andreas Winkel"},{"name":"Boris N Chichkov"},{"name":"Nico S Stumpp"},{"name":"Meike Stiesch"}],"keywords":[{"word":" genome sequencing"},{"word":"FluidFM"},{"word":"RNASeq"},{"word":"Slippery liquid-infused porous surface"},{"word":"bacterial adhesion force"},{"word":"oral multispecies biofilm"}]},"article397":{"pmid":"31173460","title":"Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, an under-recognised entity.","abs":"Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a rare form of T-cell lymphoma, recently linked to the use of certain types of breast implants.

Clone adaptation to distinct ecological niches and/or different food products contamination routes may account for this uneven distribution. Indeed, hypervirulent clones colonize better the intestinal lumen and invade more intestinal tissues than hypovirulent ones, reflecting their adaption to host environment. Conversely, hypovirulent clones are adapted to food processing environments, with a higher prevalence of stress resistance and benzalkonium chloride tolerance genes and a higher survival and biofilm formation capacity in presence of sub-lethal benzalkonium chloride concentrations. Lm virulence heterogeneity therefore reflects the diversity of the ecological niches in which it evolves.

Here, we show how the balance between motility and flow promotes the emergence of morphological patterns in Caulobacter crescentus biofilms. By modeling transport of single cells by flow and Brownian-like swimming, we show that the emergence of these patterns is guided by an effective Péclet number. By analogy with transport phenomena we show that, counter-intuitively, fluid flow represses mixing of distinct clonal lineages, thereby affecting the interaction landscapes between biofilm-dwelling bacteria. This demonstrates that hydrodynamics influence species interaction and evolution within surface-associated communities.","authors":[{"name":"Tamara Rossy"},{"name":"Carey D Nadell"},{"name":"Alexandre Persat"}],"keywords":[]},"article401":{"pmid":"31171741","title":"Antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities of Bi subnitrate and BiNPs produced by Delftia sp.

To increase the knowledge of the HIAS (MBBR) process the aim of the current work was to characterize the MBBR microbiota and operational performance weekly for the operational year. Surprisingly, we found a major succession of the microbiota, with a five-fold increase in phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs), and major shifts in eukaryote composition, despite a stable phosphorus removal. Temperature was the only factor that significantly affected both phosphorus removal and the microbiota. There was a lower phosphor removal during the winter, coinciding with a higher microbiota alpha diversity, and a lower beta diversity. This differs from what is observed for activated sludge based EBPR. Taken together, the knowledge gained from the current microbiota study supports the efficiency and stability of MBBR-based systems, and that knowledge from activated sludge-based EBPR approaches cannot be translated to MBBR systems.","authors":[{"name":"Knut Rudi"},{"name":"Inger Andrea Goa"},{"name":"Torgeir Saltnes"},{"name":"Gjermund Sørensen"},{"name":"Inga Leena Angell"},{"name":"Sondre Eikås"}],"keywords":[]},"article412":{"pmid":"31169490","title":"Isolation and characterization of Siphoviridae phage infecting extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo.","abs":"Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Acinetobacter baumannii are being reported worldwide, and they are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.

Development of allergic CD skin lesions includes complex immune pathways and inflammatory mediators, influenced by both genetic (predominantly filaggrin mutations) and environmental triggers. In the pathogenesis of allergic CD, antimicrobial peptides play a prominent role; they are produced by various skin cells (e.g., keratinocytes, sebocytes) and move to inflamed lesions during an inflammation process.

The antibiofilm activity was evaluated by the method of biofilm formation in triplicate. The specimens were contaminated in a standard way and incubated. After that, manual brushing was performed (60 s), washed with PBS, immersed in liquid culture medium for resuspension and sowing in solid medium. The results (mean of triplicates) were expressed in CFU/mL. The data was submitted to Shapiro-Wilk, ANOVA and Tukey test (p<0.05). The specific dentifrice (1.27±1.20) was the most effective against S. mutans, followed by conventional (Trihydral, 3.13±0.88; Colgate, 2.16±2.02) and experimental (3.81±1.37) dentifrices, which were similar to each other (p=0.008). All of them were different from water (4.79±1.42). The specific (0.21±0.21) and experimental (0.36±0.25) dentifrices were similar against S. aureus, with a higher mean of CFU when compared to conventional (Colgate, 0.06±0.13), which was more efficient (p=0.000). For C. albicans, C. glabrata and E. coli, all dentifrices were similar to water (p=0.186). It was concluded, that the experimental dentifrice was effective against S. aureus and had not efficacy against Candida spp.; S. mutans; E. coli, as occurred with the commercials dentifrices.","authors":[{"name":"Maurício Malheiros Badaró"},{"name":"Vanessa Maria Fagundes Leite-Fernandes"},{"name":"Luciano Trevisan Martin"},{"name":"Viviane de Cássia Oliveira"},{"name":"Evandro Watanabe"},{"name":"Helena de Freitas de Oliveira Paranhos"},{"name":"Cláudia Helena Silva-Lovato"}],"keywords":[]},"article422":{"pmid":"31166390","title":"Beneficial Effects of Ethyl-Cyanoacrylate Coating Against Candida Albicans Biofilm Formation.","abs":"The aim of this study was to verify whether modifications made in a hard chairside reline resin by an ethyl-cyanoacrylate adhesive, ECA (Super Bonder®, Loctite, Itapevi, SP, Brazil) would be able to inhibit or reduce Candida albicans biofilm formation on its surface, comparing to a commercial surface sealant (BisCover®, Bisco, Schaumburg, USA).

Specimens were inoculated with C. albicans SC5314 (1x107 cells/mL) and incubated for 24 h. Then, the biofilm were stained with LIVE/DEAD® BaclightTM L7007 Kit and analyzed by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy. The images were evaluated by bioImageL® v.2.0 software and total biovolume (µm3), viable cells (%), and covered area (%) were calculated. Data were statistically analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (p<0.05). Results showed that ECA-coated groups presented better results, reducing C. albicans biofilm formation. Acquired images revealed that these groups (ECA1 and ECA2) presented a reduced number of cells, mostly in yeast form (less pathogenic), while the other groups presented higher number of cells, mostly in hyphae form (more pathogenic). Based on these findings, a beneficial effect of Super Bonder® coating reline resins surface could be demonstrated, suggesting a promising way to prevent fungal biofilm formation on dentures.","authors":[{"name":"Flora Freitas Fernandes Távora"},{"name":"Ana Paula Chappuis Chocano"},{"name":"Denise Gusmão de Oliveira"},{"name":"Jefferson Ricardo Pereira"},{"name":"Ricardo Sergio Almeida"},{"name":"Karin Hermana Neppelenbroek"},{"name":"Vinícius Carvalho Porto"}],"keywords":[]},"article423":{"pmid":"31166181","title":"Progress of Antimicrobial Discovery Against the Major Cariogenic Pathogen Streptococcus mutans.","abs":"Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, or cavities, remains a global public health issue. Streptococcus mutans is considered the most significant contributor to dental caries. Its cariogenicity typically depends on its unique metabolic activity and lifestyle, including acid production, acid tolerance and biofilm formation. Currently used anti-caries therapies, such as fluoride and chlorhexidine, are characterized by side-effects and drug resistance. Therefore, the development of alternative inhibitors against S. mutans growth is urgently needed. In the last decade, a larger number of natural products and their derivatives from plants, marine organisms and microorganisms were studied to evaluate their antibacterial activity against S. mutans. In addition, drug-repositioning base screening and target based high-throughput screening were employed, resulting in inspiring progresses in recent years. In this review, we summarized the available evidences regarding the inhibition of S. mutans growth. We focus on the sources, structures and potential mechanism of action of these inhibitors. Beside small molecular compounds, we also considered antibacterial peptides and protein inhibitors developed in this field.","authors":[{"name":"Tao Cui"},{"name":"Wenfu Luo"},{"name":"Letong Xu"},{"name":"Baoqiang Yang"},{"name":"Wen Zhao"},{"name":"Huaixing Cang"}],"keywords":[]},"article424":{"pmid":"31166180","title":"Molecular Evolution of Clinical Pathogenic Streptococci.","abs":"The genus Streptococcus comprises a wide variety of pathogenic and commensal gram-positive bacteria, many of which the pathogenic species cause severe, invasive infections that account for a high burden of morbidity and mortality.

So far, it has been proved that ComDE TCS could play critical roles in environmental stress responses to acid, antibiotic, oxidative pressures and so on, and modulating multiple virulence traits like biofilm formation, bacteriocin production, competence, autolysis.

The responses of S. mutans to environmental stresses are essential for its survival and role in cariogenesis. The VicRK system is one of the 13 putative TCS of S. mutans. The conserved functions of the VicRK signal transduction system is the key regulator of bacterial oxidative stress responses, acidification, cell wall metabolism, and biofilm formation. In this paper, it was discussed how the VicRK system regulates S. mutans virulence including bacterial physiological function, operon structure, signal transduction, and even post-transcriptional control in its regulon. Thus, this emerging subspecialty of the VicRK regulatory networks in S. mutans may strengthen our understandings aimed at providing a basis for the prevention of dental caries.","authors":[{"name":"Lei Lei"},{"name":"Li Long"},{"name":"Xin Yang"},{"name":"Yang Qiu"},{"name":"Yanglin Zeng"},{"name":"Tao Hu"},{"name":"Shida Wang"},{"name":"Yuqing Li"}],"keywords":[]},"article427":{"pmid":"31166149","title":"Magnesium-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles alter biofilm formation of Proteus mirabilis.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Victoria Iribarnegaray"},{"name":"Nicolas Navarro"},{"name":"Luciana Robino"},{"name":"Pablo Zunino"},{"name":"Javier Morales"},{"name":"Paola Scavone"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"magnesium doping"},{"word":"zinc oxide nanoparticles"}]},"article428":{"pmid":"31166029","title":"Antibacterial activity of disodium succinoyl glycyrrhetinate, a derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid against Streptococcus mutans.","abs":"Streptococcus mutans is a cariogenic bacterium that localizes in the oral cavity. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) is a major component of licorice extract. GRA and several derivatives, including disodium succinoyl glycyrrhetinate (GR-SU), are known to have anti-inflammatory effects in humans. In this study, the antimicrobial effect of GRA and its derivatives against the S. mutans UA159 strain were investigated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of GRA and GR-SU showed antibacterial activity against the S. mutans strain, whereas other tested derivatives did not. Because GR-SU is more soluble than GRA, GR-SU was used for further experiments. The antibacterial activity of GR-SU against 100 S. mutans strains was evaluated and it was found that all strains are susceptible to GR-SU, with MIC values below 256 µg/mL. A cell viability assay showed that GR-SU has a bacteriostatic effect on S. mutans cells. As to growth kinetics, sub-MICs of GR-SU inhibited growth. The effect of GR-SU on S. mutans virulence was then investigated. GR-SU at sub-MICs suppresses biofilm formation. Additionally, GR-SU greatly suppresses the pH drop caused by the addition of glucose and glucose-induced expression of the genes responsible for acid production (ldh and pykF) and tolerance (aguD and atpD). Additionally, expression of enolase, which is responsible for the carbohydrate phosphotransferase system, was not increased in the presence of GR-SU, indicating that GR-SU suppresses incorporation of sugars into S. mutans. In conclusion, GR-SU has antibacterial activity against S. mutans and also decreases S. mutans virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Takahito Yamashita"},{"name":"Miki Kawada-Matsuo"},{"name":"Tamaki Katsumata"},{"name":"Atsuko Watanabe"},{"name":"Yuichi Oogai"},{"name":"Yoshihiro Nishitani"},{"name":"Shouichi Miyawaki"},{"name":"Hitoshi Komatsuzawa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial agent"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"}]},"article430":{"pmid":"31165570","title":"Breathable Nanowood Biofilms as Guiding Layer for Green On-Skin Electronics.","abs":"Thin-film electronics are urged to be directly laminated onto human skin for reliable, sensitive biosensing together with feedback transdermal therapy, their self-power supply using the thermoelectric and moisture-induced-electric effects also has gained great attention (skin and on-skin electronics (On-skinE) themselves are energy storehouses).

In both years, settling cyprids adopted a specific sub-set of benthic bacteria that was distinct from the planktonic cyprid and the benthos. This microbiome was consistent, regardless of annual variability in the benthic community structure, and established within hours of settlement. The results imply that a natural process of selection occurs during the critical final transition of S. balanoides to the sessile form.

Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic characterization of vesicles from LVS and LVS∆fupA/B identified 801 proteins, including a subset of 23 proteins exhibiting differential abundance between both strains which may therefore contribute to the reduced antibiotic susceptibility of the FupA/B-deleted strain. We also demonstrated that OMVs are key structural elements of LVSΔfupA/B biofilms providing protection against FQ.
