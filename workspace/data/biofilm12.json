In Staphylococcus aureus, ϕSa3int is a widely distributed family of prophages that integrate into the β-toxin structural gene hlb, effectively inactivating it. However, β-toxin-producing strains often arise during infections and are more virulent in experimental infective endocarditis and pneumonia infections. We present evidence that in S. aureus MW2, ϕSa3mw excision is temporally and differentially responsive to growth conditions relevant to S. aureus pathogenesis. PCR analyses of ϕSa3mw (integrated and excised) and of intact hlb showed that ϕSa3mw preferentially excises in response to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and during biofilm growth. ϕSa3mw remains as a prophage when in contact with human aortic endothelial cells in culture. A criterion for a prophage to be considered a phage-RS is the inability to lyse host cells. MW2 grown under phage-inducing conditions did not release infectious phage particles by plaque assay or transmission electron microscopy, indicating that ϕSa3mw does not carry out a productive lytic cycle. These studies highlight a dynamic, and perhaps more sophisticated, S. aureus-prophage interaction where ϕSa3int prophages provide a novel regulatory mechanism for the conditional expression of virulence factors.","authors":[{"name":"Phuong M Tran"},{"name":"Michael Feiss"},{"name":"Kyle J Kinney"},{"name":"Wilmara Salgado-Pabón"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PR-switch"},{"word":"Sa3int"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"beta toxin"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"infective endocarditis"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"phage regulatory switch"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"30962352","title":"Flagellar stators activate a diguanylate cyclase to inhibit flagellar stators.","abs":"The bacterial secondary metabolite cyclic-di-GMP is a widespread, cytoplasmic signal that promotes a physiological transition in which motility is inhibited and biofilm formation is activated.….","authors":[{"name":"Daniel B Kearns"}],"keywords":[]},"article2":{"pmid":"30962351","title":"Pathoadaptive Alteration of Salmonella Biofilm Formation in Response to the Gallbladder Environment.","abs":"Typhoid fever, a human-specific disease, is primarily caused by the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. It is estimated that 3 to 5% of people infected with typhoid fever become chronic carriers. Studies have demonstrated that a mechanism of chronic carriage involves biofilm formation on gallstone surfaces. In the course of a previous study using a chronic carriage mouse model, a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate was recovered from a mouse gallstone that exhibited a 2-fold increase in biofilm formation over the wild type. In order to identify the gene(s) responsible for the phenotype, the genomic sequences of this isolate and others were determined and compared. These sequences identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes. Mutations in the most promising candidates, envZ and rcsB, were created, but neither showed increased biofilm-forming ability separately or in combination. The hyperbiofilm isolate did, however, present variations in cellular appendages observable using different techniques and a preferential binding to cholesterol. The isolate was also examined for systemic virulence and the ability to colonize the gallbladder/gallstones in a mouse model of chronic infection, demonstrating a systemic virulence defect and decreased gallbladder/gallstone colonization. Finally, to determine if the appearance of hyperbiofilm isolates could be replicated in vitro and if this was a common event, wild-type Salmonella spp. were grown long term in vitro under gallbladder-mimicking conditions, resulting in a high proportion of isolates that replicated the hyperbiofilm phenotype of the original isolate. Thus, Salmonella spp. acquire random mutations under the gallbladder/gallbladder-simulating conditions that may aid persistence but negatively affect systemic virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Michael R Neiger"},{"name":"Juan F González"},{"name":"Geoffrey Gonzalez-Escobedo"},{"name":"Harkness Kuck"},{"name":"Peter White"},{"name":"John S Gunn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chronic carriage"},{"word":"gallbladder"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"30962344","title":"Lysocins: Bioengineered Antimicrobials That Deliver Lysins across the Outer Membrane of Gram-Negative Bacteria.","abs":"The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has stimulated development of alternative therapeutics.

NBs are stable spherical packages of gas within liquid and are operationally defined as having diameters less than 1000 nm, though they are typically in the range of 100 nm in one dimension. While theories still lack the ability to explain empirical evidence for formation of stable NBs in water, numerous NB applications have emerged in different fields, including water and wastewater purification where NBs offer the potential to replace or improve efficiency of current treatment processes. The United Nations identifies access to safe drinking water as a human right, and municipal and industrial wastewaters require purification before they enter water bodies. These protections require treatment technologies to remove naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic, chromium, fluoride, manganese, radionuclides, salts, selenium, natural organic matter, algal toxins), or anthropogenic (e.g., nitrate, phosphate, solvents, fuel additives, pharmaceuticals) chemicals and particles (e.g., virus, bacteria, oocysts, clays) that cause toxicity or aesthetic problems to make rivers, lakes, seawater, groundwater, or wastewater suitable for beneficial use or reuse in complex and evolving urban and rural water systems. NBs raise opportunities to improve current or enable new technologies for producing fewer byproducts and achieving safer water. This account explores the potential to exploit the unique properties of NBs for improving water treatment by answering key questions and proposing research opportunities regarding (1) observational versus theoretical existence of NBs, (2) ability of NBs to improve gas transfer into water or influence gas trapped on particle surfaces, (3) ability to produce quasi-stable reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the surface of NBs to oxidize pollutants and pathogens in water, (4) ability to improve particle aggregation through intraparticle NB bridging, and (5) ability to mitigate fouling on surfaces. We conclude with key insights and knowledge gaps requiring research to advance the use of NBs for water purification. Among the highest priorities is to develop techniques that measure NB size and surface properties in complex drinking and wastewater chemistries, which contain salts, organics, and a wide variety of inorganic and organic colloids. In the authors' opinion, ROS production by NB may hold the greatest promise for usage in water treatment because it allows movement away from chemical-based oxidants (chlorine, ozone) that are costly, dangerous to handle, and produce harmful byproducts while helping achieve important treatment goals (e.g., destruction of organic pollutants, pathogens, biofilms). Because of the low chemical requirements to form NBs, NB technologies could be distributed throughout rapidly changing and increasingly decentralized water treatment systems in both developed and developing countries.","authors":[{"name":"Ariel J Atkinson"},{"name":"Onur G Apul"},{"name":"Orren Schneider"},{"name":"Sergi Garcia-Segura"},{"name":"Paul Westerhoff"}],"keywords":[]},"article17":{"pmid":"30958158","title":"Eggshell spheres protect brown widow spider ( Latrodectus geometricus) eggs from bacterial infection.","abs":"Eggs provide a rich source of nutrients for the developing embryo, making them a favoured food source for other organisms as well.

Pulse field gel electrophoresis revealed 10 PFGE types in MDR and 8 in non-MDR isolates. Although all isolates showed biofilm formation potential, strong biofilm formation was found more in enriched media than in minimal media. Eight MDR isolates showed strong biofilm potential in both enriched and minimal media by both detection methods. Strong direct correlation between crystal violet and VideoScan methods was observed in identifying strong biofilm forming isolates. High cytotoxic effect was observed by 4 isolates in all cell lines used while 6 other isolates showed high cytotoxic effect on T24 cell line only. Strong association of multidrug resistance was found with biofilm formation as strong biofilms were observed significantly higher in MDR isolates (p-value < 0.05) than non-MDR isolates. No significant association of cytotoxic potential with multidrug resistance or biofilm formation was found (p-value > 0.05). The MDR isolates showing significant cytotoxic effects and strong biofilm formation impose a serious threat for hospitalized patients with weak immune system.","authors":[{"name":"Asad Bashir Awan"},{"name":"Juliane Schiebel"},{"name":"Alexander Böhm"},{"name":"Jörg Nitschke"},{"name":"Yasra Sarwar"},{"name":"Peter Schierack"},{"name":"Aamir Ali"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"VideoScan technology"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cytotoxicity"},{"word":"multidrug resistance"}]},"article24":{"pmid":"30955967","title":"Biofilm formation and migration on ventricular assist device drivelines.","abs":"Driveline infections remain an important complication of ventricular assist device therapy, with biofilm formation being a major contributor.

We revealed enhanced p-fluoronitrobenzene (p-FNB) degradation in a BES by observing a defluorination efficiency that was three times higher than that in biodegradation or electrochemical processes. Such an improvement was achieved by the collaborative roles of electrode biofilms and planktonic microbes, as their individual contributions to p-FNB degradation were found to be similarly stimulated by electricity.

In liquid, cells rotate their corkscrew-shaped flagella to swim, but in surface attached biofilms cells instead use grappling hook-like appendages called pili to pull themselves along. In both forms of motility, cells selectively alternate between relatively straight 'runs' and sharp reorientations to generate biased random walks up chemoattractant gradients. However, recent experiments suggest that swimming and biofilm cells employ fundamentally different strategies to generate chemotaxis: swimming cells typically suppress reorientations when moving up a chemoattractant gradient, whereas biofilm cells increase reorientations when moving down a chemoattractant gradient. The reason for this difference remains unknown. Here we develop a mathematical framework to understand how these different chemotactic strategies affect the distribution of cells at the population level. Current continuum models typically assume a weak bias in the reorientation rate and are not able to distinguish between these two strategies, so we derive a model for strong chemotaxis that resolves how both the drift and diffusive components depend on the underlying chemotactic strategy. We then test predictions from our continuum model against individual-based simulations and identify further refinements that allow our continuum model to resolve boundary effects. Our analyses reveal that the strategy employed by swimming cells yields a larger chemotactic drift, but the strategy used by biofilm cells allows them to more tightly aggregate where the chemoattractant is most abundant. This new modelling framework provides new quantitative insights into how the different chemical landscapes experienced by swimming and biofilm cells might select for divergent ways of generating chemotaxis.","authors":[{"name":"R N Bearon"},{"name":"W M Durham"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PDEs"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chemotaxis"},{"word":"stochastic simulations"}]},"article59":{"pmid":"30950296","title":"Antimicrobial activity of nitrochalcone and pentyl caffeate against hospital pathogens results in decreased microbial adhesion and biofilm formation.","abs":"The present study investigated the antimicrobial, anti-adhesion and anti-biofilm activity of the modified synthetic molecules nitrochalcone (NC-E05) and pentyl caffeate (C5) against microorganisms which have a high incidence in hospital-acquired infections.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol, a major polyphenol found in grapes and wine, on the growth and virulence properties of P. gingivalis as well as on gingival keratinocyte tight junction integrity and the host inflammatory response. Resveratrol exhibited antibacterial activity that may result from damage to the bacterial cell membrane. Resveratrol also killed a pre-formed P. gingivalis biofilm and reduced bacterial adherence to matrix proteins. In addition, resveratrol had a protective effect on the integrity of the keratinocyte tight junctions by inhibiting its breakdown by P. gingivalis. This may be related to the ability of resveratrol to inhibit the protease activities of P. gingivalis. Lastly, resveratrol reduced P. gingivalis-mediated activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and attenuated TREM-1 gene expression as well as soluble TREM-1 secretion in monocytes. The effect on NF-κB activation likely results from the ability of resveratrol to act as a PPAR-γ agonist.

The transcriptional regulation of genes associated with methicillin resistance, surface adhesion, fatty acid biosynthesis, and global regulation (sigma B) was investigated. A significant increase in biofilm formation ability (10.21-fold) and aggregation ability (2.56-fold) was observed in BWSA15 upon the treatment with TZ (16 μg/ml). The TZ-induced biofilm formation in BWSA15 was characterized by a disappearance of polysaccharide-like extracellular substances and an appearance of a large number of intercellular MVs from extracellular matrix. Few MVs were identified in the biofilms formed by BWSA11 and BWSA23. There was a significant upregulation of mecA, sigB, and fatty acid biosynthesis-associated genes and downregulation of icaA, icaD, clfA, clfB, and fnaA in BWSA15 upon the treatment with TZ.

This study demonstrated that beta-lactam antibiotics can induce biofilm formation in OS-MRSA, and the biofilm induction in OS-MRSA can mainly be attributed to exposed MVs with increased hydrophobicity rather than polysaccharide intercellular adhesins, cell wall-anchored surface proteins, and extracellular DNA.","authors":[{"name":"Xinlong He"},{"name":"Shuang Li"},{"name":"Yi Yin"},{"name":"Jiahui Xu"},{"name":"Weijuan Gong"},{"name":"Guocai Li"},{"name":"Li Qian"},{"name":"Yinyan Yin"},{"name":"Xiaoqin He"},{"name":"Tingting Guo"},{"name":"Yuzheng Huang"},{"name":"Feng Lu"},{"name":"Jun Cao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"membrane vesicle"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"}]},"article73":{"pmid":"30949147","title":"The Eukaryotic Life on Microplastics in Brackish Ecosystems.","abs":"Microplastics (MP) constitute a widespread contaminant all over the globe.

As knowledge on MP-attached communities is insufficient for brackish ecosystems, we conducted exposure experiments in the coastal Baltic Sea, an in-flowing river and a WWTP within the drainage basin. While reporting on prokaryotic and fungal communities from the same set-up previously, we focus here on the entire eukaryotic communities. Using high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the eukaryotes colonizing on two types of MP, polyethylene and polystyrene, and compared them to the ones in the surrounding water and on a natural surface (wood). More than 500 different taxa across almost all kingdoms of the eukaryotic tree of life were identified on MP, dominated by Alveolata, Metazoa, and Chloroplastida. The eukaryotic community composition on MP was significantly distinct from wood and the surrounding water, with overall lower diversity and the potentially harmful dinoflagellate Pfiesteria being enriched on MP. Co-occurrence networks, which include prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa, hint at possibilities for dynamic microbial interactions on MP. This first report on total eukaryotic communities on MP in brackish environments highlights the complexity of MP-associated biofilms, potentially leading to altered microbial activities and hence changes in ecosystem functions.","authors":[{"name":"Marie Therese Kettner"},{"name":"Sonja Oberbeckmann"},{"name":"Matthias Labrenz"},{"name":"Hans-Peter Grossart"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Baltic Sea"},{"word":"diversity profiles"},{"word":"microeukaryotes"},{"word":"network analysis"},{"word":"next-generation sequencing"},{"word":"plastic-associated biofilms"},{"word":"polyethylene"},{"word":"polystyrene"}]},"article74":{"pmid":"30949142","title":"Genetic Relationship, Virulence Factors, Drug Resistance Profile and Biofilm Formation Ability of Vibrio parahaemolyticus Isolated From Mussel.","abs":"The objective of this study was to investigate the virulence factors, genetic relationship, antibiotic resistance profile and the biofilm formation ability of Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates on shrimp and mussel surfaces at 30°C.

In this article, the current evidence for the role of oral pre- and probiotics in caries prevention and caries management is discussed. Prebiotics are defined as substrates that are selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit. With regard to caries, this would include alkali-generating substances such as urea and arginine, which are metabolized by some oral bacteria, resulting in ammonia production and increase in pH. While there is no evidence that urea added to chewing gums or mouth rinses significantly contributes to caries inhibition, multiple studies have shown that arginine in consumer products can exert an inhibitory effect on the caries process. Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administrated in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Clinical trials have suggested that school-based programs with milk supplemented with probiotics and probiotic lozenges can reduce caries development in preschool children and in schoolchildren with high caries risk. Due to issues with research ethics (prebiotics) and risk of bias (prebiotics, probiotics), the confidence in the effect estimate is however limited. Further long-term clinical studies are needed with orally derived probiotic candidates, including the health-economic perspectives.

The cause for PTLDS is unclear and hotly debated. Borrelia burgdorferi develops morphological variants under stress conditions but their significance is not clear. Here we isolated the biofilm-like microcolony (MC) and planktonic (spirochetal form and round body) (SP) variant forms from the stationary phase culture of B. burgdorferi and showed that the MC and SP variant forms were not only more tolerant to the current Lyme antibiotics but also caused more severe arthritis in mice than the log phase spirochete form (LOG). We propose to divide the persistent Lyme disease into two categories: (1) early development of persistent disease from inoculation with persister/biofilm at the beginning of infection introduced by tick bites, or Type I persistent disease (i.e., PTLDS); and (2) late development of persistent disease due to initial infection not being diagnosed or treated in time such that the infection develops into late persistent disease, or Type II persistent disease. Importantly, we show that the murine infection caused by LOG could be eradicated by ceftriaxone whereas the persistent infection established with MC could not be eradicated by doxycycline (Doxy), ceftriaxone (CefT), or vancomycin (Van), or Doxy+CefT or Van+CefT, but could only be eradicated by the persister drug combination daptomycin+doxycycline+ceftriaxone. We conclude that varying levels of persistence and pathologies of Borrelia infection and the corresponding different treatment responses are mostly dictated by the heterogeneous B. burgdorferi variant forms inoculated at the time of tick bites. These findings may have broad implications for understanding pathogenesis and treatment of not only persistent Lyme disease but also other persistent infections in general and call for studies to evaluate if treatment of persistent infections with persister drug combination regimens is more effective than the current mostly single-antibiotic monotherapy.","authors":[{"name":"Jie Feng"},{"name":"Tingting Li"},{"name":"Rebecca Yee"},{"name":"Yuting Yuan"},{"name":"Chunxiang Bai"},{"name":"Menghua Cai"},{"name":"Wanliang Shi"},{"name":"Monica Embers"},{"name":"Cory Brayton"},{"name":"Harumi Saeki"},{"name":"Kathleen Gabrielson"},{"name":"Ying Zhang"}],"keywords":[]},"article86":{"pmid":"30944810","title":"Quorum sensing inimical activity of Tribulus terrestris against gram negative bacterial pathogens by signalling interference.","abs":"Bacterial virulence is controlled by a cascade of genes influenced by quorum sensing alias bacterial signalling.The present study was intended to develop an effective module that could constrain bacterial communication without harming the host.

Candida-associated DS is predominantly caused by Candida albicans, a dimorphic fungus that readily colonizes and forms biofilms on denture materials. Previous studies showed a requirement for Candida biofilm formation on both palate and dentures in infection and identified fungal morphogenic transcription factors, Efg1 and Bcr1, as key players in DS pathogenesis. While both C. albicans and Candida glabrata are frequently coisolated in mucosal candidiasis, a pathogenic role for C. glabrata in DS remains unknown. Using an established rat model of DS, we sought to determine whether C. glabrata alone or coinoculation with C. albicans establishes colonization and causes palatal tissue damage and inflammation. Rats fitted with custom dentures were inoculated with C. albicans and/or C. glabrata and monitored over a 4-week period for fungal burden (denture/palate), changes in body weight, and tissue damage via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as well as palatal staining by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry for myeloperoxidase (MPO) as measures of inflammation. C. glabrata colonized the denture/palate similarly to C. albicans In contrast to C. albicans, colonization by C. glabrata resulted in minimal changes in body weight, palatal LDH release, and MPO expression. Coinoculation with both species had no obvious modulation of C. albicans-mediated pathogenic effects. These data suggest that C. glabrata readily establishes colonization on denture and palate but has no apparent role for inducing/enhancing C. albicans pathogenesis in DS.","authors":[{"name":"Junko Yano"},{"name":"Alika Yu"},{"name":"Paul L Fidel"},{"name":"Mairi C Noverr"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Candida glabrata"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"candidiasis"},{"word":"host-pathogen interactions"},{"word":"mycology"}]},"article93":{"pmid":"30944157","title":"Bacterial mechanosensing: the force will be with you, always.","abs":"Whether bacteria are in the planktonic state, free-swimming or free-floating in liquid, or in the biofilm state, sessile on surfaces, they are always subject to mechanical forces.

Since the application of combined therapy of fungal infections is currently accepted, we have decided to verify the efficacy of derivative H in combination with fluconazole on C. albicans biofilm. The main advantage of synergy over monotherapy lies in reducing or even completely preventing the induction of resistance of fungal cells. We have decided to verify the derivative H (1,4-dihydropyridine-2,3,5-tricarboxylate), an intermediate of nilvadipine synthesis, in the resistance of C. albicans to fluconazole. Therefore, we have focused on the influence of derivative H on the gene expression of the main C. albicans adhesin (ALS3), which is important for the tissue colonization during the infection process. Our results show that the newly synthesized derivative H had an impact on biofilm eradication. The effect of biofilm diminution could, therefore, be explained as derivative H preventing the adherence of C. albicans cells.

However, little is known about the diversity of L. monocytogenes present on fresh produce and their potential pathogenicity. In this work, fifteen Listeria monocytogenes isolates from the UK fresh produce supply chain were characterised using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Additionally, isolates were characterised based on their ability to form biofilm. Whole genome sequencing data was used to determine the sequence type of isolates based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), construct a core single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) phylogeny and determine the presence of virulence and resistance associated genes. MLST revealed 9 distinct sequence types (STs) spanning 2 lineages (I & II) with one isolate belonging to the ST6 subtype, strains from which have been recently implicated in two large, food-associated L. monocytogenes outbreaks in South Africa and across Europe. Although most of the 15 isolates were different, comparison of core genome SNPs showed 4 pairs of 'indistinguishable' strains (<5 SNPs difference). Virulence profiling revealed that some isolates completely lacked the Listeria pathogenicity island-3 (LIPI-3) amongst other virulence factors. Investigation of the inlA gene showed that no strains in this study contained a premature stop codon (PMSC), an indicator of attenuated virulence. Assessment of biofilm production showed that isolates found in the fresh produce supply chain differ in their ability to form biofilm. This trait is considered important for L. monocytogenes to persist in environments associated with food production and processing. Overall the work indicates that a genetically diverse range of L. monocytogenes strains is present in the UK fresh produce supply chain and the virulence profiles found suggests that at least some of the strains are capable of causing human illness. Interestingly, the presence of some genetically indistinguishable isolates within the 15 isolates examined suggests that cross-contamination in the fresh produce environment does occur.

The sensitive strains with or without virulence factors were incubated with amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, or tobramycin. After each passage, the E. coli derivatives were compared to their wild types based on their susceptibility profiles, virulence genes, biofilm formations and the fingerprint profiles of PCR products amplified with using the (N)(6)(CGG)(4) primer.

The genomic changes among the studied bacteria were reflected in the changed profiles of the CGG-PCR products. In conclusion, the inappropriate application of antibiotics may cause a rapid rise of Multidrug Resistant (MDR) strains and give bacteria a chance to modulate their own pathogenicity.

S Typhi is a human-restricted pathogen; therefore, asymptomatic carriers represent a critical reservoir for further spread of disease. To examine the dynamics of the Salmonella biofilm during chronic carriage, the human gallstone (GS) environment was simulated by growing biofilms on cholesterol-coated surfaces in the presence of bile, and the transcriptional profile was determined. Some of the most highly activated genes corresponded to the curli fimbria operon, with the major structural component csgA upregulated >80-fold. The curli protein polymer is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in Salmonella biofilms. The upregulation of curli fimbriae by human bile was validated through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), microscopy, and Western blotting. Interestingly, this activation appears human specific, as qRT-PCR showed repression of csgA in biofilms grown in mouse or ox bile. Comparative transcriptional studies of the two divergent csg operons suggest an early activation of both operons in minimal medium complemented with glucose that quickly diminishes as the biofilm matures. However, in the presence of human bile, there is a modest activation of both operons that steadily increases as the biofilm matures. Understanding the effect of the GB environment on key biofilm-associated factors can help target antibiofilm therapeutics or other preventative strategies to eradicate chronic carriage.","authors":[{"name":"Juan F González"},{"name":"Lauren Tucker"},{"name":"James Fitch"},{"name":"Amy Wetzel"},{"name":"Peter White"},{"name":"John S Gunn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella"},{"word":"bile"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronic carriage"},{"word":"curli fimbriae"}]},"article123":{"pmid":"30936159","title":"The Second Messenger c-di-AMP Regulates Diverse Cellular Pathways Involved in Stress Response, Biofilm Formation, Cell Wall Homeostasis, SpeB Expression, and Virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.","abs":"Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a recently discovered second messenger in bacteria. The cellular level of c-di-AMP in Streptococcus pyogenes is predicted to be controlled by the synthase DacA and two putative phosphodiesterases, GdpP and Pde2. To investigate the role of c-di-AMP in S. pyogenes, we generated null mutants in each of these proteins by gene deletion. Unlike those in other Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes, DacA in S. pyogenes was not essential for growth in rich media. The DacA null mutant presented a growth defect that manifested through an increased lag time, produced no detectable biofilm, and displayed increased susceptibility toward environmental stressors such as high salt, low pH, reactive oxygen radicals, and cell wall-targeting antibiotics, suggesting that c-di-AMP plays significant roles in crucial cellular processes involved in stress management. The Pde2 null mutant exhibited a lower growth rate and increased biofilm formation, and interestingly, these phenotypes were distinct from those of the null mutant of GdpP, suggesting that Pde2 and GdpP play distinctive roles in c-di-AMP signaling. DacA and Pde2 were critical to the production of the virulence factor SpeB and to the overall virulence of S. pyogenes, as both DacA and Pde2 null mutants were highly attenuated in a mouse model of subcutaneous infection.

In this study, we found that mutation in the orn gene reduces bacterial tolerance to aminoglycoside and β-lactam antibiotics, which is mainly due to a defective response to oxidative stresses. The major catalase KatA is downregulated in the orn mutant, and overexpression of the katA gene restores the bacterial tolerance to oxidative stresses and the antibiotics. We further demonstrated that Orn influenced the translation of the katA mRNA and narrowed down the region in the katA mRNA that is involved in the regulation of its translation.

The results showed that the effects of bump configuration are significant; a detachment time larger than several seconds can be achieved in certain parameter sets. These results illustrate that the number density of bacteria near the wall may be reduced by appropriately controlling the parameter sets.

Asymptomatic carriage of S. aureus on the skin and in the anterior nares is common and recognized as a predisposing factor to invasive infection. Transition of S. aureus from the carriage state to that of invasive infection is often accompanied by a temperature upshift from approximately 33°C to 37°C. Such a temperature shift is known in other pathogens to influence gene expression, often resulting in increased production of factors that promote survival or virulence within the host. One mechanism by which bacteria modulate gene expression in response to temperature is by the regulatory activity of RNA-based thermosensors, cis-acting riboregulators that control translation efficiency. This study was designed to identify and characterize RNA-based thermosensors in S. aureus. Initially predicted by in silico analyses of the S. aureus USA300 genome, reporter-based gene expression analyses and site-specific mutagenesis were performed to demonstrate the presence of a functional thermosensor within the 5' UTR of cidA, a gene implicated in biofilm formation and survival of the pathogen. The nucleic sequence composing the identified thermosensor are sufficient to confer temperature-dependent post-transcriptional regulation, and activity is predictably altered by the introduction of site-specific mutations designed to stabilize or destabilize the structure within the identified thermosensor. The identified regulator is functional in both the native bacterial host S. aureus and in the distally related species Escherichia coli, suggesting that its regulatory activity is independent of host-specific factors. Interestingly, unlike the majority of bacterial RNA-based thermosensors characterized to date, the cidA thermosensor facilitates increased target gene expression at lower temperatures. In addition to the characterization of the first RNA-based thermosensor in the significant pathogen S. aureus, it highlights the diversity of function within this important class of ribo-regulators.","authors":[{"name":"Hebaallaha Hussein"},{"name":"Megan E Fris"},{"name":"Ahmed H Salem"},{"name":"Richard E Wiemels"},{"name":"Raeven A Bastock"},{"name":"Francesco Righetti"},{"name":"Caleb A Burke"},{"name":"Franz Narberhaus"},{"name":"Ronan K Carroll"},{"name":"Nahla S Hassan"},{"name":"Saleh A Mohamed"},{"name":"Afaf S Fahmy"},{"name":"Erin R Murphy"}],"keywords":[]},"article137":{"pmid":"30933902","title":"Candida species in intact in vivo biofilm from carious lesions.","abs":"The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and spatial localization of Candida species in intact in vivo biofilm from caries lesions in root and occlusal surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"I Dige"},{"name":"B Nyvad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Candida.

We fabricated patches with self-dissolvable microneedles and needle tips loaded with chloramphenicol (CAM)-bearing and gelatinase-sensitive gelatin nanoparticles (CAM@GNPs). During the microneedle patch-mediated treatment, arrays of 225 microneedles simultaneously penetrate the biofilm matrix.

In response to the gelatinase produced by the active bacterial community, the CAM@GNPs disassemble and release CAM into these active regions of the biofilm. Moreover, CAM@GNPs exhibited minimal off-target toxicity compared to direct CAM administration, which in turn favors wound healing.

A key step in understanding EPS production with a systems-based approach is the knowledge of microbial genome sequence. To speed biotechnology and industrial applications, this study reports on a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of B. thermoruber 423, constructed using the recently available high-quality genome sequence that we have subsequently validated using physiological data on batch growth and EPS production on seven different carbon sources. The model developed contains 1454 reactions (of which 1127 are assigned an enzyme commission number) and 1410 metabolites from 925 genes.

While to date most microplastic studies used virgin microplastics at unrealistic environmental concentrations here we exposed Salpa fusiformis to fractured and UV exposed polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics possessing a biofilm. It was found that when exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations, reported for the Mediterranean and the South Pacific Gyre, only few faecal pellets had microplastics incorporated within them.

To address this, we used stable isotope (C, N, and H) analyses of food sources and macroinvertebrates from 15 streams in New Brunswick (Canada) and assessed how different catchment conditions arising from the gradient in forest management intensity affect the contribution of autochthonous resources to these food webs. Aquatic primary production contributed substantially to the biomass of invertebrates in these headwater streams, especially for scrapers and collector-gatherers (25-75%). However, the contribution of algae to food webs decreased as forest management intensity (road density and associated sediments, water cations/carbon, and dissolved organic matter humification) increased, and as canopy openness decreased. This trend was probably due to an increase in the delivery of organic and inorganic terrestrial materials (dissolved and in suspension) in areas of greater harvesting intensity and road density, which resulted in more heterotrophic biofilms. Overall, results suggest that, despite the presence of riparian buffers, forest management can affect stream food web structure via changes in energy flows, and that increased protection should be directed at minimizing ground disturbance in areas with direct hydrological connection to streams and at reducing dissolved and particulate matter inputs from roads and stream crossings in catchments with high degrees of management activity.","authors":[{"name":"Maitane Erdozain"},{"name":"Karen Kidd"},{"name":"David Kreutzweiser"},{"name":"Paul Sibley"}],"keywords":[{"word":"algae"},{"word":"allochthony"},{"word":"benthic macroinvertebrate"},{"word":"forest harvesting"},{"word":"road"},{"word":"stable isotope analysis"}]},"article147":{"pmid":"30929272","title":"Rhenium and yttrium ions as antimicrobial agents against multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms.","abs":"Antimicrobial resistance presents major global concerns to patient health.

One of the simplest, yet powerful, assays that can be leveraged to dissect the molecular basis of this vital host-pathogen interaction is the in vitro adhesion and invasion assay. Among many key results, this assay has been used to discover the bacterial and host determinants involved in bacterial attachment, identify host signaling networks required for uptake of the bacteria into an endosome, and the characterization of the intracellular trafficking machinery that is subverted by Spn during development of bacteremia and meningitis. These assays have also been used to characterize the epithelial, endothelial, and/or immune cell response to these bacteria, and to learn how pneumococci disperse from an established biofilm to a planktonic phenotype to colonize another niche and/or transmit.

The toxic effects may be due to the damage of biomembrane integrity and/or the interference of membrane signal pathway. In this study, the damages of fifteen typical OPFRs (chlorinated phosphates, alkyl phosphates, aryl phosphates, and alkoxy phosphates) to mimetic biomembrane were determined by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The molecular structure descriptors that characterized the action mechanisms were screened by stepwise regression. The six molecular descriptors (MATS7e, DLS_05, Mor19m, Mor22v, Mor12v and MATS8m) were screened to study the actions between OPFRs and mimetic biomembrane. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was developed by the partial least squares (PLS) method. Statistical results indicated that the QSAR model had good robustness and mechanism interpretability. The distribution of atomic electronegativities (MATS7e) and atomic masses in three dimensional spaces (Mor19m) were the key factors influencing the actions between OPFRs and simulated biofilms. The compounds with strong electron-withdrawing property could invade the inner layer of membrane and destroy its integrity. High levels of steric hindrance could impair the damage capacity caused by electronegativity. Moreover, drug-like index (DLS_05), spatial structures of particle (Mor22v, Mor12v) and atomic masses (MATS8m) also affected the actions.

We developed biofilm consortia metabolic models for two coculture systems centered around the ecological design motif of a primary cell type that utilizes a supplied electron donor and secretes acetate as a byproduct and a secondary cell type that consumes the acetate, relieving byproduct inhibition on the primary cell type and enhancing overall system biomass. The models presented in this paper predict that distinct metabolic niches for the two cell types could be established by supplying electron donors and acceptors at opposite ends of the biofilm and that acetate consumption by the secondary cell type could increase total biomass accumulation and the synthesis of valuable biochemicals, such as isobutanol, by the primary cell type. System tunability is enhanced when each cell type is supplied with a unique terminal electron acceptor at opposite ends of the biofilm rather than competing for a common electron acceptor.

L. asiaticus' attachment to the psyllid midgut is believed to be critical to further infect other organs, including the salivary gland. In this study, the type IVc tight adherence (Tad) pilus locus encoded by 'Ca. L. asiaticus' was characterized. The Tad loci are conserved among members of Rhizobiaceae, including 'Ca. L. asiaticus' and Agrobacterium spp. Ectopic expression of the 'Ca.

The success of microbes in biofilms results from properties that are inherent in the biofilm, including enhanced interaction, protection, and biodiversity. Given the diversity of microbes that live in biofilms in harsh environments on the Earth, it is logical to hypothesize that, if microbes inhabit other bodies in the Universe, there are also biofilms on those bodies. The Biofilm Organisms Surfing Space experiment was conducted as part of the EXPOSE-R2 mission on the International Space Station. The experiment was an international collaboration designed to perform a comparative study regarding the survival of biofilms versus planktonic cells of various microorganisms, exposed to space and Mars-like conditions. The objective was to determine whether there are lifestyle-dependent differences to cope with the unique mixture of stress factors, including desiccation, temperature oscillations, vacuum, or a Mars-like gas atmosphere and pressure in combination with extraterrestrial or Mars-like ultraviolet (UV) radiation residing during the long-term space mission. In this study, the outcome of the flight and mission ground reference analysis of Deinococcus geothermalis is presented. Cultural tests demonstrated that D. geothermalis remained viable in the desiccated state, being able to survive space and Mars-like conditions and tolerating high extraterrestrial UV radiation for more than 2 years. Culturability decreased, but was better preserved, in the biofilm consortium than in planktonic cells. These results are correlated to differences in genomic integrity after exposure, as visualized by random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, cultivation-independent viability markers such as membrane integrity, ATP content, and intracellular esterase activity remained nearly unaffected, indicating that subpopulations of the cells had survived in a viable but nonculturable state.

While a myriad of water pollutants can impact public health, the greatest threat arises from pathogenic bacteria that can be harbored in different components of water treatment, distribution, and reuse systems. Bacterial biofilms can also promote water infrastructure corrosion and biofouling, which substantially increase the cost and complexity of many critical operations. Conventional disinfection and microbial control approaches are often insufficient to keep up with the increasing complexity and renewed relevance of this pressing challenge. For example, common disinfectants cannot easily penetrate and eradicate biofilms, and are also relatively ineffective against resistant microorganisms. The use of chemical disinfectants is also curtailed by regulations aimed at minimizing the formation of harmful disinfection byproducts. Furthermore, disinfectants cannot be used to kill problematic bacteria in biological treatment processes without upsetting system performance. This underscores the need for novel, more precise, and more sustainable microbial control technologies. Bacteriophages (phages), which are viruses that exclusively infect bacteria, are the most abundant (and perhaps the most underutilized) biological resource on Earth, and hold great promise for targeting problematic bacteria. Although phages should not replace broad-spectrum disinfectants in drinking water treatment, they offer great potential for applications where selective targeting of problematic bacteria is warranted and antimicrobial chemicals are either relatively ineffective or their use would result in unintended detrimental consequences. Promising applications for phage-based biocontrol include selectively suppressing bulking and foaming bacteria that hinder activated sludge clarification, mitigating proliferation of antibiotic resistant strains in biological wastewater treatment systems where broad-spectrum antimicrobials would impair pollutant biodegradation, and complementing biofilm eradication efforts to delay corrosion and biofouling. Phages could also mitigate harmful cyanobacteria blooms that produce toxins in source waters, and could also serve as substitutes for the prophylactic use of antibiotics and biocides in animal agriculture to reduce their discharge to source waters and the associated selective pressure for resistant bacteria. Here, we consider the phage life cycle and its implications for bacterial control, and elaborate on the biochemical basis of such potential application niches in the water supply and reuse cycle. We also discuss potential technological barriers for phage-based bacterial control and suggest strategies and research needs to overcome them.","authors":[{"name":"Jacques Mathieu"},{"name":"Pingfeng Yu"},{"name":"Pengxiao Zuo"},{"name":"Marcio L B Da Silva"},{"name":"Pedro J J Alvarez"}],"keywords":[]},"article178":{"pmid":"30924807","title":"Evaluation of biocidal efficacy of Chloramine T trihydrate on planktonic and sessile bacteria in a model cooling tower water system.","abs":"A model cooling tower system was experimentally seeded with Legionella pneumophila and real industrial cooling tower (CT) water has been run at the closest to full-scale system operating conditions.

TAAs, are modular homotrimeric virulence factors, containing a signal peptide, complex stalk, and conserved membrane anchoring domain. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying the evolvement of these adhesins are not clear. Here, we showed that TAA genes were laterally acquired and underwent gene duplication and recombination. The heterogeneity of TAA nucleotide sequences, GC content, codon usage, and the probability of recombination and duplication events were assessed by MEGA7. Given the heterogeneity of sequences, we used all-against-all BLAST for clustering the TAAs. The pattern of distribution of TAAs are highly scattered; GC content and codon usage for these genes are variable. Multiple events of lateral gene transfer from the early history of Acinetobacter and the occurrence of gene duplication, gene loss, and recombination after acquiring the alien genes may explain the scattered pattern of distribution of TAAs. Additionally, this gene is not present in many clinical isolates of A. baumannii, thus is not a single virulence factor attributing to the infection. The advantage of harboring such genes might be adopting to different environments by developing the biofilm communities.

This is because the interaction of such cells has important implications in a range of areas, including biofilm formation, biofouling, antimicrobial surface technologies, and bio-nanotechnologies, as well as infection development, control, and mitigation. While central to many biological phenomena, the factors which govern microbial surface attachment are still not fully understood. This lack of understanding is a direct consequence of the complex nature of cell-surface interactions, which can involve both specific and non-specific interactions. For applications involving micro- and nano-structured surfaces, developing an understanding of such phenomenon is further complicated by the diverse nature of surface architectures, surface chemistry, variation in cellular physiology, and the intended technological output. These factors are extremely important to understand in the emerging field of antibacterial nanostructured surfaces. The aim of this perspective is to re-frame the discussion surrounding the mechanism of nanostructured-microbial surface interactions. Broadly, the article reviews our current understanding of these phenomena, while highlighting the knowledge gaps surrounding the adhesive forces which govern bacterial-nanostructure interactions and the role of cell membrane rigidity in modulating surface activity. The roles of surface charge, cell rigidity, and cell-surface adhesion force in bacterial-surface adsorption are discussed in detail. Presently, most studies have overlooked these areas, which has left many questions unanswered.

Plant exudates are essential in the dialogue between microbes and their host plant and, in particular, amino acids can play an important role in the chemotactic response of bacteria. Histidine, arginine, and aspartate, which are the three most abundant amino acids present in S. rostrata seed exudates, behave as chemoattractants toward A. caulinodans. A position-specific-iterated BLAST analysis of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) (chemoreceptors) in the genome of A. caulinodans was performed. Among the 43 MCP homologs, two MCPs harboring a dCache domain were selected as possible cognate amino acid MCPs. After analysis of relative gene expression levels and construction of a gene-deleted mutant strain, one of them, AZC_0821 designed as TlpH, was confirmed to be responsible for the chemotactic response to the three amino acids. In addition, it was found that these three amino acids can also influence chemotaxis of A. caulinodans independently of the chemosensory receptors, by being involved in the increase of the expression level of several che and fla genes involved in the chemotaxis pathway and flagella synthesis. Thus, the contribution of amino acids present in seed exudates is directly related to the role as chemoattractants and indirectly related to the role in the regulation of expression of key genes involved in chemotaxis and motility. This dual role is likely to influence the formation of biofilms by A. caulinodans and the host root colonization properties of this bacterium.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaolin Liu"},{"name":"Zhihong Xie"},{"name":"Yixuan Wang"},{"name":"Yu Sun"},{"name":"Xiaoxiao Dang"},{"name":"Haishuan Sun"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Rhizobium-legume symbiosis"},{"word":"genetics and gene regulation"},{"word":"molecular signaling"}]},"article192":{"pmid":"30920083","title":"Preclinical evaluation of a novel silver gelling fiber dressing on Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a porcine wound infection model.","abs":"The wound environment is a fertile ground for biofilm forming pathogens.

From a clinical perspective, bacteria from surgical specimens are cultured in a planktonic state to determine antibiotic sensitivity. However, S. aureus exists primarily as established biofilms in PJI. To address this dichotomy, we developed a prospective registry of total knee and hip arthroplasty PJI S. aureus isolates to quantify the activity of clinically important antibiotics against isolates grown as biofilms. S. aureus planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were assessed using clinical laboratory standard index assays for 10 antibiotics (cefazolin, clindamycin, vancomycin, rifampin, linezolid, nafcillin, gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and daptomycin). Mature biofilms of each strain were grown in vitro, after which biofilm MIC (MBIC) and biofilm MBC (MBBC) were determined. Overall, isolates grown as biofilms displayed larger variations in antibiotic MICs as compared to planktonic MIC values. Only rifampin, doxycycline, and daptomycin had measurable biofilm MIC values across all S. aureus isolates tested. Biofilm MBC observations complemented biofilm MIC observations; rifampin, doxycycline, and daptomycin were the only antibiotics with measurable biofilm MBC values. 90% of S. aureus biofilms could be killed by rifampin, 50% by doxycycline, and only 15% by daptomycin. Biofilm formation increased bacterial antibiotic tolerance nonspecifically across all antibiotics, in both MSSA and MRSA samples.

We show that CB-origami directs curli subunit CsgA monomers to form oligomers and then accelerates fibril formation by increasing the proliferation rate of primary pathways. Fibrils grow either out from (departure mode) or towards the nucleators (arrival mode), implying two distinct roles of CsgB: as nucleation sites and as trap sites to capture growing nanofibrils in vicinity. Curli polymerization follows typical stop-and-go dynamics but exhibits a higher instantaneous elongation rate compared with independent fibril growth. This origami nucleator thus provides an in vitro platform for mechanistically probing molecular nucleation and controlling directional fibril polymerization for bionanotechnology.","authors":[{"name":"Xiuhai Mao"},{"name":"Ke Li"},{"name":"Mengmeng Liu"},{"name":"Xinyu Wang"},{"name":"Tianxin Zhao"},{"name":"Bolin An"},{"name":"Mengkui Cui"},{"name":"Yingfeng Li"},{"name":"Jiahua Pu"},{"name":"Jiang Li"},{"name":"Lihua Wang"},{"name":"Timothy K Lu"},{"name":"Chunhai Fan"},{"name":"Chao Zhong"}],"keywords":[]},"article196":{"pmid":"30918210","title":"Effect of water temperature during ultrasonic denture cleaning.","abs":"Denture plaque is a biofilm composed of various microorganisms aggregated with saliva.

The versatility and efficacy of some of these agents favors their use and ultimate release into the aquatic environment, where they may still exert toxic activity. Zinc pyrithione is classified as a metal biocide with bactericidal, algicidal, and fungicidal actions. It has been formulated in antifouling paints, which prevent the formation of biofilms in submerged structures, and has also been used for dermocosmetic purposes, in shampoos for the treatment of dandruff and seborrhea. Some of the uses of zinc pyrithione are responsible for its direct release as flakes that reach the bottom sediments, especially in estuarine areas. Considering this fate, the ecotoxicity assessment of its effects towards sediment organisms, namely Polychaetous species, is extremely important. The present study characterized the acute potential toxicity of zinc pyrithione in terms of parameters of oxidative stress (catalase, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)), and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase) which were evaluated in individuals of the polychaete Hediste diversicolor.

While the general use of the Hi metabolic network was similar across all three strains, the two invasive isolates secreted increased amounts of succinate, which can have anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, they showed a common shift in their carbon source utilization patterns, with strongly enhanced metabolism of nucleoside substrates, glucose and sialic acid. The latter two are major compounds present in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Interestingly, C188 and R2866 also shared a reduced ability to invade or survive intracellularly in 16HBE14 bronchial epithelial cells relative to Hi2019 (4-fold (4 h), 25-fold (24 h) reduction). Altered metabolic properties, such as the ones observed here, could arise from genomic adaptations that NTHi undergo during infection.

The quantification of biofilms production in 48 hours' cultures through CV shows that Ver3 yielded higher production in the treatment without arsenic cultured on a glass support, while S17 yield higher biofilm production under intermediate arsenic concentration on glass supports.

Pneumocin production is controlled by a quorum sensing system encoded by the blp locus. Although the locus is found in all pneumococci, there is significant variability in the repertoire of pneumocins and associated immunity proteins encoded in the Bacteriocin Immunity Region (BIR) and in the presence or absence of a functional Blp transporter. Strains without an active Blp transporter are inactive in plate overlay assays and rely on a homologous transporter that is only produced during brief periods of competence to stimulate the blp locus and secrete pneumocins. The variability of the locus suggests that selective pressure is influencing the content to promote the optimal competitive environment. Much of the variability in the blp locus has been described at the genome level; the phenotypic activity attributable to the various BIR genes has not been fully described. To examine the role of the predicted pneumocin peptides in competition, 454 isolates were screened for competence independent blp pheromone secretion using plate assays. Active strains were characterized for inhibition, BIR content, BlpC pherotype and serotype. Deletion analysis on inhibitory strains demonstrated that BlpI and BlpJ peptides function as a two-peptide bacteriocin and that BlpIJ immunity is encoded by the co-transcribed blpU4/5 genes. BlpIJ secretion promotes inhibitory activity against the majority of pneumococcal isolates when expressed in a Blp transporter intact background. Intermediate levels of competition in biofilms were noted when BlpIJ containing strains carried the non-functional Blp transporter. Based on genome data, the combination of BlpIJ in a Blp transporter intact strain is surprisingly rare, despite clear advantages during colonization and biofilm growth. In contrast, we show that the blpK/pncF operon encoding the single-peptide pneumocin BlpK and its immunity protein is found in the majority of isolates.

After media optimization for biofilm formation, we demonstrated that Lcr attaches to surfaces, and form cell aggregates embedded in a polysaccharide matrix both in batch cultures and under flow conditions in microfluidic chambers. Biofilm structures may represent excellent adaptive advantages for CLs during insect vector colonization helping with host retention, immune system evasion, and transmission.

Similarities and species-specific differences in cellular processes modulated by RsaE/RoxS suggest that this sRNA plays a prominent role in the adaptation of Gram-positive bacteria to niches with varying nutrient availabilities and environmental cues. This review summarizes recent findings on the molecular function of RsaE/RoxS and its interaction with mRNA targets.

Our antimicrobial urinary catheter (AUC) impregnated with rifampicin, triclosan, and sparfloxacin has demonstrated long-term protective activity against major uropathogens. This study aimed to firstly assess the ability of the AUC to resist mineral encrustation in the presence and absence of bacteria. Secondly, it aimed to investigate the AUC's anti-biofilm activity against multi-drug resistant organisms. There was no difference in surface roughness between AUC and control segments. In a static and a perfusion model, phosphate deposition was significantly reduced on AUCs challenged with P. mirabilis. Furthermore, none of the AUCs blocked during the 28 day test period, unlike controls. The AUC prevented colonisation by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli, and carbapenemase-producing E. coli for 12 consecutive weekly challenges. All three drugs impregnated into the catheter continued to exert protective activity throughout 12 weeks of constant perfusion. The drugs appear to migrate into the crystalline biofilm to continually protect against bacteria not it direct contact with the catheter surface. In conclusion, the AUC reduces mineral encrustation and may increase time to blockage in the presence of P. mirabilis, and does not predispose to mineral deposition under other conditions. It also offers 12 weeks of protection against multi-drug resistant bacteria. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Infection and associated mineral encrustation of urinary catheters are two serious complications of indwelling urinary catheters. Others have attempted to address this through various technologies such as coatings, dips, and surface modifications to prevent infection and/or encrustation. However, all current 'anti-infective' urinary catheter technologies are limited to short-term use. Some patients with spinal injuries, multiple sclerosis, stroke survivors and others use long-term catheters for 4-12 weeks at a time with multiple catheterisation possibly throughout the rest of their life. We present a urinary catheter for long-term use that is impregnated with three antimicrobials by a patient-protected process to prevent infection and encrustation for up to 12 weeks, the maximum lifetime of a long-term catheter before it is changed.","authors":[{"name":"Katherine Belfield"},{"name":"Xinyong Chen"},{"name":"Emily F Smith"},{"name":"Waheed Ashraf"},{"name":"Roger Bayston"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-infective agents"},{"word":"Atomic force"},{"word":"Catheter obstruction"},{"word":"Catheter-related infection"},{"word":"Catheters"},{"word":"Indwelling"},{"word":"Microscopy"},{"word":"Struvite"},{"word":"Urinary catheters"}]},"article213":{"pmid":"30913919","title":"Enhanced antibacterial properties and the cellular response of stainless steel through friction stir processing.","abs":"Biofilm related bacterial infection is one of the primary causes of implant failure.

Spatial structure is present in biofilms on many lengthscales. These range from the nanometer scale of molecular motifs to the hundred-micron scale of multicellular aggregates. Spatial structure is a physical property that impacts the biology of biofilms in many ways. The molecular structure of matrix components controls their interaction with each other (thereby impacting biofilm mechanics) and with diffusing molecules such as antibiotics and immune factors (thereby impacting antibiotic tolerance and evasion of the immune system). The size and structure of multicellular aggregates, combined with microbial consumption of growth substrate, give rise to differentiated microenvironments with different patterns of metabolism and gene expression. Spatial association of more than one species can benefit one or both species, while distances between species can both determine and result from the transport of diffusible factors between species. Thus, a widespread theme in the biological importance of spatial structure in biofilms is the effect of structure on transport. We survey what is known about this and other effects of spatial structure in biofilms, from molecules up to multispecies ecosystems. We conclude with an overview of what experimental approaches have been developed to control spatial structure in biofilms and how these and other experiments can be complemented with computational work.","authors":[{"name":"Vernita Gordon"},{"name":"Layla Bakhtiari"},{"name":"Kristin Kovach"}],"keywords":[]},"article215":{"pmid":"30913464","title":"Inhibition of biofilm formation, quorum sensing activity and molecular docking study of isolated 3, 5, 7-Trihydroxyflavone from Alstonia scholaris leaf against P.aeruginosa.","abs":"The current study is to evaluate the inhibition of biofilm formation and quorum sensing activity of isolated 3, 5, 7-Trihydroxyflavone (TF) from A.scholaris leaf extract against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

It is known that the space environment affects microbial behavior, including growth rate, biofilm formation, virulence, drug resistance, and metabolism. However, the mechanisms of these alternations have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, it is beneficial to monitor microorganisms for preventing infections among astronauts in a space environment. Salmonella enteritidis is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that commonly causes acute gastroenteritis in humans. In this study, to better understand the effects of the space environment on S. enteritidis, a S. enteritidis strain was taken into space by the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft from 17 October 2016 to 18 November 2016, and a ground simulation with similar temperature conditions was simultaneously performed as a control. It was found that the flight strain displayed an increased growth rate, enhanced amikacin resistance, and some metabolism alterations compared with the ground strain. Enrichment analysis of proteome revealed that the increased growth rate might be associated with differentially expressed proteins involved in transmembrane transport and energy production and conversion assembly. A combined transcriptome and proteome analysis showed that the amikacin resistance was due to the downregulation of the oppA gene and oligopeptide transporter protein OppA.

Increasing concentrations of phenol significantly decreased the denitrification efficiency in the reactor. The kinetic data indicate the limitation of nitrate diffusion may be one of reasons. Increasing phenol concentrations declined the activities of nitrate and nitrite reductases and induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting potential toxicity to the denitrifying consortium.

Cooperative biofilm formation by Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis was documented in vitro using growth models and scanning electron microscopy. Analysis of growth rates by species-specific 16s rRNA probes revealed distinct, early advantages to consortium growth for S. gordonii and F. nucleatum with P. gingivalis, while P. gingivalis upregulated its short mfa1 fimbriae, leading to increased invasion of DCs. F. nucleatum was only taken up by DCs when in consortium with P. gingivalis. Mature consortium regressed DC maturation upon uptake, as determined by flow cytometry. Analysis of dental plaques of PD and healthy subjects by 16s rRNA confirmed oral colonization with consortium members, but DC hematogenous spread was limited to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. Expression of P. gingivalis mfa1 fimbriae was increased in dental plaques and hematogenous DCs of PD patients.

However, since biofilm thickness is inextricably linked to external factors such as water flow, temperature, development age and nutrient conditions, its importance is difficult to quantify. Here, we designed an experimental system in a wastewater treatment plant whereby nitrifying biofilms with different thicknesses (50 or 400 µm) were grown in a single reactor, and thus subjected to identical external conditions. The 50 and 400 µm biofilm communities were significantly different. This beta-diversity between biofilms of different thickness was primarily caused by deterministic factors. Turnover (species replacement) contributed more than nestedness (species loss) to the beta-diversity, i.e. the 50 µm communities were not simply a subset of the 400 µm communities. Moreover, the two communities differed in the composition of nitrogen-transforming bacteria and in nitrogen transformation rates. The study illustrates that biofilm thickness alone is a key driver for community composition and ecosystem function, which has implications for biotechnological applications and for our general understanding of biofilm ecology.","authors":[{"name":"Carolina Suarez"},{"name":"Maria Piculell"},{"name":"Oskar Modin"},{"name":"Silke Langenheder"},{"name":"Frank Persson"},{"name":"Malte Hermansson"}],"keywords":[]},"article228":{"pmid":"30910901","title":"In Vitro Activity of a Novel Glycopolymer against Biofilms of Burkholderia cepacia Complex Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Isolates.","abs":"Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are often associated with a steady decline in lung function and death.

New therapeutic strategies targeting bacterial biofilms are anticipated to enhance antibiotic penetration and facilitate resolution of infection. Poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG) is a cationic glycopolymer therapeutic being developed to directly target biofilm integrity.

E. faecalis produces biofilms that are highly resistant to antibiotics, and it has been previously reported that certain genes of the epa operon contribute to biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance. Despite several studies examining the epa operon, many gene products of this operon remain annotated as hypothetical proteins. Here, we further explore the epa operon; we identified epaQ, currently annotated as encoding a hypothetical membrane protein, as being important for biofilm formation in the presence of the antibiotic daptomycin. Mutants with disruptions of epaQ were more susceptible to daptomycin relative to the wild type, suggesting its importance in biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the ΔepaQ mutant exhibited an altered biofilm architectural arrangement and formed small aggregates in liquid cultures. Our cumulative data show that epa mutations result in altered polysaccharide content, increased cell surface hydrophobicity, and decreased membrane potential. Surprisingly, several epa mutations significantly increased resistance to the antibiotic ceftriaxone, indicating that the way in which the epa operon impacts antibiotic resistance is antibiotic dependent. These results further define the key role of epa in antibiotic resistance in biofilms and in biofilm architecture.","authors":[{"name":"Michelle L Korir"},{"name":"Jennifer L Dale"},{"name":"Gary M Dunny"}],"keywords":[{"word":"cell wall polysaccharide"},{"word":"cell wall stress"},{"word":"functional genomics"},{"word":"intrinsic resistance to antibiotics"}]},"article230":{"pmid":"30909644","title":"Bactericidal and Anti-Biofilm Activity of Ethanol Extracts Derived from Selected Medicinal Plants against Streptococcus pyogenes.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Niluni M Wijesundara"},{"name":"H P Vasantha Rupasinghe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus pyogenes"},{"word":"antibacterial agents"},{"word":"infectious disease"},{"word":"natural health products"},{"word":"phytochemicals"},{"word":"streptococcal pharyngitis"}]},"article231":{"pmid":"30909579","title":"Towards Inhaled Phage Therapy in Western Europe.","abs":"The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria constitutes a great challenge for modern medicine, recognized by leading medical experts and politicians worldwide.

Cytotoxicity of the extract to lung epithelial cells was also investigated. It was found that POE has bacteriostatic effects at MIC 1⁻2 mg/mL, recognized as of limited efficacy, but at MIC/subMICs it targeted virulence not viability. It usually decreased S. aureus adhesion and less frequently inhibited biofilm formation on native and protein-conditioned surfaces. Observed effect seems to be related to significant reduction by POE of sortase A activity. However, in some cases POE favored the creation of biofilm by staphylococci and S. aureus adhesion to the lung epithelium was not limited. On the other side POE caused significant decrease of S. a. α-toxin synthesis and slightly weakened the expression of SpA. When used at supraMICs POE eradicated mature biofilm, but in some cases with unsatisfying outcomes. Promisingly, POE has been recognized as a safe product, with no cytotoxicity up to 4 mg/mL.

If the environment also contains a gradient of some inhibitor (e.g. a toxic drug), a tradeoff exists: the nutrient-rich tip is more exposed to the inhibitor, while the nutrient-starved region behind the front is less exposed. Here we show that this can lead to complex dynamics when the organism's response to the inhibitory substance is coupled to nutrient availability. We model a bacterial population which expands in a spatial gradient of antibiotic, under conditions where either fast-growing bacteria at the wave's tip, or slow-growing, resource-limited bacteria behind the front are more susceptible to the antibiotic. We find that growth-rate dependent susceptibility can have strong effects on the dynamics of the expanding population. If slow-growing bacteria are more susceptible, the population wave advances far into the inhibitory zone, leaving a trail of dead bacteria in its wake. In contrast, if fast-growing bacteria are more susceptible, the wave is blocked at a much lower concentration of antibiotic, but a large population of live bacteria remains behind the front.

In this study, the influence of the microplastic particles type, size and density in the production of EPS and hetero-aggregates potential was studied. Most microalgae contaminated with microplastics displayed a cell abundance decrease (of up to 42%) in the cultures. The results showed that the formed aggregates were composed of microalgae and EPS (homo-aggregates) or a combination of microalgae, EPS and microplastics (hetero-aggregates). The hetero-aggregation was dependent on the size and yield production of EPS, which was species specific. Microcystis panniformis and Scenedesmus sp. exhibited small EPS, with a higher propension to disaggregate, and consequently lower capabilities to aggregate microplastics. Tetraselmis sp. displayed a higher ability to aggregate both low and high-density microplastics, being partially limited by the size of the microplastics. Gloeocapsa sp. had an outstanding EPS production and presented excellent microplastic aggregation capabilities (adhered onto the surface and also incorporated into the EPS). The results highlight the potential of microalgae to produce EPS and flocculate microplastics, contributing to their vertical transport and consequent deposition.

We find that verticalization proceeds through a series of localized mechanical instabilities on the cellular scale. For short cells, these instabilities are primarily triggered by cell division, whereas long cells are more likely to be peeled off the surface by nearby vertical cells, creating an inverse domino effect. The interplay between cell growth and cell verticalization gives rise to an exotic mechanical state in which the effective surface pressure becomes constant throughout the growing core of the biofilm surface layer. This dynamical isobaricity determines the expansion speed of a biofilm cluster and thereby governs how cells access the third dimension.

In addition, in seven rooms of the haemato-oncological ward, the effect of 24 h of stagnation on the antibiotic concentrations and MDR (multi-drug-resistant) bacteria in biofilms was evaluated. Whereas no antibiotic residues were found in the psychosomatic ward, potential selective concentrations of piperacillin, meropenem and ciprofloxacin were detected at a rehabilitation ward and ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim were present at a haemato-oncology ward. Antibiotic resistant bacteria were isolated from the siphons of all wards, however in the psychosomatic ward, only one MDR strain with resistance to piperacillin, third generation cephalosporins and quinolones (3MRGN) was detected. In contrast, the other two wards yielded 11 carbapenemase producing MDR isolates and 15 3MRGN strains. The isolates from the haemato-oncological ward belonged mostly to two specific rare sequence types (ST) (P. aeruginosa ST823 and Enterobacter cloacae complex ST167).

The processes of the re-equilibrium of Cd after a supplement of Cd and after an adjustment of solution pH were also investigated. The results showed both the migration of Cd from water to the solid materials, and the accumulation of Cd in the solid materials. (Modified) pseudo-second-order kinetic model can be used to simulate such processes. However, Cd content in biofilms and sediments varied in different ways: Cd in biofilms increased rapidly at first, then decreased, and finally approached constancy, while Cd in sediments increased slowly and continuously. The more the Cd was added in the water, the higher the Cd contents in solid phases, and the quicker the Cd accumulation and decrease process would be. The decrease of solution pH promoted the release of adsorbed Cd from the solid phases, especially from biofilms, while the increase of pH stimulated the migration of Cd to the solids. Therefore, as an indicator and temporary reservoir of trace metals in water, which respond rapidly to the variation of trace metal concentration in water, biofilms play a role in indicating and buffering the variation of trace metals in water. Although the response of sediments to the variation of metal concentration in water is very slow, most trace metals migrate to sediments eventually, thus sediments play a role as a more stable and massive reservoir for trace metals in water.","authors":[{"name":"Xiuyi Hua"},{"name":"Xiaomeng Huang"},{"name":"Jiaqing Tian"},{"name":"Deming Dong"},{"name":"Dapeng Liang"},{"name":"Zhiyong Guo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Dynamic process"},{"word":"Microcosm"},{"word":"Multi-phase"},{"word":"Sediments"},{"word":"Trace metals"}]},"article249":{"pmid":"30903911","title":"On-line monitoring of heavy metals-related toxicity with a microbial fuel cell biosensor.","abs":"This study describes an environmental biosensor for real time toxicity monitoring, which exploits high sensitivity of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) to variations in concentrations of electron donors and acceptors.

Traditional flocculation processes have the disadvantages of high chemical dosing and solid increase, thus affecting subsequent land application. Therefore, it is desirable to develop low-cost, biodegradable, nontoxic and environmentally friendly sludge conditioners. In this work, the chitosan (CTS) was chemically modified by incorporating functional groups (amino group and the carboxyl group) to improve its water solubility and flocculation efficiency, and the anaerobically digested sludge conditioning effectiveness of different chitosan based flocculants were comparatively investigated. Results indicated that aminated chitosan (CTS-DMDAAC) and CTS performed well in sludge dewatering improvement in terms of specific resistance to filtration (SRF) and Capillary suction time (CST), which decreased to a minimum when the concentration of conditioner reached to 35 mg/g TSS. Flocs conditioned by CTS-DMDAAC were more compact and aggregated more efficiently than that flocculated with CTS and C-CTS (carboxylated chitosan). CTS-DMDAAC and CTS interacted with extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) by charge neutralization and complexation adsorption, which caused the densification of gel-like structure and enhancement of floc strength of sludge. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis showed that after CTS-DMDAAC treatment, there were plentiful large pores distributed on floc surface, which provided channels for water release under pressure filtration. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed that protein-like substances were agglomerated under flocculation conditioning, which was responsible for the promotion of sludge dewatering performance. This study provides a green and promising solution for the improvement of anaerobically digested sludge dewatering performance.","authors":[{"name":"Weijun Zhang"},{"name":"Huidi Wang"},{"name":"Liqing Li"},{"name":"Dandan Li"},{"name":"Qiandi Wang"},{"name":"Qiongying Xu"},{"name":"Dongsheng Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chitosan based polymers"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS)"},{"word":"Flocculation conditioning"},{"word":"Sludge dewatering"}]},"article251":{"pmid":"30903902","title":"Insights into microbial community profiles associated with electric energy production in microbial fuel cells fed with food waste hydrolysate.","abs":"Insights of microbial community profiles associated with electric energy production in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) fed with food waste hydrolysate (FWH) were investigated in this study.

The fitness of STEC isolates was compared to that of environmental E. coli isolates at temperatures relevant to plant growth. Growth kinetics in plant extracts varied in a plant-dependent and isolate-dependent manner for all isolates, with spinach leaf lysates supporting the highest rates of growth. Spinach extracts also supported the highest levels of biofilm formation.

The highest level of in planta colonization occurred on alfalfa sprouts, though internalization was 10 times more prevalent in the leafy vegetables than in sprouted seeds. Marked differences in in planta growth meant that the growth potential of STEC could be inferred only for sprouted seeds. In contrast, biofilm formation in extracts related to spinach colonization.

These molecular mechanisms are particularly important in bacteria exposed to different, and frequently simultaneous, types of extreme conditions. This is the case in acidithiobacilli, a group of extremophilic bacteria thriving in highly acidic biotopes, that must also cope with significant variations in temperature, osmotic potentials and concentrations of various transition metals and metalloids. Environmental cues sensed by bacteria are transduced into differential levels of nucleotides acting as intracellular second messengers, promoting the activation or inhibition of target components and eliciting different output phenotypes. Cyclic (c) di-GMP, one of the most common bacterial second messengers, plays a key role in lifestyle changes in many bacteria, including acidithiobacilli. The presence of functional c-di-GMP-dependent signal transduction pathways in representative strains of the best-known linages of this species complex has been reported. However, a comprehensive panorama of the c-di-GMP modulated networks, the cognate input signals and output responses, are still missing for this group of extremophiles. Moreover, little fundamental understanding has been gathered for other nucleotides acting as second messengers. Taking advantage of the increasing number of sequenced genomes of the taxon, here we address the challenge of disentangling the nucleotide-driven signal transduction pathways in this group of polyextremophiles using comparative genomic tools and strategies. Results indicate that the acidithiobacilli possess all the genetic elements required to establish functional transduction pathways based in three different nucleotide-second messengers: (p)ppGpp, cyclic AMP (cAMP), and c-di-GMP. The elements related with the metabolism and transduction of (p)ppGpp and cAMP appear highly conserved, integrating signals related with nutrient starvation and polyphosphate metabolism, respectively. In contrast, c-di-GMP networks appear diverse and complex, differing both at the species and strain levels. Molecular elements of c-di-GMP metabolism and transduction were mostly found scattered along the flexible genome of the acidithiobacilli, allowing the identification of probable control modules that could be critical for substrate colonization, biofilm development and intercellular interactions.

Moreover, research on photosensitizers and light sources are also reviewed. The publications were selected using PubMed, Web of Science, and manual search of references cited in key papers. The descriptors used were dental caries and photodynamic therapy. The relative efficacy of aPDT to reduce the population of cariogenic bacteria in in vitro biofilms is demonstrated by large number of laboratory studies. Preclinical (in situ models) and clinical studies show a less pronounced bacterial reduction for aPDT than for in vitro models, especially in dentin carious lesions, since the bacteria in dentin caries may be less susceptible to this therapy due to the limited photosensitizer penetration as well as reduced diffusion of light along dentin structures. Although aPDT may be an efficient and less invasive complementary approach to disinfect deep caries lesions, there is insufficient scientific evidence of its efficacy to warrant a clinical recommendation for its use.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Catarina Martins Reis"},{"name":"Wanessa Fernandes Matias Regis"},{"name":"Lidiany Karla Azevedo Rodrigues"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Light source"},{"word":"Photosensitizer"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"}]},"article267":{"pmid":"30897827","title":"Periodontal Disease: A Risk Factor for Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease.","abs":"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease, initiated by the presence of a bacterial biofilm, called dental plaque, which affects both the periodontal ligaments and bone surrounding teeth. In the last decades, several lines of evidence have supported the existence of a relationship between periodontitis and systemic health. For instance, as periodontitis acts within the same chronic inflammatory model seen in cardiovascular disease (CVD), or other disorders, such as diabetes, several studies have suggested the existence of a bi-directional link between periodontal health and these pathologies. For instance, people with diabetes are more susceptible to infections and are more likely to suffer from periodontitis than people without this syndrome. Analogously, it is now evident that cardiac disorders are worsened by periodontitis, both experimentally and in humans. For all these reasons, it is very plausible that preventing periodontitis has an impact on the onset or progression of CVD and diabetes. On these grounds, in this review, we have provided an updated account on the current knowledge concerning periodontal disease and the adverse effects exerted on the cardiovascular system health and diabetes, informing readers on the most recent preclinical studies and epidemiological evidence.","authors":[{"name":"Daniela Liccardo"},{"name":"Alessandro Cannavo"},{"name":"Gianrico Spagnuolo"},{"name":"Nicola Ferrara"},{"name":"Antonio Cittadini"},{"name":"Carlo Rengo"},{"name":"Giuseppe Rengo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"cardiovascular disease"},{"word":"diabetes"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article268":{"pmid":"30897425","title":"Water vapor sorption-desorption hysteresis in glassy surface films of mucins investigated by humidity scanning QCM-D.","abs":"Investigating the origin of water sorption-desorption hysteresis in glassy biopolymers is important for understanding the properties of biological barriers, such as the mucus epithelium.

The size of the whole genome is 5 242 327 bp, with two chromosomes and one plasmid.

The urochordate, Ciona robusta, is a model organism that has been adapted to experimental studies of host/microbiome interactions.

Because the incubation temperature can influence both the reactivity of electron mediators and cell growth, it may also affect the electron-shuttle-mediated extracellular electron transfer (EET) process. Here, the effect of incubation temperature (22-38°C) was investigated in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and 50 μM of 9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS). We found that current generation increased as the temperature was increased from 22 to 34°C and then decreased sharply at 38°C. The biofilm biomass, as indicated by the total protein extracted from the electrode, increased as the temperature increased from 22 to 34°C and then decreased at 38°C, mirroring the current generation results. These results were further confirmed by increasing the temperature slowly, step-by-step, in a single BES with a constant biofilm biomass, suggesting that the EET rates could be substantially influenced by temperature, even with the same biofilm. The effects of temperature on the AQS bioreduction rate, c-type cytochrome (c-Cyts)-bound-cofactor-mediated EET, the AQS mid-point potential, and the AQS diffusion coefficient were studied. From these results, we were able to conclude that temperature influenced the EET rates by changing the c-Cyts-bound-cofactor-mediated EET process and the AQS bioreduction rate, and that the change in biofilm formation was a dominant factor influencing the overall EET rates. These findings should contribute to the fundamental understanding of EET processes. Moreover, optimization of the operating parameters for current generation will be helpful for the practical application of bioelectrochemical techniques.","authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu"},{"name":"Yundang Wu"},{"name":"Tongxu Liu"},{"name":"Fangbai Li"},{"name":"Hui Dong"},{"name":"Meiqing Jing"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"extracellular electron transfer"},{"word":"mediator"},{"word":"redox transformation"},{"word":"temperature"}]},"article279":{"pmid":"30894842","title":"Shear Stress Affects Biofilm Structure and Consequently Current Generation of Bioanode in Microbial Electrochemical Systems (MESs).","abs":"Shear stress is an important factor that affects the formation and structure of anode biofilms, which are strongly related to the extracellular electron transfer phenomena and bioelectric performance of bioanodes.

Over time, knowledge on periodontal plastic procedures has become less empirical and more supportive of the clinical management of recession-type defects. Gingival recession etiology, animal studies, free gingival grafts, pedicle flaps (semilunar, laterally positioned, and coronally positioned), and subepithelial connective tissue grafts are extensively reviewed. The use of allografts as an alternative to subepithelial connective tissue grafts, the treatment of multiple gingival recessions, and the rationale for use of guided tissue regeneration and enamel matrix derivative in plastic periodontal procedure is discussed. We also assess how smoking can affect the treatment outcomes in plastic surgery procedures. Minimally invasive procedures are of great value in improving the features of the final tissues. The following aspects identified in this compilation were of great interest: (a) some factors, anatomical in nature, favor the formation of root recessions, but it is the inflammatory process (caused by the presence of biofilm and/or by traumatic toothbrushing) that is responsible for the development of root recessions; and (b) pedicle flap procedures (especially the coronally positioned flap) are extremely versatile and have the most predictable outcome of all root-coverage procedures, especially when combined with subepithelial connective tissue grafting and/or allogeneic grafts. In summary: subepithelial connective tissue grafting is considered as the first option to augment gingival width and thickness, and it may provide better long-term results; the same principles of root-coverage procedures in individual sites appear be used in clinical practice also for multiple-recession type defects; an allograft is an efficient alternative to a subepithelial connective tissue graft and, when it is the treatment option of choice, the use of wide, extended flaps should be considered; because of the superiority of plastic periodontal procedures over guided tissue regeneration and the technical difficulty of the latter, guided tissue regeneration has become obsolete for root-coverage procedures; there is rather a large body of evidence attesting that smoking negatively influences root-coverage procedures, especially subepithelial connective tissue grafts; and minimally invasive techniques may be of great value for improving the results obtained with plastic periodontal procedures, but these techniques need to be better addressed in clinical trials, both in terms of the quality and quantity of the new tissue generated.","authors":[{"name":"Arthur Belém Novaes"},{"name":"Daniela Bazan Palioto"}],"keywords":[]},"article286":{"pmid":"30892766","title":"Maintenance therapy for teeth and implants.","abs":"Maintenance care is mandatory for the long-term success of periodontal and implant treatment.

To provide a better understanding to the reader, a historical perspective is firstly presented. The main features on the controversy of the role played by trauma from occlusion on the physiologic behavior of the periodontal structures are shown, together with how deviations from the normal characteristics of this relationship itself affect the integrity of the periodontal tissues when or associated with dental biofilm in the presence or not of periodontal pockets have arisen. The literature provides evidence showing that the very first publication to establish a strong correlation between trauma from occlusion and periodontal pockets in humans was of Latin-American origin. However, subsequently, trauma from occlusion was mostly evaluated by an American group, followed by a Scandinavian group, yet with some contributions from the Latin-American group. Basically trauma from occlusion has been correlated with periodontal pockets in view of the fact that these would render the periodontal supporting tissues more amenable to the spread of inflammation of biofilm-related periodontal pockets. This would facilitate the fast deepening of periodontal pockets, influencing the generation of infrabony periodontal pockets or suprabony periodontal pockets that are deeper than in areas without trauma from occlusion. The factors related to these different behaviors are discussed. Several clinical cases are presented showing evidence that corroborates the possibility of an actual interrelationship between trauma from occlusion and periodontitis. Theoretical evaluations based on recent advances of the mechanisms involving molecular modulation in physiological and altered occlusal functions, as well as on research data, and evaluations from data of clinical cases, support the assumption that trauma from occlusion and periodontitis may embrace the unique pathologic condition of the associated lesion trauma from occlusion plus periodontitis or act independently even if both co-exist simultaneously in a particular case. The link between both conditions that was emphasized as definitively necessary in order for an associated lesion to develop is that both lesions, namely trauma from occlusion and periodontitis, occur in their destructive stage at exactly the same time. This involvement would explain why so many different data are presented in the literature and hopefully will shed some light for development of new methodologies of research.

Eradication of biofilm bacteria can require sustained exposure to high antimicrobial concentrations (we estimate 100-1000 μg/mL sustained for 24 h) which are far in excess of what can be provided by systemic administration. We have previously reported the development of temperature-responsive hydrogels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-dimethylbutyrolactone acrylate-co-Jeffamine M-1000 acrylamide) (PNDJ) that provide sustained antimicrobial release in vitro and are effective in treating a rabbit model of osteomyelitis when instilled after surgical debridement. In this work, we sought to measure in vivo antimicrobial release from PNDJ hydrogels and the antimicrobial concentrations provided in adjacent tissues. PNDJ hydrogels containing tobramycin and vancomycin were administered in four dosing sites in rabbits (intramedullary in the femoral canal, soft tissue defect in the quadriceps, intramuscular injection in the hamstrings, and intra-articular injection in the knee). Gel and tissue were collected up to 72 h after dosing and drug levels were analyzed. In vivo antimicrobial release (43-95% after 72 h) was markedly faster than in vitro release. Drug levels varied significantly depending on the dosing site but not between polymer formulations tested. Notably, total antimicrobial concentrations in adjacent tissue in all dosing sites were sustained at estimated biofilm-eradicating levels for at least 24 h (461-3161 μg/mL at 24 h).

Pilus-mediated initial adherence of N. meningitidis to the epithelial mucosa is followed by the formation of three-dimensional aggregates, called microcolonies. Dispersal from microcolonies contributes to the transmission of N. meningitidis across the epithelial mucosa. We have recently discovered that environmental concentrations of host cell-derived lactate influences N. meningitidis microcolony dispersal. Here, we examined the ability of N. meningitidis mutants deficient in lactate metabolism to form biofilms. A lactate dehydrogenease A (ldhA) mutant had an increased level of biofilm formation. Deletion of ldhA increased the N. meningitidis cell surface hydrophobicity and aggregation. In this study, we used FAM20, which belongs to clonal complex ST-11 that forms biofilms independently of extracellular DNA (eDNA). However, treatment with DNase I abolished the increased biofilm formation and aggregation of the ldhA-deficient mutant, suggesting a critical role for eDNA. Compared to wild-type, the ldhA-deficient mutant exhibited an increased autolytic rate, with significant increases in the eDNA concentrations in the culture supernatants and in biofilms. Within the ldhA mutant biofilm, the transcription levels of the capsule, pilus, and bacterial lysis genes were downregulated, while norB, which is associated with anaerobic respiration, was upregulated. These findings suggest that the absence of ldhA in N. meningitidis promotes biofilm formation and aggregation through autolysis-mediated DNA release.","authors":[{"name":"Sara Sigurlásdóttir"},{"name":"Gabriela M Wassing"},{"name":"Fanglei Zuo"},{"name":"Melanie Arts"},{"name":"Ann-Beth Jonsson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Neisseria meningitidis"},{"word":"autolysis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"lactate dehydrogenase"}]},"article295":{"pmid":"30891013","title":"Corrigendum: Flor Yeast Diversity and Dynamics in Biologically Aged Wines.","abs":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02235.].","authors":[{"name":"Vanessa David-Vaizant"},{"name":"Hervé Alexandre"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FLO11"},{"word":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"flor yeast"},{"word":"scanning electron microscopy"},{"word":"vin jaune"},{"word":"wine"}]},"article296":{"pmid":"30890906","title":"Common miRNA Patterns of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease and Their Putative Impact on Commensal Gut Microbiota.","abs":"With the rise of Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) methods, Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have achieved an important position in the research landscape and have been found to present valuable diagnostic tools in various diseases such as multiple sclerosis or lung cancer.

Apparently, these diseases come along with changes in miRNA expression patterns which led to attempts from researchers to use these small RNA species from several body fluids for a better diagnosis and in order to observe disease progression. Additionally, it became evident that microbial commensals might play an important role for pathology development and were shown to have a significantly different composition in patients suffering from neurodegeneration compared with healthy controls. As it could recently be shown that secreted miRNAs are able to enter microbial organisms, it is conceivable that the host's miRNA might affect the gut microbial ecosystem. As such, miRNAs may inherit a central role in shaping the diseased microbiome and thereby mutually act on the characteristics of these neurodegenerative diseases. We have therefore (1) compiled a list of miRNAs known to be associated with AD and/or PD, (2) performed an in silico target screen for binding sites of these miRNA on human gut metagenome sequences and (3) evaluated the hit list for interesting matches potentially relevant to the etiology of AD and or PD. The examination of protein identifiers connected to bacterial secretion system, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation revealed an overlap of 37 bacterial proteins that were targeted by human miRNAs. The identified links of miRNAs to the biological processes of bacteria connected to AD and PD have yet to be validated via in vivo experiments.

In porous media, biofilms grow to clog partially or totally the pore network. Dynamics of biofilm accumulation (e.g., by attachment, detachment, advective transport in depth) and their impact on both surface and deep bioclogging are still not yet fully understood. To address this concern, a 104 day-long outdoor infiltration experiment in sand tanks was performed, using secondary treated wastewater and two grain size distributions (GSDs): a monolayer system filled with fine sand, and a bilayer one composed by a layer of coarse sand placed on top of a layer of fine sand. Biofilm dynamics as a function of GSD and depth were studied through cross-correlations and multivariate statistical analyses using different parameters from biofilm biomass and activity indices, plus hydraulic parameters measured at different depths. Bioclogging (both surface and deep) was found more significant in the monolayer fine system than in the bilayer coarse-fine one, possibly due to an early low-cohesive biofilm formation in the former, driven by lower porosity and lower fluxes; under such conditions biomass is favorably detached from the top layer, transported and accumulated in depth, so that new biomass might colonize the surface. On the other hand, in the bilayer system, fluxes are highest, and the biofilm is still in a growing phase, with low biofilm detachment capability from the top sand layer and high microbial activity in depth, resulting in low bioclogging. Overall, the bilayer coarse-fine system allows infiltrating higher volume of water per unit of surface area than the monolayer fine one, minimizing surface and deep bioclogging, and thus increasing the longevity and efficiency of infiltration systems.","authors":[{"name":"N Perujo"},{"name":"A M Romaní"},{"name":"X Sanchez-Vila"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm activity"},{"word":"Biofilm attachment/detachment"},{"word":"Deep clogging"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)"},{"word":"Grain size distribution"},{"word":"Porous media"}]},"article307":{"pmid":"30889223","title":"Transcriptional organization, regulation and functional analysis of flhF and fleN in Pseudomonas putida.","abs":"The Pseudomonas putida flhA-flhF-fleN-fliA cluster encodes a component of the flagellar export gate and three regulatory elements potentially involved in flagellar biogenesis and other functions.

In this study, we demonstrate that HigA antitoxin is produced at a higher level than HigB and that higA mRNA is expressed separately from a promoter inside higB during the late stationary phase. Critically, HigA represses the expression of mvfR, which is an important virulence-related regulator, by binding to a conserved HigA palindrome (5'-TTAAC GTTAA-3') in the mvfR promoter, and the binding of HigB to HigA derepresses this process. During the late stationary phase, excess HigA represses the expression of mvfR and higBA. However, in the presence of aminoglycoside antibiotics where Lon protease is activated, the degradation of HigA by Lon increases P. aeruginosa virulence by simultaneously derepressing mvfR and higB transcription. Therefore, this study reveals that the antitoxin of the P. aeruginosa TA system is integrated into the key virulence regulatory network of the host and functions as a transcriptional repressor to control the production of virulence factors.","authors":[{"name":"Yunxue Guo"},{"name":"Chenglong Sun"},{"name":"Yangmei Li"},{"name":"Kaihao Tang"},{"name":"Songwei Ni"},{"name":"Xiaoxue Wang"}],"keywords":[]},"article335":{"pmid":"30882982","title":"Prophage LambdaSo uses replication interference to suppress reproduction of coexisting temperate phage MuSo2 in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.","abs":"Many bacterial genomes carry multiple prophages that compete with each other, potentially affecting the physiology, fitness, and pathogenicity of their hosts. However, molecular mechanisms of such prophage-prophage conflicts remain poorly understood. The genome of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, a Gammaproteobacterium residing in aquatic environments and notable for its ability to reduce metal ions, harbours four prophages, two of which (LambdaSo and MuSo2) form infectious virions during biofilm formation. Here, we constructed indicator strains of LambdaSo and MuSo2 by deleting the corresponding prophages from the MR-1 chromosome and investigated their reproduction. Interestingly, the fitness of MuSo2 increased in the absence of LambdaSo, suggesting that prophage LambdaSo repressed MuSo2 reproduction. Partial deletion of LambdaSo from the MR-1 chromosome revealed that gene cluster R of LambdaSo, which was responsible for the switch to the lytic cycle and LambdaSo genome replication initiation, was necessary and sufficient to repress MuSo2. Furthermore, activation of cluster R genes facilitated replication of cluster R-encoding DNA and inhibited host and MuSo2 DNA replication. These findings suggest that LambdaSo represses MuSo2 propagation by inhibiting DNA replication during simultaneous induction. We predict that such a mechanism of inter-prophage interference is more widespread in bacteria than currently appreciated.","authors":[{"name":"Qinggong Guo"},{"name":"Beibei Chen"},{"name":"Yishuai Tu"},{"name":"Shishen Du"},{"name":"Xiangdong Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article336":{"pmid":"30882300","title":"In vitro activities of daptomycin combined with fosfomycin or rifampin on planktonic and adherent linezolid-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.","abs":"This study aimed to explore daptomycin combined with fosfomycin or rifampin against the planktonic and adherent linezolid-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.","authors":[{"name":"Jin-Xin Zheng"},{"name":"Xiang Sun"},{"name":"Zhi-Wei Lin"},{"name":"Guo-Bin Qi"},{"name":"Hao-Peng Tu"},{"name":"Yang Wu"},{"name":"Si-Bo Jiang"},{"name":"Zhong Chen"},{"name":"Qi-Wen Deng"},{"name":"Di Qu"},{"name":"Zhi-Jian Yu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"daptomycin"},{"word":"fosfomycin"},{"word":"linezolid-resistant"},{"word":"rifampin"}]},"article337":{"pmid":"30882296","title":"Introducing BAIT (Biofilm Architecture Inference Tool): a software program to evaluate the architecture of oral multi-species biofilms.","abs":"Biofilm model systems are used to study biofilm growth and predict the effects of anti-biofilm interventions within the human oral cavity.

Since multidrug resistant S. Infantis isolates are highly prevalent in the broiler meat industry and may represent a public health concern through the food chain, we aimed to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility, genetic diversity, and biofilm-forming ability of S. Infantis from Slovenian broiler flocks. A total of 87 S. Infantis strains isolated from broiler faeces in the period between 2007 and 2013 were studied. The samples originated from 41 farms which were subcontractors of three major food business operators and from two autonomously operating holdings (farms). Isolates were phenotypically tested for their susceptibility to 14 antimicrobials from nine classes by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration with the microdilution method. Only 8% of the isolates were susceptible to all of the antimicrobial agents tested, while 88.5% of the isolates were multidrug resistant, with the most common resistance pattern CipNxSSuT (65.5%) followed by CipNxSuT (17.2%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) divided the strains into five clusters (A-E) comprising 16 distinct XbaI PFGE profiles. Sixty-five out of 87 isolates were grouped in clusters A and B, with the predominant PFGE profiles A1 and B1 encompassing 33 and 28 isolates, respectively. A vast majority of the isolates (75/87) showed >90% PFGE profile similarity. The biofilm-forming capacity of the tested isolates, determined with crystal violet assay in polystyrene microwell plates, was generally weak. The average biofilm formation for persistent strains was higher than for presumably nonpersistent strains; however, the difference was not significant. It seems that S. Infantis persistence on broiler farms is more related to its widespread occurrence in the broiler production chain and ineffective disinfection protocols than to its ability to form biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Mateja Pate"},{"name":"Jasna Mičunovič"},{"name":"Majda Golob"},{"name":"Lene Karine Vestby"},{"name":"Matjaž Ocepek"}],"keywords":[]},"article339":{"pmid":"30881614","title":"'Second-generation' 1,2,3-triazole-based inhibitors of Porphyromonas gingivalis adherence to oral streptococci and biofilm formation.","abs":"Several 'second-generation' click inhibitors of the multi-species biofilm propagated by the adherence of the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis to Streptococcus gordonii were synthesized and evaluated.

The aim of this study was to isolate catheter-associated urinary bacterial pathogens, their biofilm formation, and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern among inpatients of Jimma University Medical Center (JUMC) in Southwest Ethiopia. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among urinary catheterized inpatients of JUMC from February to August 2016. A total of 143 study participants were enrolled consecutively in this study. Urine samples were collected from catheterized patients and processed using a standard bacteriological protocol for isolation and identification. Evaluation of in vitro biofilm formation and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of uropathogenic bacteria was done using microtiter plates and disk diffusion method, respectively. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered into SPSS version 20 for analysis. All statistical test values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. From all study participants, mean age was 44 years. Sixty bacterial strains were recovered from 57 urinary catheterized inpatients among which 54 of them were monomicrobial (94.7%).

The threat of selecting for resistance genes largely precludes sustained antimicrobial elution as a wide-spread clinical solution. In response, self-defensive surfaces have been developed where antimicrobial is released only when and where there is a bacterial challenge. We explore a new self-defensive approach using anionic microgels into which small-molecule cationic antimicrobials are loaded by complexation. We identify conditions where antimicrobial remains sequestered within the microgels for periods as long as weeks. However, bacterial contact triggers release and leads to local bacterial killing. We speculate that the close proximity of bacteria alters the local thermodynamic environment and interferes with the microgel-antimicrobial complexation. The contact-transfer approach does not require bacterial metabolism but instead appears to be driven by differences between the microgels and the bacterial cell envelope where there is a high concentration of negative charge and hydrophobicity. Contact with metabolizing macrophages or osteoblasts is, however, insufficient to trigger antimicrobial release, indicating that contact transfer can be specific to bacteria and suggesting an avenue to biomedical device surfaces that can simultaneously promote healing and resist infection.","authors":[{"name":"Jing Liang"},{"name":"Hongjun Wang"},{"name":"Matthew Libera"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial"},{"word":"Cell-material interactions"},{"word":"Drug delivery"},{"word":"Implant infection"},{"word":"Microgel"},{"word":"Triggered-release"}]},"article363":{"pmid":"30875284","title":"Animal models of orthopaedic infections. A review of rabbit models used to induce long bone bacterial infections.","abs":"The development of infections is one of the main complications in orthopaedics, especially in the presence of implants for the osteosynthesis of compound fractures and joint prosthesis. Indeed, foreign materials and implants act as substrates for the adhesion and proliferation of bacterial strains able to produce biofilm, causing peri-implant osteomyelitis. The eradication of biofilm remains a great challenge for the host immune system, as well as for medical and surgical approaches, thus imposing the need for new prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategies in which animal models have an essential role. In vivo orthopaedic models have mainly been used to study the pathogenesis of infections, biofilm behaviour and the efficacy of antimicrobial strategies, to select diagnostic techniques and test the efficacy of novel materials or surface modifications to impede both the establishment of bone infections and the associated septic loosening of implants. Among several models of osteomyelitis and implant-related infections described in small rodents and large animals, the rabbit has been widely used as a reliable and reproducible model of orthopaedic infections. This review examines the relevance of rabbits for the development of clinically representative models by analysing the pros and cons of the different approaches published in the literature.

MAPK signaling is initiated at the plasma membrane, where triggering stimuli lead to a phosphorylation cascade that ultimately activates transcription factors to ensure an appropriate adaptive response. In pathogenic fungi, the HOG pathway gains special significance as it is involved in traits related to pathogenicity; these include biofilm formation, adhesion to surfaces, and morphogenetic and epigenetic transitions.

Pilus biogenesis by the CU pathway requires two specialized assembly components: a dedicated periplasmic chaperone and an integral outer membrane assembly and secretion platform termed the usher. The CU pathway assembles a variety of surface fibers, ranging from thin, flexible filaments to rigid, rod-like organelles. Pili typically act as adhesins and function as virulence factors that mediate contact with host cells and colonization of host tissues. Pilus-mediated adhesion is critical for early stages of infection, allowing bacteria to establish a foothold within the host. Pili are also involved in modulation of host cell signaling pathways, bacterial invasion into host cells, and biofilm formation. Pili are critical for initiating and sustaining infection and thus represent attractive targets for the development of antivirulence therapeutics. Such therapeutics offer a promising alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics and provide a means to combat antibiotic resistance and treat infection while preserving the beneficial microbiota. A number of strategies have been taken to develop antipilus therapeutics, including vaccines against pilus proteins, competitive inhibitors of pilus-mediated adhesion, and small molecules that disrupt pilus biogenesis.

Here, we report on a novel long non-coding (nc)RNA, named IcaZ, which is approximately 400 nucleotides in size. icaZ is located downstream of the ica repressor gene icaR and partially overlaps with the icaR 3' UTR. icaZ exclusively exists in ica-positive S. epidermidis, but not in S. aureus or other staphylococci. Inactivation of the gene completely abolishes PIA production. IcaZ is transcribed as a primary transcript from its own promoter during early- and mid-exponential growth and its transcription is induced by low temperature, ethanol and salt stress. IcaZ targets the icaR 5' UTR and hampers icaR mRNA translation, which alleviates repression of icaADBC operon transcription and results in PIA production. Interestingly, other than in S. aureus, posttranscriptional control of icaR mRNA in S. epidermidis does not involve icaR mRNA 5'/3' UTR base pairing. This suggests major structural and functional differences in icaADBC operon regulation between the two species that also involve the recruitment of ncRNAs.

Antibacterial studies showed that the composite formulation was capable of inhibiting bacterial growth in suspension, and able to completely prevent biofilm formation on the scaffold in the presence of resistant strains. The hydrogels were also shown to be biocompatible, allowing cell proliferation. In summary, the developed CS-HACS-AgNWs composite hydrogels demonstrated significant potential as a scaffold material to be employed in bone regenerative medicine, as they present enhanced mechanical strength combined with the ability to allow calcium salts deposition, while efficiently decreasing the risk of infections.

Transcriptome analysis through differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and reporter gene fusions demonstrate that S. epidermidis protein- and PIA-biofilm matrix producers differ with respect to RsaE and metabolic gene expression. RsaE is spatiotemporally expressed within S. epidermidis PIA-mediated biofilms, and its overexpression triggers a PIA biofilm phenotype as well as eDNA release in an S. epidermidis protein biofilm matrix-producing strain background. dRNA-seq and Northern blot analyses revealed RsaE to exist as a major full-length 100-nt transcript and a minor processed species lacking approximately 20 nucleotides at the 5'-end. RsaE processing results in expansion of the mRNA target spectrum. Thus, full-length RsaE interacts with S. epidermidis antiholin-encoding lrgA mRNA, facilitating bacterial lysis and eDNA release. Processed RsaE, however, interacts with the 5'-UTR of icaR and sucCD mRNAs, encoding the icaADBC biofilm operon repressor IcaR and succinyl-CoA synthetase of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, respectively. RsaE augments PIA-mediated biofilm matrix production, most likely through activation of icaADBC operon expression via repression of icaR as well as by TCA cycle inhibition and re-programming of staphylococcal central carbon metabolism towards PIA precursor synthesis. Additionally, RsaE supports biofilm formation by mediating the release of eDNA as stabilizing biofilm matrix component. As RsaE itself is heterogeneously expressed within biofilms, we consider this sRNA to function as a factor favoring phenotypic heterogeneity and supporting division of labor in S. epidermidis biofilm communities.","authors":[{"name":"Sonja M K Schoenfelder"},{"name":"Claudia Lange"},{"name":"Srinivasa Abishek Prakash"},{"name":"Gabriella Marincola"},{"name":"Maike F Lerch"},{"name":"Freya D R Wencker"},{"name":"Konrad U Förstner"},{"name":"Cynthia M Sharma"},{"name":"Wilma Ziebuhr"}],"keywords":[]},"article388":{"pmid":"30870411","title":"Growth substrate may influence biofilm susceptibility to antibiotics.","abs":"The CDC biofilm reactor is a robust culture system with high reproducibility in which biofilms can be grown for a wide variety of analyses.

Such modifications are suggested to allow these cells to conserve energy during metabolic dormancy. In comparison, resistant strains E. coli D4, A9, and H5 elongated their cells, increased their roughness, increased their nanoscale adhesion forces, became more hydrophilic, and increased their biofilm formation upon exposure to ampicillin.

Despite the fact that multiple stent designs have been researched in recent years, encrustation and biofilm-associated infections remain significant complications of ureteral stenting, potentially leading to the functional failure of the stent. It has been suggested that inactive side-holes of stents may act as anchoring sites for encrusting crystals, as they are associated with low wall shear stress (WSS) levels. Obstruction of side-holes due to encrustation is particularly detrimental to the function of the stent, since holes provide a path for urine to by-pass the occlusion. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop novel stents to reduce deposition of encrusting particles at side-holes. In this study, we employed a stent-on-chip microfluidic model of the stented and occluded ureter to investigate the effect of stent architecture on WSS distribution and encrustation over its surface. Variations in the stent geometry encompassed (i) the wall thickness and (ii) the shape of side-holes. Stent thickness was varied in the range 0.3-0.7 mm, while streamlined side-holes of triangular shape were evaluated (with a vertex angle in the range 45°-120°). Reducing the thickness of the stent increased WSS and thus reduced the encrustation rate at side-holes. A further improvement in performance was achieved by using side-holes with a triangular shape; notably, a 45° vertex angle showed superior performance compared to other angles investigated, resulting in a significant increase in WSS within inactive side-holes. In conclusion, combining the optimal stent thickness (0.3 mm) and hole vertex angle (45°) resulted in a ∼90% reduction in encrustation rate within side-holes, compared to a standard design. If translated to a full-scale ureteric stent, this optimised architecture has the potential for significantly increasing the stent lifetime while reducing clinical complications.","authors":[{"name":"A Mosayyebi"},{"name":"D Lange"},{"name":"Q Yann Yue"},{"name":"B K Somani"},{"name":"X Zhang"},{"name":"C Manes"},{"name":"D Carugo"}],"keywords":[]},"article395":{"pmid":"30867835","title":"Real-Time Monitoring of Pharmacokinetics of Antibiotics in Biofilms with Raman-Tagged Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy.","abs":"Antibiotics resistance developed by biofilms has posed a clinical challenge in the effective treatment of bacterial infections.

Biofilms formed were stained and the percentage of extracellular polysaccharide (%EPS) and thickness were determined by CLSM. Biofilm formed in the presence of sucrose and sucrose + maltodextrin presented similar %EPS and higher than DDW and maltodextrin. Regarding to the biofilm thickness, sucrose and sucrose + maltodextrin treatments were thicker than DDW and maltodextrin and similar between them.

We found that iron restriction renders hypersensitivity to multidrug-resistant MTB strains against first-line anti-TB drugs. To decipher the effect of iron restriction on possible mechanisms of chemosensitization and altered cellular circuitry governing drug resistance and virulence of MTB, we explored MTB cellular architecture. We could identify non-intact cell envelope, tampered MTB morphology and diminished mycolic acid under iron restricted MDR-MTB cells. Deeper exploration unraveled altered lipidome profile observed through conventional TLC and advanced mass spectrometry-based LC-ESI-MS techniques. Lipidome analysis not only depicted profound alterations of various lipid classes which are crucial for pathogenecity but also exposed leads such as indispensability of iron to sustain metabolic, genotoxic and oxidative stresses. Furthermore, iron deprivation led to inhibited biofilm formation and capacity of MTB to adhere buccal epithelial cells. Lastly, we demonstrated enhanced survival of Mycobacterium-infected Caenorhabditis elegans model under iron limitation.

To report a case series of membrane formation on intraocular lenses (IOLs) after uneventful phacoemulsification and to evaluate the material characteristics and biofilm formation on different IOLs. Methods. Ten eyes implanted with the same type of IOLs were found to have membranes on their IOLs after uneventful phacoemulsification from May 2015 to May 2016. No other patients were found with the same phenomenon among 11236 patients who underwent cataract surgeries during this period. To further investigate the reasons for their formation, we assessed seven types of IOLs used in our hospital, including their material characteristics and the presence of microbes (Staphylococcus epidermidis) on the IOL surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All IOLs were incubated under in vitro flow conditions (BioFlux 1000Z). After 36 h, the IOLs were taken from the system, and both the bound bacteria and biofilm formation were observed. Results. Five eyes underwent intravitreal injections of ceftazidime and norvancomycin with one positive culture obtained from the anterior chamber fluid. The other five eyes only received topical treatment of gatifloxacin/levofloxacin and tobramycin. At the last follow-up, all patients had best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/50 or better.

Human SAP bound to fungi that expressed functional cell surface amyloid, but SAP had minimal binding to fungi with reduced expression of cell surface amyloid. In the absence of SAP, phagocytosis of fungi by human macrophages was potentiated by expression of amyloid on the fungi. SAP binding to fungi inhibited their phagocytosis by macrophages. Macrophages pretreated with SAP displayed reduced fungal phagocytosis, reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α), and increased secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

Our results showed that baicalin significantly inhibited the QS via decreasing the AI-2 secretion, biofilm formation, and the expression of virulence genes of APEC such as LsrB, LsrK, LuxS, pfs, H-NS, fimA, fimB, fyuA, csgA, csgB, and rpoS. Moreover, baicalin significantly attenuated the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the adhesion of APEC to chicken type II pneumocytes to reduce cell damage. Furthermore, baicalin also inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB activation. Thus, our data revealed that baicalin could interfere with the quorum sensing, biofilm formation and virulence genes expression to relieve the APEC pathogenicity. Additionally, baicalin decreased the inflammatory responses of chicken type II pneumocytes induced by APEC. Taken together, these data provide a novel potential pharmaco-therapeutic approach to chicken colibacillosis.","authors":[{"name":"Lu-Yuan Peng"},{"name":"Meng Yuan"},{"name":"Zong-Mei Wu"},{"name":"Ke Song"},{"name":"Chun-Lei Zhang"},{"name":"Qiang An"},{"name":"Fang Xia"},{"name":"Jia-Lin Yu"},{"name":"Peng-Fei Yi"},{"name":"Ben-Dong Fu"},{"name":"Hai-Qing Shen"}],"keywords":[]},"article434":{"pmid":"30858304","title":"σ","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains are able to produce at least two distinct types of biofilm matrixes: biofilm matrixes made of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) or poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), whose synthesis is mediated by the icaADBC locus, and biofilm matrixes built of proteins (polysaccharide independent). σ","authors":[{"name":"Jaione Valle"},{"name":"Maite Echeverz"},{"name":"Iñigo Lasa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"PNAG"},{"word":"SigB"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"ica operon"}]},"article435":{"pmid":"30858293","title":"Comparative Analysis of Ionic Strength Tolerance between Freshwater and Marine Caulobacterales Adhesins.","abs":"Bacterial adhesion is affected by environmental factors, such as ionic strength, pH, temperature, and shear forces. Therefore, marine bacteria must have developed adhesins with different compositions and structures than those of their freshwater counterparts to adapt to their natural environment. The dimorphic alphaproteobacterium Hirschia baltica is a marine budding bacterium in the clade CaulobacteralesH. baltica uses a polar adhesin, the holdfast, located at the cell pole opposite the reproductive stalk, for surface attachment and cell-cell adhesion. The holdfast adhesin has been best characterized in Caulobacter crescentus, a freshwater member of the Caulobacterales, and little is known about holdfast compositions and properties in marine Caulobacterales Here, we use H. baltica as a model to characterize holdfast properties in marine Caulobacterales We show that freshwater and marine Caulobacterales use similar genes in holdfast biogenesis and that these genes are highly conserved among the species in the two genera. We determine that H. baltica produces a larger holdfast than C. crescentus and that the holdfasts have different chemical compositions, as they contain N-acetylglucosamine and galactose monosaccharide residues and proteins but lack DNA. Finally, we show that H. baltica holdfasts tolerate higher ionic strength than those of C. crescentus We conclude that marine Caulobacterales holdfasts have physicochemical properties that maximize binding in high-ionic-strength environments.","authors":[{"name":"Nelson K Chepkwony"},{"name":"Cécile Berne"},{"name":"Yves V Brun"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Hirschia baltica"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"bacterial adhesin"},{"word":"holdfast"},{"word":"ionic strength"},{"word":"marine Caulobacterales"},{"word":"polysaccharides"}]},"article436":{"pmid":"30858288","title":"Extended Experience in the Use of Antibiotic Lock for Eradication of Biofilm Bacteria on Tenckhoff Catheter.","abs":"Whilst antibiotic lock is effective to eradicate biofilm bacteria on hemodialysis catheters, this adjunctive method has scarcely been tested in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. After our previous successful experience of its use to salvage two Tenckhoff catheters, we encountered another patient with problematic biofilm-associated PD peritonitis who strongly refused catheter removal. As a result, antibiotic lock was given once daily, initially, with continuation of the usual PD schedule. However, relapsing peritonitis could not be prevented until we administered antibiotic lock without dialysate in the abdomen, which led to successful eradication of biofilm bacteria. To investigate the significance of having dry abdomen during antibiotic lock treatment, we injected an equivalent amount of contrast into the Tenckhoff catheter under fluoroscopy. We observed that the catheter lock solution could be retained over a long period of time only with dry abdomen, whereas rapid dissipation of the lock solution occurred in the presence of dialysate. We concluded that whilst antibiotic lock in a once-daily regimen can be highly effective against biofilm bacteria on a Tenckhoff catheter, it is essential to withhold PD exchanges during the dwell of antibiotic lock to prevent it from dissolving into the surrounding dialysate.","authors":[{"name":"Steve S Wong"},{"name":"Wai-Yan Lau"},{"name":"Ping-Kwan Chan"},{"name":"Ching-Kit Wan"},{"name":"Yuk-Lun Cheng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Catheter infection"},{"word":"peritoneal dialysis"}]},"article437":{"pmid":"30858215","title":"Efficacy of Aminomethyl Spectinomycins against Complex Upper Respiratory Tract Bacterial Infections.","abs":"The most frequent ailment for which antibiotics are prescribed is otitis media (ear infections), which is most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae Treatment of otitis media is complicated by the fact that the bacteria in the middle ear typically form biofilms, which can be recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, bacterial respiratory infections can be greatly exacerbated by viral coinfection, which is particularly evidenced by the synergy between influenza and S. pneumoniae In this study, we sought to ascertain the in vivo efficacy of aminomethyl spectinomycin lead 1950, an effective antibacterial agent both in vitro and in vivo against Streptococcus pneumoniae in the context of complex respiratory infections and acute otitis media. A single dose of 1950 significantly reduced bacterial burden in the respiratory tract for all three pathogens, even when species were present in a coinfection model. Additionally, a single dose of 1950 effectively reduced pneumococcal acute otitis media from the middle ear. The agent 1950 also proved efficacious in the context of influenza-pneumococcal super infection. These data further support the development of this family of compounds as potential therapeutic agents against the common causes of complex upper respiratory tract infections and acute otitis media.","authors":[{"name":"Amy Iverson"},{"name":"Christopher J Meyer"},{"name":"Peter Vogel"},{"name":"Samanthi Waidyarachchi"},{"name":"Nisha Das"},{"name":"David F Bruhn"},{"name":"Aaron Poole"},{"name":"Michelle M Butler"},{"name":"Terry L Bowlin"},{"name":"Richard E Lee"},{"name":"Jason W Rosch"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"Streptococcus pneumoniae"},{"word":"otitis media"}]},"article438":{"pmid":"30858210","title":"Analysis of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aminoglycoside Differential Resistomes Allows Defining Genes Simultaneously Involved in Intrinsic Antibiotic Resistance and Virulence.","abs":"High-throughput screening of transposon insertion libraries is a useful strategy for unveiling bacterial genes whose inactivation results in an altered susceptibility to antibiotics. A potential drawback of these studies is they are usually based on just one model antibiotic for each structural family, under the assumption that the results can be extrapolated to all members of said family. To determine if this simplification is appropriate, we have analyzed the susceptibility of mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to four aminoglycosides. Our results indicate that each mutation produces different effects on susceptibility to the tested aminoglycosides, with only two mutants showing similar changes in the susceptibility to all studied aminoglycosides. This indicates that the role of a particular gene in the resistome of a given antibiotic should not be generalized to other members of the same structural family. Five aminoglycoside-hypersusceptible mutants inactivating glnD, hflK, PA2798, PA3016, and hpf were chosen for further analysis in order to elucidate if lower aminoglycoside susceptibility correlates with cross-hypersusceptibility to other antibiotics and with impaired virulence. Our results indicate that glnD inactivation leads to increased cross-susceptibility to different antibiotics. The mutant in this gene is strongly impaired in virulence traits such as pyocyanin production, biofilm formation, elastase activity, and swarming motility and the ability to kill Caenorhabditis elegans Thus, GlnD might be an interesting target for developing antibiotic coadjuvants with antiresistance and antivirulence properties against P. aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Fernando Sanz-García"},{"name":"Carolina Alvarez-Ortega"},{"name":"Jorge Olivares-Pacheco"},{"name":"Paula Blanco"},{"name":"José Luis Martínez"},{"name":"Sara Hernando-Amado"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"adjuvants"},{"word":"intrinsic resistome"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article439":{"pmid":"30858201","title":"A Novel Small Molecule, ZY354, Inhibits Dental Caries-Associated Oral Biofilms.","abs":"Biofilm control is a critical approach to the better management of dental caries. Antimicrobial small molecules have shown their potential in the disruption of oral biofilm and control of dental caries. The objectives of this study were to examine the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of a newly designed small-molecule compound, ZY354. ZY354 was synthesized, and its cytotoxicity was evaluated in human oral keratinocytes (HOK), human gingival epithelial cells (HGE), and macrophages (RAW) by CCK-8 assays. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), minimum biofilm inhibition concentrations (MBICs), and minimum biofilm reduction concentrations (MBRCs) of ZY354 against common oral streptococci (i.e., Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguinis) were determined by microdilution method. The exopolysaccharide (EPS)/bacterium ratio and the dead/live bacterium ratio in the ZY354-treated multispecies biofilms were determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and the microbial composition was visualized and quantified by fluorescent in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The demineralizing activity of ZY354-treated biofilms was evaluated by transverse microradiography. The results showed that ZY354 exhibited low cytotoxicity in HOK, HGE, and RAW cells and exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against common oral streptococci. The EPS and the abundance of S. mutans were significantly reduced after ZY354 treatment, along with an increased dead/live microbial ratio in multispecies biofilms compared to the level with the nontreated control. The ZY354-treated multispecies biofilms exhibited reduced demineralizing activity at the biofilm/enamel interface. In conclusion, the small-molecule compound ZY354 exhibits low cytotoxicity and remarkable antimicrobial activity against oral streptococci, and it may have a great potential in anticaries clinical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Chenzi Zhang"},{"name":"Xinyi Kuang"},{"name":"Yuanzheng Zhou"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Qiang Guo"},{"name":"Tao Yang"},{"name":"Xuedong Zhou"},{"name":"Youfu Luo"},{"name":"Xin Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"ZY354"},{"word":"antimicrobial small molecule"},{"word":"caries management"},{"word":"cytotoxicity"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"oral biofilm"}]}}
