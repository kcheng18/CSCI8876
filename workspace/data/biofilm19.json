In this study, we demonstrated that Methylobacterium populi P-1M, an isolate from a pink-pigmented household biofilm, produced two AHLs, C14:1-HSL as a predominant product and 3OHC14-HSL as a minor product. The complete genome sequence of M. populi P-1M revealed the presence of genes that are predicted to encode an AHL synthase (mpoI) and AHL receptor (mpoR). M. populi P-1M formed a pellicle-like biofilm, which had a flat surface and was easily removable. In contrast, biofilms formed by mpoI and/or mpoR deletion mutants had a wavy surface structure and strongly adhered to the glass tube. When C14:1-HSL was added to the mpoI mutant culture, the biofilm structure resembled that of the wild-type strain. These results demonstrated that the structure and adhesion strength of M. populi P-1M biofilms are determined in part by AHL-mediated quorum sensing.","authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Morohoshi"},{"name":"Xiaonan Xie"},{"name":"Tsukasa Ikeda"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Methylobacterium"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"acylhomoserine lactone"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"30200616","title":"Role of Ttca of Citrobacter Werkmanii in Bacterial Growth, Biocides Resistance, Biofilm Formation and Swimming Motility.","abs":"To screen, identify and study the genes involved in isothiazolone resistance and biofilm formation in Citrobacter werkmanii strain BF-6.

This study developed a method for the determination of elastic properties of biofilms by modelling the biofilm deformation recorded by OCT imaging with poroelastic fluid-structure interaction computations. Two-dimensional biofilm geometries were extracted from OCT scans of non-deformed and deformed structures as a result of hydrodynamic loading. The biofilm geometries were implemented in a model coupling fluid dynamics with elastic solid mechanics and Darcy flow in the biofilm. The simulation results were compared with real deformed geometries and a fitting procedure allowed estimation of the Young's modulus in given flow conditions. The present method considerably improves the estimation of elastic moduli of biofilms grown in mini-fluidic rectangular channels. This superior prediction is based on the relaxation of several simplifying assumptions made in past studies: shear stress is not anymore taken constant over the biofilm surface, total stress including also pressure is accounted for, any biofilm shape can be used in the determinations, and non-linear behavior of mechanical properties can be estimated. Biofilm elastic moduli between 70 and 700 Pa were obtained and biofilm hardening at large applied stress due to increasing flow velocity was quantified.

S. epidermidis has become one of the most common causes of primary bacteremia. Infections are difficult to diagnose because the pathogen has natural niches on human skin and the ability to adhere to inanimate surfaces via biofilms. Alarmingly, S. epidermidis has acquired resistance to many antibiotics, which presents a danger to human health. Known as methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), most clinical isolates of MRSE in North America exhibit β-lactam resistance primarily due to the presence of mecA, a gene that bestows β-lactam antibiotic resistance in a manner similar to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MecA encodes for expression of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which is absent in β-lactam susceptible strains of S. epidermidis. We can disable this resistance factor in MRSE with 600-Da branched polyethylenimine (BPEI). Cationic BPEI targets anionic wall teichoic acid (WTA), an essential cofactor for proper functioning of PBP2a. We found that BPEI synergizes the activity of β-lactam antibiotics against MRSE.

Colony biofilms originate from one or more cells that, through growth and division, develop a complicated three-dimensional structure consisting of aerial parts, agar-embedded invasive parts and a central cavity, filled with extracellular matrix. In contrast, flocs arise relatively quickly by aggregation of planktonic cells growing in liquid cultures after they reach the appropriate growth phase and/or exhaust nutrients such as glucose. Creation of both types of structures is dependent on the presence of flocculins: Flo11p in the former case and Flo1p in the latter. We recently showed that formation of both types of structures by wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BR-F is regulated via transcription regulators Tup1p and Cyc8p, but in a divergent manner. Biofilm formation is regulated by Cyc8p and Tup1p antagonistically: Cyc8p functions as a repressor of FLO11 gene expression and biofilm formation, whereas Tup1p counteracts the Cyc8p repressor function and positively regulates biofilm formation and Flo11p expression. In addition, Tup1p stabilizes Flo11p probably by repressing a gene coding for a cell wall or extracellular protease that is involved in Flo11p degradation. In contrast, formation of BR-F flocs is co-repressed by the Cyc8p-Tup1p complex. These findings point to different mechanisms involved in yeast multicellularity.","authors":[{"name":"Libuše Váchová"},{"name":"Zdena Palková"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adhesion and invasion"},{"word":"Colony biofilm"},{"word":"Cyc8p and Tup1p"},{"word":"Flocculation"},{"word":"Yeast multicellular structures"}]},"article34":{"pmid":"30190570","title":"Novel Imidazole and Methoxybenzylamine Growth Inhibitors Affecting Salmonella Cell Envelope Integrity and its Persistence in Chickens.","abs":"The control of Salmonella from farm to fork is challenging due to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant isolates and the limited effects of current control methods.

Eleven out of the ninety-four P. aeruginosa isolates exhibited a biofilm-deficient phenotype. Two biofilm-deficient isolates, one from blood and the one from pleural effusion, appeared to carry a same mutation in lasR. These two isolates differed in the ability to produce QS-regulated virulence factors, but contained the same functionally deficient LasR with the truncated C-terminal domains and belonged to the same multilocus sequence type (ST227). Chromosomal lasR complementation in these lasR mutants verified that lasR inactivation was the sole cause of las deficiency.

The lack of efficient technologies to remove ECs from residual waters contributes for their appearance in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS). Therefore, sessile microorganisms on DWDS pipes are continuously exposed to trace concentrations of ECs. However, no data exists on the role of ECs on the resident microbiota. The present work aims to understand the effects of prolonged exposure of a bacterial strain of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, isolated from a DWDS, in both planktonic and biofilm states, to trace concentrations of selected ECs (antipyrine-ANTP; diclofenac sodium salt-DCF; ibuprofen-IBP; galaxolide-GAL; tonalide-TON; carbamazepine-CBZ; clofibric acid-CA; tylosin-TY) on its tolerance to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and resistance to antibiotics. Pre-established S. maltophilia biofilms were exposed to ECs for 26 d. Subsequently, the planktonic behaviour of the biofilm cells grown in the presence of ECS was characterized in terms of susceptibility to NaOCl and to selected antibiotics (levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Moreover, S.maltophilia was tested on its biofilm productivity in the presence of ECs (alone and mixed). These biofilms were challenged by NaOCl in order to assess the role of ECs on biofilm susceptibility. The results did not evidence remarkable effects of ECs on planktonic S. maltophilia susceptibility to NaOCl and antibiotics. However, S. maltophilia biofilm production and susceptibility to NaOCl was affected from ECs pre-exposure, particularly by the combination of different ECs (CA + CBZ, CA + IBP, CA + CBZ + IBP). S. maltophilia biofilms became more resistant to removal by NaOCl when developed in the presence of mixtures of CA + CBZ and CA + CBZ + IBP. Also, biofilm production was significantly affected. CA was present in all the combinations that altered biofilm behaviour. The overall results propose that exposure to ECs for 26 days had not a huge impact on S. maltophilia planktonic antimicrobial susceptibility. Nevertheless, the prolonged exposure to some ECs altered biofilm production and tolerance to NaOCl, with a potential practical outcome of hindering DWDS disinfection. The simultaneous presence of different ECs in the environment may amplify biofilm resilience.","authors":[{"name":"Inês B Gomes"},{"name":"Lúcia C Simões"},{"name":"Manuel Simões"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm control"},{"word":"Chlorine"},{"word":"Drinking water disinfection"},{"word":"Emerging contaminants"},{"word":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"}]},"article40":{"pmid":"30189320","title":"Quorum sensing molecules regulate epithelial cytokine response and biofilm-related virulence of three Prevotella species.","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) signaling regulates the motility, adhesion, and biofilm formation of bacteria, and at the same time activates immune response in eukaryotic organisms.

Essential Oil.","abs":"Anti-virulence strategies are being explored as a novel approach to combat pathogens. Such strategies include inhibition of surface adhesion, tissue invasion, toxin production, and/or interference with the gene regulation of other virulence traits. Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, is a facultative intracellular food pathogen characterized by a wide distribution in the environment. Its ability to persist within biofilms and to develop resistance to sanitizers is the cause of significant problems in food processing plants and of steep costs for the food industry. In humans, the treatment of listeriosis is hampered by the intracellular location of listeriae and the poor intracellular penetration of some antibiotics. Eleven L. monocytogenes isolates from patients who were diagnosed with invasive listeriosis in Italy in 2014-2016 were studied. This in vitro and in vivo study explored the antibacterial and anti-virulence properties of a steam-distilled essential oil of Cannabis sativa L., which is being intensively investigated for its high content in powerful bioactive phytochemicals. Susceptibility experiments demonstrated a moderate bactericidal activity of the essential oil (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration > 2048 μg/mL). Assessment of the effects of sublethal concentrations of the essential oil on L. monocytogenes virulence traits demonstrated a significant action on motility. Listeriae were non-motile after exposure to the essential oil. Light and scanning electron microscopy documented aggregates of listeriae with the flagella trapped inside the cluster. Real-time RT-PCR experiments showed downregulation of flagellar motility genes and of the regulatory gene prfA. The ability to form biofilm and to invade Caco-2 cells was also significantly reduced. Galleria mellonella larvae infected with L. monocytogenes grown in presence of sublethal concentrations of the essential oil showed much higher survival rates compared with controls, suggesting that the extract inhibited tissue invasion. Food contamination with L. monocytogenes is a major concern for the food industry, particularly for plants making ready-to-eat and processed food. The present work provides a baseline in the study of the anti-virulence properties of the C. sativa essential oil against L. monocytogenes. Further studies are needed to understand if it could be used as an alternative agent for the control of L. monocytogenes in food processing plants.","authors":[{"name":"Emanuela Marini"},{"name":"Gloria Magi"},{"name":"Gianna Ferretti"},{"name":"Tiziana Bacchetti"},{"name":"Angelica Giuliani"},{"name":"Armanda Pugnaloni"},{"name":"Maria Rita Rippo"},{"name":"Bruna Facinelli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cannabis sativa"},{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell invasion"},{"word":"essential oil"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"sublethal concentrations"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article51":{"pmid":"30186447","title":"Preliminary study on the effect of brazilin on biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"Biofilms significantly enhance antibiotic resistance by inhibiting penetration of antibiotics and are shielded from the immune system via the formation of an extracellular polymeric matrix.

In the current study, a biofilm model of Staphylococcus aureus was established in vitro to explore inhibitory effects of brazilin (BN) on biofilm formation and to evaluate damaging effects of BN in the presence and absence of vancomycin (VCM) on the biofilm. Antibiofilm-infection mechanisms of BN were observed. In these experiments, the clinical strain of S. aureus C-4-4 was isolated for biofilm formation. Crystal violet staining and fluorescence microscopy revealed that BN inhibited biofilm formation in vitro and the best effect was observed with two times the minimum inhibitory concentration of BN following 48 h incubation. Additionally, the results demonstrated that BN in combination with VCM enhanced the damage to biofilms, whereas VCM alone did not. The results of the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that BN downregulated gene expression of intercellular adhesion (ica)A and upregulated icaR and the quorum-sensing (QS) system regulator accessory gene regulator A. In summary, BN inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and destroyed biofilms, while simultaneously increasing permeability to VCM. BN was able to reduce production of the extracellular polymeric matrix and inhibited the QS system.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of curcumin against C. albicans (SC5314) was determined. Biofilm formation was quantified and the proteinase and phospholipase secretion was measured. The cytotoxicity was tested in oral fibroblast cells. A cocultured model was used to analyze the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-6) from host cells, as well SAP-1 and PLB-1 by RT-PCR. The MIC was between 6.25 and 12.5 µM, and the activity of proteinase enzyme was significantly decreased in biofilms treated with curcumin. However, proteinase gene expression was not downregulated after curcumin treatment. Furthermore, gene expressions of host inflammatory response, IL-1β and IL-1α, were significantly downregulated after exposure to curcumin. In conclusion, curcumin exhibited antifungal activity against C. albicans and modulated the proteolytic enzyme activities without downregulating the gene expression. In host inflammatory response, curcumin downregulated IL-1β and IL-1α gene expression.","authors":[{"name":"Emily Chen"},{"name":"Bruna Benso"},{"name":"Dalia Seleem"},{"name":"Luiz Eduardo Nunes Ferreira"},{"name":"Silvana Pasetto"},{"name":"Vanessa Pardi"},{"name":"Ramiro Mendonça Murata"}],"keywords":[]},"article53":{"pmid":"30186269","title":"Pseudomonas-Specific NGS Assay Provides Insight Into Abundance and Dynamics of Pseudomonas Species Including P. aeruginosa in a Cooling Tower.","abs":"Pseudomonas species are frequent inhabitants of freshwater environments and colonizers of water supply networks via bioadhesion and biofilm formation.

In the present study, an Illumina-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach using Pseudomonas-specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene was evaluated and applied to a set of freshwater samples from different environments including a cooling tower sampled monthly during 2 years. Our approach showed high in situ specificity and accuracy. NGS read counts revealed a precise quantification of P. aeruginosa and a good correlation with the absolute number of Pseudomonas genome copies in a validated genus-specific qPCR assay, demonstrating the ability of the NGS approach to determine both relative and absolute abundances of Pseudomonas species and P. aeruginosa. The characterization of Pseudomonas communities in cooling tower water allowed us to identify 43 phylotypes, with P. aeruginosa being the most abundant. A shift existed within each year from a community dominated by phylotypes belonging to P. fluorescens and P. oleovorans phylogenetic groups to a community where P. aeruginosa was highly abundant. Co-occurrence was observed between P. aeruginosa and other phylotypes of P. aeruginosa group as well as the potentially pathogenic species P. stutzeri, but not with phylotypes of the P. fluorescens group, indicating the need to further investigate the metabolic networks and ecological traits of Pseudomonas species.

Coumarin inhibited QS in the P. aeruginosa QSIS2 biosensor strain, reduced protease and pyocyanin production, and inhibited biofilm formation in microtiter plates in different P. aeruginosa strains. The effects of coumarin in inhibiting biofilm formation in an in vitro wound model and reducing P. aeruginosa virulence in the Lucilia sericata infection model were strain-dependent. Transcriptome analysis revealed that several key genes involved in the las, rhl, Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), and integrated QS (IQS) systems were downregulated in coumarin-treated biofilms of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Coumarin also changed the expression of genes related to type III secretion and cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) metabolism.

Especially, utility of fosfomycin has being evaluated with particular interest to treat chronic biofilm infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa because it often encounters anaerobic situations. Here, we showed that P. aeruginosa PAO1, commonly used in many laboratories, becomes more susceptible to fosfomycin when grown anaerobically, and studied on how fosfomycin increases its activity under anaerobic conditions. Results of transport assay and gene expression study indicated that PAO1 cells grown anaerobically exhibit a higher expression of glpT encoding a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter which is responsible for fosfomycin uptake, then lead to increased intracellular accumulation of the drug. Elevated expression of glpT in anaerobic cultures depended on ANR, a transcriptional regulator that is activated under anaerobic conditions. Purified ANR protein bound to the DNA fragment from glpT region upstream, suggesting it is an activator of glpT gene expression. We found that increased susceptibility to fosfomycin was also observed in a clinical isolate which has a promoted biofilm phenotype and its glpT and anr genes are highly conserved with those of PAO1. We conclude that increased antibacterial activity of fosfomycin to P. aeruginosa under anaerobic conditions is attributed to elevated expression of GlpT following activation of ANR, then leads to increased uptake of the drug.","authors":[{"name":"Hidetada Hirakawa"},{"name":"Kumiko Kurabayashi"},{"name":"Koichi Tanimoto"},{"name":"Haruyoshi Tomita"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anaerobiosis"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance (AMR)"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"fosfomycin"},{"word":"multi-drug resistance (MDR)"}]},"article56":{"pmid":"30186252","title":"Genetic and Phenotypic Characterization of Indole-Producing Isolates of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae Obtained From Chilean Kiwifruit Orchards.","abs":"In recent years, Chilean kiwifruit production has been affected by the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), which has caused losses to the industry.

In this sense, the identification of the relationships between aggregation, the mechanisms of action and the effectiveness against microorganisms, as well as the establishment of the means and the formulations that may favor the most effective mechanisms, are essential. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the in vitro aPDT efficacies against Candida albicans, by using MB in vehicles which may influence the aggregation and present an oral formulation (OF) containing MB, to be used in clinical aPDT procedures. The efficacy of MB at 20 mg L-1 was tested in a range of vehicles (water, physiological solution - NaCl 0.9%, phosphate saline buffer - PBS, sodium dodecyl sulfate 0.25% - SDS and urea 1 mol L-1) in a C. albicans planktonic culture, when using 4.68 J cm-2 of 640 ± 12 nm LED for the irradiations, as well as 5 minutes of pre-irradiation time, together with measuring the UFC mL-1. Based upon these analyses, an OF containing MB in the most effective vehicle was tested in the biofilms, as a proposal for clinical applications. When comparing some of the vehicles, sodium dodecyl sulfate was the only one that enhanced an MB aPDT efficacy in a planktonic C. albicans culture. This OF was tested in the biofilms and 50 mg L-1 MB was necessary, in order to achieve some reduction in the cell viabilities after the various treatments.

Sutures strongly contribute to development of surgical site infections as they are considered foreign material in the human body. Sutures serve as excellent surfaces for microbial adherence and subsequent colonization, biofilm formation and infection on the site of a surgery. Various antimicrobial sutures have been developed to prevent suture-mediated surgical site infection. However, depending on the site of surgery, antimicrobial sutures may remain ineffective, and antimicrobial agents on them might have drawbacks. Plasma, defined as the fourth state of matter, composed of ionized gas, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, free radical and neutrals, draws attention for the control and prevention of hospital-acquired infections due to its excellent antimicrobial activities. In the present study, the efficacy of non-thermal atmospheric plasma treatment for prevention of surgical site infections was investigated. First, contaminated poly (glycolic-co-lactic acid), polyglycolic acid, polydioxanone and poly (glycolic acid-co-caprolactone) sutures were treated with non-thermal atmospheric plasma to eradicate contaminating bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Moreover, sutures were pre-treated with non-thermal atmospheric plasma and then exposed to S. aureus and E. coli. Our results revealed that non-thermal atmospheric plasma treatment effectively eradicates contaminating bacteria on sutures, and non-thermal atmospheric plasma pre-treatment effectively prevents bacterial colonization on sutures without altering their mechanical properties. Chemical characterization of sutures was performed with FT-IR and XPS and results showed that non-thermal atmospheric plasma treatment substantially increased the hydrophilicity of sutures which might be the primary mechanism for the prevention of bacterial colonization. In conclusion, plasma-treated sutures could be considered as novel alternative materials for the control and prevention of surgical site infections.","authors":[{"name":"Utku Kürşat Ercan"},{"name":"Fatma İbiş"},{"name":"Caner Dikyol"},{"name":"Nesrin Horzum"},{"name":"Ozan Karaman"},{"name":"Çağla Yıldırım"},{"name":"Elif Çukur"},{"name":"Emine Afra Demirci"}],"keywords":[]},"article67":{"pmid":"30183351","title":"Multidrug Resistance, Biofilm Formation, and Virulence of Escherichia coli Isolates from Commercial Meat and Vegetable Products.","abs":"Escherichia coli is an important food safety and public health concern because of its pathogenicity and potential for antimicrobial resistance.

Among the 709 samples of minced meat and fresh vegetable products tested, 18.6% were positive for E. coli. One hundred nine (29.2%) out of 383 E. coli isolates were resistant to 1 or more of the 25 tested antimicrobials. Among the isolates from minced pork, the highest rate of resistance was observed for tetracycline (52.8%), followed by ampicillin (41.6%). The highest resistance rates against tetracycline were coincident with the high amount of tetracycline sold for veterinary use. Because penicillin is the most frequently used antimicrobial in humans, with 4.52 defined daily doses per 1000 people per day, the high rate of resistance to ampicillin (41.6%) supported the potential risk of E. coli food contaminants. However, only 1.3% of the isolates possessed the virulence genes commonly involved in foodborne outbreaks of E. coli. Sixty-seven isolates (17.5%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR), and the highest MDR was observed against 14 antimicrobials. Most of the MDR E. coli isolates showed biofilm-forming ability.

Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and their exopolysaccharides (EPS) showed profound effects on plant growth and drought tolerance. Reactions of bacteria to drought stress at various organizational levels are different which depends on intensity of stress, duration, species, and growth stage. PGPR could be effectively utilized in developing strategies to facilitate water conservation strategies of plants. They have the ability to improve plant growth directly by enhancing level of phytohormones, siderophore, biofilm, and exopolysaccharides production and by increasing the nutrient availability in the rhizosphere or indirectly by protecting plants from pathogen attack. EPS producing bacteria are capable to maintain higher soil moisture content and growth of plants even under severe dried sandy soils. The evidence of survival of rhizobacteria under low moisture content obtained from the fact of rhizobacterial occurrence in the soil of desert and effective nodule formation in desert soil. Beside this, EPS produced by PGPR form rhizosheath around the roots and thus protect the plant roots from desiccation for a longer period of time. Important role exhibited by exopolysaccharides includes, protection from desiccation, microbial aggregation, plant-microbe interaction, surface attachment, bioremediation and its use by many industries for stabilizing, thickening, coagulating, gelling, suspending and for film forming. Plants inoculated with EPS-producing bacteria showed higher accumulation of proline, sugars, and free amino acids under water deficit stress. Biofilms formed by the PGPR around the roots are made up of bacterial populations or bacterial communities that encased inside the polymeric extracellular matrix formed by bacteria itself, they adhered to the external surfaces that contain sufficient moisture. It is concluded that the application of PGPR in combination with their EPS is a promising measure to combat drought stress thus, increasing global food security.","authors":[{"name":"Hafsa Naseem"},{"name":"Muhammad Ahsan"},{"name":"Muhammad A Shahid"},{"name":"Naeem Khan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"PGPR"},{"word":"drought"},{"word":"water conservation"}]},"article70":{"pmid":"30182831","title":"Isolation, Purification and Characterisation of a D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine Specific Lectin from Marine Sponge Fasciospongia cavernosa.","abs":"Marine sponges, belonging to the phylum Porifera, are gaining more attention by researchers and industrial sectors from all over the world due to their ability to produce a variety of bioactive secondary metabolites that have many applications including drug discovery.

We found that Hp1174 (glucose/galactose transporter [gluP]), an efflux pump of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), is highly expressed in biofilm-forming and multidrug-resistant (MDR) H. pylori strains and is upregulated by SpoT.

Therefore, oxygen microprofiles and confocal images for bio-nest as well as functional groups for biofilm-attached BF were performed on microsensor systems, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). Despite COD:N ratio, both reactors removed about 90% of COD, while only RBF reactor achieved high denitrification capabilities, with nitrogen removal efficiencies varying between 60.10 ± 0.45% and 82.07 ± 0.64%. Microprofile and confocal images showed that dissolved oxygen could reach the core with depth up to 50 mm, at which viable bacteria were detected. Characteristic peaks on FT-IR spectrum demonstrated that various functional groups of polysaccharide and proteins in EPS played a key role in aggregating biofilm-attached BFs into a bio-nest.

Based on these results an acute (7 day) in-situ exposures (500 μg/l) were then performed and impacts to the mesocosm systems monitored for 1 month via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) alongside chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates and a range of water quality, and hydrological parameters. Despite the clear potential for negative impacts to microbial function from both compounds observed at 100 μg/l in the ex-situ dose-response test, no impacts were observed for the 500 μg/l in-situ exposure in the VSSF mesocosms. COD removal, water chemistry, plant health, and hydrological parameters did not significantly change in response to the in-situ exposure. In terms of fate, the removal efficiency for both TCL and SMX was high (>80%) after 1 h and complete removal (>99.7%) was observed after 168 h. Following the in-situ exposure, and subsequent one month effects-monitoring period, the mesocosms were decommissioned with the media biofilm spatially assessed for organic content as well as TCL and SMX concentrations. TCL and SMX were found to have persisted in the media and demonstrated spatial variation with an overall 2-20% and 5-6% recovered respectively.

Pseudomonas putida KT2440 harboring an antibiotic resistance plasmid RP4 was chosen as the donor while Escherichia coli and activated sludge bacteria were used as the recipient cells. Dynamic features of the transfer process, including the transfer rate, cell growth rate and kinetic changes of the transfer frequency, were determined. It was found that the routes for gene transfer strongly depend on the structure and composition of a biofilm. While intraspecies HGT is essential to initiate a transfer event, the secondary retransfer from transconjugants to the same species is more efficient and can cause cascading gene spread in single-strain biofilms. For the activated sludge biofilm, only small and scattered colonies formed and vertical gene transfer appears to be the dominant route after initial intraspecies transfer. Furthermore, more than 46% of genera in the activated sludge were permissive to plasmid RP4, many of which are associated with human pathogens. These phenomena imply early prevention and interruptions to biofilm structure could provide an effect way to inhibit rapid antibiotic resistance gene spread and reduce the likelihood of catastrophic events associated with antibiotic resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Bing Li"},{"name":"Yong Qiu"},{"name":"Jing Zhang"},{"name":"Xia Huang"},{"name":"Hanchang Shi"},{"name":"Huabing Yin"}],"keywords":[]},"article91":{"pmid":"30179253","title":"Organic matter and nutrient inputs from large wildlife influence ecosystem function in the Mara River, Africa.","abs":"Animals can be important vectors for the movement of resources across ecosystem boundaries.

We studied the influence of hippopotamus excretion/egestion and wildebeest carcasses, and their interactions with discharge, in the Mara River, Kenya. We measured nutrient dissolution and decomposition rates of wildlife inputs, the influence of inputs on nutrient concentrations and nutrient limitation in the river and the influence of inputs on biofilm growth and function in both experimental streams and along a gradient of inputs in the river. We found that hippopotamus excretion/egestion increases ammonium and coarse particulate organic matter in the river, and wildebeest carcasses increase ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus, and total phosphorus. Concentrations of dissolved carbon and nutrients in the water column increased along a gradient of wildlife inputs and during low discharge, although concentrations of particulate carbon decreased during low discharge due to deposition on the river bottom. Autotrophs were nitrogen limited and heterotrophs were carbon limited and nitrogen and phosphorus colimited upstream of animal inputs but there was no nutrient limitation downstream of inputs. In experimental streams, hippo and wildebeest inputs together increased biofilm gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R). These results differed in the river, where low concentrations of hippo inputs increased gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) of biofilms, but high concentrations of hippo inputs in conjunction with wildebeest inputs decreased GPP. Our research shows that inputs from large wildlife alleviate nutrient limitation and stimulate ecosystem metabolism in the Mara River and that the extent to which these inputs subsidize the ecosystem is mediated by the quantity and quality of inputs and discharge of the river ecosystem. Thus, animal inputs provide an important ecological subsidy to this river, and animal inputs were likely important in many other rivers prior to the widespread extirpation of large wildlife.","authors":[{"name":"Amanda L Subalusky"},{"name":"Christopher L Dutton"},{"name":"Laban Njoroge"},{"name":"Emma J Rosi"},{"name":"David M Post"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem"},{"word":"carcass"},{"word":"discharge"},{"word":"ecosystem function"},{"word":"egestion"},{"word":"excretion"},{"word":"hippopotamus"},{"word":"productivity"},{"word":"river"},{"word":"stoichiometry"},{"word":"subsidy"},{"word":"wildebeest"}]},"article92":{"pmid":"30178559","title":"Biofilms and their properties.","abs":"Bacteria within the oral cavity live primarily as complex, polymicrobial biofilms.

Besides the established routines of regular toothbrushing with fluoride products, there is an opportunity for additional technologies, based on ecological principles, to address and modify the oral biofilm. Methods to reduce dietary sugar intake, slow down plaque metabolism, and support saliva functions should be further developed and investigated in terms of efficacy, compliance, and cost-effectiveness.

The comparative gene expression profile of wild and mutant strains was determined on the basis of De-Seq transcriptomic analysis, which showed that the cas9 gene is involved in enhancing virulence. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that multiple pathways were involved in virulence, regulated by the CRISPR-cas9 system.

Exogenous N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone could remedy the electricity production by lasIrhlI mutants to a level similar to wild-type strains while signaling molecules had little effect on wild-type bacteria in MFCs. Meanwhile, experiments with the wild-type and pqsA, pqsL mutants indicated that the overexpression of PQS signaling molecules made no significant contribution to EET.

As certain amount of biofilm growth is required for efficient use of biofilms, the ability to control and maintain biofilms at desired thickness is vital. To this end, we developed synthetic gene circuits to control E. coli MG1655 biofilm formation by using CRISPRi/dCas9 to regulate a gene (wcaF) involved in the synthesis of colanic acid (CA), a key polysaccharide in E. coli biofilm extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). We showed that the biofilm formation was inhibited when wcaF was repressed and the biofilms could be maintained at a different thickness over a period of time. We also demonstrated that it is also possible to control the biofilm thickness spatially by inhibiting wcaF gene using a genetic light switch.

In this study, positively charged chitosan nanoparticles (CSNP) loaded with oxacillin (Oxa) and Deoxyribonuclease I (CSNP-DNase-Oxa) were fabricated.

This study evaluated how biofilm compression driven by permeate flow increases the hydraulic resistance and leads to reduction in permeate flux. We analysed the effect of biofilm compression on hydraulic resistance and permeate flux through computational models supported by experimental data. Biofilms with homogeneous surface structure were subjected to step-wise changes in flux and transmembrane pressure during compression and relaxation tests. Biofilm thickness under applied forces was measured non-invasively in-situ using optical coherence tomography (OCT). A numerical model of poroelasticity, which couples water flow through the biofilm with biofilm mechanics, was developed to correlate the structural deformation with biofilm hydraulics (permeability and resistance). The computational model enabled extracting mechanical and hydrological parameters corresponding to the experimental data. Homogeneous biofilms under elevated compression forces experienced a significant reduction in thickness while only a slight increase in resistance was observed. This shows that hydraulic resistance of homogeneous biofilms was affected more by permeability decrease due to pore closure than by a decrease in thickness. Both viscoelastic and elastoplastic models could describe well the permanent biofilm deformation. However, for biofilms under study, a simpler elastic model could also be used due to the small irreversible deformations. The elastic moduli fitting the measured data were in agreement with other reported values for biofilm under compression. Biofilm stiffening under larger flow-driven compression forces was observed and described numerically by correlating inversely the elastic modulus with biofilm porosity. The importance of this newly developed method lies in estimation of accurate biofilm mechanical parameters to be used in numerical models for both membrane filtration system and biofouling cleaning strategies. Such model can ultimately be used to identify optimal operating conditions for membrane system subjected to biofouling.","authors":[{"name":"Morez Jafari"},{"name":"Peter Desmond"},{"name":"Mark C M van Loosdrecht"},{"name":"Nicolas Derlon"},{"name":"Eberhard Morgenroth"},{"name":"Cristian Picioreanu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm compression"},{"word":"Elastic modulus"},{"word":"Fluid-structural model"},{"word":"Hydraulic resistance"},{"word":"Poroelasticity"}]},"article110":{"pmid":"30173066","title":"Fluidized granular activated carbon electrode for efficient microbial electrosynthesis of acetate from carbon dioxide.","abs":"The electricity-driven bioreduction of carbon dioxide to multi-carbon organic compounds, particularly acetate, has been achieved in microbial electrosynthesis (MES).

To address these issues, we isolated seven novel AOB strains from the arsenic-contaminated soils. They can completely oxidize 1.0 mM As(III) in 22-60 h. Their arsenite oxidase sequences show 43-99% identities to those of other known AOB. Strains Cug1, Cug2, Cug3, Cug4, and Cug6 are able to form biofilms with thickness of 15-95 µm, whereas Cug8 and Cug9 cannot form biofilms. It is interesting to see that arsenite inhibited the biofilm formations of heterotrophic AOB strains, but promoted the biofilm formations of autotrophic strains in a concentration-dependent manner. The arsenite-oxidizing rates of Cug1 and Cug4 biofilms are 31.6% and 27.6% lower than those of their suspension cultures, whereas the biofilm activities of other strains are similar to those of their suspension cultures. The biofilm formation significantly promoted the bacterial resistance to arsenic.

In addition, the biofilm-mode-of-growth of infecting bacteria impedes antimicrobial penetration in biofilms. Here, we report on poly(ethylene)glycol-poly(β-amino esters) (PEG-PAE) micelles with conjugated antimicrobials, that can uniquely penetrate biofilms, target themselves to bacterial cell surfaces once inside the low-pH environment of a biofilm and release conjugated antimicrobials through degradation of their ester-linkage with PAE by bacterial lipases. In vitro, PEG-PAE micelles with conjugated Triclosan (PEG-PAE-Triclosan) yielded no inadvertent leakage of their antimicrobial cargo and better killing of MDR Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and oral streptococcal biofilms than Triclosan in solution. In mice, PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles with conjugated Triclosan yielded better eradication efficacy towards a MDR S. aureus-infection compared with Triclosan in solution and Triclosan-loaded micelles at equal Triclosan-equivalent concentrations. Ex vivo exposure of multi-species oral biofilms collected from orthodontic patients to PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles, demonstrated effective bacterial killing at 30-40 fold lower Triclosan-equivalent concentrations than achieved by Triclosan in solution. Importantly, Streptococcus mutans, the main causative organism of dental caries, was preferentially killed by PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles. Thus PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles present a promising addendum to the decreasing armamentarium available to combat infection in diverse sites of the body. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: pH-adaptive polymeric micelles with conjugated antimicrobials can efficiently eradicate infectious biofilms from diverse body sites in mice and men. An antimicrobial was conjugated through an ester-linkage to a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)/poly(β-amino ester) block copolymer to create micellar nanocarriers. Stable micelle structures were formed by the hydrophobic poly(β-amino ester) inner core and a hydrophilic PEG outer shell. Thus formed PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles do not lose their antimicrobial cargo underway to an infection site through the blood circulation, but penetrate and accumulate in biofilms to release antimicrobials once inside a biofilm through degradation of its ester-linkage by bacterial lipases, to kill biofilm-embedded bacteria at lower antimicrobial concentrations than when applied in solution. PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles effectively eradicate biofilms of multi-drug-resistant pathogens and oral bacteria, most notably highly cariogenic Streptococcus mutans, in mice and men respectively, and possess excellent clinical translation possibilities.","authors":[{"name":"Yong Liu"},{"name":"Yijin Ren"},{"name":"Yuanfeng Li"},{"name":"Linzhu Su"},{"name":"Yumin Zhang"},{"name":"Fan Huang"},{"name":"Jinjian Liu"},{"name":"Jianfeng Liu"},{"name":"Theo G van Kooten"},{"name":"Yingli An"},{"name":"Linqi Shi"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Enzymatic pH-adaptive"},{"word":"Infection model"},{"word":"Multi-drug resistance"},{"word":"Polymeric micelle"}]},"article113":{"pmid":"30172303","title":"Versatile use of Azospirillum brasilense strains tagged with egfp and mCherry genes for the visualization of biofilms associated with wheat roots.","abs":"This study reports the introduction of egfp or mCherry markers to the Sp245, Sp7, and M40 wild-type strains of Azospirillum brasilense and the hhkB (encoding for a putative hybrid histidine kinase) minus mutant an isogenic strain of A. brasilense Sp245 to monitor colonization of wheat (Triticum aestivum).

The deletion of hfq resulted in a growth deficiency in medium containing 4.5% ethanol or 1% Triton X-100, and the growth of the mutant was significantly reduced at 4 °C. Furthermore, the hfq deletion dramatically decreased biofilm formation in BHI medium and gastric fluid medium, and reduced the invasion and replication rate into the Caco-2BBe cells and RAW264.7 cells. However, complementation restored the wild-type phenotype. Importantly, mouse infection experiments demonstrated that hfq played a more important role in the colonisation and virulence in serotype 4b strain Lm NTSN than in the serotype 1/2a strain Lm EGDe. Taken together, these results demonstrated that hfq is a novel factor associated with biofilm formation, and plays an essential role in the stress response and pathogenisis in serotype 4b strain Lm NTSN.

This study evaluated the physical and biological properties of a denture base acrylic resin after immersion in antiseptic soaps. Acrylic resin specimens were prepared and stored in distinct solutions for 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. The solutions were as follows: DW: distilled water at 37°C (control group); DS: cycles of daily immersion in Dettol soap for 8 hours at room temperature, followed by immersion in distilled water for 16 hours at 37°C; PS: cycles of daily immersion in Protex soap, as described for the previous group; LS: cycles of daily immersion in Lifebuoy soap, as described for the DS group. The parameters evaluated at each time point were the following: biofilm formation capacity by Candida albicans and reduction of preformed fungal biofilms, cytotoxicity, surface roughness, hardness, and color change. For the fungal adhesion phase, the type of soap had a statistically significant effect (p = 0.0292), but after 24 hours, no differences were found between solutions or between storage times. Regarding the efficacy of biofilm reduction, there was a significant difference when the groups were compared to each other (p = 0.014). Dettol and Lifebuoy eliminated the preformed biofilm on the specimens. Moreover, all the soaps were classified as non-cytotoxic (on HaCaT cell line) because there was no difference in cell viability between the different groups, except after 21 days, when a decrease in cell viability occurred, regardless of the type of soap. Regarding the roughness, there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) between the groups. Lifebuoy decreased resin hardness regardless of storage time (p = 0.003). After 21 and 28 days of storage, there was an increase in hardness value, regardless of the type of soap. The specimens' color, according to the National Bureau of Standards values, ranged from 0.27 to 0.58 (i.e., imperceptible or mild color changes). In general, the disinfectant soaps were not able to prevent biofilm formation, but all the soaps were effective in reducing the preformed biofilm. In addition, all soaps were non-cytotoxic and did not change surface roughness, hardness (except Lifebuoy), and color (except Lifebuoy).

CC45 strains produced significantly more mature biofilm than other group of strains did. The formation of biofilms was highly dependent on the presence of extracellular DNA in the CC5, CC15 and CC30 strains whereas it was mostly dependent on the presence of proteins in CC45. Finally, the CC30 group highlighted higher proportion of susceptible (bMIC < breakpoints of EUCAST guidelines) for cloxacillin, teicoplanin and vancomycin compared to the other CCs.

Therefore inhibiting or modulating the function of these transporters continues to draw attention as effective strategy to combat MDR. We have previously reported the antifungal potential of Geraniol (Ger), a natural monoterpenoid from Palmarosa oil, against Candida albicans. Herein, we explored the fungicidal nature of Ger. The Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and Nile red accumulation confirms the specific effect on CaCdr1p. Mechanistic insights with Candida cells overexpressing CaCdr1p and CaMdr1p revealed that Ger specifically modulates CaCdr1p activity. Kinetic studies further unraveled the competitive inhibition of Ger for R6G efflux as evident from increased apparent Km without affecting Vmax value. The effect of Ger on CaCdr1p was substantiated by molecular docking analyses, which depicted in-silico binding affinity of Ger with CaCdr1p and explored that Ger binds to the active site of CaCdr1p with higher binding energy. Although RT-PCR and western blot revealed no change in expressions of CDR1 and CaCdr1p, confocal microscopy images however depicted CaCdr1p mislocalization in presence of Ger. Interestingly, Ger was synergistic (FICI<0.5) with fluconazole (FLC) which is a well known antifungal drug. Furthermore, Ger sensitizes the FLC sensitive and resistant clinical matched pair of isolates Gu4/Gu5 and led to abrogated R6G efflux and depleted ergosterol. Furthermore, Rhodamine B labeling demonstrates altered mitochondrial potential with Ger which suggest possible linkage of dysfunctional mitochondria with CaCdr1p activity. We also estimated phenotypic virulence marker extracellular phospholipase activity which was considerably diminished along with inhibited cell adherence and biofilm biomass. Lastly, antifungal efficacy of Ger was demonstrated by enhanced survival of Caenorhabditis elegans model and negligible hemolytic activity (20%). Together, modulation of efflux pump activity by Ger and FLC synergism represent a promising approach for combinatorial treatment of candidiasis.","authors":[{"name":"Shweta Singh"},{"name":"Zeeshan Fatima"},{"name":"Kamal Ahmad"},{"name":"Saif Hameed"}],"keywords":[]},"article154":{"pmid":"30156511","title":"[Detection of virulence factors and antifungal susceptibilities of Fusarium strains isolated from keratitis cases].","abs":"Fusarium species have gained importance as a cause of keratitis. The pathogenicity and virulence factors of genus Fusarium remain largely unknown. Several putative virulence factors have been reported for fungal pathogens, including biofilm formation, production of proteinases and other hydrolytic enzymes. It has been emphasized that Fusarium species are generally resistant to antifungals but the resistance may vary depending on the species and even according to the isolate. For this reason, pathogenic features and antifungal susceptibility of the clinical isolates gained importance for the management of keratitis cases. The aim of this study was to identify clinical Fusarium isolates, to evaluate their virulence factors and to show antifungal susceptibility patterns. The identification of Fusarium was made on genus level isolated from 25 keratitis cases. Among them, 13 of the isolates were identified by ITS sequencing on species complex level. The production of hemolytic activity, caseinase, esterase, proteinase and phospholipase activity were investigated in 13 of the isolates. Biofilm production was searched among all 25 isolates. Galleria mellonella larvae was used as in vivo infection model. Antifungal susceptibility for amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M38-A2 microdilution assay guidelines. As the subcommittee on antifungal susceptibility tests did not determine the clinical resistance breakpoints (CBP) specific to Fusarium species complex, the epidemiological cut off values (ECV) were used for the interpretation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the antifungal drugs. Isolates were identified as six F.oxysporum, six F.solani species complex and one F.brachygibbosum. One F.solani, one F.oxysporum were positive for hemolytic activity; all isolates were caseinase positive; three F.oxysporum and two F.solani isolate were esterase positive; one F.solani isolate was proteinase positive; five F.oxysporum and two F.solani isolates were phospholipase positive; biofilm activity was positive in 52% of the 25 isolates. The larvae survived for seven days after Fusarium inoculation in the G.mellonella larvae model. MIC range was 0.5-8 µg/ml for amphotericin B, 2-32 µg/ml for itraconazole, 0.5-8 µg/ml for voriconazole, 0.5-16 µg/ml for posaconazole and according to the ECV values F.solani and F.oxysporum isolates were determined as wild type for four antifungal agents. As a result, it was shown that Fusarium isolates have some virulence factors, there was a concordance between in vitro virulence properties and in vivo virulence characteristics and some of the isolates were classified as antifungal susceptible wild type isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Tuğba Çuhadar"},{"name":"Nilgün Karabıçak"},{"name":"Tuğba Özdil"},{"name":"Didem Özgür"},{"name":"Feza Otağ"},{"name":"Kenan Hızel"},{"name":"Ayşe Kalkancı"}],"keywords":[]},"article155":{"pmid":"30156245","title":"MoS","abs":"Developing novel antibacterial agents to combat bacterial infection has been an everlasting task for scientists, due to the drug resistance evolved by bacteria during antibiotic treatment.

Although herbicide effects on periphyton are frequently studied, the focus has been on photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides while other modes of toxic action have received little attention. Against this background, a 21-days-lasting bioassay was conducted, during which mature periphytic communities were exposed to the carotenoid-biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicide diflufenican for 12 days (up to 10 μg/L; n = 4), followed by a 9-days-lasting recovery phase in herbicide-free medium. Variables related to periphytic functioning (photosynthetic efficiency and non-photochemical quenching) and structure (pigment concentrations, biomass, and algal community structure) were quantified every third day during both experimental phases. Exposure to ≥ 0.2 μg diflufenican/L resulted in 20-25% and 25-30% lowered carotenoid and chlorophyll a concentrations, respectively, likely explained by a reduced algal biovolume as well as diflufenican's mode of toxic action and thus a shift towards a higher heterotrophy of the communities. Despite these adverse effects on the photosynthetic apparatus, the photosynthetic efficiency increased by up to ∼15% under diflufenican exposure judged on higher chlorophyll fluorescence. This may be explained by an up to ∼60% reduced non-photochemical quenching as well as binding of diflufenican to the pigment-protein membrane complex of the photosystem II, two processes causing higher chlorophyll fluorescence. Additionally, phototrophs may have actively increased energy assimilation to cope with higher energy demands under chemical stress. Although periphyton showed some recovery potential following the exposure phase, observed as increasing chlorophyll a concentrations and non-photochemical quenching, periphyton may not be able to quickly recover from stress given the persistent increase in the photosynthetic efficiency. While the processes underlying the observed effects yet remain speculative, the results suggest a shift towards a higher degree of heterotrophy in periphytic communities ultimately increasing the importance of heterotrophic ecosystem functions at impacted sites over the long term.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander Feckler"},{"name":"Jelena Rakovic"},{"name":"Maria Kahlert"},{"name":"Rikard Tröger"},{"name":"Mirco Bundschuh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algae"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Carotenoid-biosynthesis-inhibitor"},{"word":"Chlorophyll fluorescence"},{"word":"Herbicide"},{"word":"PAM fluorometry"},{"word":"Photosynthesis"}]},"article165":{"pmid":"30153549","title":"Application of a novel strain Corynebacterium pollutisoli SPH6 to improve nitrogen removal in an anaerobic/aerobic-moving bed biofilm reactor (A/O-MBBR).","abs":"A novel bacterium Corynebacterium pollutisoli SPH6 was added in A/O-MBBR system to explore its potential in nitrogen removal.

The last two interactions require a surface-specific probe restricted to a few nanometers or less. This is particularly true of efforts to probe polymer surface structure without being overwhelmed by bulk polymer signal or interfacial water structure in the presence of bulk water. Second-order nonlinear optical techniques are ideal probes of such interactions, as their reporting depth is determined by the polar arrangement of molecules (a break in the macroscopic inversion symmetry) rather than the penetration of the optical fields. This Account begins with an introduction of surface water structure from the perspective of a nonlinear probe. Details about the unique view of the water orientation distribution are discussed and contrasted with information obtained from conventional vibrational techniques. The salient features of water next to model hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces are discussed, in preparation for a discussion of solute interactions that follows. We then present three examples using a combination of linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to illustrate how water is both a mediator and a marker of adhesion. The first is a study of amphipathic peptide adhesion onto hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, characterizing the adsorbed structure in relation to the water surrounding the molecule and trapped near the surface. Water is found to be especially important in mediating adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces, where it aids in solvating the peptide as well as facilitating interactions with the surface. In the second example, we look at adhesion of a multicomponent polymer adhesive using surface-bulk heterospectral correlation analysis, in which surface vibrational spectroscopy is combined with bulk infrared absorption to determine interfacial structure development during the evaporation of water. When acrylic acid is added to the polymer, there is a change in orientation of the polymer before an increase in population. This is opposite to what is observed when no additive is present. In our third example, we show how interfacial water provides a unique window into the surface microenvironment during bacterial adhesion, highlighting the role of solution conditions at the surface in cell attachment and biofilm growth. Changes in the nonlinear vibrational response of interfacial water reflect changes occurring in the pH and ionic strength only at the surface, due to the presence of polymeric adhesives secreted by the bacteria. These studies underline the importance of surface water in governing the structure of adhered molecules and in mediating changes in the interfacial environment as a result of adhesion and provide insight into a nanoscale region that is otherwise difficult to query. They also illustrate the importance of combining surface-sensitive and bulk spectroscopic probes with computer modeling to gain a better understanding of the interplay between water and adsorbate structure.","authors":[{"name":"Tasha Jarisz"},{"name":"Sandra Roy"},{"name":"Dennis K Hore"}],"keywords":[]},"article174":{"pmid":"30152639","title":"Oral Helicobacter pylori: Interactions with host and microbial flora of the oral cavity.","abs":"The role of the oral cavity as a reservoir for Helicobacter pylori is still a controversial issue. There is a great number of articles indicating the presence of this pathogen in the oral cavity, but discrepancies among techniques for H. pylori detection and the variations in the patients tested often make it difficult to formulate a final verdict. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are one of the most important factors determining colonization of H. pylori in the oral cavity. Among them, the key role is attributed to BabA, SabA and NapA, all of which promote adherence and retention within this area. The oral cavity is characterized by the co-existence of numerous microorganisms which may potentially affect the physiology and morphology of H. pylori. The presence of coccoid-stimulating factors and relatively low levels of AI-2 in the earlyto mid-stages of supragingival plaque allow dental H. pylori to colonize this niche as nonculturable spherical forms. On the other hand, subgingival plaque characterized by high numbers of periopathogens, capable of synthesizing high concentrations of AI-2, may favor the presence of mixed populations of spiral and coccoid H. pylori forms.

The genome of Bdolosa strain AU0158 (BdAU0158) contains three loci that are predicted to encode contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) systems. CDI systems function by translocating the toxic C terminus of a large exoprotein directly into target cells, resulting in growth inhibition or death unless the target cells produce a cognate immunity protein. We demonstrate here that each of the three bcpAIOB loci in BdAU0158 encodes a distinct CDI system that mediates interbacterial competition in an allele-specific manner. While only two of the three bcpAIOB loci were expressed under the in vitro conditions tested, the third conferred immunity under these conditions due to the presence of an internal promoter driving expression of the bcpI gene. One BdAU0158 bcpAIOB allele is highly similar to bcpAIOB in Burkholderia thailandensis strain E264 (BtE264), and we showed that their BcpI proteins are functionally interchangeable, but contact-dependent signaling (CDS) phenotypes were not observed in BdAU0158.

Initial testing of PLA2G1B's effect on bovine mammary epithelial cell (bMEC) line PS revealed no changes in cell viability or cytokine-secretion pattern. However, when cells were first treated with lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) or live bacteria (Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus), incubation with PLA2G1B significantly improved cell viability, suggesting involvement of sPLA2s in protecting membranes from lipid-peroxidation damage, rather than a bactericidal action. When PLA2G1B was applied simultaneously with LPS, a significant short-term reduction in interleukin-8 secretion was observed compared with bMECs treated only with LPS, supporting previous reports that PLA2G1B affects interleukin-8 signaling in similar cells. Following the favorable outcome of the in vitro experiments, we tested PLA2G1B in vivo by mammary infusion into infected glands. In one of a small sample (n = 4) of lactating cows chronically infected with Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a single PLA2G1B treatment completely cleared inflammation and bacteria, demonstrating its potential to cure subclinical mastitis. PLA2G1B treatment did not affect coagulase-negative staphylococci infection. These types of mastitis may involve formation of a resistant biofilm, and its elimination may relate to sPLA2s' characteristic ability to aggregate with cellular debris, facilitating their internalization by macrophages. In a bovine model of clinical mastitis based on introduction of E. coli via the streak canal, a single mammary infusion of PLA2G1B led to faster recovery to pre-infection milk-yield levels and decrease of somatic cell counts. In this case, all of sPLA2s' modes of resolving inflammation may apply, including competitive binding of the sPLA2s' receptor, the inactivation of which confers resistance to endotoxic shock.

Severe cases of periodontitis, an inflammatory condition initiated by an oral bacterial biofilm, can lead to significant destruction of soft and hard tissues of the periodontium and result in compromised dental function and aesthetics. Although current treatment approaches can limit the progression of the disease by controlling the inflammatory aspect, complete periodontal regeneration cannot be predictably achieved. Various tissue engineering approaches are investigated for their ability to control the critical temporo-spatial wound healing events that are essential for achieving periodontal regeneration. This paper reviews recent progress in the field of periodontal tissue engineering with an emphasis on advanced 3D multiphasic tissue engineering constructs (TECs) and provides a critical analysis of their regenerative potential and limitations. The review also elaborates on the future of periodontal tissue engineering, including scaffold customization for individual periodontal defects, TEC's functionalization strategies for imparting enhanced bioactivity, periodontal ligament fiber guidance, and the utilization of chair-side regenerative solutions that can facilitate clinical translation.","authors":[{"name":"Cedryck Vaquette"},{"name":"Sophia P Pilipchuk"},{"name":"P Mark Bartold"},{"name":"Dietmar W Hutmacher"},{"name":"William V Giannobile"},{"name":"Saso Ivanovski"}],"keywords":[{"word":"additive manufacturing"},{"word":"periodontal regeneration"},{"word":"scaffolds"},{"word":"tissue engineering"}]},"article197":{"pmid":"30146698","title":"Halotolerant bacteria belonging to operational group Bacillus amyloliquefaciens in biocontrol of the rice brown stripe pathogen Acidovorax oryzae.","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonistic activity of halotolerant bacteria against rice brown stripe pathogen Acidovorax oryzae.","authors":[{"name":"M M I Masum"},{"name":"L Liu"},{"name":"M Yang"},{"name":"M M Hossain"},{"name":"M M Siddiqa"},{"name":"M E Supty"},{"name":"S O Ogunyemi"},{"name":"A Hossain"},{"name":"Q An"},{"name":"B Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acidovorax"},{"word":"Bacillus"},{"word":"MALDI-TOF"},{"word":"biocontrol"},{"word":"halotolerant"},{"word":"lipopeptides"},{"word":"siderophore"}]},"article198":{"pmid":"30146415","title":"Modulation of S. epidermidis-induced innate immune responses in neonatal whole blood.","abs":"Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) such as Staphylococcus epidermidis are highly prevalent pathogens for sepsis in neonates.

Ratiometric monitoring of pH with the fluorescent dye C-SNARF-4 has been used to reliably map extracellular pH in the basal layers of biofilms, but only under static conditions. Here, we expand this methodology to measurements of vertical gradients in multispecies in vitro-grown and in situ-grown dental biofilms of different age, and to pH measurements in in vitro-grown biofilms under flow conditions. After static incubation with glucose, young in vitro-grown biofilms (30h) were more acidogenic than older biofilms (120h). However, under dynamic conditions mimicking the oral salivary flow, low pH was only preserved in older biofilms. As both types of biofilm were of similar thickness (~20 μm), these findings highlight the importance of cell density and biofilm matrix maturation for pH developments. In both in vitro-grown and in in situ-grown biofilms, horizontal and vertical pH gradients were observed. Under static conditions, the surface layer of the biofilms tended to be more acidic, whereas the bottom layer became more acidic under dynamic conditions. Compared to in vitro-grown biofilms, 120 h in situ-grown biofilms showed higher acidogenicity during static incubation. This study shows that pH ratiometry with C-SNARF-4 is well-suited to monitor extracellular pH in thin biofilms in all three dimensions. The different pH dynamics observed under static and dynamic conditions argue for the implementation of flow during real-time assessment of biofilm pH.","authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Schlafer"},{"name":"Vibeke Baelum"},{"name":"Irene Dige"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"C-SNARF-4"},{"word":"Confocal laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"Flow"},{"word":"In situ"},{"word":"pH ratiometry"}]},"article203":{"pmid":"30144008","title":"Use of high-strength electromagnetic radiation to remove phototrophic biofilms from terracotta artifacts.","abs":"A novel technique, effective in eliminating biodeteriogens from biofilms encrusting terracotta artifacts, is presented here.

The shards, after sterilization, were inoculated with several phototrophic microorganisms previously isolated from whole terracotta pots. The newly formed biofilms were exposed to EMR amplitude modulated by a train of rectangular pulses with Tr = 200 ns repetition time and 10% duty cycle. The exposure protocol consisted of three applications of 2 h each, every other day. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses conducted on the newly formed biofilms showed that, after the first exposure to EMR, all species in the biofilms but one were still alive. The second exposure resulted in the disappearance of 9 out of 13 species that were initially present on the samples. After the third exposure, all species disappeared. Superficial layers of terracotta from the exposed samples, transferred to a culture medium at 24 °C for 72 h, did not show any re-growing of organisms. Petrographic analyses of the sampleswere carried out before and after the treatments; they showed that exposure to EMR did not cause structural alterations in the treated substrates. Moreover, the amplitude of the EMR that samples were exposed to was not high enough to cause any significant increase in the temperature of the substrates; that is, no thermal effect, which is the most relevant effect when matter or organisms containing water are exposed to EMR, was observed.

In continuation, the present study was carried to substantiate this association in clinical isolates.

On cadmium accumulation, antibiotic(s) sensitive isolates were rendered resistant and the resistant isolates were rendered more resistant as per their minimum inhibitory concentration(s). Further, after subjecting the pathogen to cadmium accumulation, alterations occurring in the cells were assessed. Transgenerational cadmium exposure led to changes in growth response, morphology, proteome, elevated antioxidants other than SOD, increased biofilm formation, decreased intracellular macrophage killing coupled with upregulation of genes encoding metallothionein and metal transporters. Thus, these results indicate that cadmium, if acquired from the environment, being non-degradable can exert a long-lasting selective pressure on Salmonella in the host which may display antibiotic resistance later on, as a result of co-selection. Therefore, appropriate strategies need to be developed to inhibit such an enduring pressure of heavy metals, as these represent one of the factors for the emerging antibiotic resistance in pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Ujjwal Jit Kaur"},{"name":"Simran Preet"},{"name":"Praveen Rishi"}],"keywords":[]},"article207":{"pmid":"30143697","title":"Whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis of two plant-associated strains of Rhodopseudomonas palustris (PS3 and YSC3).","abs":"Rhodopseudomonas palustris strains PS3 and YSC3 are purple non-sulfur phototrophic bacteria isolated from Taiwanese paddy soils.

In the future, the nanotechnology and chemical modification of biomaterials may be able to further optimize the properties of degradation.","authors":[{"name":"Lin Wang"},{"name":"Ganggang Yang"},{"name":"Hua Xie"},{"name":"Fang Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Stent"},{"word":"biodegradable"},{"word":"biomaterial"},{"word":"design"},{"word":"ureteral stent"}]},"article220":{"pmid":"30141743","title":"Grafting antibiofilm polymer hydrogel film onto catheter by SARA SI-ATRP.","abs":"Catheters are widely used and play an important role in medicine. However, catheter-associated infection is prevalent even under stringent sterile conditions. Biofilms are formed when bacteria populate the surfaces of catheters. This makes the biofilm resistant to antibiotics. Hence, it is imperative for there to be an inherently antifouling and anti-bacterial catheter to mitigate the formation of biofilm. This paper aims to outline the synthesis of non-leachable anti-biofilm and anti-bacterial cationic film coatings through direct polymerization using supplemental activator and reducing agent surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SARA SI-ATRP). Three crosslinked cationic coatings comprising of Diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DADMAC), or ε-poly-L-lysine HCl methacrylic acid (EPL-MA) together with a crosslinker (polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, PEGDMA) were investigated. These non-leachable covalently linked coatings with DADMAC can achieve more than 2 log reduction (99.0%) with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 1.25 log reduction (94.4%) with Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in in vitro studies.","authors":[{"name":"Chao Zhou"},{"name":"Hongqin Song"},{"name":"Jia Ling Celestine Loh"},{"name":"Jueqin She"},{"name":"Linhong Deng"},{"name":"Bo Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"SARA SI-ATRP"},{"word":"Surface modification"},{"word":"antibacterial property"},{"word":"antibiofilm coating"},{"word":"cationic polymer"},{"word":"log reduction"}]},"article221":{"pmid":"30141414","title":"Effect of shear stress on the reduction of bacterial adhesion to antifouling polymers.","abs":"In this work, two antifouling polymer brushes were tested at different shear stress conditions to evaluate their performance in reducing the initial adhesion of Escherichia coli.

Here, we performed RNA-seq analysis of biofilm cells formed by S. aureus RN450 and two derived strains carrying prophages ϕ11 and ϕ80α. The lysogenic strains displayed increased biofilm formation and production of the carotenoid pigment staphyloxanthin. These phenotypes could be partly explained by the differences in gene expression displayed by prophage-harboring strains, namely an activation of the alternative sigma factor (SigB) regulon and downregulation of genes controlled by the Agr quorum-sensing system, especially the decreased transcription of genes encoding dispersion factors like proteases. Nonetheless, spontaneous lysis of part of the population could also contribute to the increased attached biomass.

Resulting coatings afforded fast prodrug conversion and mediated antibacterial measures against planktonic species as evidenced by pronounced zone of bacterial growth inhibition around the biomaterial surface.

Since the model analysis is likely dependent on the numerical estimates of the parameters, parameter identifiability should be addressed beforehand to capture biologically relevant parameter space. Here, we propose a framework which uses data from different experiment regimes to identify a region in the parameter space over which subsequent mathematical analysis can be conducted. Along with building confidence in the parameter estimates, it provides us with variations in the parameters due to changes in the experimental conditions. To determine significance of these variations, we conduct global sensitivity analysis, allowing us to make testable hypothesis for effects of changes in the experimental conditions on the biological system. As a case study, we develop a model for growth dynamics and biofilm formation of a bacterial plant pathogen, and use our framework to identify possible effects of zinc on the bacterial populations in different metabolic states. The framework reveals underlying issues with parameter identifiability and identifies a suitable region in the parameter space, sensitivity analysis over which informs us about the parameters that might be affected by addition of zinc.

The lpsB mutant, which has a defective core portion of LPS, exhibited a reduction in biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces as well as altered biofilm architecture compared with the wild-type Rm8530 strain. Atomic force microscopy and confocal laser microscopy revealed an increase in polar cell-to-cell interactions in the lpsB mutant, which might account for the biofilm deficiency.

These D-type strains typically: (i) formed aggregations of 100s-1000s of cells on the light-organ surface, up to 3 orders of magnitude larger than those of S-type strains; (ii) showed dominance in co-aggregation experiments, independent of inoculum size or strain proportion; (iii) perturbed larger areas of the organ's ciliated surface; and, (iv) appeared at the pore of the organ approximately 4×s more quickly than S-type strains. At least in part, genes responsible for biofilm synthesis control the hyperaggregation phenotype of a D-type strain.

Then, the structure-activity relationship of the peptide was investigated using alanine and D-amino acid scanning. Among the analogs synthesized, FK-1D showed much more potent antimicrobial activity, superior stability, and very low toxicity, and it was able to permeabilize bacterial membranes. Furthermore, it exhibited significant anti-biofilm activity. More importantly, FK-1D showed excellent antimicrobial activity in vivo, especially against clinical multidrug-resistant bacteria, in contrast to ceftazidime. Our results suggested that FK-1D could be subjected to fixed-point modification in the first and fourth sites to further optimize its medicinal properties and potential as a lead compound for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and the associated biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Junqiu Xie"},{"name":"Yao Li"},{"name":"Jing Li"},{"name":"Zhibin Yan"},{"name":"Dan Wang"},{"name":"Xiaomin Guo"},{"name":"Jianfeng Zhang"},{"name":"Bangzhi Zhang"},{"name":"Lingyun Mou"},{"name":"Wenle Yang"},{"name":"Xianxing Jiang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Analogs"},{"word":"Anti-biofilm"},{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"Multidrug-resistant bacteria"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}]},"article244":{"pmid":"30135956","title":"Antimicrobial Peptides: A Potential Therapeutic Option for Surgical Site Infections.","abs":"Surgical Site Infections (SSI) represents one of the most common hospital-associated infections worldwide, and many cases of SSI are due to multidrug-resistant bacteria with the propensity to attach to tissues and form biofilm on post-surgical sites.

Although A. baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen, its infections are notoriously difficult to treat due to intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance, often limiting effective therapeutic options. A. baumannii can survive for long periods in the hospital environment, particularly on inanimate surfaces. Such environments may act as a reservoir for cross-colonization and infection outbreaks and should be considered a substantial factor in infection control practices. Moreover, clothing of healthcare personnel and gadgets may play a role in the spread of nosocomial bacteria. A link between contamination of hospital surfaces and A. baumannii infections or between its persistence in the environment and its virulence has not yet been established. Bacteria under stress (i.e., long-term desiccation in hospital setting) could conserve factors that favor infection. To investigate whether desiccation and/or starvation may be involved in the ability of certain strains of A. baumannii to retain virulence factors, we have studied five well-characterized clinical isolates of A. baumannii for which survival times were determined under simulated hospital conditions. Despite a considerable reduction in the culturability over time (up to 88% depending on strain and the condition tested), some A. baumannii strains were able to maintain their ability to form biofilms after rehydration, addition of nutrients, and changing temperature. Also, after long-term desiccation, several clinical strains were able to grow in the presence of non-immune human serum as fine as their non-stressed homologs. Furthermore, we also show that the ability of bacterial strains to kill Galleria mellonella larvae does not change although A. baumannii cells were stressed by long-term starvation (up to 60 days). This means that A. baumannii can undergo a rapid adaptation to both the temperature shift and nutrients availability, conditions that can be easily found by bacteria in a new patient in the hospital setting.","authors":[{"name":"Itziar Chapartegui-González"},{"name":"María Lázaro-Díez"},{"name":"Zaloa Bravo"},{"name":"Jesús Navas"},{"name":"José M Icardo"},{"name":"José Ramos-Vivas"}],"keywords":[]},"article251":{"pmid":"30132198","title":"Dynamics of Pseudomonas putida biofilms in an upscale experimental framework.","abs":"Exploitation of biofilms for industrial processes requires them to adopt suitable physical structures for rendering them efficient and predictable.

We confirmed that the genes encoding the AcrAB efflux pump, acrA and acrB forms a polycistronic operon which is under the control of acrR gene upstream of acrA. Bioinformatic analysis indicated the presence of AcrR binding motif in the promoter region of acrAB operon and the specific binding of AcrR was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The EMSA data showed that AcrR binds to -89 bp upstream of the start codon of acrA.

ETEC causes disease by adhering tightly to the epithelial cells in a concerted effort by adhesins, flagella, and other virulence-factors. When attached ETEC secretes toxins targeting the small intestine host-cells, which ultimately leads to osmotic diarrhea. HldE is a bifunctional protein that catalyzes the nucleotide-activated heptose precursors used in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and in post-translational protein glycosylation. Both mechanisms have been linked to ETEC virulence: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the bacterial outer membrane and is needed for transport of heat-labile toxins to the host cells, and ETEC glycoproteins have been shown to play an important role for bacterial adhesion to host epithelia. Here, we report that HldE plays an important role for ETEC virulence. Deletion of hldE resulted in markedly reduced binding to the human intestinal cells due to reduced expression of colonization factor CFA/I on the bacterial surface. Deletion of hldE also affected ETEC motility in a flagella-dependent fashion. Expression of both colonization factors and flagella was inhibited at the level of transcription. In addition, the hldE mutant displayed altered growth, increased biofilm formation and clumping in minimal growth medium. Investigation of an orthogonal LPS-deficient mutant combined with mass spectrometric analysis of protein glycosylation indicated that HldE exerts its role on ETEC virulence both through protein glycosylation and correct LPS configuration.

We hypothesized that biofilm-triggered TLR activation affects the mineralization potential of human SCAPs. SCAPs were challenged with conditioned media derived from standardized dual-species biofilms and planktonic bacterial cultures and their inflammatory status and mineralization capacity were studied. Bacterial products from both growth modes (planktonic vs. biofilm) compromised cell viability, proliferation and mineralization capacity of SCAPs, but in a species- and growth mode-dependent fashion. While TLR4 expression remained unaffected, TLR2 expression was upregulated coinciding with a pro-inflammatory activation of SCAPs. Moreover, TLR and its downstream TGF-β-associated kinase (TAK1) appeared to be blocking mineralization, as inhibition of these factors restored it. In conclusion, bacterial products promoted the pro-inflammatory status and inhibited mineralization of human SCAPs in a TLR-, species-, and culture-dependent fashion.

Compared to their planktonic counterparts, these biofilm dispersal yeast cells displayed enhanced virulence-associated characteristics and drug resistance. However, little is known about their molecular properties. To address that issue, in this study we aimed to define the molecular characteristics of these biofilm dispersal cells. We found that the inducer of dispersal, PES1, genetically interacts with the repressor of filamentation, NRG1, in a manner consistent with the definition of dispersed cells as yeast cells. Further, using a flow biofilm model, we performed comprehensive comparative RNA sequencing on freshly dispersed cells in order to identify unique transcriptomic characteristics. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that dispersed cells largely inherit a biofilm-like mRNA profile. Strikingly, however, dispersed cells seemed transcriptionally reprogrammed to acquire nutrients such as zinc and amino acids and to metabolize alternative carbon sources, while their biofilm-associated parent cells did not induce the same high-affinity transporters or express gluconeogenetic genes, despite exposure to the same nutritional signals.

This barrier can however be overcome on healthy and in particular on compromised skin. Mycosis, diaper/incontinence dermatitis and wound healing are examples of cases where microbial infection is promoted by the altered skin conditions or environment. Fungi have a complex system that senses ambient pH that leads to metabolic responses allowing adhesion, growth and invasion, as microbial metabolites further increase skin pH resulting in a clinically manifest infection (mycosis). Diabetic patients with a higher pH in intertriginous areas are particularly vulnerable to candidiasis. In diaper and incontinence dermatitis, the increase in skin pH and damage to the skin barrier function is triggered by the contact with urine and faeces with or without occlusion and maintained by host and microbial enzymes and metabolites. This leads to the reduction of the protective resident microflora and fungal overgrowth, mostly with Candida albicans. Skin care with slightly acidic products may help to prevent and treat this kind of dermatitis. Wound healing is a complex sequence of biologic events correlated with ambient pH, which influences the different phases of the healing process. The pH determines the appropriate activity of immune cells and key enzymes as well as biofilm formation. Chronic wounds emerging from the disruption of the healing process are characterized by a neutral to slightly alkaline pH and may benefit from wound pH monitoring and therapeutic acidification.","authors":[{"name":"Frank Rippke"},{"name":"Enzo Berardesca"},{"name":"Teresa M Weber"}],"keywords":[]},"article264":{"pmid":"30130704","title":"Integrated fixed-film activated sludge membrane bioreactors versus membrane bioreactors for nutrient removal: A comprehensive comparison.","abs":"This research elucidates the pollutants (nutrients and carbon) removal performance and nitrous oxide (N","authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Mannina"},{"name":"George A Ekama"},{"name":"Marco Capodici"},{"name":"Alida Cosenza"},{"name":"Daniele Di Trapani"},{"name":"Hallvard Ødegaard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Greenhouse gases"},{"word":"Membrane fouling"},{"word":"Nutrient removal"},{"word":"Respirometry"}]},"article265":{"pmid":"30130698","title":"Biodegradation of sulfadiazine in microbial fuel cells: Reaction mechanism, biotoxicity removal and the correlation with reactor microbes.","abs":"Sulfadiazine (SDZ) is a high priority sulfonamide antibiotic and was always detected in environmental samples.

SDZ would greatly impact the activity of reactor microbes, and longtime acclimation is required for the biodegradation of SDZ in MFCs. After acclimation, 10 mg/L of SDZ could be removed within 48 h.

In the present study, polished and unpolished welded coupons prepared by shielded metal arc welding were assayed to identify the effect of surface roughness and local changes in the metal microstructure on microbial colonization. Experiments were performed in glass cell vessels with fresh and sterile seawater to establish the presence or absence of microorganisms. For comparison, nonwelded coupons were simultaneously tested as a control. On the 15th day, both polished and unpolished welded coupons and the nonwelded coupons immersed in fresh seawater showed microbial colonization, though the corrosion products were more abundant for the welded coupons. Nevertheless, unpolished welded coupons showed a higher predominance of pitting around the beads than polished coupons. These results suggest that filler material creates conditions more favorable for biofilm development, thus intensifying the localized corrosion on the welds. It can be concluded that adhesion and subsequent biocorrosion are directly influenced by surface roughness, whereas microstructural modifications due to welding interfere little with microbial adhesion, regardless of the greater pit depths compared to those of nonwelded coupons. Additionally, although open circuit potential measurements indicated that metal surfaces are protected when coated with biofilms, pitting corrosion was more pronounced in welded coupons immersed in fresh seawater than in those immersed in seawater without microorganisms. Therefore, the use of open circuit analysis alone is not recommended for biocorrosion monitoring of welded coupons.","authors":[{"name":"V S Liduino"},{"name":"M T S Lutterbach"},{"name":"E F C Sérvulo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocorrosion"},{"word":"Carbon steel X65"},{"word":"Pitting"},{"word":"Seawater"},{"word":"Welding"}]},"article267":{"pmid":"30130574","title":"Evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of various root canal disinfection methods against Enterococcus faecalis biofilm.

Recent work in bacteria demonstrated that polyP increases oxidative stress resistance by preventing stress-induced protein aggregation and promotes biofilm formation by stimulating functional amyloid formation. To gain insights into these two seemingly contradictory functions of polyP, we investigated the effects of polyP on the folding model lactate dehydrogenase. We discovered that the presence of polyP during the thermal unfolding process stabilizes folding intermediates of lactate dehydrogenase as soluble micro-β-aggregates with amyloid-like properties. Size and heterogeneity of the oligomers formed in this process were dependent on the polyP chain length, with longer chains forming smaller, more homogenous complexes. This ability of polyP to stabilize thermally unfolded proteins even upon exposure to extreme temperatures appears to contribute to the observed resistance of uropathogenic Escherichia coli toward severe heat shock treatment. These results suggest that the working mechanism of polyP is the same for both soluble and amyloidogenic proteins, with the ultimate outcome likely being determined by a combination of polyP chain length and the client protein itself. They help to explain how polyP can simultaneously function as general stress-protective chaperone and instigator of amyloidogenic processes in vivo.","authors":[{"name":"Nicholas G Yoo"},{"name":"Siddhant Dogra"},{"name":"Ben A Meinen"},{"name":"Eric Tse"},{"name":"Janine Haefliger"},{"name":"Daniel R Southworth"},{"name":"Michael J Gray"},{"name":"Jan-Ulrik Dahl"},{"name":"Ursula Jakob"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Polyphosphate"},{"word":"amyloid-like aggregates"},{"word":"chaperone"},{"word":"heat shock"},{"word":"protein unfolding"}]},"article269":{"pmid":"30129510","title":"Anticaries Activity of Curcumin on Decay Process in Human Tooth Enamel Samples (In Vitro Study).","abs":"Dental caries is a big public health problem which is prevalent in the highest degree worldwide, especially in lower socioeconomic levels.

During the mid- to late-log growth phase, transcriptomic profiling revealed that 562 genes were significantly upregulated, and 502 genes were downregulated by at least twofold at the RNA level in the rpoN deletion mutant in comparison with the wild-type strain H78. With respect to antibiotics, Plt biosynthesis and the expression of its operon were positively regulated, while Prn biosynthesis and the expression of its operon were negatively regulated by RpoN. RpoN is responsible for the global activation of operons involved in flagellar biogenesis and assembly, biofilm formation, and bacterial mobility. In contrast, RpoN was shown to negatively control a number of secretion system operons including one type VI secretion system operon (H1-T6SS), two pilus biogenesis operons (Flp/Tad-T4b pili and Csu-T1 pili), and one polysaccharide biosynthetic operon (psl). In addition, two operons that are involved in mannitol and inositol utilization are under the positive regulation of RpoN. Consistent with this result, the ability of H78 to utilize mannitol or inositol as a sole carbon source is positively influenced by RpoN.

These oscillations emerge once the colony reaches a large enough number of cells. However, it remains unclear whether the amplitude of the oscillations, and thus their effectiveness, builds up over time gradually or if they can emerge instantly with a nonzero amplitude. Here we address this question by combining microfluidics-based time-lapse microscopy experiments with a minimal theoretical description of the system in the form of a delay-differential equation model. Analytical and numerical methods reveal that oscillations arise through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, which enables instant high-amplitude oscillations. Consequently, the model predicts a bistable regime where an oscillating and a nonoscillating attractor coexist in phase space. We experimentally validate this prediction by showing that oscillations can be triggered by perturbing the media conditions, provided the biofilm size lies within an appropriate range. The model also predicts that the minimum size at which oscillations start decreases with stress, a fact that we also verify experimentally. Taken together, our results show that collective oscillations in cell populations can emerge suddenly with nonzero amplitude via a discontinuous transition.","authors":[{"name":"Rosa Martinez-Corral"},{"name":"Jintao Liu"},{"name":"Gürol M Süel"},{"name":"Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm growth"},{"word":"biological oscillations"},{"word":"delay-induced oscillations"},{"word":"delayed negative feedback"},{"word":"subcritical Hopf bifurcation"}]},"article278":{"pmid":"30126994","title":"Enterotoxigenic E. coli virulence gene regulation in human infections.","abs":"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a global diarrheal pathogen that utilizes adhesins and secreted enterotoxins to cause disease in mammalian hosts. Decades of research on virulence factor regulation in ETEC has revealed a variety of environmental factors that influence gene expression, including bile, pH, bicarbonate, osmolarity, and glucose. However, other hallmarks of the intestinal tract, such as low oxygen availability, have not been examined. Further, determining how ETEC integrates these signals in the complex host environment is challenging. To address this, we characterized ETEC's response to the human host using samples from a controlled human infection model. We found ETEC senses environmental oxygen to globally influence virulence factor expression via the oxygen-sensitive transcriptional regulator fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) regulator. In vitro anaerobic growth replicates the in vivo virulence factor expression profile, and deletion of fnr in ETEC strain H10407 results in a significant increase in expression of all classical virulence factors, including the colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) adhesin operon and both heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxins. These data depict a model of ETEC infection where FNR activity can globally influence virulence gene expression, and therefore proximity to the oxygenated zone bordering intestinal epithelial cells likely influences ETEC virulence gene expression in vivo. Outside of the host, ETEC biofilms are associated with seasonal ETEC epidemics, and we find FNR is a regulator of biofilm production.

Spatial patterns have been detected in planktonic bacterial communities at distances <20 m, but little is known about the occurrence of similar variation for other microbial groups and changes in microbial meta-community assembly at different levels of a meta-community. To examine this variation, the biofilm of eight saline ponds were used to investigate processes shaping diversity within ponds (β) and between ponds (δ). Bacterial and ciliate communities were assessed using ARISA and T-RFLP respectively, while diversity partitioning methods were used to examine the importance of taxonomic turnover and variation partitioning was used to distinguish spatial from environmental determinants. The results show that turnover is important for determining β- and δ-diversity of biofilms. Spatial factors are important drivers of bacterial β-diversity but were unimportant for ciliate β-diversity. Environmental variation was a strong determinant of bacterial and ciliate δ-diversity, suggesting sorting processes are important for assembling pond communities. Determinants of diversity in bacteria are not universal for ciliates, suggesting higher functional redundancy of bacteria or the greater niche breadth of ciliates may be important in discriminating assembly processes between the two organisms.","authors":[{"name":"Christopher R J Kavazos"},{"name":"Megan J Huggett"},{"name":"Ute Mueller"},{"name":"Pierre Horwitz"}],"keywords":[]},"article289":{"pmid":"30123701","title":"Occurrence of virulent multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in the pigs, farmers and farm environments in Malaysia.","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are ubiquitous opportunistic pathogens found in the guts of humans and farmed animals.

A strong inhibition of microbial viability on surfaces can potentially delay the development of biofilms on treated surfaces, thereby enhancing the performance of water-purification technologies and medical devices, for example, to prevent hospital-acquired infections. However, the synergistic effects of surface-immobilized antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have not yet been reported. Here, we demonstrate the synergistic antimicrobial effects of the AMPs PGLa and magainin-2 on modified reverse-osmosis (RO) membranes. These AMPs are known to act synergistically in the free state, but their antimicrobial synergistic effects have not yet been reported in a surface-immobilized state. The AMPs were functionalized with alkyne linkers and covalently attached to RO membranes modified with azides, using a click chemistry reaction. The resulting RO membranes showed reduced contact angles, indicating increased wettability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the two peptides on the membranes via changes in the amounts of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur, which led to an increased S/C ratio, probably because of the sulfur present in the methionine residue of the peptides. The synergistic activity was measured with the free peptides in solution and covalently bound on RO membrane surfaces by observing increased leakage of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein from large unilamellar vesicles. The synergistic antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed using surface-activity assays, where the AMP-modified RO membranes showed an effective inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilm growth, as compared with unmodified membranes. An enhanced activity of antimicrobials on surfaces might lead to potent antimicrobial surfaces, which could result in more fouling-resistant water-treatment membranes.","authors":[{"name":"Nitzan Shtreimer Kandiyote"},{"name":"Gunasekaran Mohanraj"},{"name":"Canwei Mao"},{"name":"Roni Kasher"},{"name":"Christopher J Arnusch"}],"keywords":[]},"article293":{"pmid":"30121931","title":"Disintegration of Bacterial Film by Electrochemically Activated Water Solution.","abs":"The structure of bacterial film formed at the inner surface of the recirculation reactor tube, is studied.

In order to colonize the human host, these fungi express several virulence factors such as the response to oxidative stress and the formation of biofilms. In the expression of these virulence factors, the cell wall of C. albicans and C. glabrata is of fundamental importance. As the outermost structure of the yeast, the cell wall is the first to come in contact with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during the respiratory outbreak, and in the formation of biofilms, it is the first to adhere to organs or medical devices implanted in the human host. In both processes, several cell wall proteins (CWP) are required, since they promote attachment to human cells or abiotic surfaces, as well as to detoxify ROS.

Roots of these plants engage in interactions with a broad range of microorganisms, collectively referred to as the microbiota. The microbiota contributes to the natural process of phytodepuration, whereby pollutants are removed from contaminated water bodies through plants. The outermost layer of the root corpus, the rhizoplane, is a hot-spot for these interactions where microorganisms establish specialized aggregates designated biofilm. Earlier studies suggest that biofilm-forming members of the microbiota play a crucial role in the process of phytodepuration. However, the composition and recruitment cue of the Phragmites, and Typha microbiota remain poorly understood. We therefore decided to investigate the composition and functional capacities of the bacterial microbiota thriving at the P. australis and T. latifolia root-soil interface. By using 16S rRNA gene Illumina MiSeq sequencing approach we demonstrated that, despite a different composition of the initial basin inoculum, the microbiota associated with the rhizosphere and rhizoplane of P. australis and T. latifolia tends to converge toward a common taxonomic composition dominated by members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Planctomycetes. This indicates the existence of a selecting process acting at the root-soil interface of these aquatic plants reminiscent of the one observed for land plants. The magnitude of this selection process is maximum at the level of the rhizoplane, where we identified different bacteria enriched in and discriminating between rhizoplane and rhizosphere fractions in a species-dependent and -independent way. This led us to hypothesize that the structural diversification of the rhizoplane community underpins specific metabolic capabilities of the microbiota. We tested this hypothesis by complementing the sequencing survey with a biochemical approach and scanning electron microscopy demonstrating that rhizoplane-enriched bacteria have a bias for biofilm-forming members. Together, our data will be critical to facilitate the rational exploitation of plant-microbiota interactions for phytodepuration.","authors":[{"name":"Laura Pietrangelo"},{"name":"Antonio Bucci"},{"name":"Lucia Maiuro"},{"name":"Davide Bulgarelli"},{"name":"Gino Naclerio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Phragmites"},{"word":"Typha"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"microbiota"},{"word":"phytodepuration"},{"word":"rhizoplane"},{"word":"wetlands"}]},"article310":{"pmid":"30116222","title":"ArsRS-Dependent Regulation of homB Contributes to Helicobacter pylori Biofilm Formation.","abs":"One elusive area in the Helicobacter pylori field is an understanding of why some infections result in gastric cancer, yet others persist asymptomatically for the life-span of the individual. Even before the genomic era, the high level of intraspecies diversity of H. pylori was well recognized and became an intriguing area of investigation with respect to disease progression. Of interest in this regard is the unique repertoire of over 60 outer membrane proteins (OMPs), several of which have been associated with disease outcome. Of these OMPs, the association between HomB and disease outcome varies based on the population being studied. While the molecular roles for some of the disease-associated OMPs have been evaluated, little is known about the role that HomB plays in the H. pylori lifecycle. Thus, herein we investigated homB expression, regulation, and contribution to biofilm formation. We found that in H. pylori strain G27, homB was expressed at a relatively low level until stationary phase. Furthermore, homB expression was suppressed at low pH in an ArsRS-dependent manner; mutation of arsRS resulted in increased homB transcript at all tested time-points. ArsRS regulation of homB appeared to be direct as purified ArsR was able to specifically bind to the homB promoter. This regulation, combined with our previous finding that ArsRS mutations lead to enhanced biofilm formation, led us to test the hypothesis that homB contributes to biofilm formation by H. pylori. Indeed, subsequent biofilm analysis using a crystal-violet quantification assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that loss of homB from hyper-biofilm forming strains resulted in reversion to a biofilm phenotype that mimicked wild-type. Furthermore, expression of homB in trans from a promoter that negated ArsRS regulation led to enhanced biofilm formation even in strains in which the chromosomal copy of homB had been deleted. Thus, homB is necessary for hyper-biofilm formation of ArsRS mutant strains and aberrant regulation of this gene is sufficient to induce a hyper-biofilm phenotype. In summary, these data suggest that the ArsRS-dependent regulation of OMPs such as HomB may be one mechanism by which ArsRS dictates biofilm development in a pH responsive manner.","authors":[{"name":"Stephanie L Servetas"},{"name":"Ryan S Doster"},{"name":"Aeryun Kim"},{"name":"Ian H Windham"},{"name":"Jeong-Heon Cha"},{"name":"Jennifer A Gaddy"},{"name":"D Scott Merrell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ArsRS"},{"word":"H. pylori"},{"word":"OMPs"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"homB"}]},"article311":{"pmid":"30116190","title":"Antibacterial Properties of Medicinal Plants From Pakistan Against Multidrug-Resistant ESKAPE Pathogens.","abs":"Local people in the Sudhnoti district of Pakistan share a rich practice of traditional medicine for the treatment of a variety of ailments.

A multivariate DistLM analysis revealed that 83.4% of the temporal variation of V. mediterranei QS phenotypes was explained by environmental variables.

We have shown that C. jejuni CsrA is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of more than 100 proteins, and altered expression of these proteins is presumably involved in the altered virulence-related phenotypes of a csrA mutant. Mutation of fliW results in C. jejuni cells that have greatly truncated flagella, are less motile, less able to form biofilms, and exhibit a reduced ability to colonize chicks. The loss of FliW results in the altered expression of 153 flagellar and non-flagellar proteins, the majority of which are members of the CsrA regulon. The number of proteins dysregulated in the fliW mutant was greater at mid-log phase (120 proteins) than at stationary phase (85 proteins); 52 proteins showed altered expression at both growth phases. Loss of FliW altered the growth-phase- and CsrA-mediated regulation of FlaA flagellin. FliW exerts these effects by binding to both FlaA and to CsrA, as evidenced by pull-down assays, protein-protein cross-linking, and size-exclusion chromatography. Taken together, these results show that CsrA-mediated regulation of both flagellar and non-flagellar proteins is modulated by direct binding of CsrA to the flagellar chaperone FliW. Changing FliW:CsrA stoichiometries at different growth phases allow C. jejuni to couple the expression of flagellar motility to metabolic and virulence characteristics.","authors":[{"name":"Jiaqi Li"},{"name":"Connor J Gulbronson"},{"name":"Marek Bogacz"},{"name":"David R Hendrixson"},{"name":"Stuart A Thompson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"protein regulation"}]},"article324":{"pmid":"30113216","title":"Pentamidine inhibits the growth of Sporothrix schenckii complex and exhibits synergism with antifungal agents.","abs":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the antileishmanials meglumine antimoniate and pentamidine against Sporothrix schenckii complex.","authors":[{"name":"Raimunda Sn Brilhante"},{"name":"Vandbergue S Pereira"},{"name":"Jonathas S Oliveira"},{"name":"Raissa Gp Lopes"},{"name":"Anderson M Rodrigues"},{"name":"Zoilo P Camargo"},{"name":"Waldemiro A Pereira-Neto"},{"name":"Débora Scm Castelo-Branco"},{"name":"Rossana A Cordeiro"},{"name":"José Jc Sidrim"},{"name":"Marcos Fg Rocha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Sporothrix"},{"word":"antileishmanial drugs"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"pre-exposure"},{"word":"synergism"}]},"article325":{"pmid":"30112961","title":"Molecular Biological Tools in Concrete Biodeterioration - A Mini Review.","abs":"Concrete structures develop biofilms when exposed to various environments.

Here, we investigate the potential role of the high osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) MAP kinase pathway for C. glabrata virulence. The C. glabrata MAP kinase CgHog1 becomes activated by a variety of environmental stress conditions such as osmotic stress, low pH, and carboxylic acids and subsequently accumulates in the nucleus. We found that CgHog1 allows C. glabrata to persist within murine macrophages, but it is not required for systemic infection in a mouse model. C. glabrata and Lactobacilli co-colonise mucosal surfaces. Lactic acid at a concentration produced by vaginal Lactobacillus spp. causes CgHog1 phosphorylation and accumulation in the nucleus. In addition, CgHog1 enables C. glabrata to tolerate different Lactobacillus spp. and their metabolites when grown in co-culture. Using a phenotypic diverse set of clinical C. glabrata isolates, we find that the HOG pathway is likely the main quantitative determinant of lactic acid stress resistance.

In a second step, they were exposed to human oral environment in situ in order to explore potential application in dentistry. In vitro, the cuticular structures were found to resist wetting by albumin solutions for up to 3 h and colonization by Staphylococcus epidermidis was inhibited. When exposed in the oral cavity, initial pellicle formation was of high heterogeneity: parts of the surface were coated by adsorbed proteins, others remained uncoated but exhibited locally attached, 'bridging', proteinaceous membranes spanning across cavities of the cuticle surface; this unique phenomenon was observed for the first time. Also the degree of bacterial colonization varied considerably. In conclusion, the springtail cuticle partially modulates bioadhesion in the oral cavity in a unique and specific manner, but it has no universal effect. Especially after longer exposure, the nanotextured surface of springtails is masked by the pellicle, resulting in subsequent bacterial colonization, and, thus, cannot effectively avoid bioadhesion in the oral cavity comprehensively. Nevertheless, the observed phenomena offer valuable information and new perspectives for the development of antifouling surfaces applicable in the oral cavity.","authors":[{"name":"Christian Hannig"},{"name":"Ralf Helbig"},{"name":"Julia Hilsenbeck"},{"name":"Carsten Werner"},{"name":"Matthias Hannig"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioadhesion"},{"word":"collembolan"},{"word":"hexapods"},{"word":"pellicle"},{"word":"saliva"},{"word":"springtail"}]},"article338":{"pmid":"30108735","title":"Novel T-C@AgNPs mediated biocidal mechanism against biofilm associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Bap-MRSA) 090, cytotoxicity and its molecular docking studies.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a commonly found pathogen that can cause food-spoilage and life threatening infections.

Biofilms are a major problem in infections due to their increasingly difficult control and eradication, and tolerance to multiple prescribed drugs. As so, alternative methods are necessary. Bacteriophages (phages) and honey are both seen as a promising approach for biofilm related infections. Phages have specificity toward a bacterial genus, species or even strain, self-replicating nature, and avoid dysbiosis. Honey has gained acknowledgment due to its antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. In this work, the effect of E. coli and P. aeruginosa phages vB_EcoS_CEB_EC3a and vB_PaeP_PAO1-D and chestnut honey, alone and combined, were tested using in vitro (polystyrene) and ex vivo (porcine skin) models and against mono and dual-species biofilms of these bacteria. In general, colonization was higher in the porcine skins and the presence of a second microorganism in a consortium of species did not affect the effectiveness of the treatments. The antibacterial effect of combined therapy against dual-species biofilms led to bacterial reductions that were greater for biofilms formed on polystyrene than on skin. Monospecies biofilms of E. coli were better destroyed with phages and honey than P. aeruginosa monospecies biofilms. Overall, the combined phage-honey formulations resulted in higher efficacies possibly due to honey's capacity to damage the bacterial cell membrane and also to its ability to penetrate the biofilm matrix, promoting and enhancing the subsequent phage infection.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Oliveira"},{"name":"Jéssica C Sousa"},{"name":"Ana C Silva"},{"name":"Luís D R Melo"},{"name":"Sanna Sillankorva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"E. coli"},{"word":"P. aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"dual-species"},{"word":"ex vivo"},{"word":"in vitro"}]},"article340":{"pmid":"30108564","title":"Listeria monocytogenes Colonizes Pseudomonas fluorescens Biofilms and Induces Matrix Over-Production.","abs":"In food facilities, biofilms or their debris might act as helpers for attracting free floating microorganisms.

Diketopiperazine inhibitors of the acyl homoserine lactone synthase CepI have been recently described. These compounds are able to impair the ability of B. cenocepacia to produce proteases, siderophores, and to form biofilm, being also active in a Caenorhabditis elegans infection model. However, the precise mechanism of action of the compounds, as well as their effect on the cell metabolism, fundamental for candidate drug optimization, are still not completely defined. Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of B. cenocepacia cells treated with one of these inhibitors, and compared it with a cepI deleted strain. Our results demonstrate that the effects of the compound are similar to the deletion of cepI, clearly confirming that these molecules function as inhibitors of the acyl homoserine lactone synthase. Moreover, to deepen our knowledge about the binding mechanisms of the compound to CepI, we exploited previously published in silico structural insights about this enzyme structure and validated different candidate binding pockets on the enzyme surface using site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analyses.

Here, we demonstrate a novel relationship between NMF expression in AD skin and strength of bacterial adhesion. Low-NMF corneocytes, unlike high-NMF ones, are covered by a dense layer of nanoscale villus protrusions. S. aureus bacteria isolated from AD skin bind much more strongly to corneocytes when the NMF level is reduced. Strong binding forces originate from a specific interaction between the bacterial adhesion clumping factor B (ClfB) and skin ligands.

C10-KKWW was identified and selected using virtual screening of a lipopeptide library, a minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) assay, cytotoxicity assays and a hemolysis assay. Surface plasmon resonance confirmed that C10-KKWW had a high binding affinity for PtxA. Combining with scanning electron microscopy and cell permeability assay, it was shown that the effects of C10-KKWW could be attributed to both membrane and PtxA. Wild type (WT) S. mutans, a ptxA deletion mutant (ΔptxA), and a mutant-complemented strain (CptxA), were cultured consistently in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium, tryptone-vitamin medium supplemented with 15 mM L-ascorbate (TVL), or for 5 h in BHI supplemented with 7.4 mM sodium L-ascorbate. Compared to ∆ptxA, in WT S. mutans and CptxA, C10-KKWW had a stronger MIC (3.9 μg/mL), and distinctively decreased biofilm viability.

Initially, we tested if the presence of the macroalga Fucus vesiculosus inside the chamber affected colonization of the outer membranes by marine bacteria. The alga did indeed enrich the total population of colonizing bacteria by more than a factor of four. These findings lead us to investigate the effect of the presence of the coccolithophoric alga Emiliania huxleyi on attachment and biofilm formation of the marine bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens DSM17395. These organisms co-exist in the marine environment and have a well-characterized interdependence on secondary metabolites. P. inhibens attached in significantly higher numbers when having access to E. huxleyi as compared to when exposed to sterile media. The experiment was carried out using a wild type (wt) strain as well as a TDA-deficient strain of P. inhibens. The ability of the bacterium to produce the antibacterial compound, tropodithietic acid (TDA) influenced its attachment since the P. inhibens DSM17395 wt strain attached in higher numbers to a surface within the first 48 h of incubation with E. huxleyi as compared to a TDA-negative mutant. Whilst the attachment of the bacterium to a surface was facilitated by presence of the alga, however, we cannot conclude if this was directly affected by the algae or whether biofilm formation was dependent on the production of TDA by P. inhibens, which has been implied by previous studies. In the light of these results, other applications of immersed culture chambers are suggested.","authors":[{"name":"Mariane S Thøgersen"},{"name":"Jette Melchiorsen"},{"name":"Colin Ingham"},{"name":"Lone Gram"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Emiliania huxleyi"},{"word":"Phaeobacter inhibens"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"co-culture"},{"word":"microbial culture chamber"},{"word":"qPCR"}]},"article361":{"pmid":"30104621","title":"Gold nanoparticle biodissolution by a freshwater macrophyte and its associated microbiome.","abs":"Predicting nanoparticle fate in aquatic environments requires mimicking of ecosystem complexity to observe the geochemical processes affecting their behaviour.

Several aspects of farnesol's mechanism of action remain incompletely uncharacterized. Among these are a thorough accounting of the cellular receptors and transporters for farnesol. This work suggests these processes are linked through the Zn cluster transcription factors Tac1 and Znc1 and their induction of the multidrug efflux pump Cdr1. Specifically, we have demonstrated that Tac1 and Znc1 are functionally activated by farnesol through a mechanism that mimics other means of hyperactivation of Zn cluster transcription factors. This is consistent with our observation that many genes acutely induced by farnesol are dependent on TAC1, ZNC1, or both. A related molecule, 1-dodecanol, invokes a similar TAC1-ZNC1 response, while several other proposed C. albicans quorum-sensing molecules do not. Tac1 and Znc1 both bind to and upregulate the CDR1 promoter in response to farnesol. Differences in inducer and DNA binding specificity lead to Tac1 and Znc1 having overlapping, but nonidentical, regulons. Induction of genes by farnesol via Tac1 and Znc1 was inversely related to the level of CDR1 present in the cell, suggesting a model in which induction of CDR1 by Tac1 and Znc1 leads to an increase in farnesol efflux. Consistent with this premise, our results show that CDR1 expression, and its regulation by TAC1 and ZNC1, facilitates growth in the presence of high farnesol concentrations in C. albicans and in certain strains of its close relative, C. dubliniensis.","authors":[{"name":"Zhongle Liu"},{"name":"John M Rossi"},{"name":"Lawrence C Myers"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"farnesol"},{"word":"zinc cluster transcription factor"}]},"article364":{"pmid":"30104272","title":"Treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Present in Endotracheal Tubes by Poly-l-Lysine.","abs":"The endotracheal tube (ETT) is an essential interface between the patient and ventilator in mechanically ventilated patients.

The bacteria present in the biofilm are more resistant to antibiotics, and current medical practices do not make it possible to eliminate. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading pathogens that cause biofilm infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Poly-l-lysine (pLK) is a cationic polypeptide possessing antibacterial properties and mucolytic activity by compacting DNA. Here, we explored the antibiofilm activity of pLK to treat P. aeruginosa biofilms on ETTs while taking into consideration the necessary constraints for clinical translation in our experimental designs. First, we showed that pLK eradicates a P. aeruginosa biofilm formed in vitro on 96-well microplates. We further demonstrated that pLK alters bacterial membrane integrity, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy, and eventually eradicates biofilm formed either by reference or clinical strains of P. aeruginosa biofilms generated in vitro on ETTs. Second, we collected the ETT from patients with P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia. We observed that a single dose of pLK is able to immediately disrupt the biofilm structure and kills more than 90% of bacteria present in the biofilm. Additionally, we did not observe any lung tolerance issue when the pLK solution was instilled into the ETT of ventilated pigs, an animal model particularly relevant to mimic invasive mechanical ventilation in humans. In conclusion, pLK appears as an innovative antibiofilm molecule, which could be applied in the ETT of mechanically ventilated patients.","authors":[{"name":"Antoine Guillon"},{"name":"Delphine Fouquenet"},{"name":"Eric Morello"},{"name":"Clémence Henry"},{"name":"Sonia Georgeault"},{"name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar"},{"name":"Virginie Hervé"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiofilm agent"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"endotracheal tube"},{"word":"poly-l-lysine"},{"word":"ventilator-associated pneumonia"}]},"article365":{"pmid":"30104269","title":"Screening a Repurposing Library for Inhibitors of Multidrug-Resistant Candida auris Identifies Ebselen as a Repositionable Candidate for Antifungal Drug Development.","abs":"Since its original isolation in 2009, Candida auris has spread across the globe as a causative agent of invasive candidiasis. C. auris is typically intrinsically resistant to fluconazole and can also be resistant to echinocandins and even amphotericin B. Thus, there is an urgent need to find new treatment options against this emerging pathogen. To address this growing problem, we performed a screen of the Prestwick Chemical library, a repurposing library of 1,280 small molecules, consisting mostly of approved off-patent drugs, in search of those with activity against a multidrug-resistant C. auris isolate. Our initial screen, using standardized susceptibility testing methodologies, identified nine miscellaneous compounds with no previous clinical indication as antifungals or antiseptics that displayed activity against C. auris Confirmation and follow-up studies identified ebselen as the drug displaying the most potent activity, with 100% inhibition of growth detected at concentrations as low as 2.5 μM. We further evaluated the ability of ebselen to inhibit C. auris biofilm formation and examined the effects of combination therapies of ebselen with clinically used antifungals. We extended our studies to different C. auris strains with various susceptibility patterns and also confirmed its antifungal activity against Candida albicans and clinical isolates of multiple other Candida species. Furthermore, ebselen displayed a broad spectrum of antifungal actions on the basis of its activity against a variety of medically important fungi, including yeasts and molds. Overall, our results indicate the promise of ebselen as a repositionable agent for the treatment of candidiasis and possibly other mycoses and, in particular, for the treatment of infections refractory to conventional treatment with current antifungals.","authors":[{"name":"Gina Wall"},{"name":"Ashok K Chaturvedi"},{"name":"Floyd L Wormley"},{"name":"Nathan P Wiederhold"},{"name":"Hoja P Patterson"},{"name":"Thomas F Patterson"},{"name":"José L Lopez-Ribot"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida auris"},{"word":"Prestwick library"},{"word":"antifungals"},{"word":"candidiasis"},{"word":"repurposing"}]},"article366":{"pmid":"30104101","title":"One-stage exchange of septic shoulder arthroplasty following a standardized treatment algorithm.","abs":"Studies on 1-stage exchange in septic shoulder arthroplasty are limited and show a wide variation of treatment strategies.

Activation of these two phenotypes requires the chitin-induced regulator TfoX, but also integrates signals from quorum sensing via the intermediate regulator QstR, which belongs to the LuxR-type family of regulators. Here, we define the QstR regulon using RNA sequencing. Moreover, by mapping QstR binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing we demonstrate that QstR is a transcription factor that binds upstream of the up- and down-regulated genes. Like other LuxR-type family transcriptional regulators we show that QstR function is dependent on dimerization. However, in contrast to the well-studied LuxR-type biofilm regulator VpsT of V. cholerae, which requires the second messenger c-di-GMP, we show that QstR dimerization and function is c-di-GMP independent. Surprisingly, although ComEA, which is a periplasmic DNA-binding protein essential for transformation, is produced in a QstR-dependent manner, QstR-binding was not detected upstream of comEA suggesting the existence of a further regulatory pathway.

While EET-capable microbes have been successfully isolated from various environments, the diversity of bacteria capable of EET is still poorly understood, especially in difficult-to-sample, low energy or extreme environments, such as many subsurface ecosystems. Here, we describe an on-site electrochemical system to enrich EET-capable bacteria using an anode as a respiratory terminal electron acceptor. This anode is connected to a cathode capable of catalyzing abiotic oxygen reduction. Comparing this approach with electrocultivation methods that use a potentiostat for poising the electrode potential, the two-electrode system does not require an external power source. We present an example of our on-site enrichment utilized in an alkaline pond at the Cedars, a terrestrial serpentinization site in Northern California. Prior attempts to cultivate mineral reducing bacteria were unsuccessful, which is likely due to the low-biomass nature of this site and/or the low relative abundance of metal reducing microbes. Prior to implementing our two-electrode enrichment, we measured the vertical profile of dissolved oxygen concentration. This allowed us to place the carbon felt anode and platinum-electroplated carbon felt cathode at depths that would support anaerobic and aerobic processes, respectively. Following on-site incubation, we further enriched the anodic electrode in the laboratory and confirmed a distinct microbial community compared to the surface-attached or biofilm communities normally observed at the Cedars. This enrichment subsequently led to the isolation of the first electrogenic microbe from the Cedars. This method of on-site microbial enrichment has the potential to greatly enhance the isolation of EET-capable bacteria from low biomass or difficult to sample habitats.","authors":[{"name":"Akihiro Okamoto"},{"name":"Annette Rowe"},{"name":"Xiao Deng"},{"name":"Kenneth H Nealson"}],"keywords":[]},"article372":{"pmid":"30101982","title":"Diverse Profiles of Biofilm and Adhesion Genes in Staphylococcus Aureus Food Strains Isolated from Sushi and Sashimi.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is able to form multilayer biofilms embedded within a glycocalyx or slime layer.

However, whether the transcriptome faithfully reflects the proteome remains unknown. In this study, we performed quantitative proteomics analysis of membrane proteins in an E. faecalis isolate (P10748) with low-level linezolid-resistance in comparison with two linezolid-susceptible strains 3138 and ATCC 29212, all of which have been previously investigated by whole transcriptome analysis.

Our analysis suggests that the low-level linezolid-resistance in E. faecalis is conferred primarily by the ATP-binding cassette protein OptrA through ribosomal protection and, possibly, also by the enterococcal surface protein (Esp) and other proteins through biofilm formation.

Its ability to form antibiotic-resistant biofilm has raised the need for the development of alternative treatment approaches. An ideal alternate can be silver nanoparticles known for their strong yet tunable bactericidal activity. However, their use in commercial in vivo medicine could not see the light of the day because of the unwanted toxicity of silver in the host cells at higher concentrations. Thus, strategies which can modulate the bacterial cell-silver nanoparticle interactions thereby reducing the amount of nanoparticles required to kill a typical number of bacterial cells are utmost welcomed. The current work showcases one such strategy by functionalizing the silver nanoparticles with l-fucose to increase their interactions with the LecB lectins present on P. aeruginosa PAO1. The advantage of this approach lies in the higher bactericidal and antibiofilm activity of fucose-functionalized silver nanoparticles (FNPs) as compared to the citrate-capped silver nanoparticles (CNPs) of similar size and concentrations. The superior bactericidal potential of FNPs as demonstrated by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analyses may be attributed to the higher reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative membrane damage. Additionally, FNPs prevented the formation of biofilms by downregulating the expression of various virulence genes at lower concentrations as compared to CNPs. The practical applicability of the approach was demonstrated by preventing bacterial colonization on artificial silicone rubber surfaces. These results can be extrapolated in the treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, the present work strongly advocates the use of antivirulence targets and their corresponding binding residues for the augmentation of the bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles.","authors":[{"name":"Arpit Bhargava"},{"name":"Vikram Pareek"},{"name":"Subhasree Roy Choudhury"},{"name":"Jitendra Panwar"},{"name":"Surajit Karmakar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"bactericidal"},{"word":"fucose-LecB"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"}]},"article394":{"pmid":"30095990","title":"Microterracettes in Sabkha Oum Dba (Western Sahara, Morocco): Physical and Biological Interactions in the Formation of a Surface Micromorphology.","abs":"Small-scale terracing (microterracettes) is a surface geomorphic feature that recurs under a range of environmental settings, such as those existing in high to low temperature geothermal springs and evaporitic environments, through the single or combined action of physicochemical agents and microbiological processes.

However, the efficacy of periodontal treatment during pregnancy is controversial. Two pathogenic mechanisms might explain the potential effect of periodontal diseases on pregnancy outcomes. First, periodontal bacteria originating in the gingival biofilm directly affect the feto-placental unit subsequent to bacteremia. Second, inflammatory mediators secreted by the subgingival inflammatory site are carried to the feto-placental unit, where they then cause an inflammatory response. To elucidate these mechanisms, many researchers have been investigating the use of experimental animal models and in vitro models.

Contact angle, antibacterial function and protein adsorption of the modified surface were evaluated. The result shows that the modified surface exhibited significantly enhanced hydrophilicity with a 54-65% decrease in contact angle, increased antibacterial activity to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a 24-57% decrease in viability, and reduced human serum albumin adsorption with a 64-70% decrease in adsorption, as compared to the original polyurethane.","authors":[{"name":"Dong Xie"},{"name":"Leah Howard"},{"name":"Rashed Almousa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial polymer"},{"word":"bacterial viability"},{"word":"polyurethane"},{"word":"surface modification"}]},"article409":{"pmid":"30089363","title":"Mussel-Inspired Surface Functionalization of PET with Zwitterions and Silver Nanoparticles for the Dual-Enhanced Antifouling and Antibacterial Properties.","abs":"Herein, we designed and constructed a dual functional surface with antimicrobial and antifouling abilities to prevent protein and bacterial attachment that are significant challenges in biomedical devices.

The sheets were subsequently immersed into silver ion solution, in which the absorbed silver ions were reduced to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in situ by a polydopamine layer.

Mapping and coring studies of the modern ooid sand bodies on GBB provide insight into the rock record from different perspectives.

However, azoles are poorly active against biofilms, echinocandins do not achieve clinically useful urinary concentrations, and amphotericin B exhibits severe toxicities. Thus, novel strategies are needed to prevent Candida UTIs, which are often associated with urinary catheter biofilms. We previously demonstrated that cranberry-derived proanthocyanidins (PACs) prevent C. albicans biofilm formation in an in vitro urinary model. To elucidate functional pathways unique to urinary biofilm development and PAC inhibition, we investigated the transcriptome of C. albicans in artificial urine (AU), with and without PACs. C. albicans biofilm and planktonic cells were cultivated with or without PACs. Genome-wide expression analysis was performed by RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes were determined using DESeq2 software; pathway analysis was performed using Cytoscape. Approximately 2,341 of 6,444 total genes were significantly expressed in biofilm relative to planktonic cells. Functional pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in filamentation, adhesion, drug response and transport were up-regulated in urinary biofilms. Genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism and nutrient response were down-regulated. In PAC-treated urinary biofilms compared to untreated control biofilms, 557 of 6,444 genes had significant changes in gene expression. Genes downregulated in PAC-treated biofilms were implicated in iron starvation and adhesion pathways. Although urinary biofilms share key features with biofilms formed in other environments, many genes are uniquely expressed in urinary biofilms. Cranberry-derived PACs interfere with the expression of iron acquisition and adhesion genes within urinary biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Anitha Sundararajan"},{"name":"Hallie S Rane"},{"name":"Thiruvarangan Ramaraj"},{"name":"Johnny Sena"},{"name":"Amy B Howell"},{"name":"Stella M Bernardo"},{"name":"Faye D Schilkey"},{"name":"Samuel A Lee"}],"keywords":[]},"article412":{"pmid":"30088919","title":"Tackling Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence by a Hydroxamic Acid-Based LasB Inhibitor.","abs":"In search of novel antibiotics to combat the challenging spread of resistant pathogens, bacterial proteases represent promising targets for pathoblocker development.

The present inhibitor was developed based on a recently reported, highly selective thiol scaffold. Using X-ray crystallography, the lack of inhibition of a range of human matrix metalloproteases could be attributed to a distinct binding mode sparing the S1' pocket. The inhibitor was shown to restore the effect of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, decrease the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilm and, for the first time for a LasB inhibitor, reduce the release of extracellular DNA. Hence, it is capable of disrupting several important bacterial resistance mechanisms.

Cytokine sequestering is a potential virulence mechanism in various bacteria and may modulate both host defense and bacterial physiology. The objective of this study was to elucidate a possible connection between natural competence and cytokine uptake in A. actinomycetemcomitans. The extramembranous domain of HofQ (emHofQ) was shown to interact with various cytokines, of which IL-8 exhibited the strongest interaction. The dissociation constant between emHofQ and IL-8 was 43 nM in static settings and 2.4 μM in dynamic settings. The moderate binding affinity is consistent with the hypothesis that emHofQ recognizes cytokines before transporting them into the cells. The interaction site was identified via crosslinking and mutational analysis. By structural comparison, relateda type I KH domain with a similar interaction site was detected in the Neisseria meningitidis secretin PilQ, which has been shown to participate in IL-8 uptake. Deletion of hofQ from the A. actinomycetemcomitans genome decreased the overall biofilm formation of this organism, abolished the response to cytokines, i.e., decreased eDNA levels in the presence of cytokines, and increased the susceptibility of the biofilm to tested β-lactams.

The pathological hallmarks of the disease are extracellular senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of pTau. These findings led to the beta-amyloid hypothesis that proposes that Aβ is the major cause of AD. Clinical trials targeting Aβ in the brain have mostly failed, whether they attempted to decrease Aβ production by BACE inhibitors or by antibodies. These failures suggest a need to find new hypotheses to explain AD pathogenesis and generate new targets for intervention to prevent and treat the disease. Many years ago, the infection hypothesis was proposed, but received little attention. However, the recent discovery that Aβ is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) acting against bacteria, fungi, and viruses gives increased credence to an infection hypothesis in the etiology of AD. We and others have shown that microbial infection increases the synthesis of this AMP. Here, we propose that the production of Aβ as an AMP will be beneficial on first microbial challenge but will become progressively detrimental as the infection becomes chronic and reactivates from time to time. Furthermore, we propose that host measures to remove excess Aβ decrease over time due to microglial senescence and microbial biofilm formation. We propose that this biofilm aggregates with Aβ to form the plaques in the brain of AD patients. In this review, we will develop this connection between Infection - Aβ - AD and discuss future possible treatments based on this paradigm.","authors":[{"name":"Tamas Fulop"},{"name":"Jacek M Witkowski"},{"name":"Karine Bourgade"},{"name":"Abdelouahed Khalil"},{"name":"Echarki Zerif"},{"name":"Anis Larbi"},{"name":"Katsuiku Hirokawa"},{"name":"Graham Pawelec"},{"name":"Christian Bocti"},{"name":"Guy Lacombe"},{"name":"Gilles Dupuis"},{"name":"Eric H Frost"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alzheimer’s disease"},{"word":"amyloid beta"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"blood–brain barrier"},{"word":"infections"},{"word":"monocytes/macrophages"},{"word":"peripheral innate immune system"},{"word":"senile plaques"}]},"article418":{"pmid":"30087323","title":"Phenotypic and molecular analysis of nontypeable Group B streptococci: identification of cps2a and hybrid cps2a/cps5 Group B streptococcal capsule gene clusters.","abs":"The Group B streptococcus (GBS) can express a capsular polysaccharide (CPS).

An important mechanism of gene regulation in UPEC is phase variation that involves inversion of a promoter-containing DNA element via enzymatic activity of tyrosine recombinases, resulting in biphasic, ON or OFF expression of target genes. The UPEC reference strain CFT073 has five tyrosine site-specific recombinases that function at two previously characterized promoter inversion systems, fimS and hyxS Three of the five recombinases are located proximally to their cognate target elements, which is typical of promoter inversion systems. The genes for the other two recombinases, IpuA and IpuB, are located distal from these sites. Here, we identified and characterized a third phase-variable invertible element in CFT073, ipuS, located proximal to ipuA and ipuB The inversion of ipuS is catalyzed by four of the five CFT073 recombinases. Orientation of the element drives transcription of a two-gene operon containing ipuR, a predicted LuxR-type regulator, and upaE, a predicted autotransporter. We show that the predicted autotransporter UpaE is surface located and facilitates biofilm formation as well as adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins in a K-12 recombinant background. Consistent with this phenotype, the ipuS ON condition in CFT073 results in defective swimming motility, increased adherence to human kidney epithelial cells, and a positive competitive kidney colonization advantage in experimental mouse UTIs.

However, the therapeutic efficiency is often limited due to the intraoperative bleeding and the limitations of instruments. Non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTP) appears to be a potential tool for periodontitis due to its promising biofilm degradation and decontamination effects. In this study, we investigated the role of NTP, as an adjuvant approach for the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis in rats. Herein we showed that SRP or SRP-NTP application attenuated the periodontitis-induced alveolar bone loss, reflected by the increased BV/TV value and the decreased CEJ-AB distance, which might be related to the lower detection rate of periodontal pathogen in SRP and SRP-NTP groups. Besides, SRP-NTP rats showed less bone loss and lower CEJ-AB distance than that of SRP group at 30d post treatment, indicating a more comprehensive and long-lasting effect of SRP-NTP. A remarkable decrease of osteoclast number and lower expression of RANKL was also detected in SRP-NTP rats. In addition, expression of inflammatory-related cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β decreased significantly in SRP-NTP group, while IL-10 level increased substantially. These results together illustrated that a combination of SRP and NTP treatment was an effective way to prevent periodontitis progress, which reduced alveolar bone loss and promoted periodontium restoration in ligature-induced periodontitis rats.

Infection of these biomaterials is a major healthcare burden, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, the cost to healthcare systems is increasing dramatically. With advances in implant design and production, research has predominately focussed on osseointegration; however, modification of implant material, surface topography and chemistry can also provide antibacterial activity. With the increasing burden of infection, it is vitally important that we consider the bacterial interaction with the biomaterial and the host when designing and manufacturing future implants. During this review, we will elucidate the interaction between patient, biomaterial surface and bacteria. We aim to review current and developing surface modifications with a view towards antibacterial orthopaedic implants for clinical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Wich Orapiriyakul"},{"name":"Peter S Young"},{"name":"Laila Damiati"},{"name":"Penelope M Tsimbouri"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biomaterials"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"orthopaedic implants"},{"word":"titanium"},{"word":"topography"}]},"article432":{"pmid":"30083146","title":"Brazilian Ironstone Plant Communities as Reservoirs of Culturable Bacteria With Diverse Biotechnological Potential.","abs":"Extensive mineral extractivism in the Brazilian Iron Quadrangle (IQ) region has destroyed large areas of land, decimating plant species, and their associated microbiota. Very little is known about the microbiota of the region; hence, cultivable bacteria associated with plants of its soils were investigated for their biotechnological potential. Samples were collected from nine plant species and six soils, and 65 cultivable bacterial isolates were obtained. These represent predominantly gram-positive bacilli (70%) capable of producing amylases (55%), proteases (63%), cellulases (47%), indole acetic acid (IAA) (46%), siderophores (26%), and to solubilize phosphate (9%). In addition, 65% of these were resistant to ampicillin, 100% were sensitive to tetracycline, and 97% were tolerant to high arsenic concentrations. Three isolates were studied further: the isolate FOB3 (Rosenbergiella sp.) produced high concentrations of IAA in vitro in the absence of tryptophan - shown by the significant improvement in plant germination and growth rate where the isolate was present. For isolates C25 (Acinetobacter sp.) and FG3 (Serratia sp.), plasmids were purified and inserted into Escherichia coli cells where they modified the physiological profile of the transformed strains. The E. coli::pFG3B strain showed the highest capacity for biofilm production, as well as an increase in the replication rate, arsenic tolerance and catalase activity. Moreover, this strain increased DNA integrity in the presence of arsenic, compared to the wild-type strain. These results help to explain the importance of bacteria in maintaining plant survival in ferruginous, rocky soils, acting as plant growth promoters, and to highlight the biotechnological potential of these bacteria.

This peptide is a feasible candidate for further pharmacological development against this bacterium, due to its physicochemical and biological characteristics, even when it is growing in a biofilm. Thus, the treatment of pre-formed biofilms with AS-48 resulted in a dose- and time-dependent disruption of the biofilm architecture beside the decrease of bacterial viability. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential of lysozyme to bolster the inhibitory activity of AS-48 against P. acnes, rendering high reductions in the MIC values, even in matrix-growing cultures, according to the results obtained using a range of microscopy and bioassay techniques. The improvement of the activity of AS-48 through its co-formulation with lysozyme may be considered an alternative in the control of P. acnes, especially after proving the absence of cytotoxicity demonstrated by these natural compounds on relevant human skin cell lines. In summary, this study supports that compositions comprising the bacteriocin AS-48 plus lysozyme must be considered as promising candidates for topical applications with medical and pharmaceutical purposes against dermatological diseases such as acne vulgaris.","authors":[{"name":"Rubén Cebrián"},{"name":"Sergio Arévalo"},{"name":"Susana Rubiño"},{"name":"Salvador Arias-Santiago"},{"name":"María Dolores Rojo"},{"name":"Manuel Montalbán-López"},{"name":"Manuel Martínez-Bueno"},{"name":"Eva Valdivia"},{"name":"Mercedes Maqueda"}],"keywords":[]},"article435":{"pmid":"30082585","title":"Green Tea Polyphenol Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate-Stearate Inhibits the Growth of Streptococcus mutans: A Promising New Approach in Caries Prevention.","abs":"Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is the main etiological bacteria present in the oral cavity that leads to dental caries. All of the S. mutans in the oral cavity form biofilms that adhere to the surfaces of teeth. Dental caries are infections facilitated by the development of biofilm. An esterified derivative of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin-3-gallate-stearate (EGCG-S), was used in this study to assess its ability to inhibit the growth and biofilm formation of S. mutans. The effect of EGCG-S on bacterial growth was evaluated with colony forming units (CFU) and log reduction; biofilm formation was qualitatively determined by Congo red assay, and quantitatively determined by crystal violet assay, fluorescence-based LIVE/DEAD assays to study the cell viability, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the morphological changes. The results indicated that EGCG-S was able to completely inhibit growth and biofilm formation at concentrations of 250 µg/mL. Its effectiveness was also compared with a commonly prescribed mouthwash in the United States, chlorhexidine gluconate. EGCG-S was shown to be equally effective in reducing S. mutans growth as chlorhexidine gluconate. In conclusion, EGCG-S is potentially an anticariogenic agent by reducing bacterial presence in the oral cavity.","authors":[{"name":"Amy Lynn Melok"},{"name":"Lee H Lee"},{"name":"Siti Ayuni Mohamed Yussof"},{"name":"Tinchun Chu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"colony forming assay"},{"word":"epigallocatechin-3-gallate-stearate"}]},"article436":{"pmid":"30082394","title":"Cargo transport shapes the spatial organization of a microbial community.","abs":"The human microbiome is an assemblage of diverse bacteria that interact with one another to form communities. Bacteria in a given community are arranged in a 3D matrix with many degrees of freedom. Snapshots of the community display well-defined structures, but the steps required for their assembly are not understood. Here, we show that this construction is carried out with the help of gliding bacteria. Gliding is defined as the motion of cells over a solid or semisolid surface without the necessity of growth or the aid of pili or flagella. Genomic analysis suggests that gliding bacteria are present in human microbial communities. We focus on Capnocytophaga gingivalis, which is present in abundance in the human oral microbiome. Tracking of fluorescently labeled single cells and of gas bubbles carried by fluid flow shows that swarms of C. gingivalis are layered, with cells in the upper layers moving more rapidly than those in the lower layers. Thus, cells also glide on top of one another. Cells of nonmotile bacterial species attach to the surface of C. gingivalis and are propelled as cargo. The cargo cell moves along the length of a C. gingivalis cell, looping from one pole to the other. Multicolor fluorescent spectral imaging of cells of different live but nonmotile bacterial species reveals their long-range transport in a polymicrobial community. A swarm of C. gingivalis transports some nonmotile bacterial species more efficiently than others and helps to shape the spatial organization of a polymicrobial community.","authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Shrivastava"},{"name":"Visha K Patel"},{"name":"Yisha Tang"},{"name":"Susan Connolly Yost"},{"name":"Floyd E Dewhirst"},{"name":"Howard C Berg"}],"keywords":[{"word":"cargo transport"},{"word":"gliding"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"polymicrobial biofilm"},{"word":"swarm"}]},"article437":{"pmid":"30082282","title":"The PA3177 Gene Encodes an Active Diguanylate Cyclase That Contributes to Biofilm Antimicrobial Tolerance but Not Biofilm Formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"A hallmark of biofilms is their heightened resistance to antimicrobial agents. Recent findings suggested a role for bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) in the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents; however, no c-di-GMP modulating enzyme(s) contributing to the drug tolerance phenotype of biofilms has been identified. The goal of this study was to determine whether c-di-GMP modulating enzyme(s) specifically contributes to the biofilm drug tolerance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Using transcriptome sequencing combined with biofilm susceptibility assays, we identified PA3177 encoding a probable diguanylate cyclase. PA3177 was confirmed to be an active diguanylate cyclase, with overexpression affecting swimming and swarming motility, and inactivation affecting cellular c-di-GMP levels of biofilm but not planktonic cells. Inactivation of PA3177 rendered P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms susceptible to tobramycin and hydrogen peroxide. Inactivation of PA3177 also eliminated the recalcitrance of biofilms to killing by tobramycin, with multicopy expression of PA3177 but not PA3177_GGAAF harboring substitutions in the active site, restoring tolerance to wild-type levels. Susceptibility was linked to BrlR, a previously described transcriptional regulator contributing to biofilm tolerance, with inactivation of PA3177 negatively impacting BrlR levels and BrlR-DNA binding. While PA3177 contributed to biofilm drug tolerance, inactivation of PA3177 had no effect on attachment and biofilm formation. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that biofilm drug tolerance by P. aeruginosa is linked to a specific c-di-GMP modulating enzyme, PA3177, with the pool of PA3177-generated c-di-GMP only contributing to biofilm drug tolerance but not to biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Bandita Poudyal"},{"name":"Karin Sauer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BrlR"},{"word":"EMSA"},{"word":"PA3177"},{"word":"biofilm drug tolerance"},{"word":"biofilm susceptibility"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"diguanylate cyclase"},{"word":"immunoblot"}]},"article438":{"pmid":"30081836","title":"Restriction of in vivo infection by antifouling coating on urinary catheter with controllable and sustained silver release: a proof of concept study.","abs":"Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections are among the most common urological infections world-wide.
