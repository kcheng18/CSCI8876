Sarcochlamys pulcherrima (Roxb.) Gaud. is an ethnomedicinal plant traditionally used for its anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory property. In the present study two triterpenoids, have been isolated from this plant, characterised and evaluated for their antibacterial and antibiofilm potential against P. aeruginosa. Compounds were characterised as 2α, 3β, 19α-trihydroxy-urs-12-ene-28-oic acid (Tormentic acid) and 2α, 3β, 23-trihydroxyurs-12-ene-28-oic acid (23-hydroxycorosolic acid) through spectroscopic studies viz. infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectroscopy (MS). Depolarization of bacterial membrane and zone of inhibition studies revealed that both the compounds inhibited the growth of planktonic bacteria. Compounds were also found to inhibit the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilm. Inhibition of biofilm found to be mediated through suppressed secretion of pyoverdin, protease and swarming motility of P. aeruginosa. Gene expression study, in silico binding analysis, in vivo bacterial load and tissue histology observations also supported the antibiofilm activity of both the compounds.

The initial evolution of such cooperation is likely to involve interactions that produce non-additive fitness effects among small groups of individuals in local populations. However, most models for the evolution of cooperation have focused on genealogically related individuals, assume that the factors influencing individual fitness are deterministic, that populations are very large, and that the benefits of cooperation increase linearly with the number of cooperative interactions. Here we show that stochasticity and non-additive interactions can facilitate the evolution of cooperation in small local groups. We derive a generalized model for the evolution of cooperation and show that if cooperation reduces the variance in individual fitness (separate from its effect on average fitness), this can aid in the evolution of cooperation through directional stochastic effects. In addition, we show that the potential for the evolution of cooperation is influenced by non-additivity in benefits with cooperation being more likely to evolve when the marginal benefit of a cooperative act increases with the number of such acts. Our model compliments traditional cooperation models (kin selection, reciprocal cooperation, green beard effect, etc.) and applies to a broad range of cooperative interactions seen in nature.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah E Fumagalli"},{"name":"Sean H Rice"}],"keywords":[]},"article5":{"pmid":"31790395","title":"CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene deletion of the ompA gene in symbiotic Cedecea neteri impairs biofilm formation and reduces gut colonization of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.","abs":"Symbiotic bacteria are pervasive in mosquitoes and their presence can influence many host phenotypes that affect vectoral capacity.

Simple models of signal propagation in heterogenous media, such as percolation theory, can potentially provide a quantitative understanding of these processes, but it is unclear whether these simple models properly capture the complexities of multicellular systems. We recently discovered that in biofilms of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the propagation of an electrical signal is statistically consistent with percolation theory, and yet it is reasonable to suspect that key features of this system go beyond the simple assumptions of basic percolation theory. Indeed, we find here that the probability for a cell to signal is not independent from other cells as assumed in percolation theory, but instead is correlated with its nearby neighbors. We develop a mechanistic model, in which correlated signaling emerges from cell division, phenotypic inheritance, and cell displacement, that reproduces the experimentally observed correlations. We find that the correlations do not significantly affect the spatial statistics, which we rationalize using a renormalization argument. Moreover, the fraction of signaling cells is not constant in space, as assumed in percolation theory, but instead varies within and across biofilms. We find that this feature lowers the fraction of signaling cells at which one observes the characteristic power-law statistics of cluster sizes, consistent with our experimental results. We validate the model using a mutant biofilm whose signaling probability decays along the propagation direction. Our results reveal key statistical features of a correlated signaling process in a multicellular community. More broadly, our results identify extensions to percolation theory that do or do not alter its predictions and may be more appropriate for biological systems.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoling Zhai"},{"name":"Joseph W Larkin"},{"name":"Kaito Kikuchi"},{"name":"Samuel E Redford"},{"name":"Ushasi Roy"},{"name":"Gürol M Süel"},{"name":"Andrew Mugler"}],"keywords":[]},"article7":{"pmid":"31790115","title":"A lipase-responsive antifungal nanoplatform for synergistic photodynamic/photothermal/pharmaco-therapy of azole-resistant Candida albicans infections.","abs":"A lipase-triggered drug release nanoplatform (PGL-DPP-FLU NPs) for multi-modal antifungal therapy is developed.

However, the functional mechanisms of these regulators remain unclear. In this study, we identified a LuxR-type regulator that contains a cheY-homologous receiver (REC) domain in its N terminus and designated it AclR1.

Functional analysis of an aclR1 deletion mutant (ΔaclR1) in the free-living state showed that AclR1 positively regulated cell motility and flocculation but negatively regulated exopolysaccharide production, biofilm formation, and second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP)-related gene expression. In the symbiotic state, the ΔaclR1 mutant was defective in competitive colonization and nodulation on host plants.

Therefore, results obtained following inactivation of single-species biofilms by means of different technologies (e.g., Cold Atmospheric Plasma, CAP) should be validated for multi-species biofilms. First, a strongly adherent and mature Listeria monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium dual-species biofilm was developed by altering different incubation conditions, i.e., growth medium, incubation temperature, inoculum ratio of L. monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium cells, and incubation time. Adherence and maturity were quantified by means of optical density measurements and viable plate counts, respectively. Secondly, both the (1 day old) reference biofilm and a more mature 7 days old biofilm were treated for different CAP treatment times (0-30 min). Viable plate counts were again used to determine the (remaining) cell density. For both the biofilm development and inactivation, predictive models were applied to describe the growth/inactivation kinetics. Finally, the kinetics of the [1 and 7 day(s) old] dual-species biofilms were compared with those obtained for the corresponding single-species biofilms. Results implied that a strongly adherent and mature reference dual-species biofilm was obtained following 24 h of incubation at 25°C using 20-fold diluted TSB and an inoculum ratio of 1:1. Main observations regarding CAP inactivation were: (i) the dual-species biofilm age had no influence on the CAP efficacy, although a longer treatment time was required for the oldest biofilm, (ii) for the 1 day old biofilms, CAP treatment became less efficient for S. Typhimurium inactivation when this species was part of the dual-species biofilm, while L. monocytogenes inactivation was not influenced by the biofilm type, and (iii) for the 7 days old biofilms, CAP inactivation of both species became more efficient when they were part of the dual-species biofilms.

Hpa2 belongs to GNAT superfamily and GNATs are well known for the formation of homo-oligomers. However, the reason behind their oligomerization remained unexplored. Here, oligomeric states of Hpa2 were explored, to understand the functional significance of oligomerization. Biochemical analysis suggests that Hpa2 exists as dimer in solution and self-assembles into tetramer in the spermine, spermidine and kanamycin bound form. Stability analysis with denaturants concludes that homo-oligomerization of Hpa2 relies on bound substrate and not on experimental conditions. Homo-oligomerization in Hpa2 depicts direct correlation with its polyamine acetylating capacity. This correlation and in silico model structures suggest that oligomerization of Hpa2 is associated with the hastening of acetylation process. Interestingly, polyamine acetylation down regulates biofilms formation in E. coli BL21/Hpa2-transformants cells. Therefore, we propose that Hpa2 manipulates survival strategies of the bacterium via polyamines and antibiotics acetylation.","authors":[{"name":"Jyoti Singh Tomar"},{"name":"Ramakrishna Vijayacharya Hosur"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acetylation"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Cross-linking"},{"word":"Homo-oligomer"},{"word":"Polyamine"}]},"article25":{"pmid":"31785561","title":"Evaluation of a biological post-treatment after full-scale ozonation at a municipal wastewater treatment plant.","abs":"To reduce the discharge of trace organic compounds into water bodies associated with potential toxic effects such as endocrine disruption, new advanced treatment methods are being investigated at several wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).

To prevent microbial infections, flower nectars and stigma exudates contain various antimicrobial compounds. Erwinia amylovora, the causing bacterium of the devastating fire blight apple disease, is the model pathogen that multiplies in flower secretions and infects through the nectaries. Although Erwinia-resistant apples are not available, certain cultivars are tolerant. It was reported that in flower infection assay, the 'Freedom' cultivar was Erwinia tolerant, while the 'Jonagold' cultivar was susceptible. We hypothesized that differences in the nectar protein compositions lead to different susceptibility. Indeed, we found that an acidic chitinase III protein (Machi3-1) selectively accumulates to very high levels in the nectar and the stigma exudate of the 'Freedom' cultivar. We show that three different Machi3-1 alleles exist in apple cultivars and that only the 5B-Machi3-1 allele expresses the Machi3-1 protein in the nectar and the stigma exudate. We demonstrate that the 5B-Machi3-1 allele was introgressed from the Malus floribunda 821 clone into different apple cultivars including the 'Freedom'.

As we found that in vitro, the Machi3-1 protein impairs growth and biofilm formation of Erwinia at physiological concentration, we propose that the Machi3-1 protein could partially protect 5B-Machi3-1 allele containing cultivars against Erwinia by inhibiting the multiplication and biofilm formation of the pathogen in the stigma exudate and in the nectar.","authors":[{"name":"Anita Kurilla"},{"name":"Timea Toth"},{"name":"Laszlo Dorgai"},{"name":"Zsuzsanna Darula"},{"name":"Tamas Lakatos"},{"name":"Daniel Silhavy"},{"name":"Zoltan Kerenyi"},{"name":"Geza Dallmann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acidic chitinase"},{"word":"Antibacterial effect"},{"word":"Erwinia amylovora"},{"word":"MYB305"},{"word":"Nectar- and stigma-specific transcription"},{"word":"Promoter repeat"}]},"article46":{"pmid":"31781689","title":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in periodontal sites of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals in North Brazil: a cross-sectional study.","abs":"This study aimed to investigate the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) prevalence and viral load in subgingival sites of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) positive (HIV+) individuals, correlating subgingival EBV load to the clinical periodontal condition, HIV systemic load, EBV systemic load, and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).","authors":[{"name":"Humberto Jácome-Santos"},{"name":"Thalita de Almeida Amanajás"},{"name":"Samara Tatielle Monteiro Gomes"},{"name":"Luiz Fernando Almeida Machado"},{"name":"Armando Rodrigues Lopes Pereira Neto"},{"name":"Sérgio de Melo Alves Junior"},{"name":"João de Jesus Viana Pinheiro"},{"name":"Bruno Pereira Alves"},{"name":"Ana Cláudia Braga Amoras-Alves"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)"},{"word":"antiretroviral therapy"},{"word":"human herpesvirus-4"},{"word":"periodontal pocket"},{"word":"﻿HIV-1"},{"word":"﻿periodontal diseases"}]},"article47":{"pmid":"31781595","title":"Effects of Norspermidine on Dual-Species Biofilms Composed of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis.","abs":"The present study aimed at investigating the influence of norspermidine on the formation of dual-species biofilms composed of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis).

Nucleic acids and the complexes that they form with proteins-including chromatin and ribonucleoproteins-are the main autoantigens in the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). How these nuclear molecules become available to the immune system for recognition, presentation, and targeting is an area of research where complexities remain to be disentangled. In this review, we discuss how bacterial infections participate in the exposure of nuclear autoantigens to the immune system in SLE. Infections can instigate pro-inflammatory cell death programs including pyroptosis and NETosis, induce extracellular release of host nuclear autoantigens, and promote their recognition in an immunogenic context by activating the innate and adaptive immune systems. Moreover, bacterial infections can release bacterial DNA associated with other bacterial molecules, complexes that can elicit autoimmunity by acting as innate stimuli of pattern recognition receptors and activating autoreactive B cells through molecular mimicry. Recent studies have highlighted SLE disease activity-associated alterations of the gut commensals and the expansion of pathobionts that can contribute to chronic exposure to extracellular nuclear autoantigens. A novel field in the study of autoimmunity is the contribution of bacterial biofilms to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Biofilms are multicellular communities of bacteria that promote colonization during chronic infections. We review the very recent literature highlighting a role for bacterial biofilms, and their major components, amyloid/DNA complexes, in the generation of anti-nuclear autoantibodies and their ability to stimulate the autoreactive immune response. The best studied bacterial amyloid is curli, produced by enteric bacteria that commonly cause infections in SLE patients, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella spps. Evidence suggests that curli/DNA complexes can trigger autoimmunity by acting as danger signals, molecular mimickers, and microbial chaperones of nucleic acids.","authors":[{"name":"Connie C Qiu"},{"name":"Roberto Caricchio"},{"name":"Stefania Gallucci"}],"keywords":[{"word":"autoantibodies"},{"word":"autoantigens"},{"word":"bacterial infections"},{"word":"extracellular DNA"},{"word":"lupus (SLE)"}]},"article49":{"pmid":"31781106","title":"Host-Microbial Interactions in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Periodontitis.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Larissa Pessoa"},{"name":"Gajender Aleti"},{"name":"Saibyasachi Choudhury"},{"name":"Daniel Nguyen"},{"name":"Tina Yaskell"},{"name":"Yun Zhang"},{"name":"Weizhong Li"},{"name":"Karen E Nelson"},{"name":"Leopoldo Luiz Santos Neto"},{"name":"Adriana C P Sant'Ana"},{"name":"Marcelo Freire"}],"keywords":[{"word":"autoimmunity"},{"word":"cytokines"},{"word":"gingival crevicular fluid"},{"word":"host-microbes"},{"word":"oral-systemic"},{"word":"periodontal diseases"}]},"article50":{"pmid":"31781084","title":"A Field Study Into Hong Kong's Wet Markets: Raised Questions Into the Hygienic Maintenance of Meat Contact Surfaces and the Dissemination of Microorganisms Associated With Nosocomial Infections.","abs":"Millions every day purchase their raw meat in wet markets around the globe, especially in Hong Kong city, where modern and a traditional way of living is made possible.

Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are among the most common cause of GN-PJI and ciprofloxacin is the first-line antibiotic. Due to emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance, we evaluated in vitro the activity of fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, alone and in combinations, against E. coli and P. aeruginosa biofilms. Conventional microbiological tests and isothermal microcalorimetry were applied to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of the selected antibiotics against standard laboratory strains as well as clinical strains isolated from patients with prosthetic joint associated infections. The biofilm susceptibility to each antibiotic varied widely among strains, while fosfomycin presented a poor anti-biofilm activity against P. aeruginosa. Synergism of two-pair antibiotic combinations was observed against different clinical strains from both species. Highest synergism was found for the fosfomycin/gentamicin combination against the biofilm of E. coli strains (75%), including a gentamicin-resistant but fosfomycin-susceptible strain, whereas the gentamicin/ciprofloxacin combination presented synergism with higher frequency against the biofilm of P. aeruginosa strains (71.4%). A hypothetical bacteriolysis effect of gentamicin could explain why combinations with this antibiotic seem to be particularly effective. Still, the underlying mechanism of the synergistic effect on biofilms is unknown. In conclusion, combinatorial antibiotic application has shown to be more effective against biofilms compared to monotherapy.

Environmental RNA (eRNA) is thought to degrade faster than eDNA, however to our knowledge, no experimental studies have explored this. Here we present an aquarium study to investigate eDNA and eRNA shedding rates and degradation for two sessile marine invertebrates. The copy numbers for eDNA and eRNA were assessed using droplet digital PCR targeting the mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene. Environmental RNA persisted after organism removal for much longer than expected with detections for up to 13 h. In contrast, eDNA was detected is samples collected up to 94 h after organism removal. There was no evidence that the decay rates constants for eDNA and eRNA were different (p = 0.6, Kruskal-Wallis tests). Both eDNA and eRNA was detected in biofilms collected at the end of the experiment (day 21). This suggests binding with organic or inorganic compounds or stabilization of these molecules in the biofilm matrix.

They are promising novel antimicrobials since they have shown bactericidal effects against multiresistant bacteria. Their amphiphilic structure with hydrophobic and cationic regions drives their interaction with anionic bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, which leads to their disruption. In this work two synthetic designed AMPs, P5 and P6.2, which have been previously analyzed in their ability to interact with bacterial or eukaryotic membranes, were evaluated in their anti-biofilm and in vivo antibacterial activity. In a first step, a time-kill kinetic assay against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and a curve for hemolytic activity were performed in order to determine the killing rate and the possible undesirable toxic effect, respectively, for both peptides. The biofilm inhibitory activity was quantified at sub MIC concentrations of the peptides and the results showed that P5 displayed antibiofilm activity on both strains while P6.2 only on S. aureus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of bacteria treated with peptides at their MIC revealed protruding blisters on Gam-negative P. aeruginosa strain, but almost no visible surface alteration on Gram-positive S. aureus. These micrographs highlighted different manifestations of the membrane-disrupting activity that these kinds of peptides possess. Finally, both peptides were analyzed in vivo, in the lungs of neutropenic mice previously instilled with P. aeruginosa. Mice lungs were surgically extracted and bacteria and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-β, IL-6 and TNF-α) were quantified by colony forming units and ELISA, respectively. Results showed that instillation of the peptides produced a significant decrease in the number of living bacteria in the lungs, concomitant with a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), a Pa quorum sensing molecule, also chelates Fe, and delivers Fe to the Pa cell membrane using Pa siderophores. In models of Af biofilm formation or preformed biofilms, PQS inhibited Af in a low Fe environment. AfΔsidA (mutant unable to produce siderophores) biofilm was more sensitive to PQS inhibition than wild-type (WT), as was planktonic AfΔsidA growth. PQS decreased WT Af growth on agar. All these inhibitory actions were reversed by Fe. The Pa siderophore pyoverdin, or Af siderophore inhibitor celastrol, act cooperatively with PQS in Af inhibition. These findings all indicate PQS inhibition is owing to Fe chelation. Remarkably, in high Fe environments, PQS enhanced Af biofilm at 1/100 to 1/2000 Fe concentration required for Fe alone to enhance. Planktonic Af growth, and on agar, Af conidiation, were also enhanced by PQS+Fe compared to Fe alone. In contrast, neither AfΔsidA biofilm, nor planktonic AfΔsidA, were enhanced by PQS-Fe compared to Fe. When Af siderophore ferricrocin (FC),+PQS, were added to AfΔsidA, Af was then boosted more than by FC alone. Moreover, FC+PQS+Fe boosted AfΔsidA more than Fe, FC, FC+Fe, PQS+FC or PQS+Fe. Thus PQS-Fe maximal stimulation requires Af siderophores. PQS inhibits Af via chelation under low Fe conditions. In a high Fe environment, PQS paradoxically stimulates Af efficiently, and this involves Af siderophores. PQS production by Pa could stimulate Af in cystic fibrosis airways, where Fe homeostasis is altered and Fe levels increase, supporting fungal growth.","authors":[{"name":"Hasan Nazik"},{"name":"Gabriele Sass"},{"name":"Shajia R Ansari"},{"name":"Reyhan Ertekin"},{"name":"Hubertus Haas"},{"name":"Eric Déziel"},{"name":"David A Stevens"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aspergillus"},{"word":"Iron"},{"word":"PQS"},{"word":"Pseudomonas"}]},"article69":{"pmid":"31778072","title":"Bioactive extracts of Carum copticum and thymol inhibit biofilm development by multidrug-resistant extended spectrum β-lactamase producing enteric bacteria.","abs":"The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria is a clinical problem that requires novel anti-infective agents.

The effects of grafting agent and peroxide concentrations on grafting reaction and the physical and thermal properties of the functionalized polyesters were investigated. Compounding of the functionalized polyesters with different weight portions of chitosan was accomplished in a discontinuous internal mixer by in-situ functionalization, followed by blending with chitosan. The titration method, scanning electron microscopy, DSC, FTIR and mechanical characterization of the composites showed good interfacial adhesion and suggest the formation of covalent bonds between functional groups of the polyesters and chitosan, especially for the samples functionalized with GMA. The molecular weights (Mw) of the samples showed a change in the molecular weight related to the thermal degradation of the sample. The Mw of the samples grafted with MAH are lower than those functionalized with GMA.

In this study, polypyrrole was applied in biofilm formation assays with the S. mutans strains UA159 and its gtfB and gtfC double mutant (gtfBC mutant), S. sanguinis, S. mitis and S. gordonii on human saliva and bovine serum albumin-coated 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 0.25% sucrose. The effects of polypyrrole on biofilm formation were quantitatively and qualitatively observed. High concentrations of polypyrrole significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of S. mutans UA159 and S. sanguinis. As an inhibition mechanism, polypyrrole attached to the surface of bacterial cells, increased chains and aggregates, and incorporated proteins involving GTF-I and GTF-SI produced by S. mutans. In contrast, the biofilm formation of gtfBC mutant, S. sanguinis, S. mitis and S. gordonii was temporarily induced by the addition of low polypyrrole concentrations on human saliva-coated plate but not on the uncoated and bovine serum albumin-coated plates. Moreover, biofilm formation depended on live cells and, likewise, specific interaction between cells and binding components in saliva.

Antimicrobial treatment of these infections often fails, leading to expensive surgical intervention and increased risk of mortality to the patient. The challenge in treating these infections is associated with the high tolerance of S. aureus biofilm to antibiotics. MazEF, a toxin-antitoxin system, is thought to be an important regulator of this phenotype, but its physiological function in S. aureus is controversial. Here, we examined the role of MazEF in developing chronic infections by comparing growth and antibiotic tolerance phenotypes in three S. aureus strains to their corresponding strains with disruption of mazF expression. Strains lacking mazF production showed increased biofilm growth and decreased biofilm antibiotic tolerance. Deletion of icaADBC in the mazF::Tn background suppressed the growth phenotype observed with mazF-disrupted strains, suggesting the phenotype was ica dependent. We confirmed these phenotypes in our murine animal model. Loss of mazF resulted in increased bacterial burden and decreased survival rate of mice compared to its wild-type strain demonstrating that loss of the mazF gene caused an increase in S. aureus virulence. Although lack of mazF gene expression increased S. aureus virulence, it was more susceptible to antibiotics in vivo Combined, the ability of mazF to inhibit biofilm formation and promote biofilm antibiotic tolerance plays a critical role in transitioning from an acute to chronic infection that is difficult to eradicate with antibiotics alone.","authors":[{"name":"Dongzhu Ma"},{"name":"Jonathan B Mandell"},{"name":"Niles P Donegan"},{"name":"Ambrose L Cheung"},{"name":"Wanyan Ma"},{"name":"Scott Rothenberger"},{"name":"Robert M Q Shanks"},{"name":"Anthony R Richardson"},{"name":"Kenneth L Urish"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MazF"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"icaADBC"},{"word":"periprosthetic joint infection"},{"word":"surgical infection"},{"word":"toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems"}]},"article86":{"pmid":"31772058","title":"Evolution and Global Transmission of a Multidrug-Resistant, Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Lineage from the Indian Subcontinent.","abs":"The evolution and global transmission of antimicrobial resistance have been well documented for Gram-negative bacteria and health care-associated epidemic pathogens, often emerging from regions with heavy antimicrobial use. However, the degree to which similar processes occur with Gram-positive bacteria in the community setting is less well understood. In this study, we traced the recent origins and global spread of a multidrug-resistant, community-associated Staphylococcus aureus lineage from the Indian subcontinent, the Bengal Bay clone (ST772). We generated whole-genome sequence data of 340 isolates from 14 countries, including the first isolates from Bangladesh and India, to reconstruct the evolutionary history and genomic epidemiology of the lineage. Our data show that the clone emerged on the Indian subcontinent in the early 1960s and disseminated rapidly in the 1990s. Short-term outbreaks in community and health care settings occurred following intercontinental transmission, typically associated with travel and family contacts on the subcontinent, but ongoing endemic transmission was uncommon. Acquisition of a multidrug resistance integrated plasmid was instrumental in the emergence of a single dominant and globally disseminated clade in the early 1990s. Phenotypic data on biofilm, growth, and toxicity point to antimicrobial resistance as the driving force in the evolution of ST772.

At the level of individual cells, the role of mechanical forces is well recognized in eukaryotic physiology, but much less is known about prokaryotic organisms. Recent findings suggest an effect of physical forces on bacterial shape, cell division, motility, virulence, and biofilm initiation, but it remains unclear how mechanical forces applied to a bacterium are translated at the molecular level. In Gram-negative bacteria, multicomponent protein complexes can form rigid links across the cell envelope and are therefore subject to physical forces experienced by the cell. Here we manipulate tensile and shear mechanical stress in the bacterial cell envelope and use single-molecule tracking to show that octahedral shear (but not hydrostatic) stress within the cell envelope promotes disassembly of the tripartite efflux complex CusCBA, a system used by Escherichia coli to resist copper and silver toxicity. By promoting disassembly of this protein complex, mechanical forces within the cell envelope make the bacteria more susceptible to metal toxicity. These findings demonstrate that mechanical forces can inhibit the function of cell envelope protein assemblies in bacteria and suggest the possibility that other multicomponent, transenvelope efflux complexes may be sensitive to mechanical forces including complexes involved in antibiotic resistance, cell division, and translocation of outer membrane components. By modulating the function of proteins within the cell envelope, mechanical stress has the potential to regulate multiple processes required for bacterial survival and growth.","authors":[{"name":"Lauren A Genova"},{"name":"Melanie F Roberts"},{"name":"Yu-Chern Wong"},{"name":"Christine E Harper"},{"name":"Ace George Santiago"},{"name":"Bing Fu"},{"name":"Abhishek Srivastava"},{"name":"Won Jung"},{"name":"Lucy M Wang"},{"name":"Łukasz Krzemiński"},{"name":"Xianwen Mao"},{"name":"Xuanhao Sun"},{"name":"Chung-Yuen Hui"},{"name":"Peng Chen"},{"name":"Christopher J Hernandez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biomechanics"},{"word":"diffusion dynamics"},{"word":"extrusion loading"},{"word":"multicomponent efflux complex"},{"word":"single-molecule imaging"}]},"article88":{"pmid":"31771981","title":"Peptidoglycomics reveals compositional changes in peptidoglycan between biofilm- and planktonic-derived Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Peptidoglycan (PG) is a critical component of the bacterial cell wall and is composed of a repeating β-1,4-linked disaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid appended with a highly conserved stem peptide.

Our phenotypic assays revealed that (i) social trait expression profiles varied dramatically; (ii) correlations between traits were frequent, exclusively positive and sometimes habitat-specific; and (iii) heterogeneous (specialised) trait repertoires were rarer than homogeneous (unspecialised) repertoires. Our results show that most isolates lie on a continuum between a 'social' type producing multiple public goods, and an 'asocial' type showing low investment into social traits. This segregation could reflect local adaptation to different microhabitats, or emerge from interactions between different social strategies. In the latter case, our findings suggest that the scope for competition among unspecialised isolates exceeds the scope for mutualistic exchange of different public goods between specialised isolates.

In this context, supported lipid bilayers provide a suitable platform to investigate membrane proteins by a broad range of surface-sensitive techniques such as neutron reflectometry (NR), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and fluorescence microscopy. Nevertheless, the successful incorporation of membrane proteins in lipid bilayers with sufficiently high concentration and controlled orientation relative to the bilayer remains challenging. We propose the unconventional use of peptide discs made by phospholipids and amphipathic 18A peptides to mediate the formation of supported phospholipid bilayers with two different types of membrane proteins, CorA and tissue factor (TF). The membrane proteins are reconstituted in peptide discs, deposited on a solid surface, and the peptide molecules are then removed with extensive buffer washes. This leaves a lipid bilayer with a relatively high density of membrane proteins on the support surface. As a very important feature, the strategy allows membrane proteins with one large extramembrane domain to be oriented in the bilayer, thus mimicking the in vivo situation. The method is highly versatile, and we show its general applicability by characterizing with the above-mentioned surface-sensitive techniques two different membrane proteins, which were efficiently loaded in the supported bilayers with ∼0.6% mol/mol (protein/lipid) concentration corresponding to 35% v/v for CorA and 8% v/v for TF. Altogether, the peptide disc mediated formation of supported lipid bilayers with membrane proteins represents an attractive strategy for producing samples for structural and functional investigations of membrane proteins and for preparation of suitable platforms for drug testing or biosensor development.","authors":[{"name":"Alessandra Luchini"},{"name":"Frederik Grønbæk Tidemand"},{"name":"Nicolai Tidemand Johansen"},{"name":"Mario Campana"},{"name":"Javier Sotres"},{"name":"Michael Ploug"},{"name":"Marité Cárdenas"},{"name":"Lise Arleth"}],"keywords":[]},"article105":{"pmid":"31769530","title":"Intracellular survival and innate immune evasion of Burkholderia cepacia: Improved understanding of quorum sensing-controlled virulence factors, biofilm, and inhibitors.","abs":"Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are opportunistic pathogens implicated with nosocomial infections, and high rates of morbidity and mortality, especially in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).

In S. marcescens, quorum sensing (QS) mechanism coordinates the population-dependent behaviors and regulates the virulence factors production. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising alternative for the treatment of infections caused by drug resistant bacteria. Although PDI should be applied at lethal doses, it is possible that during PDI treatment, pathogens encounter sub-lethal doses of PDI (sPDI). sPDI cannot kill microorganisms, but it can considerably influence the microbial virulence. So, in this study, the effect of methylene blue (MB)-mediated PDI on QS-mediated virulence factor production and biofilm formation of S. marcescens at lethal and sub-lethal doses was evaluated. The biofilm formation and virulence factor production of S. marcescens ATCC 13,880 and S. marcescens Sm2 were assessed before and after PDI treatment. Besides, the effect of lethal and sub-lethal PDI on expression of bsmA and bsmB (Biofilm maturation), fimA and fimC (Major fimbrial protein), flhD (Regulator of flagellar mediated swarming and swimming motility) and swrR (AHL-dependent regulator) genes were evaluated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Lethal and sub-lethal PDI resulted in a significant decrease in biofilm formation, swimming/swarming motility, and pigment and hemolysin production ability of S. marcescens strains. bsmA, bsmB, flhD and swrR genes were down-regulated after PDI treatments. In conclusion, QS-mediated virulence factor production and biofilm formation ability of the two studied S. marcescens strains decreased after both lethal and sub-lethal PDI.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Fekrirad"},{"name":"Nasim Kashef"},{"name":"Ehsan Arefian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Photodynamic inactivation"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"Serratia marcescens"},{"word":"Virulence factors"}]},"article110":{"pmid":"31768614","title":"Regulation and controlling the motility properties of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Chronic infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been a major concern as their spread and mortality continue to be on the rise.

Therefore, attenuating motility properties can be considered as highly potential for controlling P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. This strategy has employed the use of various natural and chemically synthesized compounds.

The extracellular matrix is responsible for protecting microorganisms against environmental stress, hosts the immune system and confers resistance to antimicrobials. Fusarium keratoplasticum is a common species of FSSC (Fusarium solani species complex) associated with human infections, being the most prevalent species related to biofilm formation in hospital water systems and internal pipelines. With this in mind, this study aimed to characterise the biofilm formed by the fungus F. keratoplasticum and to evaluate the effects of farnesol, a fungal quorum sensing (QS) molecule, on the preformed biofilm and also during its formation at different times (adhesion and 24, 48 and 72 h). F. keratoplasticum is able to adhere to an abiotic surface and form a dense biofilm in 72 h, with increased total biomass and matrix modulation with the presence of extracellular DNA, RNA, polysaccharides and proteins. Farnesol exhibited important anti-biofilm activity, causing the destruction of hyphae and the extracellular matrix in preformed biofilm and preventing the adhesion of conidia, filamentation and the formation of biofilm. Few studies have characterised the formation of biofilm by filamentous fungi.

The regulatory system responsible for prioritizing preferred substrates is known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Two broad classes of CCR have been documented in the literature. The best described CCR strategy, referred to here as classic CCR (cCCR), has been experimentally and theoretically studied using model organisms such as Escherichia coli. cCCR phenotypes are often used to generalize universal strategies for fitness, sometimes incorrectly. For instance, extremely competitive microorganisms, such as Pseudomonads, which arguably have broader global distributions than E. coli, have achieved their success using metabolic strategies that are nearly opposite of cCCR. These organisms utilize a CCR strategy termed 'reverse CCR' (rCCR), because the order of preferred substrates is nearly reverse that of cCCR. rCCR phenotypes prefer organic acids over glucose, may or may not select preferred substrates to optimize growth rates, and do not allocate intracellular resources in a manner that produces an overflow metabolism. cCCR and rCCR have traditionally been interpreted from the perspective of monocultures, even though most microorganisms live in consortia. Here, we review the basic tenets of the two CCR strategies and consider these phenotypes from the perspective of resource acquisition in consortia, a scenario that surely influenced the evolution of cCCR and rCCR. For instance, cCCR and rCCR metabolism are near mirror images of each other; when considered from a consortium basis, the complementary properties of the two strategies can mitigate direct competition for energy and nutrients and instead establish cooperative division of labor.","authors":[{"name":"Heejoon Park"},{"name":"S Lee McGill"},{"name":"Adrienne D Arnold"},{"name":"Ross P Carlson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Carbon catabolic repression"},{"word":"Diauxie"},{"word":"Division of labor"},{"word":"Overflow metabolism"},{"word":"Reverse carbon catabolic repression"}]},"article113":{"pmid":"31768404","title":"Oral Fungal Microbiota: To Thrush and Beyond.","abs":"The oral microbiota is complex, multikingdom, interactive, and involves extensive biofilm formation.

Here, we systematically investigate this question in the model organism Escherichia coli, varying cell density, cell length, and suspension confinement. The characteristics of the collective motion indicate that hydrodynamic interactions between swimmers made the primary contribution to its emergence. We observe that the chemotactic drift is moderately enhanced at intermediate cell densities, peaks, and is then strongly suppressed at higher densities. Numerical simulations reveal that this suppression occurs because the collective motion disturbs the choreography necessary for chemotactic sensing.

Biofilm samples were collected, cultivated in a hydrodynamic flume for six weeks, and then exposed in polystyrene (PS) beads (100 nm in size) with different NP concentrations (1, 5, and 10 mg/L). BIOLOG ECO microplates were used to quantify carbon source utilization characteristics. The data were analyzed using average well-color development (AWCD), functional diversity indices, and principle component analysis (PCA). Results showed that the total carbon metabolic functions (represented by AWCD) remained constant (p > 0.05) with elevated NP concentrations, but some specific carbon sources (e.g., esters) changed in their utilization ability (p < 0.05). The microbial functional diversity (Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson diversity index, and Shannon evenness index) was significantly reduced under 10 mg/L NPs (p < 0.05), indicating an inhibiting effect of NPs on biofilm metabolic diversity. This study examined NP ecotoxicity effects on microbial metabolic activities at the community level, but further studies are required to fully understand the mechanisms driving this change.","authors":[{"name":"Lingzhan Miao"},{"name":"Song Guo"},{"name":"Zhilin Liu"},{"name":"Songqi Liu"},{"name":"Guoxiang You"},{"name":"Hao Qu"},{"name":"Jun Hou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AWCD"},{"word":"BIOLOG ECO microplate"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"carbon source utilization"},{"word":"metabolic functions"},{"word":"nanoplastics"}]},"article129":{"pmid":"31766433","title":"Electrochemical Disinfection of Experimentally Infected Teeth by Boron-Doped Diamond Electrode Treatment.","abs":"Disinfection and prevention of re-infection are the decisive treatment steps in endodontic therapy.

This study evaluated the individual and synergistic effects of citral and phloretin against S. pyogenes in relation to major virulence traits. The in vitro synergy of citral and phloretin was evaluated by the checkerboard method. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values were calculated to determine the interactions between the inhibitors. The bacteria's virulence properties were tested in the presence of the molecules, individually as well as in combination. Molecules' cytotoxicity was tested using human tonsil epithelial cells. The synergistic effects of the molecules on the expression of biofilm and quorum sensing genes were tested using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The molecules were also tested for their impact on LuxS protein by molecular docking, modeling, and free-energy calculations. When the two molecules were assessed in combination (synergistic effect, FIC Index of 0.5), a stronger growth inhibitory activity was exhibited than the individual molecules. The cell surface hydrophobicity, as well as genes involved in quorum sensing and biofilm formation, showed greater suppression when the molecules were tested in combination. The in silico findings also suggest the inhibitory potential of the two molecules against LuxS protein. The binding orientation and the binding affinity of citral and phloretin well support the notion that there is a synergistic effect of citral and phloretin.

The VPA1701 deletion mutant (ΔVPA1701) eliminated the swarming motility on the surface of BHI agar plates and reduced colonization in infant rabbits. RNA-seq assays, confirmed by qRT-PCR, indicated that VPA1701 regulated the expression of lateral flagellar cluster genes. Further analyses revealed that VPA1701 directly binds to the promoter region of the flgBCDEFGHIJKL cluster to regulate the expression of lateral flagellar genes. CalR was originally identified as a repressor for the swarming motility of V. parahaemolyticus, and it was inhibited by calcium. In this study, we found that VPA1701 could inhibit the expression of the calR gene to increase the swarming motility of V. parahaemolyticus. Calcium downregulated the expression of calR, indicating that calcium could increase swarming motility of ΔVPA1701 by inhibiting calR.

The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of this phenomenon. An analysis was conducted on consecutive patients who underwent acellular dermal matrix- and implant-based breast reconstructions and developed red breast syndrome that was treated surgically between April of 2017 and June of 2018 at the authors' institution. During surgery, 1-cm specimens of acellular dermal matrix were sampled and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Observations were charted to score and record the presence and thickness of biofilm, and for identification of bacteria. These measurements were performed using Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended software. Six postmastectomy breast reconstruction patients were included, all with AlloDerm Ready-to-Use-based reconstructions. All specimens were colonized by various bacteria ranging from Gram-negative bacilli to Gram-positive microorganisms. Biofilm was present in all studied specimens. The cause of skin erythema overlying acellular dermal matrix grafts, and the so-called red breast syndrome, may be related to contamination with various bacteria. Although contamination was omnipresent in analyzed samples, its clinical significance is variable.

This approach interferes with the early steps of natural biofilm formation affecting how the community is finally developed. It is based on a multilayer artificial biofilm, composed of electrostatically modified bacterial cells, producing antimicrobial compounds, extracellular antimicrobial polyelectrolyte matrix, and a water-proof rubber elastomer barrier.

As a result, three components, including bacteria, protein, and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), were successfully resolved from the spectra of E. coli biofilm. Furthermore, the structural changes of biofilms could be visualized and quantified by their abundances derived from the NMF analysis, which might be related to the nutrient and oxygen gradient and physiological functions.

Amongst the drug-resistant microbes, major threat is posed by the group named as ESKAPEE, an acronym for Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli, comprising high to critical drug-resistant, World Health Organization Critical Priority I and II pathogens. The drying pipeline of effective and new antibiotics has worsened the situation with looming threat of heading to a 'post-antibiotic era'. This necessitates novel and effective approaches to combat this life-threatening issue. Medicinal and aromatic plants are hailed as the reservoir of bioactive compounds and can serve as a source of antimicrobial compounds, and some recent leads show that essential oils (EOs) may provide an effective solution for tackling AMR. EOs have shown wide-spectrum antimicrobial potentials via targeting the major determinants of pathogenicity, drug-resistance and its spread including cell membrane, drug efflux pumps, quorum sensing, biofilms and R-plasmids. Latest reports confirm the EOs having strong direct-killing or re-sensitizing potentials to replace or rejuvenate otherwise fading antibiotics arsenal. We discuss herein possibilities of using EOs directly for antimicrobial potentials or in combination with antibiotics to potentiate the later for combating AMR in ESKAPEE pathogens.

Biosorption activated media (BAM), one of the green sorption media, are composed of sand, tire crumb, and clay, which can remove nitrogen from stormwater and groundwater through integrated hydrological, chemophysical, and microbial processes. The fate and transport processes of interest are complicated by internal microbial processes including ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), each of which is controlled by different microbial species in addition to some varying field conditions. In this study, BAM was tested in a suite of columns to address site-specific physical, chemical and biological concerns driven by in situ traffic compaction, carbon availability, and animal impact (such as gopher turtles, moles, and ants) all of which impose different impacts on nitrogen fate and transport processes that may be signified by changing dissolved organic nitrogen species (DONs). The traffic compaction condition resulted in the most suitable hydraulic retention time in the hydrological process, which is beneficial for the assimilation of DONs in a long-term carbon rich environment due to biofilm expansion. Denitrifiers were the most predominant microbial population and the microbial species of DNRA were the second most predominant one in all three field conditions.

Nanobubble aeration accelerated the growth of the biofilm and achieved better removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand and ammonia, with as maximum as six times higher dehydrogenase activity, and more extracellular polymeric substance content than when using the traditional aeration mode.

Hydroxyapatite-associated biofilms were more susceptible to antibiotics than biofilms formed on titanium, but no clear correlation between the tolerance and biofilm age was observed. Thus, other factors, possibly the adhesive moonlighters, could have contributed to the observed chemotolerant phenotype.

Previously, we have shown that CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing techniques could be utilized to expand temperate bacteriophage host range and enhance bactericidal activity through modification of the tail fiber protein. In a dermal infection study, these CRISPR-Cas9 phages reduced bacterial load relative to unmodified phage. Thus we hypothesized this temperate bacteriophage, equipped with the CRISPR-Cas9 bactericidal machinery, would be effective at mitigating infection from a biofilm forming S. aureus strain in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, qualitative fluorescent imaging demonstrated superiority of phage to conventional vancomycin and fosfomycin antibiotics against S. aureus biofilm. Quantitative antibiofilm effects increased over time, at least partially, for all fosfomycin, phage, and fosfomycin-phage (dual) therapeutics delivered via alginate hydrogel. We developed an in vivo rat model of osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection that was reproducible and challenging and enabled longitudinal monitoring of infection progression. Using this model, phage (with and without fosfomycin) delivered via alginate hydrogel were successful in reducing soft tissue infection but not bone infection, based on bacteriological, histological, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Notably, the efficacy of phage at mitigating soft tissue infection was equal to that of high dose fosfomycin.

The central PTS protein P-Ser-HPr interacts directly with MalR and enhances its DNA binding capacity, which allows E. faecalis to adapt its metabolism to environmental conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Maxime Grand"},{"name":"Victor Sebastián Blancato"},{"name":"Martín Espariz"},{"name":"Josef Deutscher"},{"name":"Andreas Pikis"},{"name":"Axel Hartke"},{"name":"Christian Magni"},{"name":"Nicolas Sauvageot"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus"},{"word":"maltose"},{"word":"metabolism"},{"word":"regulation"}]},"article171":{"pmid":"31754718","title":"MiST 3.0: an updated microbial signal transduction database with an emphasis on chemosensory systems.","abs":"Bacteria and archaea employ dedicated signal transduction systems that modulate gene expression, second-messenger turnover, quorum sensing, biofilm formation, motility, host-pathogen and beneficial interactions.

It is recognized to be associated with infectious bacterial communities called biofilms. Currently used conventional antibiotics alone often reveal themselves ineffective, since they do not specifically target the wound biofilm. Here, we report a new conceptual tool aimed at overcoming this drawback: an antibiofilm drug delivery system targeting the bacterial biofilm as a whole, by inhibiting its formation and/or disrupting it once it is formed. The system consists of a micro/nanostructured poly(butylene-succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA)-based asymmetric membrane (AM) with controlled porosity. By the incorporation of hydrophilic porogen agents, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), we were able to obtain AMs with high levels of porosity, exhibiting interconnections between pores. The PBSA-PEG membrane presented a dense upper layer with pores small enough to block bacteria penetration. Upon using such porogen agents, under dry and wet conditions, membrane's integrity and mechanical properties were maintained. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein, we demonstrated that protein loading and release from PBSA membranes were affected by the membrane structure (porosity) and the presence of residual porogen. Furthermore, the release curve profile consisted of a fast initial slope followed by a second slow phase approaching a plateau within 24 h. This can be highly beneficial for the promotion of wound healing. Cross-sectional confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images revealed a heterogeneous distribution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled BSA throughout the entire membrane. PBSA membranes were loaded with dispersin B (DB), a specific antibiofilm matrix enzyme. Studies using a Staphylococcus epidermidis model, indicate significant efficiency in both inhibiting or dispersing preformed biofilm (up to 80 % eradication). The asymmetric PBSA membrane prepared with the PVP porogen (PBSA-PVP) displayed highest antibiofilm activity. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity assays using HaCaT and reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) models revealed that unloaded and DB-loaded PBSA-PVP membranes had excellent biocompatibility suitable for wound dressing applications.","authors":[{"name":"Naila Bou Haidar"},{"name":"Stéphane Marais"},{"name":"Emmanuelle Dé"},{"name":"Annick Schaumann"},{"name":"Magalie Barreau"},{"name":"Marc G J Feuilloley"},{"name":"Anthony C Duncan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocompatibility"},{"word":"Biofilm inhibition or dispersion"},{"word":"Biofilm-targeted therapies"},{"word":"Chronic wound dressings"},{"word":"Polymeric asymmetric membranes"},{"word":"Protein adsorption"}]},"article179":{"pmid":"31752998","title":"Compositional homogeneity in the pathobiome of a new, slow-spreading coral disease.","abs":"Coral reefs face unprecedented declines in diversity and cover, a development largely attributed to climate change-induced bleaching and subsequent disease outbreaks.

In particular, graphene oxide was exploited as the respiratory electron acceptors, which can be directly reduced by G. sulfurreducens through extracellular electron transfer, closely coupled with outer membrane cytochromes in electroactive conformation, and actively wire the redox centers to external electrical contacts. Through this strategy, the contact resistance at the biofilm/electrode interface can be effectively reduced by 90%. Furthermore, the cyclic voltammetry reveals that the electron transfer of the DL-1 biofilm transformed from a low-current (∼0.36 μA), rate-limited profile to a high-current (∼5 μA), diffusion-limited profile. These results suggested that the integration of rGO can minimize the charge transfer barriers at the biofilm/electrode interface. The more transparent contact at the DL-1/electrode interface also enables unambiguous characterization of the inherent electron transport kinetics across the electroactive biofilm independent of cell/electrode interactions.

While current therapies against bacteria often employ antibiotics, most bacterial pathogens can form biofilms and prevent effective treatment of infections. Biofilm cells can aggregate and encased themselves in a self-secreted protective exopolymeric matrix, to reduce the penetration by antibiotics. Biofilm formation is mediated by c-di-GMP signaling, the ubiquitous secondary messenger in bacteria. Synthesis of c-di-GMP by diguanylate cyclases leads to biofilm formation via the loss of motility, increased surface attachment, and production of biofilm matrix, whereas c-di-GMP degradation by phosphodiesterases causes biofilm dispersal to new sites via increased bacterial motility and matrix breakdown. The highly variable nature of biofilm development and antimicrobial tolerance imposes tremendous challenges in conventional antimicrobial therapies, indicating an imperative need to develop anti-biofilm drugs against biofilm infections. In this review, we focus on two main emergent approaches-active dispersal and disruption. While both approaches aim to demolish biofilms, we will discuss their fundamental differences and associated methods. Active dispersal of biofilms involves signaling the bacterial cells to leave the biofilm, where resident cells ditch their sessile lifestyle, gain motility and self-degrade their matrix. Biofilm disruption leads to direct matrix degradation that forcibly releases embedded biofilm cells. Without the protection of biofilm matrix, released bacterial cells are highly exposed to antimicrobials, leading to their eradication in biofilm infections. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches will allow optimized utility with antimicrobials in clinical settings.","authors":[{"name":"Miao Yu"},{"name":"Song Lin Chua"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial treatment"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chronic infections"},{"word":"dispersal"},{"word":"disruption"}]},"article201":{"pmid":"31746024","title":"Quinine Improves the Fungicidal Effects of Antimicrobial Blue Light: Implications for the Treatment of Cutaneous Candidiasis.","abs":"Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen of clinical importance and is the primary cause of fungal-associated wound infections, sepsis, or pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals.

We found that compared to Escherichia coli Crp, C helix amino acid substitutions in Y. pestis Crp did not impact the cAMP dependency of Crp to bind DNA promoters. To investigate Y. pestis Crp-regulated genes during plague pneumonia, we performed RNA sequencing on both wild-type and Δcrp mutant bacteria growing in planktonic and biofilm states in minimal media with glucose or glycerol. Y. pestis Crp was found to dramatically alter expression of hundreds of genes in a manner dependent upon carbon source and growth state. Gel shift assays confirmed direct regulation of the malT and ptsG promoters, and Crp was then linked to Y. pestis growth on maltose as a sole carbon source. Iron regulation genes ybtA and fyuA were found to be indirectly regulated by Crp. A new connection between carbon source and quorum sensing was revealed as Crp was found to regulate production of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) through direct and indirect regulation of genes for AHL synthetases and receptors.

These enzymes contribute significantly to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and biofilm formation in the chronic colonization of CF patient lungs, as well as playing a role in infections of the cornea, burn wounds, and chronic wounds. We previously characterized a secreted P. aeruginosa peptidase, PaAP, that is highly expressed in chronic CF isolates. This leucine aminopeptidase is highly expressed during infection and in biofilms, and it associates with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), structures known to contribute to virulence mechanisms in a variety of Gram-negative species and one of the major components of the biofilm matrix. We hypothesized that PaAP may play a role in P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Using a lung epithelial cell/bacterial biofilm coculture model, we show that PaAP deletion in a clinical P. aeruginosa background alters biofilm microcolony composition to increase cellular density, while decreasing matrix polysaccharide content, and that OMVs from PaAP-expressing strains but not PaAP alone or in combination with PaAP deletion strain-derived OMVs could complement this phenotype. We additionally found that OMVs from PaAP-expressing strains could cause protease-mediated biofilm detachment, leading to changes in matrix and colony composition. Finally, we showed that the OMVs could also mediate the detachment of biofilms formed by both nonself P. aeruginosa strains and Klebsiella pneumoniae, another respiratory pathogen.

The biofilm components were analyzed using a two-step approach, when prepared biofilms of gram-positive microorganisms were stained with crystal violet for 5 minutes, followed by fixing the dye in bacterial cells with iodine solution, and then the colored products were dissolved with 95% alcohol: matrix components for 1 minute, total biofilm for 15 minutes, after which the composition of biofilms was estimated by the formula: M=(OP1/OP15)×100, Kb=100-M, where M is the proportion of the matrix,%; Kb - the proportion of the cellular component,%; OP1 - optical density of samples, when alcohol was allowed to dissolve the colored product for no more than 1 minute; OP15 - was the optical density of samples, when alcohol is allowed to dissolve the colored product for 15 minutes.

Ligands of B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9 KinD in cucumber root exudates were determined by both the nontargeted ligand fishing method and the targeted surface plasmon resonance detection method. In total, we screened 80 compounds in root exudates for binding to KinD and found that spermine and guanosine could bind to KinD with dissociation constant values of 213 and 51 μΜ, respectively.

Evaluation of 1-5 day lactobacilli conditioned media (CM) revealed maximal inhibition against wound pathogens using the 5-day CM. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5-day Lactobacillus CMs was tested by diluting CM in Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth from 0 to 25% and was found to be 12.5% for A. baumannii. Concentrating the CM to 10× with a 3 kDa centrifuge filter decreased the CM MIC to 6.25-12.5% for A. baumannii planktonic cells. Minimal impact of 5-day CMs was observed against bacterial biofilms. No toxicity was observed when these Lactobacillus CMs were injected into Galleria melonella waxworms.

These serve as scaffolding for controlled drug release and prevent bacterial infections. Films of polylactic acid (PLA) polymers that are Mg-reinforced have demonstrated they have suitable properties and bioactive behavior for promoting the osseointegration process. However little attention has been paid to studying whether the degradation process can alter the adhesive physical properties of the biodegradable film and whether this can modify the biofilm formation capacity of pathogens. Moreover, considering that the concentration of Mg and other corrosion products may not be constant during the degradation process, the question that arises is whether these changes can have negative consequences in terms of the bacterial colonization of surfaces. Bacteria are able to react differently to the same compound, depending on its concentration in the medium and can even become stronger when threatened. In this context, physical surface parameters such as hydrophobicity, surface tension and zeta potential of PLA films reinforced with 10% Mg have been determined before and after degradation, as well as the biofilm formation capacity of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The addition of Mg to the films makes them less hydrophobic and the degradation also reduces the hydrophobicity and increases the negative charge of the surface, especially over long periods of time. Early biofilm formation at 8 h is consistent with the physical properties of the films, where we can observe a reduction in the bacterial biofilm formation. However, after 24 h of incubation, the biofilm formation increases significantly on the PLA/Mg films with respect to PLA control. The explosive release of Mg ions and other corrosion products within the first hours were not enough to prevent a greater biofilm formation after this initial time. Consequently, the Mg addition to the polymer matrix had a bacteriostatic effect but not a bactericidal one. Future works should aim to optimize the design and biofunctionality of these promising bioabsorbable composites for a degradation period suitable for the intended application.","authors":[{"name":"M Coronada Fernández-Calderón"},{"name":"Daniel Romero-Guzmán"},{"name":"Ana Ferrández-Montero"},{"name":"Ciro Pérez-Giraldo"},{"name":"Jose L González-Carrasco"},{"name":"Marcela Lieblich"},{"name":"Rosario Benavente"},{"name":"Begoña Ferrari"},{"name":"M Luisa González-Martín"},{"name":"Amparo M Gallardo-Moreno"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Hydrophobicity"},{"word":"Magnesium"},{"word":"Polylactic acid"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"zeta potential"}]},"article221":{"pmid":"31740248","title":"α-Haloacetophenone and analogues as potential antibacterial agents and nematicides.","abs":"A series of α-haloacetophenones and analogues were synthesized.

The principal component was methyleugenol, followed by methyl trans-cinnamate, with relative contents of 90.46% and 4.25%, respectively.

Antibacterial activity assay and MIC detection against seven pathogens (Dickeya dadantii Onc5, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25933, Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Serratia marcescens MG1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC31532) demonstrated that S. aureus ATCC25933 and S. marcescens MG1 had the higher sensitivity to M. bracteata EO, while P. aeruginosa PAO1 displayed the strongest resistance to M. bracteata EO.

In recent years, many published articles reported promising results indicating the possibility of reducing pathogenicity of tested microorganisms and their easier eradication when co-treated with antibiotics. The aim of the present article is to point to the opposite, negative side of the QQ therapy, with particular emphasis on three fundamental properties attributed to anti-QS substances: the selectivity, virulence reduction, and lack of resistance against QQ. This point of view may highlight new directions of research, which should be taken into account in the future before the widespread introduction of QQ therapies in the treatment of people.","authors":[{"name":"Paweł Krzyżek"}],"keywords":[{"word":"microbiota"},{"word":"pathogenicity"},{"word":"quorum quenching"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"resistance"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article234":{"pmid":"31736899","title":"Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Plant-Associated Bacterial Communities.","abs":"Plants in soil are not solitary, hence continually interact with and obtain benefits from a community of microbes (microbiome). The meta-functional output from the microbiome results from complex interactions among the different community members with distinct taxonomic identities and metabolic capacities. Particularly, the bacterial communities of the root surface are spatially organized structures composed of root-attached biofilms and planktonic cells arranged in complex layers. With the distinct but coordinated roles among the different member cells, bacterial communities resemble properties of a multicellular organism. High throughput sequencing technologies have allowed rapid and large-scale analysis of taxonomic composition and metabolic capacities of bacterial communities. However, these methods are generally unable to reconstruct the assembly of these communities, or how the gene expression patterns in individual cells/species are coordinated within these communities. Single-cell transcriptomes of community members can identify how gene expression patterns vary among members of the community, including differences among different cells of the same species. This information can be used to classify cells based on functional gene expression patterns, and predict the spatial organization of the community. Here we discuss strategies for the isolation of single bacterial cells, mRNA enrichment, library construction, and analysis and interpretation of the resulting single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. Unraveling regulatory and metabolic processes at the single cell level is expected to yield an unprecedented discovery of mechanisms involved in bacterial recruitment, attachment, assembly, organization of the community, or in the specific interactions among the different members of these communities.","authors":[{"name":"Qin Ma"},{"name":"Heike Bücking"},{"name":"Jose L Gonzalez Hernandez"},{"name":"Senthil Subramanian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"droplet-sequencing"},{"word":"fluorescence-activated cell sorting"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"rhizosphere"},{"word":"rolling circle amplification"},{"word":"single primer isothermal amplification"},{"word":"split pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing"}]},"article235":{"pmid":"31736897","title":"Identification of a Contact-Dependent Growth Inhibition (CDI) System That Reduces Biofilm Formation and Host Cell Adhesion of Acinetobacter baumannii DSM30011 Strain.","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii is a multidrug-resistant nosocomial opportunistic pathogen that is becoming a major health threat worldwide. In this study, we have focused on the A. baumannii DSM30011 strain, an environmental isolate that retains many virulence-associated traits. We found that its genome contains two loci encoding for contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) systems. These systems serve to kill or inhibit the growth of non-sibling bacteria by delivering toxins into the cytoplasm of target cells, thereby conferring the host strain a significant competitive advantage. We show that one of the two toxins functions as a DNA-damaging enzyme, capable of inducing DNA double-stranded breaks to the chromosome of Escherichia coli strain. The second toxin has unknown catalytic activity but stops the growth of E. coli without bactericidal effect. In our conditions, only one of the CDI systems was highly expressed in the A. baumannii DSM30011 strain and was found to mediate interbacterial competition.

This heterogeneity has been attributed to spatial differences in environmental factors. Understanding their impact on localized biofilm heterogeneity in building plumbing systems is important for both management and representative sampling strategies. We assessed heterogeneity within the confined engineered ecosystem of a shower hose by high-resolution sampling (200 individual biofilm sections per hose) on varying scales (μm to m). We postulated that a biofilm grown on a single material under uniform conditions should be homogeneous in its structure, bacterial numbers, and community composition. A biofilm grown for 12 months under controlled laboratory conditions, showed homogeneity on large-scale. However, some small-scale heterogeneity was clearly observed. For example, biofilm thickness of cm-sections varied up to 4-fold, total cell concentrations (TCC) 3-fold, and relative abundance of dominant taxa up to 5-fold. A biofilm grown under real (i.e., uncontrolled) use conditions developed considerably more heterogeneity in all variables which was attributed to more discontinuity in environmental conditions. Interestingly, biofilm communities from both hoses showed comparably low diversity, with <400 taxa each, and only three taxa accounting for 57%, respectively, 73% of the community. This low diversity was attributed to a strong selective pressure, originating in migrating carbon from the flexible hoses as major carbon source. High-resolution sampling strategy enabled detailed analysis of spatial heterogeneity within an individual drinking water biofilm.

Many aspects of cell physiology such as cell motility, predation, and biofilm production can be affected by cell shape. Bacterial cells are three-dimensional (3D) objects, although they are rarely treated as such. Most microscopy techniques result in two-dimensional (2D) images leading to the loss of data pertaining to the actual 3D cell shape and localization of proteins. Certain shape parameters, such as Gaussian curvature (the product of the two principal curvatures), can only be measured in 3D because 2D images do not measure both principal curvatures. Additionally, not all cells lie flat when mounting and 2D imaging of curved cells may not accurately represent the shapes of these cells. Accurately measuring protein localization in 3D can help determine the spatial regulation and function of proteins. A forward convolution technique has been developed that uses the blurring function of the microscope to reconstruct 3D cell shapes and to accurately localize proteins. Here, a protocol for preparing and mounting samples for live cell imaging of bacteria in 3D both to reconstruct an accurate cell shape and to localize proteins is described. The method is based on simple sample preparation, fluorescent image acquisition, and MATLAB-based image processing. Many high-quality fluorescent microscopes can be simply modified to take these measurements. These cell reconstructions are computationally intensive and access to high-throughput computational resources is recommended, although not necessary. This method has been successfully applied to multiple bacterial species and mutants, fluorescent imaging modalities, and microscope manufacturers.","authors":[{"name":"Benjamin P Bratton"},{"name":"Brody Barton"},{"name":"Randy M Morgenstein"}],"keywords":[]},"article238":{"pmid":"31736330","title":"Groundwater, soil and compost, as possible sources of virulent and antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major public health concern all around the world.

The enumeration of EVs and the detection of eDNA-associated EVs were performed by PFC, analyzing both whole samples (cells plus vesicles) and EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation confirm EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation. PFC analysis was performed relying on a known-size beaded system and a mix of three different fluorescent tracers. In detail, the whole EV compartment was stained by a lipophilic cationic dye (LCD), which was combined to PKH26 and PicoGreen that selectively stain lipids and DNA, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy results displayed that both H. pylori and L. reuteri produced well-structured biofilms. PFC data highlighted that, in both detected bacterial species, biofilms produced higher EVs counts when paralleled to the related planktonic phenotypes. Furthermore, the staining with PicoGreen showed that most of the generated vesicles were associated with eDNA.

Mortality rates associated with these infections have risen sharply due to the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of C. albicans and other Candida spp., highlighting the urgent need of new antifungal therapies. Rhesus theta (θ) defensin-1 (RTD-1), a natural macrocyclic antimicrobial peptide, was recently shown to be rapidly fungicidal against clinical isolates of MDR C. albicans in vitro. Here we found that RTD-1 was rapidly fungicidal against blastospores of fluconazole/caspofungin resistant C. albicans strains, and was active against established C. albicans biofilms in vitro. In vivo, systemic administration of RTD-1, initiated at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection, promoted long term survival in candidemic mice whether infected with drug-sensitive or MDR strains of C. albicans. RTD-1 induced an early (4 h post treatment) increase in neutrophils in naive and infected mice. In vivo efficacy was associated with fungal clearance, restoration of dysregulated inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17, and homeostatic reduction in numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. Because these effects occurred using peptide doses that produced maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of less than 1% of RTD-1 levels required for in vitro antifungal activity in 50% mouse serum, while inducing a transient neutrophilia, we suggest that RTD-1 mediates its antifungal effects in vivo by host directed mechanisms rather than direct fungicidal activity.

A microfluidic chamber with two parallel channels was used, and RNA isolated from cells grown inside the system was analysed by RNA-Seq. Ca transcriptionally regulated the machinery of type IV pili and other genes related to pathogenicity and host adaptation. Results were compared to our previous RNA-Seq study in biofilm cells in batch cultures (Parker et al., 2016, Environ Microbiol 18, 1620).

Hence quantifying the molecular diffusion coefficient is important to determine whether there is an influence of biofilm microenvironment on the mobility of molecules. Here, we use single plane illumination microscopy fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (SPIM-FCS) to obtain 3D diffusion coefficient maps with micrometre spatial and millisecond temporal resolution of entire Pseudomonas aeruginosa microcolonies. We probed how molecular properties such as size and charge as well as biofilm properties such as microcolony size and depth influence diffusion of fluorescently labelled dextrans inside biofilms. The 2 MDa dextran showed uneven penetration and a reduction in diffusion coefficient suggesting that the biofilm acts as a molecular sieve. Its diffusion coefficient was negatively correlated with the size of the microcolony. Positively charged dextran molecules and positively charged antibiotic tobramycin preferentially partitioned into the biofilm and remained mobile inside the microcolony, albeit with a reduced diffusion coefficient. Lastly, we measured changes of diffusion upon induction of dispersal and detected an increase in diffusion coefficient inside the biofilm before any loss of biomass. Thus, the change in diffusion is a proxy to detect early stages of dispersal. Our work shows that 3D diffusion maps are very sensitive to physiological changes in biofilms, viz. dispersal. However, this study also shows that diffusion, as mediated by the biofilm matrix, does not account for the high level of antibiotic tolerance associated with biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Jagadish Sankaran"},{"name":"Nicholas J H J Tan"},{"name":"Ka Pui But"},{"name":"Yehuda Cohen"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"},{"name":"Thorsten Wohland"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobials"},{"word":"Bacteriology"},{"word":"Biofilms"}]},"article268":{"pmid":"31728201","title":"Rapid microevolution of biofilm cells in response to antibiotics.","abs":"Infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii are increasingly antibiotic resistant, generating a significant public health problem.

However, it is unclear how adaptation to fluctuating environments differs from adaptation to constant environments at the genetic level. For bacteria, one key axis of environmental variation is selection for planktonic or biofilm modes of growth. We conducted an evolution experiment with Burkholderia cenocepacia, comparing the evolutionary dynamics of populations evolving under constant selection for either biofilm formation or planktonic growth with populations in which selection fluctuated between the two environments on a weekly basis. Populations evolved in the fluctuating environment shared many of the same genetic targets of selection as those evolved in constant biofilm selection, but were genetically distinct from the constant planktonic populations. In the fluctuating environment, mutations in the biofilm-regulating genes wspA and rpfR rose to high frequency in all replicate populations. A mutation in wspA first rose rapidly and nearly fixed during the initial biofilm phase but was subsequently displaced by a collection of rpfR mutants upon the shift to the planktonic phase. The wspA and rpfR genotypes coexisted via negative frequency-dependent selection around an equilibrium frequency that shifted between the environments. The maintenance of coexisting genotypes in the fluctuating environment was unexpected. Under temporally fluctuating environments, coexistence of two genotypes is only predicted under a narrow range of conditions, but the frequency-dependent interactions we observed provide a mechanism that can increase the likelihood of coexistence in fluctuating environments.","authors":[{"name":"Caroline B Turner"},{"name":"Sean W Buskirk"},{"name":"Katrina B Harris"},{"name":"Vaughn S Cooper"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adaptation"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"experimental evolution"},{"word":"population ecology"}]},"article274":{"pmid":"31725458","title":"Chronic wound biofilms: diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.","abs":"To review the diagnosis of chronic wound biofilms and discuss current treatment approaches.","authors":[{"name":"Di Wei"},{"name":"Xiao-Mei Zhu"},{"name":"Yong-Yi Chen"},{"name":"Xu-Ying Li"},{"name":"Yu-Pan Chen"},{"name":"Hua-Yun Liu"},{"name":"Min Zhang"}],"keywords":[]},"article275":{"pmid":"31725203","title":"Combining culture and culture-independent methods reveals new microbial composition of halitosis patients' tongue biofilm.","abs":"Oral malodor is a very discomforting condition deriving from the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the expired air.

However, the underlying causes of the defects observed in the absence of glycosylation are unclear. Using proteomics, luciferase reporter assays, and DNA cross-linking, we demonstrate the loss of glycosylation leads to changes in transcriptional regulation of multiple proteins, including the repression of the master quorum CepR/I. These proteomic and transcriptional alterations lead to the abolition of biofilm formation and defects in siderophore activity. Surprisingly, the abundance of most of the known glycosylated proteins did not significantly change in the glycosylation-defective mutants, except for BCAL1086 and BCAL2974, which were found in reduced amounts, suggesting they could be degraded. However, the loss of these two proteins was not responsible for driving the proteomic alterations, biofilm formation, or siderophore activity. Together, our results show that loss of glycosylation in B. cenocepacia results in a global cell reprogramming via alteration of the transcriptional regulatory systems, which cannot be explained by the abundance changes in known B. cenocepacia glycoproteins.","authors":[{"name":"Cameron C Oppy"},{"name":"Leila Jebeli"},{"name":"Miku Kuba"},{"name":"Clare V Oates"},{"name":"Richard Strugnell"},{"name":"Laura E Edgington-Mitchell"},{"name":"Miguel A Valvano"},{"name":"Elizabeth L Hartland"},{"name":"Hayley J Newton"},{"name":"Nichollas E Scott"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia cenocepacia"},{"word":"CepR"},{"word":"DNA binding"},{"word":"glycoproteins"},{"word":"glycosylation"},{"word":"pathogenesis"},{"word":"posttranslational modifications"},{"word":"protein modification"},{"word":"proteomics"}]},"article279":{"pmid":"31722981","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor signaling suppresses αvβ6 integrin and promotes periodontal inflammation and bone loss.","abs":"In periodontal disease (PD), bacterial biofilms cause gingival inflammation, leading to bone loss. In healthy individuals, αvβ6 integrin in junctional epithelium maintains anti-inflammatory transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling, whereas its expression is lost in individuals with PD. Bacterial biofilms suppress β6 integrin expression in cultured gingival epithelial cells (GECs) by attenuating TGF-β1 signaling, leading to an enhanced pro-inflammatory response. In the present study, we show that GEC exposure to biofilms induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Inhibition of EGFR and ERK stunted both the biofilm-induced ITGB6 suppression and IL1B stimulation. Furthermore, biofilm induced the expression of endogenous EGFR ligands that suppressed ITGB6 and stimulated IL1B expression, indicating that the effects of the biofilm were mediated by autocrine EGFR signaling. Biofilm and EGFR ligands induced inhibitory phosphorylation of the TGF-β1 signaling mediator Smad3 at S208. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective mutant of Smad3 (S208A) reduced the β6 integrin suppression. Furthermore, inhibition of EGFR signaling significantly reduced bone loss and inflammation in an experimental PD model. Thus, EGFR inhibition may provide a target for clinical therapies to prevent inflammation and bone loss in PD.","authors":[{"name":"Jiarui Bi"},{"name":"Leeni Koivisto"},{"name":"Jiayin Dai"},{"name":"Deshu Zhuang"},{"name":"Guoqiao Jiang"},{"name":"Milla Larjava"},{"name":"Ya Shen"},{"name":"Liangjia Bi"},{"name":"Fang Liu"},{"name":"Markus Haapasalo"},{"name":"Lari Häkkinen"},{"name":"Hannu Larjava"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Epidermal growth factor receptor"},{"word":"Inflammation"},{"word":"Periodontal disease"},{"word":"αvβ6 integrin"}]},"article280":{"pmid":"31722523","title":"Exploiting Correlations between Protein Abundance and the Functional Status of saeRS and sarA To Identify Virulence Factors of Potential Importance in the Pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus Osteomyelitis.","abs":"We used a murine model of postsurgical osteomyelitis (OM) to evaluate the relative virulence of the Staphylococcus aureus strain LAC and five isogenic variants that differ in the functional status of saeRS and sarA relative to each other.

These infections are often associated with the formation of biofilms on the medical implants that are difficult to treat because of their resistance to the classical antifungal drugs. The most common fungi isolated from catheters and other medical devices are Candida species. The Candida genus contains multiple species of which C. albicans and C. glabrata are the two most common pathogenic yeasts in humans. A limited number of animal models is available for investigating host-pathogen interactions and testing novel antifungal drugs in vivo against these species. Fungal load in biofilms in these models is traditionally analyzed postmortem, requiring host sacrifice and enumeration of microorganisms from individual biofilms in order to evaluate the amount of colony forming units and the efficacy of antifungal treatment. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) made compatible with small animal models for in vivo biofilm formation is a valuable tool to follow biofilm development and its treatment longitudinally. Due to the noninvasive nature of BLI, the imaging procedure can be repeated in the same animal, allowing for follow-up of the biofilm growth in vivo without removing the implanted device or detaching the biofilm from its substrate. Although detecting a quantifiable in vivo BLI signal from biofilms formed on the inside of implanted catheters is challenging, BLI proved to be a practical tool in the study of fungal biofilms. This method describes the use of BLI for in vitro and in vivo follow-up of device-related fungal biofilm formation in mice and rats and antifungal activity testing against both C. albicans and C. glabrata device-associated biofilms.

The use of OA negative pressure wound therapy (OA NPWT) has been a significant advancement in the management of the open abdomen.

Biofilms are comprised of surface-attached bacteria embedded in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, which confers increased antibiotic resistance and host immune evasion. Therefore, disruption of this matrix is essential to tackle the biofilm-embedded bacteria. Here, we propose a novel nanotechnology to do this, based on protease-functionalized nanogel carriers of antibiotics. Such active antibiotic nanocarriers, surface coated with the protease Alcalase 2.4 L FG, digest their way through the biofilm EPS matrix, reach the buried bacteria, and deliver a high dose of antibiotic directly on their cell walls, which overwhelms their defenses. We demonstrated their effectiveness against six wound biofilm-forming bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. We confirmed a 6-fold decrease in the biofilm mass and a substantial reduction in bacterial cell density using fluorescence, atomic force, and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we showed that co-treatments of ciprofloxacin and Alcalase-coated Carbopol nanogels led to a 3-log reduction in viable biofilm-forming cells when compared to ciprofloxacin treatments alone. Encapsulating an equivalent concentration of ciprofloxacin into the Alcalase-coated nanogel particles boosted their antibacterial effect much further, reducing the bacterial cell viability to below detectable amounts after 6 h of treatment. The Alcalase-coated nanogel particles were noncytotoxic to human adult keratinocyte cells (HaCaT), inducing a very low apoptotic response in these cells. Overall, we demonstrated that the Alcalase-coated nanogels loaded with a cationic antibiotic elicit very strong biofilm-clearing effects against wound-associated biofilm-forming pathogenic bacteria.

However, amyloid also occurs in the extracellular matrix of bacterial biofilm, which protects bacteria from environmental stress and antibiotics. Many Pseudomonas strains produce functional amyloid where the main component is the highly fibrillation-prone protein FapC. FapC fibrillation may be inhibited by small molecules such as plant polyphenols, which are already known to inhibit formation of pathogenic amyloid, but the mechanism and biological impact of inhibition is unclear. Here, we elucidate how polyphenols modify the self-assembly of functional amyloid, with particular focus on epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), penta-O-galloyl-β-d-glucose (PGG), baicalein, oleuropein, and procyanidin B2. We find EGCG and PGG to be the best inhibitors. These compounds inhibit amyloid formation by redirecting the aggregation of FapC monomers into oligomeric species, which according to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements organize into core-shell complexes of short axis diameters 25-26 nm consisting of ~7 monomers. Using peptide arrays, we identify EGCG-binding sites in FapC's linker regions, C and N-terminal parts, and high amyloidogenic sequences located in the R2 and R3 repeats. We correlate our biophysical observations to biological impact by demonstrating that the extent of amyloid inhibition by the different inhibitors correlated with their ability to reduce biofilm, highlighting the potential of anti-amyloid polyphenols as therapeutic agents against biofilm infections.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Najarzadeh"},{"name":"Hossein Mohammad-Beigi"},{"name":"Jannik Nedergaard Pedersen"},{"name":"Gunna Christiansen"},{"name":"Thorbjørn Vincent Sønderby"},{"name":"Seyed Abbas Shojaosadati"},{"name":"Dina Morshedi"},{"name":"Kristian Strømgaard"},{"name":"Georg Meisl"},{"name":"Duncan Sutherland"},{"name":"Jan Skov Pedersen"},{"name":"Daniel E Otzen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FapC protein"},{"word":"aggregation inhibitor"},{"word":"bacterial amyloid"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"peptide array"}]},"article304":{"pmid":"31717766","title":"Chemical Composition and Antimicrobial Effectiveness of Ocimum gratissimum L.

EOOG biological activity was verified against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, using four strains for each species. The antibacterial action of EOOG was determined by disk diffusion, microdilution (MIC/MBC), growth curve under sub-MIC exposure, and the combinatorial activity with ciprofloxacin (CIP) and oxacillin (OXA) were determined by checkerboard assay. The EOOG antibiofilm action was performed against the established biofilm and analyzed by crystal violet, colony-forming unit count, and SEM analyses. EOOG yielded 1.66% w/w, with eugenol as the major component (74.83%). The MIC was 1000 µg/mL for the most tested strains. The growth curve showed a lag phase delay for both species, mainly S. aureus, and reduced the growth level of E. coli by half. The combination of EOOG with OXA and CIP led to an additive action for S. aureus. A significant reduction in biofilm biomass and cell viability was verified for S. aureus and E. coli.

For this reason, treatment of TJR-associated infections and related complications remains a significant concern. The objective of this study was to develop a polymer-controlled dual antibiotic-releasing bone void filler (ABVF) with an underlying osseointegrating substrate to treat TJR implant-associated biofilm infections. An ABVF putty was designed to provide sustained vancomycin and rifampicin antibiotic release for 6 weeks while concurrently providing an osseointegrating support for regrowth of lost bone. The reported ABVF showed efficient antibacterial and antibiofilm activity both in vitro and in a rat infection model where the ABVF both showed complete bacterial elimination and supported bone growth. Furthermore, in an in vivo k-wire-based biofilm infection model, the ABVF putty was also able to eliminate the biofilm infection while supporting osseointegration. The retrieved k-wire implants were also free from biofilm and bacterial burden.

Furthermore, the presence of Zn(II) suppressed expression of the response regulator Spo0F but not of sensor histidine kinases KinA-D. Suppression of phosphorelay by excess Zn interferes with sinI induction under biofilm-inducing conditions, leading to repression of transcription of operons epsA-O and tapA-sigW-tasA. Addition of Zn(II) decreased the intracellular Mn(II) level by competing for binding to the solute-binding protein MntA during Mn(II) uptake.

When assembled into amyloid, FuBA is unusually robust and withstands most chemicals including denaturants and SDS. Uses include strengthening of bacterial biofilms, cell-to-cell communication, cell wall construction and even bacterial warfare. Biogenesis is under tight spatio-temporal control, thanks to a simple but efficient secretion system which in E. coli, Pseudomonas and other well-studied bacteria includes a major amyloid component that is kept unfolded in the periplasm thanks to chaperones, threaded through the outer membrane via a pore protein and anchored to the cell surface through a nucleator and possibly other helper proteins. In these systems, amyloid formation is promoted through imperfect repeats, but other evolutionarily unrelated proteins either have no or only partially conserved repeats or simply consist of small peptides with multiple structural roles. This makes bioinformatics analysis challenging, though the sophisticated amyloid prediction tools developed from research in pathological amyloid together with the steady increase in identification of further examples of amyloid will strengthen genomic data mining. Functional amyloid represents an intriguing source of robust yet biodegradable materials with new properties, when combining the optimized self-assembly properties of the amyloid component with e.g. peptides with different binding properties or surface-reactive protein binders.

In this study, the target genes of Vvrr1 were fully screened and verified by constructing Vvrr1-overexpressing strains and using the proteome sequencing technology.

The adhesion ability, biofilm formation and virulence were significantly reduced in the Vvrr1-overexpressing and the pykF-silenced strain compared with the wild strains. Similar to the overexpression of Vvrr1, the silencing of pykF also reduced the expression level of virulence genes, such as ndk, eno, sdhB, glpF, and cysH. Meanwhile, by constructing the pykF-GFP fusion expression plasmid and using the GFP reporter gene analysis in Escherichia coli, the fluorescence intensity of the strain containing Vvrr1 whole ncRNA sequence vector was found to be significantly weakened.

At low cell densities, when QS autoinducers are absent, V. cholerae forms biofilms. At high cell densities, when autoinducers have accumulated, biofilm formation is repressed, and dispersal occurs. Here, we focus on the roles of two well-characterized QS autoinducers that function in parallel. One autoinducer, called cholerae autoinducer-1 (CAI-1), is used to measure Vibrio abundance, and the other autoinducer, called autoinducer-2 (AI-2), is widely produced by different bacterial species and presumed to enable V. cholerae to assess the total bacterial cell density of the vicinal community. The two V. cholerae autoinducers funnel information into a shared signal relay pathway. This feature of the QS system architecture has made it difficult to understand how specific information can be extracted from each autoinducer, how the autoinducers might drive distinct output behaviors, and, in turn, how the bacteria use QS to distinguish kin from nonkin in bacterial communities. We develop a live-cell biofilm formation and dispersal assay that allows examination of the individual and combined roles of the two autoinducers in controlling V. cholerae behavior. We show that the QS system works as a coincidence detector in which both autoinducers must be present simultaneously for repression of biofilm formation to occur. Within that context, the CAI-1 QS pathway is activated when only a few V. cholerae cells are present, whereas the AI-2 pathway is activated only at much higher cell density. The consequence of this asymmetry is that exogenous sources of AI-2, but not CAI-1, contribute to satisfying the coincidence detector to repress biofilm formation and promote dispersal. We propose that V. cholerae uses CAI-1 to verify that some of its kin are present before committing to the high-cell-density QS mode, but it is, in fact, the broadly made autoinducer AI-2 that sets the pace of the V. cholerae QS program. This first report of unique roles for the different V. cholerae autoinducers suggests that detection of kin fosters a distinct outcome from detection of nonkin.","authors":[{"name":"Andrew A Bridges"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"}],"keywords":[]},"article330":{"pmid":"31710252","title":"Effects of surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) eluate on Candida spp.: antifungal activity, anti-biofilm properties, and protective effects on Galleria mellonella against C. albicans infection.","abs":"Surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) is a bioactive filler produced by PRG technology, which is applied to various dental materials.

The presence of a shading mesh resulted in a reduction in tomato production and in smaller fruits with lower contents of sugars (glucose and fructose) and carotenoids (lycopene and β-carotene) and higher contents of organic acids, amino acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic and oleic acids) and of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids (which contributed to an increased antioxidant activity). Methanolic extracts of leaves of nonshaded plants showed a higher antibiofilm activity than that from shaded plants.

The environmental sample screening identified P. aeruginosa as significantly associated with hydrocarbon and pesticide-contaminated environments and feces, as compared to uncontaminated environments in which its prevalence was relatively low.

For this, the genome sequencing and phenotypical tests were performed. The draft genome annotation revealed several complete pathways associated with carbon metabolism and a mucin-desulfating sulfatase which may contribute to intestine colonization, and a large number of virulence-associated genes encoding structures associated with adhesion, toxins, and secretion systems. The strain exhibited swimming and swarming motility, biofilm formation, and hemolytic activity. It was resistant to ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Although a cphA gene encoding a narrow-spectrum carbapenase was identified in the strain genome, no carbapenemase activity was detected in the antimicrobial susceptibility test. When compared with other A. veronii with complete genomes, the main differences in virulence characteristics are related to lateral flagella and type III and VI secretion systems; the antimicrobial resistance spectrum also varied among strains.

Desert strains showed more diversity at the genetic level and were able to utilise more carbon sources than riverbank strains which were highly genetically conserved. Biofilm morphologies of desert and riverbank strains generally segregated and both groups formed different morphology clusters despite the astonishing diversity observed among riverbank strains.

More attention is required to address this global health issue owing to the increase in air pollution. Implantation of a silicone stent is the preferred treatment for epiphora; however, introducing a silicone stent into a narrow duct with complex geometry is challenging as it requires guidance by a sharp metal needle. Additionally, silicone can cause adverse reactions such as biofilm formation and tear flow resistance due to its extreme hydrophobicity. To overcome these problems, in this study we developed a new type of biocompatible shape memory polymer (SMP) stent with elasticity capacity for self-expansion. First, SMPs in the form of x%poly(ε-caprolactone)-co-y%poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (x%PCL-y%PGMA) were synthesized via ring opening polymerization by varying the molar ratio of PCL (x%) and PGMA (y%). Second, the shape memory and mechanical properties were tuned by controlling the crosslinking degree and concentration of x%PCL-y%PGMA solution to produce a test type of SMP stent. Lastly, this 94%PCL-06%PGMA stent exhibited more standout critical functions in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments such as a cell growth-supporting level of biocompatibility with nasal epithelial cells without significant inflammatory responses, better resistance to biofilm formation, and more efficient capacity to drain tear than the silicone control. Overall, 94%PCL-06%PGMA can be suggested as a superior alternative to the currently used materials for nasolacrimal stents. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Silicone intubation (stenting) has been widely used to treat nasolacrimal duct obstruction, however, it can cause adverse clinical effects such as bacterial infection; presents procedural challenges because of the curved nasolacrimal duct structure; and shows poor drainage efficiency stemming from the highly hydrophobic nature of silicone. In this work, we describe an innovative shape memory polymer (SMP) as a superior alternative to conventional silicone-based materials for nasolacrimal duct intubation. We demonstrate the clear advantages of the SMP over conventional silicone, including a much higher drainage capacity and superior resistance to bacterial infection.","authors":[{"name":"Ju Young Park"},{"name":"Jung Bok Lee"},{"name":"Woo Beom Shin"},{"name":"Mi-Lan Kang"},{"name":"Yong Cheol Shin"},{"name":"Deok Hyeon Son"},{"name":"Se Won Yi"},{"name":"Jeong-Kee Yoon"},{"name":"Ji Young Kim"},{"name":"JaeSang Ko"},{"name":"Chang-Soo Kim"},{"name":"Jin Sook Yoon"},{"name":"Hak-Joon Sung"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Epiphora"},{"word":"Nasolacrimal stent"},{"word":"Shape memory polymer"},{"word":"Silicone"}]},"article354":{"pmid":"31707076","title":"Strategies for improving the electroactivity and specific metabolic functionality of microorganisms for various microbial electrochemical technologies.","abs":"Electroactive microorganisms, which possess extracellular electron transfer (EET) capabilities, are the basis of microbial electrochemical technologies (METs) such as microbial fuel and electrolysis cells.

Various aspects related to the microorganisms, electrodes, separators, reactor design, and operational or process parameters influence the overall functioning of METs.

Modification of the electrode surfaces and microorganisms for optimizing their interactions has therefore been the major MET research focus area over the last decade. In the case of microorganisms, primarily their EET mechanisms and efficiencies along with the biofilm formation capabilities, collectively considered as microbial electroactivity, affect their interactions with the electrodes. In addition to electroactivity, the specific metabolic or biochemical functionality of microorganisms is equally crucial to the target MET application. In this article, we present the major strategies that are used to enhance the electroactivity and specific functionality of microorganisms pertaining to both anodic and cathodic processes of METs.

However, the mechanism for the initial adhesion of anammox bacteria remains unclear. In this work, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were extracted separately from anammox granules and then characterized by multi-methods. The adhesion properties of anammox consortia to biotic and abiotic surfaces were examined separately before and after the extraction of three stratified EPS, using aggregation assays and a quartz crystal microbalance technique with dissipation monitoring, respectively. The extraction of each of the three stratified EPS gradually increased the initial aggregation of anammox consortia from 77.6 ± 3.0% to 85.2 ± 2.6%. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry confirmed that the aggregation of anammox consortia depended largely on the interactions between functional groups on the cell surfaces. All three stratified EPS had positive effects on the initial adhesion rate and mass of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces. More importantly, the structure of the adhered layer was more compact before the extraction of each of the three stratified EPS. We therefore hypothesized that the initial adhesion among anammox consortia was due to the ability of the anammox bacteria to express adhesion molecules on the bacterial surfaces and that the three stratified EPS were excreted to adhere inert particulates and form a compact biofilm structure.

Herein, Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-based quorum sensing (QS) in a lab-scale AnMBR initially revealed that N-Hexanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N-Octanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL) and N-Decanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C10-HSL) were the dominant AHLs in AnMBRs in this study. Three FQQs, namely, FQQ-C6, FQQ-C8 and FQQ-C10, were harvested after anaerobic screening of aerobic QQ consortiums (AeQQs) which were isolated by enrichment culture, aiming to degrade C6-HSL, C8-HSL and C10-HSL, respectively. Growth of FQQ-C6 and FQQ-C10 using AHLs as carbon source under anaerobic condition was significantly faster than those using acetate, congruously suggesting that their QQ performance will not be compromised in AnMBRs. All FQQs degraded a wide range of AHLs pinpointing their extensive QQ ability. FQQ-C6, FQQ-C8 and FQQ-C10 remarkably alleviated extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production in a lab-scale AnMBR by 72.46%, 35.89% and 65.88%, respectively, and FQQ-C6 retarded membrane fouling of the AnMBR by 2 times.

In the hybrid NRPS-PKS system of L. lactis KF147, a total of 21 NRPS and 8 PKS domains were identified that are arranged into 6 NRPS modules, 3 PKS modules, and two single functional domains (trans-acyl-transferase transAT and thioesterase). We found homologous hybrid systems having similar gene, module, and domain organization in six other L. lactis strains and 25 strains of the dental cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. This study mainly aimed to predict the structure and function of the hybrid NRP-PK product of L. lactis KF147 using comparative genomics techniques, and included a detailed analysis of the regulatory system. Various bioinformatical approaches were used to predict the substrate specificity of the six A domains and the iterative transAT domain. Functional conservation of the A domains within different-niche-associated strains supported the prediction of the primary core structure of the putative hybrid natural product to be Leu-DLeu-Asp-DAsn-Gly-MC-MC-MC-DAsp (MC = Malonyl-CoA). Oxidative stress resistance and biofilm formation are the most probable functions of this hybrid system. The need for such a system in two different niches is argued, as an adaptation of L. lactis and S. mutans to adhere to plant tissues and human teeth, respectively, in an oxidative environment.","authors":[{"name":"Barzan I Khayatt"},{"name":"Vera van Noort"},{"name":"Roland J Siezen"}],"keywords":[]},"article366":{"pmid":"31705142","title":"Antibiofilm and antibacterial activities of repurposing auranofin against Bacteroides fragilis.","abs":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the antibiofilm and antibacterial effects of auranofin against WT-ETBF, rETBF, WT-NTBF and clinically isolated Bacteroides fragilis strains.

The QS signaling is crucial for several phenotypic characteristics responsible for bacterial survival such as motility, virulence, and biofilm formation.

Using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical modeling, here we demonstrate that this transition originates from the competition between growth-induced in-plane active stresses and vertical restoring forces, due to the cell-substrate interactions. Using a simple chainlike colony of laterally confined cells, we show that the transition sets when individual cells become unstable to rotations; thus it is localized and mechanically deterministic. Asynchronous cell division renders the process stochastic, so that all the critical parameters that control the onset of the transition are continuously distributed random variables. Here we demonstrate that the occurrence of the first division in the colony can be approximated as a Poisson process in the limit of large cell numbers. This allows us to approximately calculate the probability distribution function of the position and time associated with the first extrusion. The rate of such a Poisson process can be identified as the order parameter of the transition, thus highlighting its mixed deterministic-stochastic nature.","authors":[{"name":"Zhihong You"},{"name":"Daniel J G Pearce"},{"name":"Anupam Sengupta"},{"name":"Luca Giomi"}],"keywords":[]},"article390":{"pmid":"31702119","title":"Antibacterial activity of human mesenchymal stem cells mediated directly by constitutively secreted factors and indirectly by activation of innate immune effector cells.","abs":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to improve wound healing and suppress inflammatory immune responses. Newer research also indicates that MSC exhibit antimicrobial activity, although the mechanisms underlying this activity have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we conducted in vitro and in vivo studies to examine the ability of resting and activated MSC to kill bacteria, including multidrug resistant strains. We investigated direct bacterial killing mechanisms and the interaction of MSC with host innate immune responses to infection. In addition, the activity of MSC against chronic bacterial infections was investigated in a mouse biofilm infection model. We found that MSC exhibited high levels of spontaneous direct bactericidal activity in vitro. Moreover, soluble factors secreted by MSC inhibited Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation in vitro and disrupted the growth of established biofilms. Secreted factors from MSC also elicited synergistic killing of drug-resistant bacteria when combined with several major classes of antibiotics. Other studies demonstrated interactions of activated MSC with host innate immune responses, including triggering of neutrophil extracellular trap formation and increased phagocytosis of bacteria. Finally, activated MSC administered systemically to mice with established S. aureus biofilm infections significantly reduced bacterial numbers at the wound site and improved wound healing when combined with antibiotic therapy. These results indicate that MSC generate multiple direct and indirect, immunologically mediated antimicrobial activities that combine to help eliminate chronic bacterial infections when the cells are administered therapeutically.","authors":[{"name":"Lyndah Chow"},{"name":"Valerie Johnson"},{"name":"Renata Impastato"},{"name":"Jonathan Coy"},{"name":"Alyssa Strumpf"},{"name":"Steven Dow"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"cytokines"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"neutrophil"},{"word":"peptides"},{"word":"stem cells"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"31701321","title":"Metabolomic studies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common, Gram-negative environmental organism.

In the considered time window, an increasing number of Candida BSI (p = 0.005) and of biofilm producing strains were observed (p<0.0001). Although C. albicans was the species more frequently isolated in BSI with a major biofilm production, an increased involvement of non-albicans species was reported, particularly of C. parapsilosis that displayed a high frequency in catheter infections, and lower biofilm production compared to C. albicans. Although trends of biofilm production were substantially stable in time, a decreasing biofilm production by C. parapsilosis in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was observed (p = 0.0041). Principal component analysis displayed a change in antifungal drugs consumption driven by two mutually independent temporal trends, i.e. voriconazole use in the general medicine wards initially, and fluconazole use mainly in the ICU; these factors explain 68.9% and 25.7% of total variance respectively. Moreover, a significant trend (p = 0.003) in fluconazole use during the whole time period considered emerged, particularly in the ICU (p = 0.017), but also in the general medicine wards (p = 0.03).

Advanced understandings of such oral diseases, e.g., inflammatory periodontal lesions, have raised the demand for antibacterial therapeutic strategies, because these diseases are caused by viruses and bacteria. The application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) on oral infectious diseases has attracted tremendous interest in the past decade. However, aPDT had a minimal effect on the viability of organized biofilms due to the hydrophobic nature of the majority of the photosensitizers (PSs). Therefore, novel nanotechnologies were rapidly developed to target the delivery of hydrophobic PSs into microorganisms for the antimicrobial performance improvement of aPDT.

The first part of this article focuses on the cutting-edge research on the synthesis, toxicity, and therapeutic effects of various forms of nanomaterials serving as PS carriers for aPDT applications. The second part discusses nanomaterials applications for aPDT in treatments of oral diseases.

Thus, we compared a clinical strain of methicillin-resistant biofilm-producing S. epidermidis (RP62A) to a highly virulent and osteolytic strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (USA300) in an established murine implant-associated osteomyelitis model. Bacterial burden was assessed by colony forming units (CFUs), tissue damage was assessed by histology and micro-computed tomography, biofilm was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), host gene expression was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and osseous integration was assessed via biomechanical push-out test. While CFUs were recovered from RP62A-contaminated implants and surrounding tissues after 14 days, the bacterial burden was significantly less than USA300-infected tibiae (p < 0.001). In addition, RP62A failed to produce any of the gross pathologies induced by USA300 (osteolysis, reactive bone formation, Staphylococcus abscess communities, marrow necrosis, and biofilm). However, fibrous tissue was present at the implant-host interface, and rigorous SEM confirmed the rare presence of cocci on RP62A-contaminated implants. Gene expression studies revealed that IL-1β, IL-6, RANKL, and TLR-2 mRNA levels in RP62A-infected bone were increased versus Sterile controls. Ex vivo push-out testing showed that RP62A-infected implants required significantly less force compared with the Sterile group (7.5 ± 3.4 vs. 17.3 ± 4.1 N; p < 0.001), but required 10-fold greater force than USA300-infected implants (0.7 ± 0.3 N; p < 0.001). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that S. epidermidis is a commensal pathogen whose mechanisms to inhibit osseous integration are limited to minimal biofilm formation on the implant, and low-grade inflammation. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Specifically, a titania (TiO2) nanospike coating (TNC) was fabricated by alkaline hydrothermal treatment firstly, followed by immobilization of rationally synthesized Pep via robust coordinative interactions, named TNPC. This coating was able to effectively kill (>99.9%) both Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, while being non-toxic to murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Furthermore, the in vivo infection studies denoted that the adherent bacteria numbers on the TNPC implants were significantly reduced by 6 orders of magnitude than those on the pure Ti implants (p < 0.001). Importantly, in the presence of cationic amino groups and residual Ti-OH groups, substantial HAp deposition on the TNPC surface in Kokubo's simulated body fluid (SBF) occurred after 14 days.

We followed replicated microbial communities under strong and weak habitat filters associated with the crab's gut and carapace. For bacteria, colonization of the crab's gut is constrained by strong chemical and physical filtering, while the carapace remains relatively open for colonization. Consistent with successional models of bacterial biofilms, carapace microbial communities initially converged in community composition at day 8 and diverged thereafter. We expected gut microbial communities to deviate from the trajectory in the carapace and converge towards a subset of tolerant species. Instead, bacterial communities in the gut exhibited low richness, unchanging similarity in composition and turnover in species identities throughout the duration of our study. These habitat filter effects were linked with weak species interactions and low influence from colonization in the gut.

Our results indicate that soluble SRGO nanosheets were prepared using graphene oxide (GO) as a raw material.

Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements were used to determine Z-average sizes and surface charges of GO and SRGOs. X-ray diffractometry, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy revealed the progressive elimination of labile oxygen functional groups during hydrothermal treatment and restoration of the π-conjugated network.

Peculiarities of course and appearance of pyelonephritis chronic form and relapses in children is explained by biofilms formation.","authors":[{"name":"М Mishyna"},{"name":"I Marchenko"},{"name":"S Malanchuk"},{"name":"N Makieieva"},{"name":"Yu Mozgova"}],"keywords":[]},"article436":{"pmid":"31687841","title":"Magnesium and calcium ions: roles in bacterial cell attachment and biofilm structure maturation.","abs":"The ubiquitous divalent cations magnesium and calcium are important nutrients required by bacteria for growth and cell maintenance. Multi-faceted roles are shown both in bacterial initial attachment and biofilm maturation. The effects of calcium and magnesium can be highlighted in physio-chemical interactions, gene regulation and bio-macromolecular structural modification, which lead to either promotion or inhibition of biofilms. This review outlines recent research addressing phenotypic changes and mechanisms undertaken by calcium and magnesium in affecting bacterial biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Tianyang Wang"},{"name":"Steve Flint"},{"name":"Jon Palmer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm structure"},{"word":"calcium"},{"word":"cell attachment"},{"word":"gene regulation"},{"word":"magnesium"}]},"article437":{"pmid":"31687557","title":"A compact pulse-modulation cold air plasma jet for the inactivation of chronic wound bacteria: development and characterization.","abs":"A compact low-temperature plasma jet device was developed to use ambient air as plasma gas. The device was driven by a 2.52-kV high-voltage direct-current pulse in a burst mode, with a repetition rate of 2 kHz. The maximum plasma discharge current was 3.5 A, with an approximately 10 ns full-width half-maximum. Nitric oxide, hydroxyl radical, atomic oxygen, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide-important reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS)-were mainly produced. The amount of plasma-generated RONS can be controlled by varying the pulse-modulation factors. After optimization, the plasma plume length was approximately 5 mm and the treatment temperature was less than 40 °C. The preliminary bactericidal effects were tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and their biofilms. The results showed that the plasma can effectively inactivate S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA in both time- and pulse-dependent manner. Thus, this produced plasma device proved to be an efficient tool for inactivating deteriorating bacteria. Further versatile utilization of this portable plasma generator is also promising.","authors":[{"name":"Phuthidhorn Thana"},{"name":"Apiwat Wijaikhum"},{"name":"Pipath Poramapijitwat"},{"name":"Chakkrapong Kuensaen"},{"name":"Jomkhwan Meerak"},{"name":"Athipong Ngamjarurojana"},{"name":"Sureeporn Sarapirom"},{"name":"Dheerawan Boonyawan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bactericidal action"},{"word":"Biomedical engineering"},{"word":"Chronic wound bacteria"},{"word":"Cold atmospheric pressure plasmas"},{"word":"Plasma physics"}]},"article438":{"pmid":"31687190","title":"Antibacterial efficacy of silver diamine fluoride as a root canal irrigant.","abs":"Conventional disinfectants and medicaments have not been able to achieve and maintain sterilization of root canals.
