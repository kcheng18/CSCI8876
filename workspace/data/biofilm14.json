Two of the seven patients were admitted to hospital for intravenous antibiotic treatment, while the rest were treated with oral antibiotics at home. Both the admitted patients had temporary vascular catheter infections from the aforementioned pathogens. We conclude that the outbreak is due to colonization of treated reverse osmosis water, presumably through contamination via polluted filters and compounded by the usage of reprocessed dialysers in the dialysis center. This is especially relevant because contaminated treated water is directly introduced into the blood compartment of the dialysers during reprocessing. In addition, there seems to be a propensity for both organisms to cause prolonged febrile reactions in patients with temporary vascular catheters, likely through the early development of biofilm. Intensification of general sterilization procedures, servicing and replacement of old decrepit components of the water treatment system and temporary cessation of dialyser reuse practice seem to have halted the outbreak. Due to the virulent nature and difficult resistant profile of nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria, we strongly recommend meticulous vigilance in the surveillance of culture isolates in routine microbiological specimens from dialysis centers, especially if there is a senescent water treatment system and a practice of reprocessing dialysers.","authors":[{"name":"May K Thet"},{"name":"Ma Lourdes F Pelobello"},{"name":"Milton Das"},{"name":"Mohammed M Alhaji"},{"name":"Vui Heng Chong"},{"name":"Muhammad Abdul Mabood Khalil"},{"name":"Terence Chinniah"},{"name":"Jackson Tan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Ralstonia Pickettii"},{"word":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"},{"word":"Outbreak"},{"word":"hemodialysis"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"30746681","title":"N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.","abs":"Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is one of the most common pathogens to establish and cause infection in human beings, affecting about 50% of the world's population.

Approximately 20% of infected people will manifest disease; people at high risk include those who live in low- and middle-income countries with poor sanitary conditions, since the mechanism of transmission seems to be oral-oral or faecal-oral (mostly during infancy).

Staphylococcus saprophyticus is one of the main etiological agents of UTIs, however, little is known about biofilm production in this species and especially about its response to the antimicrobial agents used to treat UTIs when a biofilm is present. For this reason, the aim of this work was to evaluate the response of S. saprophyticus biofilms to five antimicrobial agents. Staphylococcus saprophyticus was evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility in its planktonic form by means of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and in biofilms by means of minimum inhibitory concentration in biofilm (MICB) against the following antimicrobial agents by the microdilution technique: vancomycin, oxacillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin. Of the 169 S. saprophyticus studied, 119 produced a biofilm as demonstrated by the polystyrene plate adherence method. Biofilm cells of S. saprophyticus exhibited a considerable increase in MICB when compared to the planktonic forms, with an increase of more than 32 times in the MICB of some drugs. Some isolates switched from the category of susceptible in the planktonic condition to resistant in the biofilm state. Statistical analysis of the results showed a significant increase in MICB (p < 0.0001) for all five drugs tested in the biofilm state compared to the planktonic form. Regarding determination of the minimum bactericidal concentration in biofilm (MBCB), there were isolates for which the minimum bactericidal concentration of all drugs was equal to or higher than the highest concentration tested.","authors":[{"name":"Katheryne Benini Martins"},{"name":"Adriano Martison Ferreira"},{"name":"Valéria Cataneli Pereira"},{"name":"Luiza Pinheiro"},{"name":"Adilson de Oliveira"},{"name":"Maria de Lourdes Ribeiro de Souza da Cunha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MBCB"},{"word":"MICB"},{"word":"Staphylococcus saprophyticus"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"30745390","title":"Role of Viscoelasticity in Bacterial Killing by Antimicrobials in Differently Grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizes the sputum of most adult cystic fibrosis patients, forming difficult-to-eradicate biofilms in which bacteria are protected in their self-produced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrices.

These deposits reduce the eco-efficiency of the processing equipment and increase the risk of subsequent surface contamination with the formation of biofilms. In the agro-food and water supplier sectors, which are our main concern, fouling on the hot walls of processing heat exchangers is a common occurrence and requires frequent cleaning cycles to ensure hygiene requirements are met. This results in a considerable ecological footprint. Sensors and diagnostic tools for monitoring fouling are thus of utmost importance to ensure the rational validation of the cleaning end-point and to decrease the environmental impact of the cleaning cycles. In this paper, a non-destructive ultrasonic monitoring technique using coda waves and the associated signal processing was tested to monitor the evolution over time of a deposit layer on a solid wall during cleaning. To ascertain the feasibility of the method, a piece of wax of controlled thickness was deposited to simulate the initial fouling state and a cleaning cycle was launched. The decorrelation coefficient was used as an indicator to monitor fouling. This article presents the principle of this unprecedented technique for measuring the degree of fouling. The results of the experiments show that this non-destructive monitoring technology is sensitive to changes in fouling and that the decorrelation coefficient curves are in agreement with the cleaning kinetics captured using a video camera, thus ascertaining the pertinence of the diagnostic tool proposed.","authors":[{"name":"B Chen"},{"name":"D Callens"},{"name":"P Campistron"},{"name":"E Moulin"},{"name":"P Debreyne"},{"name":"G Delaplace"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cleaning"},{"word":"Coda wave interferometry"},{"word":"Fouling"},{"word":"Ultrasonic"}]},"article5":{"pmid":"30744421","title":"Dose-response effect of chlorhexidine on a multispecies oral biofilm formed on pure titanium and on a titanium-zirconium alloy.","abs":"This study aimed to test the dose-response effect of chlorhexidine on multispecies biofilms formed on commercially pure titanium (cpTi) and titanium-zirconium (TiZr) alloy.

Results showed that biofilm development have different growth rate and distinct algae composition in different seasons, which are mainly related to the difference in temperature, nutrient levels, and suspend solids in lake water. Biofilm development was much quicker on small plastics in all seasons. At the end of the experiment, all plastics lost buoyancy in summer while only a small portion lost buoyance in other seasons. Sinking of the floating plastics can be attributed to the development of biofilm and the trapped minerals. Our results demonstrated that biofilm development can cause the sinking of floating plastics in fresh lakes but the time required to lose buoyance can differ seasonally. Floating plastics will remain in water for a longer time in cold season but sink in a short time in warm season.

In technical applications of bioleaching, such as reactor leaching in the temperature range of 50 up to 90 °C and also in (self-heating) heaps, thermophilic archaea play an important role and often are the leaching organisms of choice. Nevertheless, to date there is little information available on the interactions between thermoacidophilic archaea and their natural mineral substrates such as pyrite. Especially for extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of archaea and their biofilms in bioleaching environments information is rather limited. The present work focused on investigations of biofilm dynamics and EPS production of the thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus sp. DSM 29099 under bioleaching conditions. The results show that biofilms are dispersed non-homogeneously on pyrite. Large parts of the pyrite surfaces remain free of cells. Cell detachment from pyrite results in microbial footprints which, based on lectin binding assays, consist of mannose, glucose and fucose containing compounds. A monolayer biofilm develops on pyrite after 2-4 days of incubation. In addition, the pyrite surface is covered with a layer of organic compounds. EPS analysis indicates the presence of proteins, polysaccharides and uronic acids, the composition of which varies according to substrate and lifestyle (i.e. planktonic, biofilm cells). This report provides insight into EPS and biofilm characteristics of thermophilic archaea and improves understanding of the mineral-microbial-biofilm interfacial interactions in extreme environments. Moreover, the results on interaction dynamics of archaeal microbial consortia will facilitate the understanding of thermophilic bioleaching.","authors":[{"name":"Ruiyong Zhang"},{"name":"Thomas R Neu"},{"name":"Véronique Blanchard"},{"name":"Mario Vera"},{"name":"Wolfgang Sand"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm dynamics"},{"word":"Bioleaching"},{"word":"Confocal laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"Thermoacidophilic archaea"}]},"article16":{"pmid":"30742947","title":"In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of laser exposed chlorpromazine against Gram-positive bacteria in planktonic and biofilm growth state.","abs":"Aqueous chlorpromazine solutions exposed to 266 nm generated as fourth harmonic of Nd:YAG pulsed laser along time intervals from 1 min to 240 min were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against planktonic and adherent Gram-positive bacterial strains.

Enterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of local and disseminated multidrug-resistant hospital infections, but the molecular mechanisms used by this non-motile bacterium to penetrate surfaces and translocate through tissues remain largely unexplored. Here we present experimental evidence indicating that E. faecalis generates exopolysaccharides containing β-1,6-linked poly-N-acetylglucosamine (polyGlcNAc) as a mechanism to successfully penetrate semisolid surfaces and translocate through human epithelial cell monolayers. Genetic screening and molecular analyses of mutant strains identified glnA, rpiA and epaX as genes critically required for optimal E. faecalis penetration and translocation. Mechanistically, GlnA and RpiA cooperated to generate uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) that was utilized by EpaX to synthesize polyGlcNAc-containing polymers. Notably, exogenous supplementation with polymeric N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) restored surface penetration by E. faecalis mutants devoid of EpaX. Our study uncovers an unexpected mechanism whereby the RpiA-GlnA-EpaX metabolic axis enables production of polyGlcNAc-containing polysaccharides that endow E. faecalis with the ability to penetrate surfaces.

Persistent MRSA infection was associated with staphylococcal metabolic adaptation, but not changes in immunogenicity. Adaptation was characterized by selective use of the tricarboxylic acid cycle cycle and generation of biofilm, a means of limiting oxidant stress. Increased transcription of specific metabolic genes was conserved in all host-adapted strains, most notably a 10,000-fold increase in fumC, which catalyzes the interconversion of fumarate and malate. Elevated fumarate levels promoted in vitro biofilm production in clinical isolates. Host-adapted strains preferred to assimilate glucose polymers and pyruvate, which can be metabolized to generate N-acetylglucosamine polymers that comprise biofilm.

Piper nigrum has also been extensively explored for its biological properties and its bioactive phyto-compounds. There is, however, no updated compilation of these available data to provide a complete profile of the medicinal aspects of P. nigrum. This study endeavors to systematically review scientific data on the traditional uses, phytochemical composition, and pharmacological properties of P. nigrum. Information was obtained using a combination of keywords via recognized electronic databases (e.g., Science Direct and Google Scholar). Google search was also used. Books and online materials were also considered, and the literature search was restricted to the English language. The country with the highest number of traditional reports of P. nigrum for both human and veterinary medicine was India, mostly for menstrual and ear-nose-throat disorders in human and gastrointestinal disorders in livestock. The seeds and fruits were mostly used, and the preferred mode of preparation was in powdered form, pills or tablets, and paste. Piper nigrum and its bioactive compounds were also found to possess important pharmacological properties. Antimicrobial activity was recorded against a wide range of pathogens via inhibition of biofilm, bacterial efflux pumps, bacterial swarming, and swimming motilities. Studies also reported its antioxidant effects against a series of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species including the scavenging of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, DPPH, ABTS, and reducing effect against ferric and molybdenum (VI). Improvement of antioxidant enzymes in vivo has also been reported. Piper nigrum also exhibited anticancer effect against a number of cell lines from breast, colon, cervical, and prostate through different mechanisms including cytotoxicity, apoptosis, autophagy, and interference with signaling pathways. Its antidiabetic property has also been confirmed in vivo as well as hypolipidemic activity as evidenced by decrease in the level of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein and increase in high-density lipoprotein. Piper nigrum also has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anticonvulsant, and neuroprotective effects. The major bioactive compound identified in P. nigrum is piperine although other compounds are also present including piperic acid, piperlonguminine, pellitorine, piperolein B, piperamide, piperettine, and (-)-kusunokinin, which also showed biological potency. Most pharmacological studies were conducted in vitro (n = 60) while only 21 in vivo and 1 clinical trial were performed. Hence, more in vivo experiments using a pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic approach would be beneficial. As a conclusive remark, P. nigrum should not only be regarded as King of spices but can also be considered as part of the kingdom of medicinal agents, comprising a panoply of bioactive compounds with potential nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Heerasing Takooree"},{"name":"Muhammad Z Aumeeruddy"},{"name":"Kannan R R Rengasamy"},{"name":"Katharigatta N Venugopala"},{"name":"Rajesh Jeewon"},{"name":"Gokhan Zengin"},{"name":"Mohamad F Mahomoodally"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"Black pepper"},{"word":"piperine"},{"word":"spice"},{"word":"traditional medicine"}]},"article29":{"pmid":"30740751","title":"Pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa planktonic and biofilm-derived cells.","abs":"The influence of growth phase and state on the survival and recovery of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exposed to ciprofloxacin was investigated using batch culture grown planktonic cells and disaggregated biofilm populations. Biofilms were either nonantibiotic exposed or previously exposed to ciprofloxacin before disaggregation and subsequent challenge with ciprofloxacin. Viable counts showed that late stationary phase cells were tolerant to ciprofloxacin over 24 h exposure, while all other populations presented a biphasic killing pattern. In contrast, the metabolic activity of planktonic and biofilm-derived cells remained similar to controls during the initial 6 h of ciprofloxacin exposure, despite a significant reduction in viable cell numbers. A similar effect was observed when assessing the postantibiotic effect of 1 h ciprofloxacin exposure. Thus, although cell reduction occurred, the metabolic status of the cells remained unchanged. The recovery of disaggregated biofilm cells previously exposed to ciprofloxacin was significantly quicker than naïve biofilm cells, and this latter population's recovery was significantly slower than all planktonic populations. Results from this work have implications for our understanding of biofilm-related infections and their resilience to antimicrobial treatment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Removal of biofilms from surfaces and infection sites via disaggregation and induction of dispersion may reverse their antibiotic tolerant state. However, little is known of the recovery of the cells upon disaggregation from biofilms. Driven by this gap in knowledge we quantified the effect of ciprofloxacin on disaggregated biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including those previously exposed to ciprofloxacin. Our results provide further insight into bacterial resilience, regrowth, and antimicrobial efficacy, as reduction in cell viability does not directly correlate with the metabolic activity of bacteria at the time of the exposure to antimicrobials. Thus, despite a perceived reduction in viability, the potential for cell persistence and regrowth remains and recovery is quicker upon subsequent exposure to antimicrobial, supporting the increase in resilience and recurrence of infections.","authors":[{"name":"C N H Marques"},{"name":"S M Nelson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonads"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"microbial physiology"},{"word":"resistance"}]},"article30":{"pmid":"30740688","title":"Synergistic activity of chlorhexidine and synoeca-MP peptide against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬This study aims to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities and cytotoxicity of chlorhexidine (CHX) and synoeca-MP peptide alone or in combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

These infections are often recalcitrant to treatment and require therapy with multiple drugs for long duration. The biofilm resident bacteria also display phenotypic drug tolerance and thus it has been hypothesized that the drug unresponsiveness in vivo could be due to formation of biofilms inside the host. We have discussed the biofilms of several pathogenic non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) species in context to the in vivo pathologies. Besides pathogenic NTMs, Mycobacterium smegmatis is often used as a model organism for understanding mycobacterial physiology and has been studied extensively for understanding the mycobacterial biofilms. A number of components of the mycobacterial cell wall such as glycopeptidolipids, short chain mycolic acids, monomeromycolyl diacylglycerol, etc. have been shown to play an important role in formation of pellicle biofilms. It shall be noted that these components impart a hydrophobic character to the mycobacterial cell surface that facilitates cell to cell interaction. However, these components are not necessarily the constituents of the extracellular matrix of mycobacterial biofilms. In the end, we have described the biofilms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis. Three models of Mtb biofilm formation have been proposed to study the factors regulating biofilm formation, the physiology of the resident bacteria, and the nature of the biomaterial that holds these bacterial masses together. These models include pellicle biofilms formed at the liquid-air interface of cultures, leukocyte lysate-induced biofilms, and thiol reductive stressinduced biofilms. All the three models offer their own advantages in the study of Mtb biofilms. Interestingly, lipids (mainly keto-mycolic acids) are proposed to be the primary component of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in the pellicle biofilm, whereas the leukocyte lysate-induced and thiol reductive stress-induced biofilms possess polysaccharides as the primary component of EPS. Both models also contain extracellular DNA in the EPS. Interestingly, thiol reductive stressinduced Mtb biofilms are held together by cellulose and yet unidentified structural proteins. We believe that a better understanding of the EPS of Mtb biofilms and the physiology of the resident bacteria will facilitate the development of shorter regimen for TB treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Poushali Chakraborty"},{"name":"Ashwani Kumar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cellulose"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substance"},{"word":"macrocolony biofilm"},{"word":"pellicle biofilm"},{"word":"thiol reductive stress"},{"word":"tuberculosis pathogenesis"}]},"article32":{"pmid":"30740095","title":"Physical Interaction of Sodium Houttuyfonate With β-1,3-Glucan Evokes Candida albicans Cell Wall Remodeling.","abs":"Candida albicans is a commonly isolated opportunistic yeast and can endanger immune-compromised human health. As increasingly isolated strains present resistance to currently used antifungals, it is necessary to develop novel antimycotics. In a previous study, sodium houttuyfonate (SH) alone or in combination with fluconazole revealed relatively strong antifungal potential against C. albicans, and the underlying mechanism might be likely to be associated with β-glucan synthesis and transportation (Shao et al., 2017). In the present experiment, we used a standard C. albicans isolate and a phr1 mutant (phr1-/-) to investigate the interaction of SH with β-glucan, one of the critical components in cell wall and biofilm matrix. We showed that lyticase was the most effective enzyme that could significantly increase the antifungal inhibition of SH at 64 μg/mL in C. albicans SC5314 but became futile in phr1-/-. Although the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of SH were comparable in the two Candida strains used, phr1-/- appeared to be more susceptible to SH compared with C. albicans SC5314 in biofilms (64 versus 512 μg/mL). The peak areas of SH decreased markedly by 71.6, 38.2, and 62.6% in C. albicans SC5314 and by 70% and 53.2% in phr1-/- by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis after co-incubation of SH with laminarin, extracellular matrix (EM) and cell wall. The chitin appeared to not interact with SH. We further demonstrated that sub-MIC SH (8 μg/mL) was able to induce cell wall remodeling by unmasking β-1,3-glucan and chitin in both C. albicans SC5314 and phr1-/-. Based on these findings, we propose that β-1,3-glucan can block the entrance of SH through non-specific absorption, and then the fungus senses the interaction of SH with β-1,3-glucan and exposes more β-1,3-glucan that contributes to SH blocking in turn.","authors":[{"name":"Wenyue Da"},{"name":"Jing Shao"},{"name":"Qianqian Li"},{"name":"Gaoxiang Shi"},{"name":"Tianming Wang"},{"name":"Daqiang Wu"},{"name":"Changzhong Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"cell wall remodeling"},{"word":"chitin"},{"word":"glucan"},{"word":"sodium houttuyfonate"},{"word":"unmasking"}]},"article33":{"pmid":"30739982","title":"Dynamic evolution of anodic biofilm when maturing under different external resistive loads in microbial fuel cells.

By interfering with different steps of the pilin glycosylation and phosphoform modification pathways, we investigated the effect of pilin post-translational modification on the shape and dynamics of microcolonies formed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Deleting the phosphotransferase responsible for phosphoethanolamine modification at residue serine 68 inhibits shape relaxations of microcolonies after perturbation and causes bacteria carrying the phosphoform modification to segregate to the surface of mixed colonies. We relate these mesoscopic phenotypes to increased attractive forces generated by T4P between cells. Moreover, by deleting genes responsible for the pilin glycan structure, we show that the number of saccharides attached at residue serine 63 affects the ratio between surface tension and viscosity and cause sorting between bacteria carrying different pilin glycoforms. We conclude that different pilin post-translational modifications moderately affect the attractive forces between bacteria but have severe effects on the material properties of microcolonies.","authors":[{"name":"Robert Zöllner"},{"name":"Tom Cronenberg"},{"name":"Nadzeya Kouzel"},{"name":"Anton Welker"},{"name":"Michael Koomey"},{"name":"Berenike Maier"}],"keywords":[]},"article35":{"pmid":"30739147","title":"Microbial Organic Matter Utilization in High-Arctic Streams: Key Enzymatic Controls.","abs":"In the Arctic, climate changes contribute to enhanced mobilization of organic matter in streams.

We found significant differences in microbial organic matter utilization among the study streams draining contrasting geomorphological features, indicating a strong coupling between terrestrial and stream ecosystems. Phosphatase and phenol oxidase activities were higher in solifluction areas than in alluvial areas.

In drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), effective removal of cyanotoxins with reduced toxicity is a primary concern. Commonly used treatments, such as ozonation, chlorination or activated carbon, undergo significant changes in their operating conditions (mainly dosage) to counter the variation in different environmental parameters, such as pH, temperature, and high cyanotoxin concentration. Presence of metal ions, natural organic matter (NOM), and other chemicals demand higher dosage and hence affect the activation energy to efficiently break down the cyanotoxin molecule. Due to these higher dose requirements, the treatment leads to the formation of toxic metabolites at a concentration high enough to break the guideline values. Biological methods of cyanotoxin removal proceed via enzymatic pathway where the protein-encoding genes are often responsible for the compound breakdown into non-toxic metabolites. However, in contrast to the chemical treatment, the biological processes advance at a much slower kinetic rate, predominantly due to a longer onset period (high lag phase). In fact, more than 90% of the studies reported on the biological degradation of the cyanotoxins attribute the biodegradation to the bacterial suspension. This suspended growth limits the mass transfer kinetics due to the presence of metal ions, NOMs and, other oxidizable matter, which further prolongs the lag phase and makes biological process toxic-free, albeit less efficient. In this context, this review attempts to bring out the importance of the attached growth mechanism, in particular, the biofilm-based treatment approaches which can enhance the biodegradation rate.","authors":[{"name":"Pratik Kumar"},{"name":"Krishnamoorthy Hegde"},{"name":"Satinder Kaur Brar"},{"name":"Maximiliano Cledon"},{"name":"Azadeh Kermanshahi-Pour"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Attached growth process"},{"word":"Biodegradation"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cyanotoxin"},{"word":"Gene analysis"}]},"article39":{"pmid":"30737817","title":"Antimicrobial effect of anesthetic-eluting ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for post-arthroplasty antibacterial prophylaxis.","abs":"Despite being a relatively safe surgery, total joint replacement is often associated with two major complications-severe post-operative pain and periprosthetic joint infection.

On the other hand, the presence of corrosion inhibitor 2-mercaptopyridine (2-MCP) with bacteria (EN2 and EN9), the biofilm on metal surface was highly inhibited and thus reduces the corrosion rate (CR: 0.004 mm/y).

One of the derivatives, PPAP 23, which showed high antimicrobial activity and low cytotoxicity, was chosen for further investigation of its bactericidal profiles and mode of action. PPAP 23 showed a better efficacy in killing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and decreasing the metabolic activity of 5-day-old biofilm cells than vancomycin. Moreover, S. aureus did not appear to develop resistance against PPAP 23. The antimicrobial mechanism of PPAP 23 was investigated by RNA-seq combined with phenotypic and biochemical approaches. RNA-seq suggested that PPAP 23 signaled iron overload to the bacterial cells because genes involved in iron transport were downregulated and iron storage gene was upregulated by PPAP 23. PPAP 23 affected the membrane integrity but did not induce pore formation; it inhibited bacterial respiration. PPAP 23 preferentially inhibited Fe-S cluster enzymes; it has a mild iron chelating activity and supplementation of exogenous iron attenuated its antimicrobial activity. PPAP 23 was more effective in inhibiting the growth of S. aureus under iron-restricted condition. The crystal structure of a benzylated analog of PPAP 23 showed a highly defined octahedral coordination of three PPAP ligands around a Fe (3+) core. This suggests that PPAPs are generally capable of iron chelation and are able to form defined stable complexes. PPAP 23 was found to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Fluorescence microscopic analysis showed that PPAP 23 caused an enlargement of the bacterial cells, perturbed the membrane, and dislocated the nucleoid.

Whereas the hyper-virulent serogroup III clonal cluster 17 has been associated with neonatal disease and meningitis, serogroup III ST283 was recently implicated in invasive disease among non-pregnant adults in Asia. Here, through comparative genome analyses of invasive and non-invasive ST283 strains, we identified a truncated DNA-binding regulator of a two-component system in a non-invasive strain that was homologous to Bacillus subtilis bceR, encoding the bceRSAB response regulator, which was conserved among GBS strains. Using isogenic knockout and complementation mutants of the ST283 strain, we demonstrated that resistance to bacitracin and the human antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin LL-37 was reduced in the ΔbceR strain with MICs changing from 64 and 256 μg/ml to 0.25 and 64 μg/ml, respectively. Further, the ATP-binding cassette transporter was upregulated by sub-inhibitory concentrations of bacitracin in the wild-type strain. Upregulation of dltA in the wild-type strain was also observed and thought to explain the increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides. DltA, an enzyme involved in D-alanylation during the synthesis of wall teichoic acids, which mediates reduced antimicrobial susceptibility, was previously shown to be regulated by the bceR-type regulator in Staphylococcus aureus. In a murine infection model, we found that the ΔbceR mutation significantly reduced the mortality rate compared to that with the wild-type strain (p < 0.01). Moreover, this mutant was more susceptible to oxidative stress compared to the wild-type strain (p < 0.001) and was associated with reduced biofilm formation (p < 0.0001). Based on 2-DGE and mass spectrometry, we showed that downregulation of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC), a Gls24 family stress protein, and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) in the ΔbceR strain might explain the attenuated virulence and compromised stress response.

We previously postulated that the presence of in vivo biofilm-like communities of M. tuberculosis could contribute to this drug tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, certain 2-aminoimidazole (2-AIs) molecules with anti-biofilm activity were shown to revert mycobacterial drug tolerance in an in vitro M. tuberculosis biofilm model. While exploring their mechanism of action, it was serendipitously observed that these 2-AI molecules also potentiated β-lactam antibiotics by affecting mycobacterial protein secretion and lipid export. As these two bacterial processes are energy-dependent, herein it was evaluated if 2-AI compounds affect mycobacterial bioenergetics. At low concentrations, 2B8, the lead 2-AI compound, collapsed both components of the proton motive force, similar to other cationic amphiphiles. Interestingly, however, the minimum inhibitory concentration of 2B8 against M. tuberculosis correlated with a higher drug concentration determined to interfere with the mycobacterial electron transport chain.

However, they exert negative effects in clinical applications, for example, teeth staining, taste disturbance and harm to oral tissue after a long-term exposure. Therefore, biocompatible strategies for efficient antibacterial drug delivery are in high demand. In this study, aimed at dental caries therapy enhancement, we designed a pH-responsive nanocarrier system, capable of releasing CHX in an acidic environment within cariogenic biofilms. Cationic poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-(((2-aminoethyl)carbamoyl)oxy)ethyl methacrylate) (PEG-b-PAECOEMA) was synthesized first. Modification of PAECOEMA by citraconic anhydride (CA) forms negatively charged PEG-b-PAECOEMA/CA, which could assemble into core-shell polyionic complex micelles (PICMs) when mixed with cationic CHX via electrostatic interactions. PICMs are stable in healthy neutral oral microenvironments with CHX encapsulated in the core and PEG shell exposed. Once in acidic milieu within caries-producing biofilms, they rapidly disassemble and release CHX cargo owing to degradation of citraconic amide groups. Molecular structures of the above copolymers were confirmed using 1H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. The pH-dependent degradation rates of citraconic amide in PEG-b-PAECOEMA/CA copolymer were measured by fluorescamine method. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies confirmed successful assembly of well-defined spherical PICMs in aqueous solution. The disassembly of PICMs in acidic microenvironment was observed using dynamic light scattering (DLS). PICMs showed an obvious pH-dependent drug release profile when the pH changed from 7.4 to 5.5. More importantly, the micellar system could reduce drug toxicity of CHX and exhibited outstanding antibacterial capability in the biofilm of Streptococcus mutans. Micelles constructed from pH-sensitive PEG-b-PAECOEMA/CA are highly promising for dental caries therapy and provide guidelines for drug-delivery system design in other acidic pathologic systems.","authors":[{"name":"Zhouxiang Zhao"},{"name":"Chunmei Ding"},{"name":"Yaqin Wang"},{"name":"Hong Tan"},{"name":"Jianshu Li"}],"keywords":[]},"article81":{"pmid":"30723364","title":"In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial property of silver nanoparticles and chlorhexidine against five different oral pathogenic bacteria.","abs":"Numerous antimicrobial agents are used to eliminate oral biofilm.

Such initial biomaterial-bacteria interactions and the influence of antibacterial treatments are poorly understood and investigated here in situ by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). A saliva-coated titanium (Ti) biosensor is applied to analyze possible specific signal patterns indicating microbial binding mechanisms and bactericide-caused changes in bacterial film rigidity or cell leakage caused by a clinically relevant antibacterial agent (ABA), i.e., a mouth rinse comprising chlorhexidine (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). Apparent missing mass effects during the formation of microscopically proven dense and vital bacterial films indicate punctual, specific binding of S. gordonii to the saliva-coated biosensor, compared to unspecific adhesion to pure Ti. Coincidentally to ABA-induced killing of surface-adhered bacteria, an increase of adsorbed dissipative mass can be sensed, contrary to the prior mass-loss. This suggests the acoustic sensing of the leakage of cellular content caused by bacterial cell wall rupturing and membrane damage upon the bactericidal attack.

Previously, it has been reported that substrate stiffness plays an important role in the initial attachment of bacteria. However, the mechanism of how the stiffness modulates the initial adhesion of bacteria remains unclear. Here, we developed magnetic nanoprobe-based force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) as a new platform to measure the adhesion force of bacteria. Through examining the initial adhesion force and the adhesive protein, fibronectin-binding protein (FnBP), of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), we found that the increase of the substrate stiffness promoted the expression of FnBP, thus enhancing the initial adhesion force of bacteria. Following the formation of initial adhesion, the substrates with soft stiffness delayed the biofilm formation, whereas those with moderate stiffness showed preferential promotion of the biofilm formation.

Beyond its function at the ribosomal level it should be exported to the bacterial surface and act as an environmental sensor. In Bacillus cereus, and other cutaneous bacteria, it serves as a Substance P (SP) receptor and is essential for bacterial adaptation to the host. However, the modus operandi of EfTu as a bacterial sensor remains to be investigated. Studies realized by confocal and transmission electron microscopy revealed that, in the absence of an exogenous signal, EfTu is not exposed on the bacterial surface but is recruited under the effect of SP. In addition, SP acts as a transcriptional regulator of the tuf gene encoding for EfTu. As observed using gadolinium chloride, an inhibitor of membrane mechanosensitive channels (Msc), Msc control EfTu export and subsequently the bacterial response to SP both in terms of cytotoxicity and biofilm formation activity. Microscale thermophoresis revealed that in response to SP, EfTu can form homopolymers. This event should occur after EfTu export and, as shown by proteo-liposome reconstruction studies, SP appears to promote EfTu polymers association to the membrane, leading subsequently to the bacterial response. Molecular modeling suggests that this mechanism should involve EfTu unfolding and insertion into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, presumably through formation of homopolymers. This study is unraveling the original mechanism action of EfTu as a bacterial sensor but also reveals that this protein should have a broader role, including in eukaryotes.","authors":[{"name":"Awa R N'Diaye"},{"name":"Valerie Borrel"},{"name":"Pierre-Jean Racine"},{"name":"Thomas Clamens"},{"name":"Segolene Depayras"},{"name":"Olivier Maillot"},{"name":"Beatrice Schaack"},{"name":"Sylvie Chevalier"},{"name":"Olivier Lesouhaitier"},{"name":"Marc G J Feuilloley"}],"keywords":[]},"article91":{"pmid":"30718527","title":"Biofilm Formation of Staphylococcus aureus under Food Heat Processing Conditions: First Report on CML Production within Biofilm.","abs":"This study aimed to evaluate the Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation and Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine generation ability under food heat processing conditions including pH (5.0-9.0), temperature (25 °C, 31 °C, 37 °C, 42 °C and 65 °C), NaCl concentration (10%, 15% and 20%, w/v) and glucose concentration (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, w/v).

I previously showed that the cysL deletion mutant was defective in biofilm formation, but the reason for this remains unidentified. CysL is a transcriptional activator of the cysJI operon, which encodes sulfite reductase, an enzyme involved in cysteine biosynthesis. Decreased production of sulfite reductase led to biofilm formation defects in the ΔcysL mutant. The ΔcysL mutation was suppressed by disrupting cysH operon genes, whose products function upstream of sulfite reductase in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway, indicating that defects in cysteine biosynthesis were not a direct cause for the defective biofilm formation observed in the ΔcysL mutant. The cysH gene encodes phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase, which requires a reduced form of thioredoxin (TrxA) as an electron donor. High expression of trxA inhibited biofilm formation in the ΔcysL mutant but not in the wild-type strain. Northern blot analysis showed that trxA transcription was induced in the ΔcysL mutant in a disulfide stress-induced regulator Spx-dependent manner. On the basis of these results, I propose that the ΔcysL mutation causes phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase to consume large amounts of reduced thioredoxin, inducing disulfide stress and activating Spx. The spx mutation restored biofilm formation to the ΔcysL mutant. The ΔcysL mutation reduced expression of the eps operon, which is required for exopolysaccharide production. Moreover, overexpression of the eps operon restored biofilm formation to the ΔcysL mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that the ΔcysL mutation activates Spx, which then inhibits biofilm formation through repression of the eps operon.","authors":[{"name":"Kazuo Kobayashi"}],"keywords":[{"word":" Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"Spx"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cysteine biosynthesis"},{"word":"disulfide stress"}]},"article93":{"pmid":"30718303","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa Can Inhibit Growth of Streptococcal Species via Siderophore Production.","abs":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes patients to accumulate thick, dehydrated mucus in the lung and develop chronic, polymicrobial infections due to reduced mucociliary clearance.

The DSF family AIs are fatty acids, differing in their acyl chain length, branching, and substitution but having in common a cis-2 double bond that is required for their activity. In both human and plant pathogens, DSFs regulate diverse phenotypes, including virulence factor expression, antibiotic resistance, and biofilm dispersal. Despite their widespread relevance to both human health and agriculture, the molecular basis of DSF recognition by their cellular receptors remained a mystery. Here, we report the first structure-function studies of the DSF receptor regulation of pathogenicity factor R (RpfR). We present the X-ray crystal structure of the RpfR DSF-binding domain in complex with the Burkholderia DSF (BDSF), which to our knowledge is the first structure of a DSF receptor in complex with its AI. To begin to understand the mechanistic role of the BDSF-RpfR contacts observed in the biologically important complex, we have also determined the X-ray crystal structure of the RpfR DSF-binding domain in complex with the inactive, saturated isomer of BDSF, dodecanoic acid (C12:0). In addition to these ligand-receptor complex structures, we report the discovery of a previously overlooked RpfR domain and show that it binds to and negatively regulates the DSF synthase regulation of pathogenicity factor F (RpfF). We have named this RpfR region the RpfF interaction (FI) domain, and we have determined its X-ray crystal structure alone and in complex with RpfF. These X-ray crystal structures, together with extensive complementary in vivo and in vitro functional studies, reveal the molecular basis of DSF recognition and the importance of the cis-2 double bond to DSF function. Finally, we show that throughout cellular growth, the production of BDSF by RpfF is post-translationally controlled by the RpfR N-terminal FI domain, affecting the cellular concentration of the bacterial second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). Thus, in addition to describing the molecular basis for the binding and specificity of a DSF for its receptor, we describe a receptor-synthase interaction regulating bacterial quorum-sensing signaling and second messenger signal transduction.","authors":[{"name":"Evan J Waldron"},{"name":"Daniel Snyder"},{"name":"Nicolas L Fernandez"},{"name":"Emily Sileo"},{"name":"Daigo Inoyama"},{"name":"Joel S Freundlich"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"Vaughn S Cooper"},{"name":"Matthew B Neiditch"}],"keywords":[]},"article110":{"pmid":"30715289","title":"Effects of low-intensity and low-frequency ultrasound combined with tobramycin on biofilms of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) Escherichia coli.","abs":"Low-intensity and low-frequency ultrasound (LILFU) can enhance the bactericidal action of antibiotics against various sensitive bacterial species.

Isolates from a range of environments all grow by autotrophic Fe(II) oxidation. Their success lies partly in their microaerophily, which enables them to compete with abiotic Fe(II) oxidation at Fe(II)-rich oxic/anoxic transition zones. To determine the known diversity of the Zetaproteobacteria, we have used 16S rRNA gene sequences to define 59 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), at 97% similarity. While some Zetaproteobacteria taxa appear to be cosmopolitan, others are enriched by specific habitats. OTU networks show that certain Zetaproteobacteria co-exist, sharing compatible niches.

Also, a putative Fe(II) oxidation gene has been found in diverse Zetaproteobacteria taxa, suggesting that the Zetaproteobacteria evolved as Fe(II) oxidation specialists.

We show that a major factor contributing to the wide host range of phiAGO1.3 is a lack or sparcity of target sites for certain restriction-modification systems of types I and II in its genome. Phage phiAGO1.3 requires for adsorption β-O-GlcNAcylated cell wall teichoic acid, which is also essential for the expression of methicillin resistance. Under certain conditions an exposure of S. aureus to phiAGO1.3 can lead to the establishment of a mixed population in which the bacteria and phages remain in equilibrium over multiple generations. This is reminiscent of the so called phage carrier state enabling the co-existence of phage-resistant and phage-sensitive cells supporting a continuous growth of the bacterial and phage populations. The stable co-existence of bacteria and phage favors the emergence of phage-resistant variants of the bacterium. All phiAGO1.3-resistant cells isolated from the phage-carrier-state cultures contained a mutation inactivating the two-component regulatory system ArlRS, essential for efficient expression of numerous S. aureus virulence-associated traits. Moreover, the mutants were unaffected in their susceptibility to infection with an unrelated, polyvalent S. aureus phage of the genus Kayvirus. The ability of phiAGO1.3 to establish phage-carrier-state cultures did not preclude its antistaphylococcal activity in vivo in an S. aureus nematode infection model.

Active release coatings have promise to provide early protection to an implant by eradicating small colony biofilm contaminants or planktonic bacteria that can form biofilm. Traditional antibiotics can be limited as active release agents in that they have limited effect against biofilms and develop resistance at sub-lethal concentrations. A unique first-in-class compound (CZ-01127) was assessed as the active release agent in a silicone (Si)-based coating to prevent PJI in a sheep model of joint space infection. Titanium (Ti) plugs contained a porous coated Ti (PCTi) region and polymer-coated region. Plugs were implanted into a femoral condyle of sheep to assess the effect of the Si polymer on cancellous bone ingrowth, the effect of CZ-01127 on bone ingrowth, and the ability of CZ-01127 to prevent PJI. Microbiological results showed that CZ-01127 was able to eradicate bacteria in the local region of the implanted plugs. Data further showed that Si did not adversely affect bone ingrowth. However, bacteria that reached the joint space (synovium) were not fully eradicated. Outcomes suggested that the CZ-01127 coating provided local protection to the implant system in a challenging model, the design of which could be beneficial for testing future antimicrobial therapies for PJI. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is now commonplace, and constitutes an underlying problem that patients and physicians face. Active release antibiotic coatings have potential to prevent these infections. Traditional antibiotics are limited in their ability to eradicate bacteria that reside in biofilms, and are more susceptible to resistance development. This study addressed these limitations by testing the efficacy of a unique antimicrobial compound in a coating that was tested in a challenging sheep model of PJI. The unique coating was able to eradicate bacteria and prevent infection in the environment adjacent to the implant. Bacteria that escaped into the joint space still caused infection, yet benchmark data can be used to optimize the coating and translate it toward clinical use.","authors":[{"name":"Dustin L Williams"},{"name":"Richard T Epperson"},{"name":"Nicholas N Ashton"},{"name":"Nicholas B Taylor"},{"name":"Brooke Kawaguchi"},{"name":"Raymond E Olsen"},{"name":"Travis J Haussener"},{"name":"Paul R Sebahar"},{"name":"Gina Allyn"},{"name":"Ryan E Looper"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bone ingrowth"},{"word":"CZ-01127"},{"word":"Coating"},{"word":"Drug delivery"},{"word":"Implant"},{"word":"Silicone"}]},"article138":{"pmid":"30710463","title":"Controlling chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections by strategically interfering with the sensory function of SagS.","abs":"The hybrid sensor SagS plays a central role in the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, by enabling the switch from the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth and by facilitating the transition of biofilm cells to a highly tolerant state.

We developed a biofilm assay and found that axenic Synechocystis forms biofilms of cells and extracellular material but only when cells are induced by an environmental signal, such as a reduction in the concentration of growth medium BG11. Mutants lacking cell surface structures, namely type IV pili and the S-layer, do not form biofilms. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms of cell-cell binding by Synechocystis, we also developed a rapid (8-h) axenic aggregation assay. Mutants lacking type IV pili were unable to aggregate, but mutants lacking a homolog to Wza, a protein required for type 1 exopolysaccharide export in Escherichia coli, had a superbinding phenotype. In WT cultures, 1.2× BG11 medium induced aggregation to the same degree as 0.8× BG11 medium.

Outbreaks of A. baumannii infections within the clinical setting are often associated with the biofilm phenotype. This study investigates the role of biofilm biomass in A. baumannii susceptibility to exposure to a kilohertz-driven, in-house-designed, cold plasma jet, through the examination of cold plasma treatment efficacy in A. baumannii biofilms grown over various times for up to 72 h. For biofilms grown for 24, 48 and 72 h, D values were 19·32 ± 2·71, 29·18 ± 3·15 and 24·70 ± 3·07 s respectively. Monitoring A. baumannii biofilm biomass over these time periods revealed that the greatest biomass was observed at 48 h with the lowest biofilm biomass at 24 h growth. Enumeration of viable biofilm colony counts at each time point was comparable. Scanning electron microscopy images of plasma-treated biofilms revealed extensive surface damage of A. baumannii cells. These results describe the role of biomass in mediating A. baumannii biofilm susceptibility to cold plasma treatment, implicating the biofilm matrix as a protective barrier to the antimicrobial effects of cold plasma. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm formation results in increased environmental and antimicrobial tolerance and resistance compared to the planktonic phenotype. Cold plasma technology is increasingly investigated as a new tool for decontamination of biofilm-contaminated surfaces, especially those found in the clinical setting. This new technology presents a promising approach to the remediation of surfaces contaminated by biofilms. This study identifies the role played by A. baumannii biofilm biomass in mediating tolerance and susceptibility to cold plasma treatment. This work demonstrates that increased biofilm biomass reduces the efficacy of antimicrobial species generated by cold plasma, resulting in greater tolerance to plasma exposure.","authors":[{"name":"P B Flynn"},{"name":"W G Graham"},{"name":"B F Gilmore"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobials"},{"word":"biocides"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"disinfection"},{"word":"nonthermal processes"}]},"article153":{"pmid":"30706705","title":"Tetrameric Charge-Zipper Assembly of the TisB Peptide in Membranes-Computer Simulation and Experiment.","abs":"TisB is a short amphiphilic α-helical peptide from Escherichia coli that induces a breakdown of the pH gradient across the inner membrane when the bacteria are under stress and require to form persister cells to turn into a biofilm.

We further discuss how, C. glabrata, despite lacking morphological switching and secreted proteolytic activity, is able to disarm macrophage, dampen the host inflammatory immune response and replicate intracellularly.","authors":[{"name":"Kundan Kumar"},{"name":"Fizza Askari"},{"name":"Mahima Sagar Sahu"},{"name":"Rupinder Kaur"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida glabrata"},{"word":"adherence"},{"word":"aspartyl proteases"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"host immune cells"},{"word":"stress response mechanisms"},{"word":"yeast pathogens"}]},"article161":{"pmid":"30704099","title":"The Search for Natural Inhibitors of Biofilm Formation and the Activity of the Autoinductor C6-AHL in Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13884.","abs":"Human nosocomial infections are common around the world. One of the main causes is the bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae, which shows high rates of resistance to antibiotics. Thus, drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed. In this work, we report the effects of various natural substances on the formation of biofilm in Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as its stability. The effect of the molecules on the growth of K. pneumoniae was initially determined by measuring the optical density. The modification of the biofilm, the changes relating to its resistance, the effects on the bacterial adhesion to the urethral catheter and its antagonist role the hexanoyl-homoserinelactone were assessed by crystal violet, as well as by microscopy. The best effects were obtained with 3-methyl-2(5H)-furanone and 2´-hydroxycinnamic acid, which inhibited the formation of biofilm by 67.38% and 65.06%, respectively. Additionally, the remaining biofilm formed was more susceptible to gentamicin. Through microscopy examination, there were evident changes in the biofilm and adherence on the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) urethral catheter. Besides, 3-methyl-2(5H)-furanone inhibited the biofilm-forming effect of the autoinducer hexanoyl-homoserinelactone.

Therefore, the materials used for packaging production should show peculiar features and properties. Specifically, antimicrobial packaging has recently gained great attention with respect to both social and economic impacts. In this paper, the results obtained by using a polymer material functionalized by a small synthetic peptide as active packaging are reported. The surface of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), one of the most commonly used plastic materials in food packaging, was plasma-activated and covalently bio-conjugated to a bactenecin-derivative peptide named 1018K6, previously characterized in terms of antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities. The immobilization of the peptide occurred at a high yield and no release was observed under different environmental conditions. Moreover, preliminary data clearly demonstrated that the active packaging was able to significantly reduce the total bacterial count together with yeast and mold spoilage in food-dairy products. Finally, the functionalized-PET polymer showed stronger efficiency in inhibiting biofilm growth, using a Listeria monocytogenes strain isolated from food products. The use of these active materials would greatly decrease the risk of pathogen development and increase the shelf-life in the food industry, showing a real potential against a panel of microorganisms upon exposure to fresh and stored products, high chemical stability and re-use possibility.","authors":[{"name":"Bruna Agrillo"},{"name":"Marco Balestrieri"},{"name":"Marta Gogliettino"},{"name":"Gianna Palmieri"},{"name":"Rosalba Moretta"},{"name":"Yolande T R Proroga"},{"name":"Ilaria Rea"},{"name":"Alessandra Cornacchia"},{"name":"Federico Capuano"},{"name":"Giorgio Smaldone"},{"name":"Luca De Stefano"}],"keywords":[{"word":"active packaging"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"food shelf-life"},{"word":"foodborne pathogens"},{"word":"plastic materials"}]},"article163":{"pmid":"30704020","title":"The Effects of Mentha × piperita Essential Oil on C. albicans Growth, Transition, Biofilm Formation, and the Expression of Secreted Aspartyl Proteinases Genes.","abs":"The rise in resistance and changes in the spectrum of Candida infections have generated enormous interest in developing new antifungal drugs using natural molecules such as plant essential oils (EOs).

We show that whole EO and its vapor attenuated the yeast's growth, compared to that in the control. The effect of the EO was comparable to that of amphotericin-B (AmB). The EO and its vapor significantly decreased the morphological changes of C. albicans, reduced biofilm formation, and disrupted mature C. albicans biofilms. The effect produced by whole EO on biofilm formation/disruption was notably comparable to that observed with AmB. Exposure of C. albicans to EO and its vapor downregulated the expression of various genes, such as secreted aspartyl proteinases (SAP 1, 2, 3, 9, 10) and hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1).

N-acyl homoserine lactone acylase PvdQ from human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a quorum-quenching enzyme that can hydrolyze the amide bond of the quorum signaling N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) thereby degrading the signaling molecules, turning off the biofilm phenotype and resulting in a reduction of bacterial virulence. Previous studies demonstrated that PvdQ has different preferences for N-acyl substrates with different acyl chain lengths and substituents. However, the substrate binding specificity determinants of the quorum-quenching enzyme PvdQ with the different bacterial ligands are unknown and unintuitive. Further, elucidation of these determinants can lead to mutants with efficiency and broader substrate promiscuity. To investigate this question, a computational study was carried out combining multiple molecular docking methods, molecular dynamics simulations, residue interaction network analysis, and binding free energy calculations. The main findings are: firstly, the results from pKa predictions support that the pKa of the N-terminus of Serβ1 was depressed due to the surrounding residues. Multiple molecular docking studies provide useful information about the detailed binding modes and binding affinities. Secondly, 300 ns molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to analyze the overall molecular motions of substrate-bound and substrate-free PvdQ. The specific interactions between the active site of PvdQ and different ligands revealed the determinants for the preference among the ligands. A systematic comparison and analysis of the protein dynamic fingerprint of each complex demonstrated that binding of the most favorable ligand, C12-homoserine lactone (C12-HSL), reduced the global motions of the complex and maintained the correct arrangement of the catalytic site. Further, the residue interaction network analysis of each system illustrated that there are more communication contacts and pathways between the residues in the C12-HSL complex as compared to complexes with the other ligands. The binding of the C12-HSL ligand facilitates structural communication between the two knobs and the active site. While the binding of the other ligands tend to impair specific communication pathways between the two knobs and the active site, and lead to a catalytically inefficient state. Finally, simulation results from free energy landscape and binding free energy analysis revealed that the C12-HSL ligand has the lowest binding free energy and greater stability than the less favored ligands. Each of the following residues: Serβ1, Hisβ23, Pheβ24, Metβ30, Pheβ32, Leuβ50, Asnβ57, Thrβ69, Valβ70, Trpβ162, Trpβ186, Asnβ269, Argβ297 and Leuα146, play different roles in substrate binding specificity.

The strict human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes expresses a surface-associated 5'-nucleotidase (S5nA) under infection conditions that has previously been discussed as a potential virulence factor.

Our study revealed that 25% of human and 15.69% of turkey strains were resistant to vancomycin. Multidrug resistance showed in 32.14% and 43.14% of human and turkey strains, respectively. The tetracycline resistance gene, tetM, was detected in 82.24% of all strains analyzed, whereas the tetO gene was found in 53.57% of human but only in 7.84% of turkey strains.

Those unexplored and complex communities compete for nutrients using antagonistic molecules as war weapons. Up to now, few of these molecules were characterized in regards of L. pneumophila sensitivity. In this context, we established, from five freshwater environments, a vast collection of culturable bacteria and investigated their ability to inhibit the growth of L. pneumophila.

Aeromonas, Bacillus, Flavobacterium, and Pseudomonas were the most abundant genera (154/273).

P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat due to a number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the organism's propensity to form multicellular biofilms. Epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa often dominate within the lungs of individual CF patients, but how they achieve this is poorly understood. One way that strains of P. aeruginosa can compete is by producing chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, called pyocins. Three major classes of pyocin have been identified in P. aeruginosa: soluble pyocins (S types) and tailocins (R and F types). In this study, we investigated the distribution of S- and R-type pyocins in 24 clinical strains isolated from individual CF patients and then focused on understanding their roles in interstrain competition. We found that (i) each strain produced only one R-pyocin type, but the number of S-pyocins varied between strains, (ii) R-pyocins were generally important for strain dominance during competition assays in planktonic cultures and biofilm communities in strains with both disparate R- and S-pyocin subtypes, and (iii) purified R-pyocins demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against established biofilms. Our work provides support for a role played by R-pyocins in the competition between P. aeruginosa strains and helps explain why certain strains and lineages of P. aeruginosa dominate and displace others during CF infection.

These properties allow biochar to retain soil nutrients, yet the effects of biochar on bacterial growth remain poorly understood. To examine how biochar influences microbial metabolism, Escherichia coli was grown in a complex, well-defined media and treated with either biochar or activated carbon. The concentration of metabolites in the media were then quantified at several time points using NMR spectroscopy. Several metabolites were immediately adsorbed by the char, including l-asparagine, l-glutamine, and l-arginine. However, we find that biochar quantitatively adsorbs less of these metabolic precursors when compared to activated carbon. Electron microscopy reveals differences in surface morphology after cell culture, suggesting that Escherichia coli can form biofilms on the surfaces of the biochar. An examination of significant compounds in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis reveals that treatment with biochar is less disruptive than activated carbon throughout metabolism. While both biochar and activated carbon slowed growth compared to untreated media, Escherichia coli in biochar-treated media grew more efficiently, as indicated by a longer logarithmic growth phase and a higher final cell density. This work suggests that biochar can serve as a beneficial soil amendment while minimizing the impact on bacterial viability. In addition, the experiments identify a mechanism for biochar's effectiveness in soil conditioning and reveal how biochar can alter specific bacterial metabolic pathways.","authors":[{"name":"Rebecca A Hill"},{"name":"John Hunt"},{"name":"Emily Sanders"},{"name":"Melanie Tran"},{"name":"Griffin A Burk"},{"name":"Todd E Mlsna"},{"name":"Nicholas C Fitzkee"}],"keywords":[]},"article195":{"pmid":"30695121","title":"Durability and performance of loofah sponge as carrier for wastewater treatment with high ammonium.","abs":"Loofah sponge (LS) was used as carrier for high ammonia wastewater treatment with a sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR), aimed at evaluating its nitrogen removal performance and durability to changeable pH and microbial corrosion.

In addition to identifying the weight control mechanism, we show that adding a feedback loop can lead to a bistable QS response in certain parameter regimes.

One critical mechanism of biofilm infection that leads to persistent infection lies in the capacity of biofilms to evade the macrophage-mediated innate immune response. It is now increasingly apparent that microorganisms exploit the negative regulatory mechanisms of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated inflammatory response to subvert host cell functions by using various virulence factors. However, the detailed molecular mechanism, along with the identity of a target molecule, underlying the evasion of the macrophage-mediated innate immune response against S. aureus infection associated with biofilm formation remains to be elucidated. Here, using an in vitro culture model of murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells, we demonstrate that S. aureus biofilm-conditioned medium significantly attenuated the capacity for macrophage bactericidal and proinflammatory responses. Importantly, the responses were associated with attenuated activation of NF-κB and increased expression of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in RAW 264.7 cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of KLF2 in RAW 264.7 cells could restore the activation of NF-κB toward the bactericidal activity and generation of proinflammatory cytokines in the presence of S. aureus biofilm-conditioned medium. Collectively, our results suggest that factors secreted from S. aureus biofilms might exploit the KLF2-dependent negative regulatory mechanism to subvert macrophage-mediated innate immune defense against S. aureus biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Talib Alboslemy"},{"name":"Bing Yu"},{"name":"Tara Rogers"},{"name":"Min-Ho Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"KLF2"},{"word":"S. aureus biofilm"},{"word":"macrophages"}]},"article209":{"pmid":"30692023","title":"Convenient framework of poly functionalized (E)-2-benzylideno-(Z)-carbazolylideno cyanoacetamides via rearrangements as an efficient antibiofilm inhibitors with SAR study.","abs":"A simple and one-pot approach for the synthesis of highly functionalized novel (E)-2-benzylideno-(Z)-carbazolylideno cyanoacetamide derivatives from different 2-(2',3',4',9'-tetrahydro-carbazol-1'-ylidene)-propanedinitriles and aryl/heteroaryl carbaldehydes via vinylogous aldol reaction.

The rise of antibiotic resistance among P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates makes treatment of this disease challenging, emphasizing the need for alternative therapeutic modalities. By comparing the responses to P. aeruginosa infection between an outbred mouse strain (Swiss Webster, SW) and a susceptible mouse strain (C57BL6/N), we found that the inherent neutrophil-killing abilities of these strains correlated with their susceptibility to infection. Namely, SW-derived neutrophils were significantly more efficient at killing P. aeruginosa in vitro than C57BL6/N-derived neutrophils. To interrogate whether the distinct neutrophil killing capacities were dependent on endogenous or exogenous factors, neutrophil progenitor cell lines were generated. The in vitro differentiated neutrophils from either SW or C57BL6/N progenitors retained the differential killing abilities, illustrating that endogenous factors conferred resistance. Consistently, quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis revealed strain-specific and infection-induced alterations of neutrophil proteomes. Among the distinctly elevated proteins in the SW-derived proteomes were α-mannosidases, potentially associated with protection. Inhibition of α-mannosidases reduced neutrophil bactericidal functions in vitro. Conversely, topical application of α-mannosidases reduced bacterial biofilms and burden of infected corneas.

Previously, we demonstrated that a peptide (BAR) derived from Streptococcus gordonii (Sg) potently inhibited adherence of Pg to streptococci and reduced Pg virulence in a mouse model of periodontitis. Thus, BAR may represent a novel therapeutic to control periodontitis by preventing Pg colonization of the oral cavity. However, while BAR inhibited the initial formation of Pg/Sg biofilms, much higher concentrations of peptide were required to disrupt an established Pg/Sg biofilm. To improve the activity of the peptide, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were surface-modified with BAR and shown to more potently disrupt Pg/Sg biofilms relative to an equimolar amount of free peptide. The goal of this work was to determine the in vivo efficacy of BAR-modified NPs (BNPs) and to assess the toxicity of BNPs against human gingival epithelial cells. In vivo efficacy of BNPs was assessed using a murine model of periodontitis by measuring alveolar bone resorption and gingival IL-17 expression as outcomes of Pg-induced inflammation. Infection of mice with Pg and Sg resulted in a significant increase in alveolar bone loss and gingival IL-17 expression over sham-infected animals. Treatment of Pg/Sg infected mice with BNPs reduced bone loss and IL-17 expression almost to the levels of sham-infected mice and to a greater extent than treatment with an equimolar amount of free BAR. The cytotoxicity of the maximum concentration of BNPs and free BAR used in in vitro and in vivo studies (1.3 and 3.4 μM), was evaluated in telomerase immortalized gingival keratinocytes (TIGKs) by measuring cell viability, cell lysis and apoptosis. BNPs were also tested for hemolytic activity against sheep erythrocytes. TIGKs treated with BNPs or free BAR demonstrated >90% viability and no significant lysis or apoptosis relative to untreated cells. In addition, neither BNPs nor free BAR exhibited hemolytic activity.

The NO-releasing PEGylated pDA film inhibited biofilm attachment by 96 and 70% after exposure to bacterial culture solution for 24 and 36 h, respectively. In contrast, films that do not contain NO failed to prevent biofilm formation on the surfaces at these time points. Furthermore, this coating also showed 99.9, 97, and 99% killing efficiencies against surface-attached PAO1, PA37, and S. aureus bacteria. Overall, the combination of low-fouling PEG and antibacterial activity of NO in pDA films makes this coating a potential therapeutic option to inhibit biofilm formation on medical devices.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Sadrearhami"},{"name":"Farah Nabilah Shafiee"},{"name":"Kitty K K Ho"},{"name":"Naresh Kumar"},{"name":"Marta Krasowska"},{"name":"Anton Blencowe"},{"name":"Edgar H H Wong"},{"name":"Cyrille Boyer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial coating"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"multidrug-resistant bacteria"},{"word":"nitric oxide"},{"word":"polydopamine"},{"word":"surface modification"}]},"article229":{"pmid":"30688370","title":"Topographic characterization of multispecies biofilms growing on dental implant surfaces: An in vitro model.","abs":"To describe the early biofilm formation over whole dental implants with its micro- and macrostructure, using an in vitro multispecies biofilm model.","authors":[{"name":"Patricia Bermejo"},{"name":"María Carmen Sánchez"},{"name":"Arancha Llama-Palacios"},{"name":"Elena Figuero"},{"name":"David Herrera"},{"name":"Mariano Sanz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CLSM"},{"word":"SEM"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dental implants"},{"word":"peri-implant diseases"},{"word":"qPCR"},{"word":"titanium"}]},"article230":{"pmid":"30688322","title":"Antimicrobial random peptide cocktails: a new approach to fight pathogenic bacteria.","abs":"Antibiotic resistance in bacteria has become a serious threat to public health, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop new classes of antimicrobial agents. Nowadays, natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their synthetic derivatives are considered as promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics. The broad molecular diversity of AMPs, in terms of sequences and structures, suggests that their activity does not depend on specific features of amino acid sequence or peptide conformation. We therefore selected two common properties of AMPs, (high percentage of hydrophobic and cationic amino acids), to develop a novel approach to synthesize random antimicrobial peptide mixtures (RPMs). Instead of incorporating a single amino acid at each coupling step, a mixture of hydrophobic and cationic amino acids in a defined proportion is coupled. This results in a mixture that contains up to 2n sequences, where n is the number of the coupling step, of random peptides with a defined composition, stereochemistry, and controlled chain length. We have discovered that RPMs of hydrophobic and cationic α-amino acids, such as phenylalanine and lysine, display strong and broad antimicrobial activity towards Gram-negative, Gram-positive, clinically isolated antibiotic resistant superbugs, and several plant pathogenic bacteria. This review summarizes our efforts to explore the mode of action of RPMs and their potential as bioactive agents for multiple applications, including the prevention of biofilm formation and degradation of mature biofilm (related to human health), reduction of disease severity in plant bacterial disease models (related to crop protection), and inhibition of bacterial growth in milk (related to food preservation).

Oral biofilm presents increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and elevated virulence compared with planktonic bacteria. Antimicrobial agents, such as chlorhexidine, have proven effective in the disruption/inhibition of oral biofilm. However, the challenge of precisely and continuously eliminating the specific pathogens without disturbing the microbial ecology still exists, which is a major factor in determining the virulence of a multispecies microbial consortium and the consequent development of oral infectious diseases. Therefore, several novel approaches are being developed to inhibit biofilm virulence without necessarily inducing microbial dysbiosis of the oral cavity. Nanoparticles, such as pH-responsive enzyme-mimic nanoparticles, have been developed to specifically target the acidic niches within the oral biofilm where tooth demineralization readily occurs, in effect controlling dental caries. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) such as dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM), when incorporated into dental adhesives or resin composite, have also shown excellent and durable antimicrobial activity and thus could effectively inhibit the occurrence of secondary caries. In addition, custom-designed small molecules, natural products and their derivatives, as well as basic amino acids such as arginine, have demonstrated ecological effects by modulating the virulence of the oral biofilm without universally killing the commensal bacteria, indicating a promising approach to the management of oral infectious diseases such as dental caries and periodontal diseases. This article aims to introduce these novel approaches that have shown potential in the control of oral biofilm.

Out of 130 strains, 99.2% were biofilm producers. Strong biofilms were formed by 39.7% of MRSA and 36.8% of MSSA strains. The highest percentage of strong biofilm producers was found among the strains isolated from sputum and tracheostomy tube (66.7%), nose and catheter (50%), throat (44.4%), and bronchoalveolar washings (43.8%). The strains isolated from bronchoalveolar washings produced significantly more biofilm than strains isolated from wound and anus. The ability of biofilm forming by fecal strains was significantly lower compared to strains from other materials. MRSA strains had significantly higher ability of biofilm formation than MSSA strains (P = 0.000247). The presence of ica operon in MRSA was detected in all strains. Comparison of strong biofilm biomass of the strains with icaABCD, icaABD, and icaAD revealed that strains with icaABCD and icaABD produced highly significantly more biofilm than strains with icaAD.

This present study therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different infused oils obtained from either fresh or oven-dried herbal parts of YaSP (F-YaSP and D-YaSP) against biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which reside in chronic wounds. Its main active herbal component, Garcinia mangostana (F-GM and D-GM), as well as α-mangostin were also tested in this study. All infused oils significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa with a percentage of reduction ranging from 50 to 90%. Visualization of the inhibition of biofilm development was confirmed using scanning electron and atomic force microscopes. All tested agents resulted in a reduction in the mean average roughness of the biofilm, whereas only treating with D-YaSP, D-GM, and α-mangostin led to a decrease in both peak height and peak-valley height. MTT reduction assays revealed that the metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa mature biofilms decreased considerably up to 50% after only 3 h of incubation and after only 9 h of exposure to D-YaSP. Confocal laser scanning micrographs illustrated that a maximum biofilm eradication was found when treated with the extracts for 3 h, whereas the biomass, the average thickness, maximum thickness, and the surface to volume ratio of the treated biofilm was reduced after up to 18 h of contact time. It can be concluded that D-YaSP can effectively inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa.

Two clinical strains of K.pneumoniae were included in the study. One strain was completely susceptible and the other was resistant to certain antibiotics. Susceptible strain was subjected in the exposure assay as parent/wild strain. Exposure was performed by increasing chlorhexidine concentrations in agar plates. Chlorhexidine concentrations were gradually decreased reaching a final concentration of 0.12 mg/L after five weeks. Chlorhexidine-adapted viable colonies were selected and isolated. Minimal inhibitor concentrations of chlorhexidine, sodium hypochloride, benzalkonium chloride and triclosan for K.pneumoniae strains were determined using broth microdilution method.

Sequence types of isolates were identified using the PubMLST database. Characteristics of biofilm formation of clinical isolates were evaluated by microplate method. Antibiotic susceptibilities of ceftazidime, meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SXT) and levofloxacin were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI (2017) guidelines.

This requires a flexible metabolism and physiology, responsive to conditions of the local milieu. The sequence specific RNA binding protein CsrA serves as a global regulator that governs gene expression required for pathogenicity, metabolism, biofilm formation, and motility in response to nutritional conditions. Its activity is determined by two noncoding small RNAs (sRNA), CsrB and CsrC, which sequester and antagonize this protein. Here, we used ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis to comprehensively examine the effects of CsrA on mRNA occupancy with ribosomes, a measure of translation, transcript stability, and the steady state levels of transcripts under in vitro SPI-1 inducing conditions, to simulate growth in the intestinal lumen, and under in vitro SPI-2-inducing conditions, to simulate growth in the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV) of the macrophage. Our findings uncovered new roles for CsrA in controlling the expression of structural and regulatory genes involved in stress responses, metabolism, and virulence systems required for infection. We observed substantial variation in the CsrA regulon under the two growth conditions. In addition, CsrB/C sRNA levels were greatly reduced under the simulated intracellular conditions and were responsive to nutritional factors that distinguish the intracellular and luminal environments. Altogether, our results reveal CsrA to be a flexible regulator, which is inferred to be intimately involved in maintaining the distinct gene expression patterns associated with growth in the intestine and the macrophage.","authors":[{"name":"Anastasia H Potts"},{"name":"Yinping Guo"},{"name":"Brian M M Ahmer"},{"name":"Tony Romeo"}],"keywords":[]},"article278":{"pmid":"30682094","title":"The peptidoglycan and biofilm matrix of Staphylococcus epidermidis undergo structural changes when exposed to human platelets.","abs":"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a bacterium frequently isolated from contaminated platelet concentrates (PCs), a blood product used to treat bleeding disorders in transfusion patients. PCs offer an accidental niche for colonization of S. epidermidis by forming biofilms and thus avoiding clearance by immune factors present in this milieu. Using biochemical and microscopy techniques, we investigated the structural changes of the peptidoglycan (PG) and the biofilm matrix of S. epidermidis biofilms formed in whole-blood derived PCs compared to biofilms grown in glucose-supplemented trypticase soy broth (TSBg). Both, the PG and the biofilm matrix are primary mechanisms of defense against environmental stress. Here we show that in PCs, the S. epidermidis biofilm matrix is mainly of a proteinaceous nature with extracellular DNA, in contrast to the predominant polysaccharide nature of the biofilm matrix formed in TSBg cultures. PG profile studies demonstrated that the PG of biofilm cells remodels during PC storage displaying fewer muropeptides variants than those observed in TSBg. The PG muropeptides contain two chemical modifications (amidation and O-acetylation) previously associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents by other staphylococci.

The hypothetical protein encoded by the mgl2 gene was found to be similar to methyltransferases (MTases). Protein homology and template-based modeling facilitated prediction of the Mgl2 structure, which greatly resembled class I MTases with a S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding cleft. The Mgl2 protein was engaged in exopolysaccharide, but not lipopolysaccharide, synthesis. The mgl2 deletion mutant produced exopolysaccharide comprised of only low molecular weight fractions, while overexpression of mgl2 caused overproduction of exopolysaccharide with a normal low to high molecular weight ratio. The deletion of the mgl2 gene resulted in disturbances in biofilm formation and a slight increase in motility in minimal medium. Red clover (Trifolium pratense) inoculated with the mgl2 mutant formed effective nodules, and the appearance of the plants indicated active nitrogen fixation. The mgl2 gene was preceded by an active and strong promoter. Mgl2 was defined as an integral membrane protein and formed homodimers in vivo; however, it did not interact with Pss proteins encoded within the Pss-I region.

Within this community, sanguinis-group streptococci, comprising the closely related Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii, together with Streptococcus parasanguinis, often predominate. Their ubiquitous and abundant nature reflects the evolution of these bacteria as highly effective colonizers of the oral cavity. Through interactions with host tissues and other microbes, and the capacity to readily adapt to prevailing environmental conditions, sanguinis-group streptococci are able to shape accretion of the oral plaque biofilm and promote development of a microbial community that exists in harmony with its host. Nonetheless, upon gaining access to the blood stream, those very same colonization capabilities can confer upon sanguinis-group streptococci the ability to promote systemic disease. This article focuses on the role of sanguinis-group streptococci as the commensurate commensals, highlighting those aspects of their biology that enable the coordination of health-associated biofilm development. This includes the molecular mechanisms, both synergistic and antagonistic, that underpin adhesion to substrata, intercellular communication, and polymicrobial community formation.

These virulence factors function primarily in bacterial adhesion to host tissues, but they also mediate biofilm formation. Type 1 and P pili of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are the two best-studied CU pilus examples, and here we primarily focus on the former. UPEC can be transmitted to the urinary tract by fecal shedding. It can then ascend up the urinary tract and cause disease by invading and colonizing host tissues of the bladder, causing cystitis, and the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis. FimH is the subunit displayed at the tip of type 1 pili and mediates adhesion to mannosylated host cells via a unique catch-bond mechanism. In response to shear forces caused by urine flow, FimH can transition from a low-affinity to high-affinity binding mode. This clever allosteric mechanism allows UPEC cells to remain tightly attached during periods of urine flow, while loosening their grip to allow dissemination through the urinary tract during urine stasis. Moreover, the bulk of a CU pilus is made up of the rod, which can reversibly uncoil in response to urine flow to evenly spread the tensile forces over the entire pilus length. We here explore the novel structural and mechanistic findings relating to the type 1 pilus FimH catch-bond and rod uncoiling and explain how they function together to enable successful attachment, spread, and persistence in the hostile urinary tract.","authors":[{"name":"Manuela K Hospenthal"},{"name":"Gabriel Waksman"}],"keywords":[]},"article282":{"pmid":"30681067","title":"Outer Membrane Vesicle-Host Cell Interactions.","abs":"Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are nanosized proteoliposomes derived from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

Our data showed that dextranase and mutanase can synergistically break down the EPS glucan matrix in preformed cariogenic biofilms, markedly enhancing bacterial killing by the antimicrobial agent (3-log increase versus antimicrobial alone). Further analyses revealed that an EPS-degrading/antimicrobial (EDA) approach disassembles the matrix scaffold, exposing the bacterial cells for efficient killing while concurrently causing cellular dispersion and physical collapse of the bacterial clusters. Unexpectedly, we found that the EDA approach can also selectively target the EPS-producing cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans with higher killing specificity (versus other species) within mixed biofilms, disrupting their accumulation and promoting dominance of commensal bacteria. Together, these results demonstrate a dual-targeting approach that can enhance antibiofilm efficacy and precision by dismantling the EPS matrix and its protective microenvironment, amplifying the killing of pathogenic bacteria within.","authors":[{"name":"Z Ren"},{"name":"D Kim"},{"name":"A J Paula"},{"name":"G Hwang"},{"name":"Y Liu"},{"name":"J Li"},{"name":"H Daniell"},{"name":"H Koo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-infective agents"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"drug resistance"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substance matrix"},{"word":"streptococcus"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"30678308","title":"Metabolic Profiling of Candida auris, a Newly-Emerging Multi-Drug Resistant Candida Species, by GC-MS.","abs":"Candidaauris, a newly-emerging Candida species, is a serious global health threat due to its multi-drug resistant pattern, difficulty to diagnose, and the high mortality associated with its invasive and bloodstream infections.

In the absence of oxygen, the feedstock can be converted into biogas through the established anaerobic digestion (AD) approach. The potential of MMC has shifted to production of intermediate AD compounds as precursors for renewable chemicals. A particular set of anaerobic pathways in MMC fermentation, known as chain elongation, can occur under specific conditions producing medium chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs) with higher value than biogas and broader applicability. This review introduces the chain elongation pathway and other bio-reactions occurring during MMC fermentation. We present an overview of the complex feedstocks used, and pinpoint the main operational parameters for MCCAs production such as temperature, pH, loading rates, inoculum, head space composition, and reactor design.

EPS initial aggregation plays key roles in the oil degrading process and various biogeochemical reactions. Here we used four types of EPS with water accommodated fraction (WAF), chemically-enhanced WAF (CEWAF) and Corexit, to represent potential situations during oil spills and post-application of Corexit. We found that Corexit alone can inhibit EPS aggregation and disperse pre-existing microgels. CEWAF can enhance EPS aggregation with efficiency by up to 80%-100% and more aggregates accumulated within the air-water interface. Additionally, more hydrophobic EPS aggregates showed high resistance to Corexit dispersion while hydrophilic EPS were more sensitive.

Here we introduce an unsupervised, systems-oriented approach to identify key members of the microbiota. We used two CF sputum microbiome data sets that were longitudinally collected through periods spanning baseline health and PEs. Key taxa were defined based on three strategies: overall relative abundance, prevalence, and co-occurrence network interconnectedness. We measured the association between changes in the abundance of the key taxa and changes in patient clinical status over time via change-point detection, and found that taxa with the highest level of network interconnectedness tracked changes in patient health significantly better than taxa with the highest abundance or prevalence. We also cross-sectionally stratified all samples into the clinical states and identified key taxa associated with each state. We found that network interconnectedness most strongly delineated the taxa among clinical states, and that anaerobic bacteria were over-represented during PEs. Many of these anaerobes are oropharyngeal bacteria that have been previously isolated from the respiratory tract, and/or have been studied for their role in CF.

Pilocarpine hydrochloride protected G. mellonella larvae from C. albicans infection via inhibition of C. albicans filamentation and appropriate regulation of cellular immunity. However, scopolamine abrogated the capacity of pilocarpine hydrochloride to protect G. mellonella larvae from C. albicans infection. Furthermore, acetylcholine and pilocarpine hydrochloride exhibited differential modulatory capabilities on Galleria mellonella hemocyte responses to C. albicans The data in this article demonstrate that a muscarinic receptor modulates C. albicans filamentation and biofilm formation. Furthermore, the results suggest that G. mellonella hemocyte subsets possess unique repertoires of cholinergic receptors that regulate their differentiation, activation, and function in contrasting manners. Therefore, targeting cholinergic receptors by repurposing currently licensed cholinergic drugs may offer novel therapeutic solutions for the prevention or treatment of fungal infections.","authors":[{"name":"Christopher Nile"},{"name":"Monica Falleni"},{"name":"Daniela Cirasola"},{"name":"Abeer Alghamdi"},{"name":"Oliver F Anderson"},{"name":"Christopher Delaney"},{"name":"Gordon Ramage"},{"name":"Emerenziana Ottaviano"},{"name":"Delfina Tosi"},{"name":"Gaetano Bulfamante"},{"name":"Giulia Morace"},{"name":"Elisa Borghi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Galleria mellonella"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"muscarinic"},{"word":"pilocarpine hydrochloride"},{"word":"repurposing"}]},"article318":{"pmid":"30674577","title":"Fluorescent Capillary Electrophoresis Is Superior to Culture in Detecting Candida Species from Samples of Urinary Catheters and Ureteral Stents with Mono- or Polyfungal Biofilm Growth.","abs":"Molecular techniques in fungal detection and identification represent an efficient complementary diagnostic tool which is increasingly used to overcome limitations of routinely used culture techniques. The aim of this study was to characterize Candida sp. representation in samples from urine, urinary catheter, and ureteral stent biofilm using ITS2 ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplification followed by fluorescent capillary electrophoresis (f-ITS2-PCR-CE) and to compare the results with those obtained by culture. A total of 419 samples were analyzed, and 106 (25.2%) were found positive, out of which 17 (16%) were polyfungal. The positivity rate did not differ between samples from catheters and stents (23.6% versus 20.9%) or between catheter and stent corresponding urine samples (40.2% versus 30.2%). Ten different Candida species were detected, with Candida parapsilosis (31.4%), Candida albicans (26.5%), and Candida tropicalis (12.4%) predominating. f-ITS2-PCR-CE was evaluated as substantially less time-consuming and 8.3 times more sensitive than the routinely applied culture technique with 1 µl of urine/sonicated fluid inoculated, detecting 67 (19.9%) versus 8 (2.4%) positive samples out of 337 initially analyzed samples. The culture sensitivity considerably improved to 1.7 times lower than that of f-ITS2-PCR-CE after the inoculation volume was increased to 100 µl in the additional 82 samples. Moreover, the molecular technique, unlike routine cultivation, enabled precise pathogen composition determination in polymicrobial samples. In conclusion, the f-ITS2-PCR-CE method was shown to be a quick and efficient tool for culture-independent detection and identification of fungi in urinary tract-related samples, demonstrating a higher sensitivity than culture.","authors":[{"name":"Hana Obručová"},{"name":"Iva Kotásková"},{"name":"Radka Tihelková"},{"name":"Veronika Holá"},{"name":"Filip Růžička"},{"name":"Tomáš Freiberger"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"capillary electrophoresis"},{"word":"fungi"},{"word":"panfungal PCR"},{"word":"polyfungal sample"},{"word":"ureteral stents"},{"word":"urinary catheters"}]},"article319":{"pmid":"30674079","title":"Ameliorating the antimicrobial resistance crisis: phage therapy.","abs":"Propelled by the overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance is now widespread in the environment, leaving us with limited drugs for treating a large number of resistant pathogens.

In the static TKS (sTKS), performed by exposing both strains over 24h to constant antibiotic concentrations, the activity of the two drugs combined was not significantly different the better drug used alone.

Vancomycin did not kill bacteria, amikacin led to bacterial regrowth whereas the combination progressively decreased the bacterial load. Thus, dTKS revealed an enhanced effect of the combination on a large inoculum not observed in sTKS. The discrepancy between the sTKS and dTKS results highlights that the assessment of the efficacy of a combination for severe infections associated with a high bacterial load could be demanding.

Lp.LTA inhibited biofilm development of E. faecalis at the early stage without affecting bacterial growth. LTA from other Lactobacillus species such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG also inhibited E. faecalis biofilm formation. In particular, among LTAs from various lactobacilli, Lp.LTA showed the highest inhibitory effect on biofilms formed by E. faecalis.

Since the efficacy of photodynamic therapy largely depends on the selection and administration of an appropriate photosensitizer, therefore, the realization of clinically active photosensitizers is an immediate need. Here, by using E. coli as a study model we have demonstrated the antimicrobial photodynamic potential of riboflavin. Intracellular ROS formation by DCFH-DA assay, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, LDH activity was measured in treated bacterial samples. Enzymatic (SOD, CAT, GSH) antioxidants and non-enzymatic (GSH) was further evaluated. Bacterial death was confirmed by colony forming assay, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The treated bacterial cells exhibited abundant ROS generation and marked increment in the level of oxidative stress markers as well as significant reduction in LDH activity. Marked reduction in colony forming units was also observed. Optical microscopic and SEM images further confirmed the bacterial death. Thus, we can say that photoilluminated riboflavin renders the redox status of bacterial cells into a compromised state leading to significant membrane damage ultimately causing bacterial death.

Periphyton was exposed for 18 days to five Cu concentrations, between 0.01 and 10 μM, in a semi-static test. Diversity and community structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms were assessed by 16S and 18S amplicon sequencing, respectively. Community function was studied as impacts on algal biomass and photosynthetic activity. Additionally, we studied Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) using photosynthesis as the endpoint. Sequencing results detected an average of 9,504 and 1,242 OTUs for 16S and 18S, respectively, reflecting the high biodiversity of marine periphytic biofilms. Eukaryotes represent the most Cu-sensitive kingdom, where effects were seen already at concentrations as low as 0.01 μM. The structure of the prokaryotic part of the community was impacted at slightly higher concentrations (0.06 μM), which is still in the range of the Cu concentrations observed in the area (0.08 μM). The current environmental quality standard for Cu of 0.07 μM therefore does not seem to be sufficiently protective for periphyton. Cu exposure resulted in a more Cu-tolerant community, which was accompanied by a reduced total algal biomass, increased relative abundance of diatoms and a reduction of photosynthetic activity. Cu exposure changed the network of associations between taxa in the communities. A total of 23 taxa, including taxa within Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Stramenopiles, and Hacrobia, were identified as being particularly sensitive to Cu.

Among cefotaxime resistant E. coli (ctxR Ec) isolates, we detected and characterized 36 ESBL-Ec from water, biofilm and fish guts. ctxR Ec and ESBL-Ec were found in samples from sites near the first small town, located downstream from the watershed which was studied. Treatment of urban wastewater by waste water treatment plants (WWTP), might therefore be a major potential source of ctxR Ec and thus of ESBL-Ec. Prevalence of total E. coli and ctxR Ec in fish guts ranged between 0 to 92% and 0 to 85%; respectively, depending on the sampling site and the fish species. The diet of fish (predator or omnivore) seems to strongly influence the prevalence of total E. coli and ESBL-Ec.

We show that A. baumannii IC II strains are non-motile, do not form pellicle and display distinct capsular polysaccharide profile compared with the IC I strains. Moreover, in contrast to the overall highly hydrophobic IC I strains, IC II strains showed a greater variation in cell surface hydrophobicity. Within the IC II lineage, hydrophilic strains demonstrated reduced ability to form biofilm and adhere to the abiotic surfaces, also possessed twofold thicker cell wall and exhibited higher resistance to desiccation. Furthermore, these strains showed increased adherence to the lung epithelial cells and were more virulent in nematode and mouse infection model compared with the hydrophobic IC II strains.

This study used a rabbit model of infection, following femoral fracture with internal fixation, to evaluate the efficacy of the combined use of tea polyphenols and <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> ST8SH bacteriocin. <strong>MATERIAL AND METHODS</strong> Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits underwent femoral fracture, internal fixation, and insertion of a mini-titanium implant, and were inoculated intravenously with suspensions of Staphylococcal bacteria. Four treatment groups included group A, injected with tea polyphenols and bacteriocins (N=6); group B, injected with cefradine and bacteriocins (N=6); group C, injected with tea polyphenols and cefradine (N=6); and group D (controls), injected with saline (N=6). Blood samples were collected at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after the injection of bacteriocins. Biofilms that formed on the mini-titanium implant were studied by fluorescence microscopy. Serum levels of level of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). <strong>RESULTS</strong> The combination of tea polyphenols and bacteriocins (group A) had a significant inhibitory effect on <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (P<0.05) and significant differences in serum levels of IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels in serum (P<0.05) when compared with groups, B, C, and D. <strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong> In a rabbit model of femoral fracture with internal fixation, the combined use of tea polyphenols and <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> ST8SH bacteriocin effectively controlled <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection.","authors":[{"name":"Zhonghua Xu"},{"name":"Jin Li"},{"name":"Xindie Zhou"},{"name":"Jianbo Dai"},{"name":"Junjie Zhang"},{"name":"Yong Huang"},{"name":"Nanwei Xu"}],"keywords":[]},"article336":{"pmid":"30670553","title":"Redundant and Distinct Roles of Secreted Protein Eap and Cell Wall-Anchored Protein SasG in Biofilm Formation and Pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"Chronic and fatal infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus are sometimes associated with biofilm formation. Secreted proteins and cell wall-anchored proteins (CWAPs) are important for the development of polysaccharide-independent biofilms, but functional relationships between these proteins are unclear. In the present study, we report the roles of the extracellular adherence protein Eap and the surface CWAP SasG in S. aureus MR23, a clinical methicillin-resistant isolate that forms a robust protein-dependent biofilm and accumulates a large amount of Eap in the extracellular matrix. Double deletion of eap and sasG, but not single eap or sasG deletion, reduced the biomass of the formed biofilm. Mutational analysis demonstrated that cell wall anchorage is essential for the role of SasG in biofilm formation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that MR23 formed a rugged and thick biofilm; deletion of both eap and sasG reduced biofilm ruggedness and thickness. Although sasG deletion did not affect either of these features, eap deletion reduced the ruggedness but not the thickness of the biofilm. This indicated that Eap contributes to the rough irregular surface structure of the MR23 biofilm and that both Eap and SasG play roles in biofilm thickness. The level of pathogenicity of the Δeap ΔsasG strain in a silkworm larval infection model was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those of the wild type and single-deletion mutants. Collectively, these findings highlight the redundant and distinct roles of a secreted protein and a CWAP in biofilm formation and pathogenicity of S. aureus and may inform new strategies to control staphylococcal biofilm infections.","authors":[{"name":"Keigo Yonemoto"},{"name":"Akio Chiba"},{"name":"Shinya Sugimoto"},{"name":"Chikara Sato"},{"name":"Mitsuru Saito"},{"name":"Yuki Kinjo"},{"name":"Keishi Marumo"},{"name":"Yoshimitsu Mizunoe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CWAP"},{"word":"Eap"},{"word":"SasG"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"infection model"},{"word":"secreted protein"},{"word":"silkworm"}]},"article337":{"pmid":"30670430","title":"DS86760016, a Leucyl-tRNA Synthetase Inhibitor with Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"DS86760016 is a new leucyl-tRNA-synthetase inhibitor at the preclinical development stage.

As potentiators do not interfere with essential processes, it has been hypothesized that they are less likely to induce resistance. However, evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking.

Biofilms were repeatedly and intermittently treated with tobramycin (TOB) alone or in combination with BH for 24 h. After treatment, the remaining cells were quantified using plate counting. After 15 cycles, biofilm cells were less susceptible to TOB and TOB+BH compared to the start population, and the potentiating effect of BH toward TOB was lost. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to probe which changes were involved in the reduced effect of BH, and mutations in 14 protein-coding genes were identified (including mutations in genes involved in central metabolism and in BCAL0296, encoding an ABC transporter). No changes in the MIC or MBC of TOB or changes in the number of persister cells were observed. However, basal intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS levels found after treatment with TOB were markedly decreased in the evolved populations. In addition, in evolved cultures with mutations in BCAL0296, a significantly reduced uptake of TOB was observed.

In this study, we report the identification of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa strain PA154197 isolated from a blood stream infection in Hong Kong. PA154197 belongs to a distinctive MLST550 clonal complex shared by two other international P. aeruginosa isolates VW0289 and AUS544. Comparative genome and transcriptome analysis of PA154197 with the reference strain PAO1 led to the identification of a variety of genetic variations in antibiotic resistance genes and the hyperexpression of three multidrug efflux pumps MexAB-OprM, MexEF-OprN, and MexGHI-OpmD in PA154197. Unexpectedly, the strain does not display a metabolic cost and a compromised virulence compared to PAO1. Characterizing its various physiological and virulence traits demonstrated that PA154197 produces a substantially higher level of the P. aeruginosa major virulence factor pyocyanin (PYO) than PAO1, but it produces a decreased level of pyoverdine and displays decreased biofilm formation compared with PAO1. Further analysis revealed that the secondary quorum-sensing (QS) system Pqs that primarily controls the PYO production is hyperactive in PA154197 independent of the master QS systems Las and Rhl.

However, this non-specific cytotoxic potential is a powerful weapon effective against almost all microorganisms, but also against eukaryotic cells, raising concerns related to their safe use. Among the analyzed transition metals, silver is the most investigated element due to its antimicrobial properties per se or as NPs; however, its toxicity raises questions about its biosafety. Even though it has milder antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity, TiO₂ needs to be exposed to UV light to be activated, thus limiting its use conjugated to orthopedic devices. By contrast, gold has a good balance between antimicrobial activity as an NP and cytocompatibility because of its inability to generate ROS. Nevertheless, although the toxicity and persistence of NPs within filter organs are not well verified, nowadays, several basic research on NP development and potential uses as antimicrobial weapons is reported, overemphasizing NPs potentialities, but without any existing potential of translation in clinics.

Even 50 years after its discovery, (p)ppGpp is venturing into exciting new fields, especially in gram-positive bacteria. After triggering the current renaissance in bacterial second messenger research, c-di-GMP is becoming ever more global with abounding new molecular mechanisms of action and physiological functions. The more recently discovered c-di-AMP is rapidly catching up and has now been found even in archaea, with its function in osmotic homeostasis being conserved across kingdom boundaries. Small modules associated with mobile genetic elements, which make and react to numerous novel mixed cyclic dinucleotides, seem to roam around rather freely in the bacterial world. Finally, many novel and old nucleotide molecules are still lurking around in search of a function. Across many talks it became apparent that (p)ppGpp, c-di-GMP and GTP/ATP can share and compete for binding sites (e.g., the Walker A motif in GTP/ATPases) with intriguing regulatory consequences, thus contributing to the emergent trend of systemwide networks that interconnect diverse signaling nucleotides. Overall, this inspiring conference made it clear that second messenger signaling is currently one of the most dynamic and exciting areas in microbial molecular biology and physiology, with major impacts ranging from microbial systems biology and ecology to infection biology.","authors":[{"name":"Regine Hengge"},{"name":"Susanne Häussler"},{"name":"Mihaela Pruteanu"},{"name":"Jörg Stülke"},{"name":"Natalia Tschowri"},{"name":"Kürşad Turgay"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"c-di-AMP"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"cGAMP"},{"word":"ppGpp"}]},"article355":{"pmid":"30668754","title":"Neutrophil-mediated antifungal activity against highly virulent Cryptococcus gattii strain R265.","abs":"Vaccine-induced immune responses, including neutrophil, macrophage, and T-cell responses, ameliorate cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus gattii.

Deepening our studies about xanthan properties and structure, the aim of this work was to analyze the characteristics of xanthan produced by Xanthomonas in different culture media. We analyzed the xanthan produced by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) in leaf extracts from grapefruit (a susceptible host of this bacterium) and compared it with the xanthan produced in a synthetic culture medium. We found that the xanthan produced in the grapefruit extract (Xan-GLE) presented shorter and more disordered molecules than xanthan produced in the synthetic medium (Xan-PYM). Besides, Xan-GLE resulted less viscous than Xan-PYM. The disordered molecular conformation of Xan-GLE could be attributed to its higher pyruvilation degree and lower acetylation degree compared with those detected in Xan-PYM. Meanwhile, the difference in the viscosity of both xanthans could be due to their molecules length. Finally, we cultured Xcc in the presence of the Xan-GLE or Xan-PYM and observed the formation of biofilm-like structures in both cases. We found significant differences in biofilm architecture between the two conditions, being the biofilm produced in presence of Xan-GLE similar to that formed in canker lesions developed in lemon plant leaves. Together, these results show how xanthan structure and properties changed when Xcc grew in a natural substrate and can contribute to better understand the biological role of xanthan.","authors":[{"name":"Valeria P Conforte"},{"name":"Pablo M Yaryura"},{"name":"María I Bianco"},{"name":"María C Rodríguez"},{"name":"Yasmin Daglio"},{"name":"Eduardo Prieto"},{"name":"Patricia Schilardi"},{"name":"Adrián A Vojnov"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri"},{"word":"grapefruit leaf extract"},{"word":"xanthan"}]},"article358":{"pmid":"30668370","title":"In vitro efficacy of eugenol in inhibiting single and mixed-biofilms of drug-resistant strains of Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans.","abs":"Candida albicans is frequently associated with mixed infections of Streptococcus mutans in plaque biofilms.

A number of substances have been identified as quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs); they can interfere with the QS system and control bacterial spoilage characteristics and production of virulence factors. In our previous study, propyl gallate at sub-minimum inhibitory concentration levels showed a potent anti-QS activity. Thus, in this study, coaxial polylactic acid-propyl gallate electrospun fibers were fabricated and their physicochemical properties were characterized. Salmon slices were coated with these electrospun fibers and the effect of this coating on the salmon slices during chilled storage was evaluated. The results showed that the electrospun fibers had a small diameter and smooth surface with no beads or other defects. The thermal stability, tensile strength, and other properties of the fibers were suitable for refrigerated storage conditions. Without inhibiting the bacterial growth in the salmon slices, the QSI-containing electrospun fibers exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the production of total volatile base nitrogen and trimethylamine. Furthermore, the deterioration of muscle tissue in the salmon slices was significantly delayed during cold storage. Quantitative analysis indicated that the electrospun fibers had a significant inhibitory effect on the bacterial spoilage ability. The results suggested that the electrospun fibers loaded with QSIs might be an effective strategy to control food spoilage and enhance the quality of aquatic food products.","authors":[{"name":"Ting Ding"},{"name":"Tingting Li"},{"name":"Jianrong Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. fluorescens"},{"word":"electrospinning"},{"word":"propyl gallate"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"yield factor"}]},"article361":{"pmid":"30667567","title":"2018 international consensus meeting on musculoskeletal infection: Summary from the biofilm workgroup and consensus on biofilm related musculoskeletal infections.","abs":"Biofilm-associated implant-related bone and joint infections are clinically important due to the extensive morbidity, cost of care and socioeconomic burden that they cause.

ODRI has been convincingly shown to delay healing, worsen functional outcome and incur significant socio-economic costs. To address this clinical problem, ever more sophisticated technologies targeting the prevention and/or treatment of ODRI are being developed and tested in vitro and in vivo. Among the most commonly described innovations are antimicrobial-coated orthopedic devices, antimicrobial-loaded bone cements and void fillers, and dual osteo-inductive/antimicrobial biomaterials. Unfortunately, translation of these technologies to the clinic has been limited, at least partially due to the challenging and still evolving regulatory environment for antimicrobial drug-device combination products, and a lack of clarity in the burden of proof required in preclinical studies. Preclinical in vivo testing (i.e. animal studies) represents a critical phase of the multidisciplinary effort to design, produce and reliably test both safety and efficacy of any new antimicrobial device. Nonetheless, current in vivo testing protocols, procedures, models, and assessments are highly disparate, irregularly conducted and reported, and without standardization and validation. The purpose of the present opinion piece is to discuss best practices in preclinical in vivo testing of antimicrobial interventions targeting ODRI.

The use of gas-discharge plasmas may offer a feasible alternative to conventional sanitization methods. Plasmas are a mixture of charged particles, chemically reactive species, and UV radiation and can be used to destroy microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to measure the effectiveness of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) treatments against bacteria attached to a solid surface and to evaluate the individual susceptibility of various L. monocytogenes strains. Attention was focused on the state of the cells after treatment, combining detection by viable counts and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Most of the culturable cells were inactivated after APP treatment, but the qPCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA revealed the presence of injured cells or their entrance into the viable but nonculturable state. These results were at least partly confirmed by a resuscitation experiment. After APP treatment, L. monocytogenes cell suspensions were incubated in brain heart infusion broth; some cells grew in the medium and therefore had survived the treatment. An understanding of the effects of APP on L. monocytogenes can inform the development of sanitation programs incorporating APP for pathogen removal.

Chemical interference with bacterial cell-to-cell communication, termed quorum sensing (QS), has been recognized as an attractive approach to control infections and address the drug resistance problems currently observed worldwide. Instead of imposing direct selective pressure on bacterial growth, the right bioactive compounds can preferentially block QS-based communication and attenuate cascades of bacterial gene expression and production of virulence factors, thus leading to reduced pathogenicity. Herein, we report on the potential of itaconimides as quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) of P. aeruginosa. An initial hit was discovered in a screening program of an in-house compound collection, and subsequent structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies provided analogs that could reduce expression of central QS-regulated virulence factors (elastase, rhamnolipid, and pyocyanin), and also successfully lead to the eradication of P. aeruginosa biofilms in combination with tobramycin.

To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of the three P. aeruginosa QS systems by DADS, high-throughput RNA and proteome sequencing techniques were used to study differences in the transcriptional and proteome expression of P. aeruginosa PAO1 following treatment with DADS. The RNA-seq and proteomic data are available via NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database with accession number GSE118801 and ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD011144, respectively. The experimental results indicated that all key genes of the three QS systems (las, rhl, and pqs) of P. aeruginosa PAO1 as well as the virulence factors (including exoprotease LasA, elastase LasB, lectin LecA and LecB, pyocyanin biosynthesis, and biofilm formation) regulated by these three QS systems were inhibited. This is consistent with our previous studies on the physiology, biochemistry, and RNA expression of P. aeruginosa treated with DADS. Additionally, our results also indicated that bacterial motility, chemotaxis, and two-component systems were inhibited by DADS treatment. All these changes abolish the sensitivity of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to environmental stimuli and cause the cells to be in a state of passivation.

Recently, the advent of high-throughput sequencing allows the posing of questions that address the system at a larger scale but also allow for the creation of high-resolution maps of transcription. Thus, while much is already known about genetic competence in streptococci, recent studies continue to reveal intricate novel regulation pathways and components. In this perspective article, we highlight the use of transcriptional profiling and mapping as a valuable resource in the identification and characterization of hidden gems pertinent to the natural transformation system. Such strategies have recently been employed in a variety of different species. In S. mutans, for example, genome editing combined with the power of promoter mapping and RNA-Seq allowed for the identification of a link between the ComCDE and the ComRS systems, a ComR positive feedback loop mediated by SigX, and the XrpA peptide, encoded within sigX, which inhibits competence. In S. pneumoniae, a novel member of the competence regulon termed BriC was found to be directly under control of ComE and to promote biofilm formation and nasopharyngeal colonization but not competence.

Over the last century, these fungi have been accorded roles ranging from commensalists to pathogens. Recently, Cyphobasidiales yeasts were shown to be ubiquitous in the cortex layer of many macrolichens [7], but for most species, little is known of their cellular distribution and constancy beyond visible fruiting structures. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of an additional and distantly related basidiomycete, Tremella, in 95% of studied thalli in a global sample of one of the most intensively studied groups of lichens, the wolf lichens (genus Letharia). Tremella species are reported from a wide range of lichen genera [8], but until now, their biology was deduced from fruiting bodies (basidiomata) formed on lichen thalli. Based on this, they have been thought to be uncommon to rare, to occur exclusively in a hyphal form, and to be parasitic on the dominant fungal partner [9, 10]. We show that, in wolf lichens, Tremella occurs as yeast cells also in thalli that lack basidiomata and infer that this is its dominant stage in nature. We further show that the hyphal stage, when present in Letharia, is in close contact with algal cells, challenging the assumption that lichen-associated Tremella species are uniformly mycoparasites. Our results suggest that extent of occurrence and cellular interactions of known fungi within lichens have historically been underestimated and raise new questions about their function in specific lichen symbioses.","authors":[{"name":"Veera Tuovinen"},{"name":"Stefan Ekman"},{"name":"Göran Thor"},{"name":"Dan Vanderpool"},{"name":"Toby Spribille"},{"name":"Hanna Johannesson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Tremella"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"confocal laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"cortex"},{"word":"symbiosis"},{"word":"transcriptomics"},{"word":"yeast"}]},"article388":{"pmid":"30661470","title":"First report of polymyxin B activity in Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilm.","abs":"Considering the clinical importance of biofilm in medical devices and chronic infections, this study aimed to investigate the action of polymyxin B on Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) biofilm.

Electrokinetic potential measurements were also employed to observe to what extent each ligand affected the surface charge property of the Ultisol. All the ligands shifted the zeta potential of the Ultisol to the negative direction, implying that the surface charge of the soil became more negative. The effect on the zeta potential of the soil was observed in the order of oxalate ˃ citrate ˃ EPS. The quantity of Pb adsorbed at each pH (3.0-7.0) reflected the corresponding change in the zeta potential as induced by each ligand.

Biofilms are the predominant lifestyle for microorganisms in rivers, providing pivotal roles in ecosystem functioning and pollutant removal. The persistence of glyphosate in these ecosystems is suspected to be mostly influenced by microbial biodegradation processes. The present study aimed to investigate the tripartite relationship among biofilms, phosphorus and glyphosate in rivers. The first part consists of a co-occurrence analysis among glyphosate, AMPA and phosphorus using an extensive dataset of measurements (n = 56,198) from French surface waters between 2013 and 2017. The second part investigated the capacity of natural river biofilms to dissipate glyphosate, depending on phosphorus availability and the exposure history of the biofilm, in a microcosm study. A strong co-occurrence among glyphosate, AMPA and phosphorus was found in surface waters. More than two-thirds of samples contained phosphorous with glyphosate, AMPA or both compounds. Seasonal fluctuations in glyphosate, AMPA and phosphorus concentrations were correlated, peaking in spring/summer shortly after pesticide spreading. Laboratory experiments revealed that natural river biofilms can degrade glyphosate. However, phosphorus availability negatively influenced the biodegradation of glyphosate and induced the accumulation of AMPA in water. An increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and phosphorus uptake was observed in glyphosate-degrading biofilms, evidencing the tight link between phosphorus limitation and glyphosate degradation by biofilms. The results of the present study show that phosphorus not only is a key driver of river eutrophication but also can reduce complete glyphosate degradation by biofilms and favour the accumulation of AMPA in river water. The predominant role of biofilms and the trophic status of rivers must therefore be considered in order to better assess the fate and persistence of glyphosate.","authors":[{"name":"Louis Carles"},{"name":"Hélène Gardon"},{"name":"Laura Joseph"},{"name":"Josep Sanchís"},{"name":"Marinella Farré"},{"name":"Joan Artigas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA)"},{"word":"Biodegradation"},{"word":"Co-occurrence"},{"word":"Eutrophication"},{"word":"Microbial ecotoxicology"},{"word":"Phosphorus"}]},"article395":{"pmid":"30660829","title":"Searching for new agents active against Candida albicans biofilm: A series of indole derivatives, design, synthesis and biological evaluation.","abs":"Candida albicans biofilm represents a major clinical problem due to its intrinsic tolerance to anti-fungal compounds and it has been highly related to infections in catheterized patients.

Our recent studies reported novel protocols to fractionate and analyzed the structural characteristics of glucans from S mutans biofilms. In this study, we identify the role of the S mutans dexAgene in dextran-dependent aggregation in biofilm formation. Our results show that deletion of dexA (SmudexA) results in increased transcription of EPS synthesis-related genes, including gtfB, gtfD, and ftf. Interestingly, we reveal that inactivating the dexA gene may lead to elevated WSG synthesis in S mutans , which results in dysregulated cariogenicity in vivo. Furthermore, structural analysis provides new insights regarding the lack of mannose monosaccharides, especially in the WSG synthesis of the SmudexA mutants. The biofilm phenotypes that are associated with the reduced glucose monosaccharide composition in both WSG and water-insoluble glucan shift the dental biofilm to reduce the cariogenic incidence of the SmudexA mutants. Taken together, these data reveal that EPS synthesis fine-tuning by the dexA gene results in a densely packed EPS matrix that may impede the glucose metabolism of WSG, thereby leading to the lack of an energy source for the bacteria.

In summary, this study clearly indicated that P. polymyxa Sx3 has strong in vitro and in vivo antagonistic activity against Xoo, which may be at least partially attributed to its production of secondary metabolites. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Antagonistic bacteria can grow well in their originating environment. However, it is unclear whether antagonistic bacteria were able to survive in different ecological environments. This study revealed that Paenibacillus polymyxa Sx3 isolated from rhizosphere soil of cotton significantly promoted the plant growth and suppressed bacterial leaf blight in rice. Therefore, it could be inferred that P. polymyxa Sx3 has the potential to be used as biocontrol agents in plants grown in different ecological environments.","authors":[{"name":"Y Abdallah"},{"name":"M Yang"},{"name":"M Zhang"},{"name":"Md M I Masum"},{"name":"S O Ogunyemi"},{"name":"A Hossain"},{"name":"Q An"},{"name":"C Yan"},{"name":"B Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. polymyxa"},{"word":"MALDI-TOF MS"},{"word":"X. oryzae pv. oryzae"},{"word":"biocontrol"},{"word":"plant growth promotion"},{"word":"transmission and scanning electron microscopy"}]},"article402":{"pmid":"30659584","title":"Potential regulates metabolism and extracellular respiration of electroactive Geobacter biofilm.","abs":"Dissimilatory metal reducer Geobacter sulfurreducens can mediate redox processes through extracellular electron transfer and exhibit potential-dependent electrochemical activity in biofilm.

In this study, the metabolism and redox conduction behaviors of G. sulfurreducens biofilms developed at different potentials were explored. We found that electrochemical acclimation occurred at the initial hours of polarizing G. sulfurreducens cells to the potentials. Two mechanisms of acclimation were found, depending on the polarizing potential. In the mature biofilms, a low level of biosynthesis and a high level of catabolism were maintained at +0.2 V versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The opposite results were observed at potentials higher than or equal to +0.4 V versus SHE. The potential also regulated the constitution of the electron transfer network by synthesizing more extracellular cytochrome c such as OmcS at 0.0 and +0.2 V and exhibited a better conductivity.

They established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIHNIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4- glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organspecific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyperechoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and multidrug- resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other genital mycoplasmas is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. Next generation investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gramnegative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alphablockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called dysbiosis causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Vittorio Magri"},{"name":"Matteo Boltri"},{"name":"Tommaso Cai"},{"name":"Roberto Colombo"},{"name":"Salvatore Cuzzocrea"},{"name":"Pieter De Visschere"},{"name":"Rosanna Giuberti"},{"name":"Clara Maria Granatieri"},{"name":"Maria Agnese Latino"},{"name":"Gaetano Larganà"},{"name":"Christian Leli"},{"name":"Giorgio Maierna"},{"name":"Valentina Marchese"},{"name":"Elisabetta Massa"},{"name":"Alberto Matteelli"},{"name":"Emanuele Montanari"},{"name":"Giuseppe Morgia"},{"name":"Kurt G Naber"},{"name":"Vaia Papadouli"},{"name":"Gianpaolo Perletti"},{"name":"Nektaria Rekleiti"},{"name":"Giorgio I Russo"},{"name":"Alessandra Sensini"},{"name":"Konstantinos Stamatiou"},{"name":"Alberto Trinchieri"},{"name":"Florian M E Wagenlehner"}],"keywords":[]},"article417":{"pmid":"30655213","title":"Benzimidazole tethered pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinoline with broad-spectrum activity against fungal pathogens.","abs":"Fungal infections caused by Candida and Cryptococcus are particularly dangerous for immunocompromised individuals.

In order to approach to an energy self-sufficient scenario in WWTPs, Membrane Aerated Biofilm Reactors (MABRs) provide a good opportunity to reduce the impact of aeration on the global energy balance. However, mass transfer limitations derived from poor flow distribution must be tackled to take advantage of this technology. In this work, in order to improve mass transfer between biofilm and bulk water, a specific configuration was developed and studied at laboratory scale, aimed at compactness, energy efficiency and high nitrification rates. Nitrification rates were higher in the innovative configuration than in the conventional one, achieving a Volumetric Nitrification Rate (VNR) as high as 575.84 g NH","authors":[{"name":"M Castrillo"},{"name":"R Díez-Montero"},{"name":"A L Esteban-García"},{"name":"I Tejero"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Energy self-sufficiency"},{"word":"MABR"},{"word":"Mass transfer"},{"word":"Nitrification"},{"word":"Nutrient removal"},{"word":"Wastewater"}]},"article425":{"pmid":"30654101","title":"In vitro and in vivo biofilm inhibitory efficacy of geraniol-cefotaxime combination against Staphylococcus spp.","abs":"In humans, the occurrence of bacterial communities in the form of biofilm is considered as a major intrinsic factor accountable for a variety of stubborn infections. Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis have gained considerable attention in clinical settings owing to the formation of intractable and long-lasting biofilms in medical device. The current study has been designed to explain the biofilm inhibitory efficacy of geraniol and cefotaxime combination (GCC) against S. epidermidis and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Biofilm biomass quantification assay was performed to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of GCC against S. epidermidis and MRSA. The minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration of GCC was found to be 100 μg/ml of geraniol and 2 μg/ml of cefotaxime. Further, microscopic analyses ascertained the devastating potential of GCC on the test pathogens' biofilm formation. Besides biofilm inhibition, GCC also suppressed the production of extracellular polymeric substance, slime and staphyloxanthin. More, GCC significantly increased the susceptibility of the test pathogens towards human blood. Further, the results of real time PCR analysis and in vivo assay using Caenorhabditis elegans unveiled the anti-biofilm potentials of GCC. Thus, the present study demonstrates the significant use of polytherapy treatment approaches to overcome the biofilm associated infections of Staphylococcus spp.","authors":[{"name":"Arunachalam Kannappan"},{"name":"Boopathi Balasubramaniam"},{"name":"Rajendhran Ranjitha"},{"name":"Ramanathan Srinivasan"},{"name":"Issac Abraham Sybiya Vasantha Packiavathy"},{"name":"Krishnaswamy Balamurugan"},{"name":"Shunmugiah Karutha Pandian"},{"name":"Arumugam Veera Ravi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiofilm"},{"word":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"word":"Cefotaxime"},{"word":"Geraniol"},{"word":"Staphylococcus spp"}]},"article426":{"pmid":"30653351","title":"Biofilms in Food Processing Environments: Challenges and Opportunities.","abs":"This review examines the impact of microbial communities colonizing food processing environments in the form of biofilms on food safety and food quality.

Information is presented on intraspecies variability in biofilm formation, interspecies relationships of cooperativism or competition within biofilms, the factors influencing biofilm ecology and architecture, and how these factors may influence removal. The effect on the biofilm formation ability of particular food components and different environmental conditions that commonly prevail during food processing is discussed.

Among MRSA isolates, 2.3 % (5/217) exhibited a high level of mupirocin-resistance with a minimum inhibitory concentration of >512 μg/mL, in addition to cross-resistance with clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin.

In occluding the tubules these agents may alter the surface layer of the dentine and consequently affect bacterial biofilm formation. This research sought to examine the effects of desensitising agents on dentinal biofilms using an in vitro model. A constant depth film fermenter (CDFF) was selected to mimic the oral environment and human dentine with exposed tubules was analysed. Calcium sodium phosphosilicate (CSPS) was selected as a model desensitising agent. Dentine discs were treated with pumice or CSPS-containing dentifrices with or without fluoride, or left untreated (control). Dual-species biofilms of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were grown in artificial saliva and analysed by viable counts, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM images confirmed the presence of occluded tubules after CSPS application and demonstrated the formation of biofilms containing extracellular matrix material. Analysis of PCR and viable count data using a one-way ANOVA showed no significant differences for bacterial composition for any of the four treatments. There were, however, trends towards increased numbers of bacteria for the pumice and CSPS treated samples which was reversed by the addition of fluoride to CSPS. In conclusion, CSPS was not found to have a significant effect on biofilms and an in vitro model for testing desensitising agents has been developed, however, further work is required to improve the reproducibility of the biofilms formed and to explore the trends seen.","authors":[{"name":"Jamie Coulter"},{"name":"Nicholas S Jakubovics"},{"name":"Philip M Preshaw"},{"name":"Matthew J German"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Dentine hypersensitivity"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"dental caries susceptibility"}]},"article430":{"pmid":"30652010","title":"Erratum: Author Correction: High-resolution bacterial 16S rRNA gene profile meta-analysis and biofilm status reveal common colorectal cancer consortia.","abs":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1038/s41522-017-0040-3.].","authors":[{"name":"Julia L Drewes"},{"name":"James R White"},{"name":"Christine M Dejea"},{"name":"Payam Fathi"},{"name":"Thevambiga Iyadorai"},{"name":"Jamuna Vadivelu"},{"name":"April C Roslani"},{"name":"Elizabeth C Wick"},{"name":"Emmanuel F Mongodin"},{"name":"Mun Fai Loke"},{"name":"Kumar Thulasi"},{"name":"Han Ming Gan"},{"name":"Khean Lee Goh"},{"name":"Hoong Yin Chong"},{"name":"Sandip Kumar"},{"name":"Jane W Wanyiri"},{"name":"Cynthia L Sears"}],"keywords":[]},"article431":{"pmid":"30651303","title":"Light Acclimation of the Colonial Green Alga Botryococcus braunii Strain Showa.","abs":"In contrast to single cellular species, detailed information is lacking on the processes of photosynthetic acclimation for colonial algae, although these algae are important for biofuel production, ecosystem biodiversity, and wastewater treatment. To investigate differences between single cellular and colonial species, we studied the regulation of photosynthesis and photoprotection during photoacclimation for the colonial green alga Botryococcus braunii and made a comparison with the properties of the single cellular species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii We show that B. braunii shares some high-light (HL) photoacclimation strategies with C. reinhardtii and other frequently studied green algae: decreased chlorophyll content, increased free carotenoid content, and increased nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Additionally, B. braunii has unique HL photoacclimation strategies, related to its colonial form: strong internal shading by an increase of the colony size and the accumulation of extracellular echinenone (a ketocarotenoid). HL colonies are larger and more spatially heterogenous than low-light colonies. Compared with surface cells, cells deeper inside the colony have increased pigmentation and larger photosystem II antenna size. The core of the largest of the HL colonies does not contain living cells. In contrast with C. reinhardtii, but similar to other biofilm-forming algae, NPQ capacity is substantial in low light. In HL, NPQ amplitude increases, but kinetics are unchanged. We discuss possible causes of the different acclimation responses of C. reinhardtii and B. braunii Knowledge of the specific photoacclimation processes for this colonial green alga further extends the view of the diversity of photoacclimation strategies in photosynthetic organisms.","authors":[{"name":"Tomas E van den Berg"},{"name":"Volha U Chukhutsina"},{"name":"Herbert van Amerongen"},{"name":"Roberta Croce"},{"name":"Bart van Oort"}],"keywords":[]},"article432":{"pmid":"30651226","title":"Treating Polymicrobial Infections in Chronic Diabetic Wounds.","abs":"This review provides a comprehensive summary of issues associated with treating polyclonal bacterial biofilms in chronic diabetic wounds.

Objective: A novel bacterium, Bacillus ligniniphilus, was characterized as producing Chitosan NAGH. This study further examine its antibiofilm properties and its possible uses against biofilm-producing bacteria. Methods: Various sea soil samples were evaluated for the presence of Chitosan NAGH. The chosen isolate, Bacillus ligniniphilus 61, was then used to extract and purify Chitosan NAGH using precipitation in ammonium sulfate followed by polyethylene glycol-treated dialysis and gel-permeation chromatography. Biofilm inhibition and antimicrobial activity of Chitosan NAGH was estimated against different bacterial species. Both gene expression profiling of biofilm-related genes and an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) inhibition assay were performed. Results: The BL61 strain was able to produce much more Chitosan activity than the other strains, as the latter only exhibited antimicrobial activity at low concentration levels; however, they did show as antibiofilm agents at varying proportions. Chitosan NAGH caused a uniform decrease in EPS formation in each isolate. Many biofilm-related genes, e.g., IcaABCD, decreased, but genes related to autoinducer synthetase were not affected by Chitosan NAGH. EPS, which is responsible for polysaccharide formation, was underexpressed at 3-fold down. Conclusions: The current study results allow future researchers to look for better and newer compounds with the antibiofilm property that inhibits the formation of biofilm created by a wide range of bacteria without affecting their growth.","authors":[{"name":"Raid Al Akeel"},{"name":"Helal F Hetta"},{"name":"Sahira Nsayef Muslim"},{"name":"Israa M S Al-Kadmy"},{"name":"Sarah Naji Aziz"}],"keywords":[]},"article435":{"pmid":"30651066","title":"Influence of subinhibitory antifungal concentrations on extracellular hydrolases and biofilm production by Candida albicans recovered from Egyptian patients.","abs":"Extracellular hydrolases (phospholipase, aspartyl protease and haemolysin) and biofilm production are considered as major virulence factors of the opportunistic pathogenic fungus Candida albicans.

Bacterial biofilms represent a major obstacle in the fight against bacterial infections as they are inherently refractory to many types of antibiotics. Treating biofilms with phage has shown promise in a handful of experimental and case studies. However, quantification of the effect of phage combined with antibiotics is needed to pave the way for larger clinical trials. Here we explore the effect of using phage in combination with a total of nine antibiotics, applied simultaneously or as a pretreatment before antibiotics are applied to in vitro biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus. Most antibiotics alone were ineffective at low concentration (2×MIC), but the addition of phage to treatment regimens led to substantial improvements in efficacy. At high concentration (10×MIC), antibiotics alone were effective, and in most cases the addition of phage to treatment regimens did not improve efficacy. Using phage with rifampin was also very effective at reducing the outgrowth of resistant strains during the course of treatment.","authors":[{"name":"James Dickey"},{"name":"Véronique Perrot"}],"keywords":[]},"article437":{"pmid":"30649850","title":"Enzyme-Identified Phosphorus Limitation Linked to More Rapid Headloss Accumulation in Drinking Water Biofilters.","abs":"Drinking water biofilters can improve water quality by transforming contaminants or their precursors, but they also can develop headloss more rapidly than do abiotic filters. Phosphorus supplementation has been proposed as one strategy to lengthen biofilter run times, but the impact of this strategy in field tests has been mixed. The current bench-scale study found that severe phosphorus limitation, as indicated by a high phosphatase to total glycosidase activity ratio (PHO:GLY), led to 230% higher headloss accumulation rate when particles were loaded onto the biofilters as compared to the same experiment performed under a mild phosphorus limitation. Phosphorus limitation was associated with higher concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances, lower biomass concentrations, a more filamentous biofilm morphology, and increased relative abundance of Hyphomicrobiaceae (a family of stalked bacteria) on the biofilter media. These differences in the biofilm likely contributed to higher headloss. This work suggests that phosphorus supplementation could improve biofilter hydraulics in the field if the biofilter is severely phosphorus limited, which was indicated by a PHO:GLY greater than 154 under the conditions tested in this study.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah E Keithley"},{"name":"Mary Jo Kirisits"}],"keywords":[]},"article438":{"pmid":"30649554","title":"Three autoinducer molecules act in concert to control virulence gene expression in Vibrio cholerae.","abs":"Bacteria use quorum sensing to monitor cell density and coordinate group behaviours. In Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, quorum sensing is connected to virulence gene expression via the two autoinducer molecules, AI-2 and CAI-1. Both autoinducers share one signal transduction pathway to control the production of AphA, a key transcriptional activator of biofilm formation and virulence genes. In this study, we demonstrate that the recently identified autoinducer, DPO, also controls AphA production in V. cholerae. DPO, functioning through the transcription factor VqmA and the VqmR small RNA, reduces AphA levels at the post-transcriptional level and consequently inhibits virulence gene expression. VqmR-mediated repression of AphA provides an important link between the AI-2/CAI-1 and DPO-dependent quorum sensing pathways in V. cholerae. Transcriptome analyses comparing the effect of single autoinducers versus autoinducer combinations show that quorum sensing controls the expression of ∼400 genes in V. cholerae and that all three autoinducers are required for a full quorum sensing response. Together, our data provide a global view on autoinducer interplay in V. cholerae and highlight the importance of RNA-based gene control for collective functions in this major human pathogen.","authors":[{"name":"Roman Herzog"},{"name":"Nikolai Peschek"},{"name":"Kathrin S Fröhlich"},{"name":"Kilian Schumacher"},{"name":"Kai Papenfort"}],"keywords":[]},"article439":{"pmid":"30649481","title":"Unequivocal identification of an underestimated opportunistic yeast species, Cyberlindnera fabianii, and its close relatives using a dual-function PCR and literature review of published cases.","abs":"Although Cyberlindnera fabinaii is a rare opportunist yeast species, its ability to cause septicemia, produce biofilm, and rapid acquisition of resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole, reinforced the urge for its identification from its closely related species. Widely used biochemical assays mainly identify Cyberlindnera fabinaii as Cyberlindnera jadinii and Wickerhamomyces anomalus, resulting in underestimation of this yeast in clinical settings. Moreover, the urge for a reliable molecular means of identification remains unsolved for 28 years. In order to unequivocally differentiate Cy. fabianii, Cy. mississipiensis, Cy. jadinii, and W. anomalus, we designed a dual-function multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Challenging our dual-function multiplex PCR assay with 30 most clinically important yeast species, proved its specificity. Although conventional PCR could differentiate four target species, the real-time PCR counterpart due to Tm overlap misidentified Cy. mississipiensis as Cy. jadinii. Alongside of presenting a comprehensive literature review of published cases of Cy. fabianii from 1990 to 2018, we collected various clinical isolates from Tehran, Shiraz, and Fasa (July 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017) to find a passive relative distribution of these closely-related species in Iran. Subjecting our Iranian collection of yeast isolates to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS and LSU and ITS rDNA sequencing revealed six isolates of Cy. fabianii (central venous catheter n = 2 and vaginal swabs n = 4) and one isolate of Cy. jadinii (vaginal swabs). Due to the use of biochemical assays in global ARTEMIS study, we encourage reidentification of clinical isolates of Cy. jadinii and Cy. jadinii using MALDI-TOF or Sanger sequencing that might lead to correcting the distribution of this fungus.","authors":[{"name":"Amir Arastehfar"},{"name":"Wenjie Fang"},{"name":"Abdullah M S Al-Hatmi"},{"name":"Mohammad Hosein Afsarian"},{"name":"Farnaz Daneshnia"},{"name":"Mina Bakhtiari"},{"name":"Sara Khanjari Sadati"},{"name":"Hamid Badali"},{"name":"Sadegh Khodavaisy"},{"name":"Ferry Hagen"},{"name":"Wanqing Liao"},{"name":"Weihua Pan"},{"name":"Kamiar Zomorodian"},{"name":"Teun Boekhout"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Cy. fabianii        "},{"word":"          Cy. jadinii        "},{"word":"          Cy. mississipiensis        "},{"word":"          W. anomalus        "},{"word":"biochemical assays"},{"word":"multiplex PCR"}]}}
