This study reports on Mn(II) oxidation and the core microbiomes in magnetite sand RSBF (MagS-RSBF) and manganese sand RSBF (MnS-RSBF). MnS-RSBF showed a relatively higher Mn(II) removal rate (40-91.2%) than MagS-RSBF during the start-up. MagS-RSBF and MnS-RSBF had similar Mn(II) removal rates (94.13% and 99.16%) over stable operation for 80 days. Mn(II) removal rates at different depths in the MnS-RSBF reactor significantly changed with operation time, and the filter in the upper layer of MnS-RSBF made the largest contribution to Mn(II) oxidation once operation had stabilized. PacBio single molecule sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA gene indicated that biofilter medium had a significant impact on the core microbiomes of the biofilms from the two biofilters. The magnetite sand biofilter facilitated the enrichment of Mn(II)-oxidizing biofilms. The dominant populations consisted of Pedomicrobium, Pseudomonas, and Hyphomicrobium in the RSBF, which have been affiliated with putative manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB). The relative abundance of Pedomicrobium manganicum increased with operation time in both RSBF reactors. In addition, Nordella oligomobilis and Derxia gummosa were statistically correlated with Mn(II) oxidation. Species-species co-occurrence networks indicated that the microbiome of MnS-RSBF had more complex correlations than that of MagS-RSBF, implying that biofilter medium substantially shaped the microbial community in the RSBF. Hyphomicrobium and nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira moscoviensis were positively correlated. The core microbiomes' composition of both RSBF reactors converged over operation time.

Here, we further explored the mechanism. Two main directions were studied: pyocyanin biosynthesis pathway and QS system. The effect on the expression of the pyocyanin biosynthesis genes was evaluated by promoter strength determination and Real-Time PCR assay, and significant changes leading to low pyocyanin production were found. The effect on the QS system was studied by signal molecule quantification using LC-MS/MS and related gene expression measurements using Real-Time PCR. In mvaT mvaU double knockout, the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL obviously increased, while those of C4-HSL and PQS obviously decreased, and the changes can be recovered by mvaT or mvaU complementation. The expressions of transcriptional activator genes binding with QS system signal molecules were all decreased, resulting in decreased formation of signal-transcriptional activator complexes. And the decreased expression of rhlR and pqsE also led to the lower expression of phzA1 and phzA2. Further exploration found that QS system downregulation may be related to QsrO, a QS system repressor, which was highly upregulated with mvaT mvaU double knockout. Hence, the synthesis of pyocyanin was suffocated and the biofilm formation ability was decreased. These results were also confirmed by transcriptome analysis, which demonstrated similar gene expression changes of the aforementioned genes together with decreased expression of other virulence factor genes regulated by QS system.","authors":[{"name":"Limin Dong"},{"name":"Jing Pang"},{"name":"Xiukun Wang"},{"name":"Youwen Zhang"},{"name":"Guoqing Li"},{"name":"Xinxin Hu"},{"name":"Xinyi Yang"},{"name":"Chung-Dar Lu"},{"name":"Congran Li"},{"name":"Xuefu You"}],"keywords":[{"word":"H-NS"},{"word":"Pyocyanin"},{"word":"mvaT"},{"word":"mvaU"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article23":{"pmid":"31885119","title":"Antimicrobial activities of Asian ginseng, American ginseng, and notoginseng.","abs":"Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.

Here, we report the neuronal and behavioral protective effects of the probiotic bacterium Bacillus subtilis in a Caenorhabditis elegans AD model. Aging and neuronal deterioration constitute important risk factors for AD development, and we showed that B. subtilis significantly delayed both detrimental processes in the wild-type C. elegans strain N2 compared with N2 worms colonized by the non-probiotic Escherichia coli OP50 strain. Importantly, B. subtilis alleviated the AD-related paralysis phenotype of the transgenic C. elegans strains CL2120 and GMC101 that express, in body wall muscle cells, the toxic peptides Aβ3-42 and Aβ1-42, respectively. B. subtilis-colonized CL2355 worms were protected from the behavioral deficits (e.g., poor chemotactic response and decreased body bends) produced by pan-neuronal Aβ1-42 expression. Notably, B. subtilis restored the lifespan level of C. elegans strains that express Aβ to values similar to the life expectancy of the wild-type strain N2 fed on E. coli OP50 cells. The B. subtilis proficiencies in quorum-sensing peptide (i.e., the Competence Sporulation Factor, CSF) synthesis and gut-associated biofilm formation (related to the anti-aging effect of the probiotic) play a crucial role in the anti-AD effects of B. subtilis.

Herein, we examined MSCs/C. acnes interaction and analysed the subsequent bacteria and MSCs behaviours following infection.

It is recognized that small-colony variants (SCVs), which produce higher levels of biofilm and that are capable of intracellular persistence, contribute to the chronicity or recurrence of infections and that this phenotype is inherent to the pathogenesis process. Prevention of S. aureus infections through vaccination has not yet met with considerable success. Some of the current vaccine formulations for S. aureus bovine mastitis consist of inactivated S. aureus bacteria, sometimes combined to E. coli J5. As such, the stimulation of cell-mediated immunity by these vaccines might not be optimal. With this in mind, we recently engineered a genetically stable double mutant SCV (ΔvraGΔhemB), which was highly attenuated in a mastitis model of infection. The present work describes the immune responses elicited in mice by various experimental vaccine compositions including the live-attenuated SCV double mutant and its inactivated form, combined or not with inactivated E. coli J5. The live-attenuated SCV was found to provoke a strong and balanced humoral response in immunized mice, as well as strong proliferation of ex-vivo stimulated splenocytes isolated from these animals. These splenocytes were also found to release high concentration of IL-17 and IFN-γ when compared to every other vaccination formulation. Inversely, the inactivated whole-cell vaccine, alone or in combination with the E. coli J5 bacterin, elicited lower antibody titers and failed to induce Th1 or Th17 cell-mediated responses in the splenocyte proliferation assay. Our results suggest that live-attenuated SCVs can trigger host immunity differently than inactivated bacteria and could represent a suitable vector for inducing strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, which are crucial for protection. This could represent an important improvement over existing vaccine formulations for preventing S. aureus bovine mastitis and other infections caused by this pathogen.","authors":[{"name":"Julie Côté-Gravel"},{"name":"Eric Brouillette"},{"name":"François Malouin"}],"keywords":[]},"article43":{"pmid":"31880897","title":"Epidemiology, Drug Resistance, and Virulence of Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Ocular Infections in Polish Patients.","abs":"Analysis of the epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) ocular infections and virulence factors of the isolates with a special emphasis on their drug resistance, and the ability of biofilm formation.

Among the strains under study, 6.0% (n = 5) had the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus phenotype, and 26.5% (n = 22) had the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B phenotype. In 48 (57.8%) isolates the neomycin resistance was revealed. All isolates under study were sensitive to vancomycin. The population most susceptible to ocular SA infections consists of hospitalized patients aged 65 and more. The SA strains under study showed the increased ability to biofilm formation. In the strains tested, high susceptibility to chloramphenicol and fluoroquinolones was demonstrated. However, the high level of drug resistance to neomycin detected in this study among SA isolates and the blood-ocular barrier makes it difficult to treat ocular infections.","authors":[{"name":"Marta Kłos"},{"name":"Monika Pomorska-Wesołowska"},{"name":"Dorota Romaniszyn"},{"name":"Agnieszka Chmielarczyk"},{"name":"Jadwiga Wójkowska-Mach"}],"keywords":[]},"article44":{"pmid":"31880890","title":"Cytokine Levels in the In Vitro Response of T Cells to Planktonic and Biofilm Corynebacterium amycolatum.","abs":"Unravelling of the interplay between the immune system and non-diphtheria corynebacteria would contribute to understanding their increasing role as medically important microorganisms.

Two reference strains: C. amycolatum ATCC 700207 (R-CA), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (R-SA), and ten clinical strains of C. amycolatum (C-CA) were used in the study. Jurkat T cells were stimulated in vitro by the planktonic-conditioned medium (PCM) and biofilm-conditioned medium (BCM) derived from the relevant cultures of the strains tested. The cytokine concentrations were determined in the cell culture supernatants using the flow cytometry. The levels of the cytokines analyzed were lower after stimulation with the BCM when compared to the PCM derived from the cultures of C-CA; statistical significance (p < 0.05) was observed for IL-1β, IL-12 p70, and IL-10. Similarly, planktonic R-CA and R-SA stimulated a higher cytokine production than their biofilm counterparts. The highest levels of pro-inflammatory IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-12p70 were observed after stimulation with planktonic R-SA whereas the strongest stimulation of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was noted for the BCM derived from the mixed culture of both reference species. Our results are indicative of weaker immunostimulatory properties of the biofilm C. amycolatum compared to its planktonic form. It may play a role in the persistence of biofilm-related infections.

Three DGT devices were deployed in a lake for 5 weeks, and two were deployed in a stream for 3 weeks. In the lake, the total Hg (THg) mass accumulated in the DGT varied between 0.05 and 0.15 ng, which increased with an increase in deployment time and decreased with an increase in agarose diffusion gel thickness. The DGT concentration in the lake water for a 2 week period was estimated to be about 0.8-1.0 ng/L, which was close to the measured value of 1.1 (± 0.13) ng/L, using the grab sampling technique. However, the DGT estimated at 4 and 6 weeks showed a concentration of about 0.5-0.7 ng/L, which is about twice as small as that measured by grab sampling. This underestimation of the THg levels in water appear to be caused by additional thicknesses of the physical diffusive boundary layer (0.15, 0.5, 1.29 mm) and biofilm, outside the DGT filter.

The results revealed that, when the excitation wavelength was increased from 340 to 390 nm, the emission peak became slightly red-shifted, which was induced by the condensation between CQDs and PVA. The PVA composite films showed an increase in fluorescence intensity with the addition of the CNF and CQDs to polymers. The chemical structure of prepared films was determined by the FTIR spectroscopy, and no new chemical bonds were formed. In addition, the UV transmittance was inversely proportional to the change of CQDs content, which indicated that CQDs improved the UV barrier properties of the films. Furthermore, embedding CQDs Nano-materials and CNF into the PVA matrix improved the mechanical behavior of the Nano-composite. Tensile modulus and strength at break increased significantly with increasing the concentration of CQDs Nano-materials inside the Nano-composite, which was due to the increased in the density of crosslinking behavior.

These pumps are also essential for Gram-negative pathogens to cause infection and form biofilms. They consist of an inner membrane RND transporter; a periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP), and an outer membrane channel. The role of PAPs in assembly, and the identities of specific residues involved in PAP-RND binding, remain poorly understood. Using recent high-resolution structures, four 3D sites involved in PAP-RND binding within each PAP protomer were defined that correspond to nine discrete linear binding sequences or binding boxes within the PAP sequence. In the important human pathogen Salmonella enterica, these binding boxes are conserved within phylogenetically-related PAPs, such as AcrA and AcrE, while differing considerably between divergent PAPs such as MdsA and MdtA, despite overall conservation of the PAP structure. By analysing these binding sequences we created a predictive model of PAP-RND interaction, which suggested the determinants that may allow promiscuity between certain PAPs, but discrimination of others. We corroborated these predictions using direct phenotypic data, confirming that only AcrA and AcrE, but not MdtA or MsdA, can function with the major RND pump AcrB. Furthermore, we provide functional validation of the involvement of the binding boxes by disruptive site-directed mutagenesis. These results directly link sequence conservation within identified PAP binding sites with functional data providing mechanistic explanation for assembly of clinically relevant RND-pumps and explain how Salmonella and other pathogens maintain a degree of redundancy in efflux mediated resistance. Overall, our study provides a novel understanding of the molecular determinants driving the RND-PAP recognition by bridging the available structural information with experimental functional validation thus providing the scientific community with a predictive model of pump-contacts that could be exploited in the future for the development of targeted therapeutics and efflux pump inhibitors.","authors":[{"name":"Helen E McNeil"},{"name":"Ilyas Alav"},{"name":"Ricardo Corona Torres"},{"name":"Amanda E Rossiter"},{"name":"Eve Laycock"},{"name":"Simon Legood"},{"name":"Inderpreet Kaur"},{"name":"Matthew Davies"},{"name":"Matthew Wand"},{"name":"Mark A Webber"},{"name":"Vassiliy N Bavro"},{"name":"Jessica M A Blair"}],"keywords":[]},"article63":{"pmid":"31877028","title":"Catalytic Cycle of Glycoside Hydrolase BglX from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Its Implications for Biofilm Formation.","abs":"BglX is a heretofore uncharacterized periplasmic glycoside hydrolase (GH) of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Five compositions of blends (alumina, zirconia, hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, chitosan), in addition to the base cement consisting of homogeneous CAC were evaluated as a substitute for bone repair. Additionally, the monotypic biofilm formation was assessed. Creation of a monocortical bone defect was performed on the femurs of rats, which were randomly filled with the different materials.

Although a marked decline in their use was driven by the discovery of antibiotics, the era of antibiotic resistance has led to a resurgence of phage therapy into clinical practice.

A peer-reviewed literature search was conducted (1890-2019) using the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases.

Moreover, EEP-NPs exhibited less cytotoxicity on Vero cells and suppressed the virulence factors of C. albicans, including adhesion, hyphal germination, biofilm formation, and invasion. Importantly, EEP-NPs exhibited a statistical decrease in the expression of hyphal adhesion-related genes, ALS3 and HWP1, of C. albicans.

This is related to its ability to form biofilm and to be internalized and persist inside osteoblasts. Recently, bacteriophage therapy has emerged as a promising option to improve treatment of such infections, but data on its activity against the specific bacterial lifestyles presented above remain scarce. We evaluated the activity of a combination of three bacteriophages, recently used for compassionate treatment in France, against S. aureus HG001 in a model of staphylococcal biofilm and a model of osteoblasts infection, alone or in association with vancomycin or rifampin. The activity of bacteriophages against biofilm-embedded S. aureus was dose dependent. In addition, synergistic effects were observed when bacteriophages were combined with antibiotics used at the lowest concentrations. Phage penetration into osteoblasts was observed only when the cells were infected, suggesting a S. aureus-dependent Trojan horse mechanism for internalization. The intracellular bacterial count of bacteria in infected osteoblasts treated with bacteriophages as well as with vancomycin was significantly higher than in cells treated with lysostaphin, used as a control condition, owing to the absence of intracellular activity and the rapid killing of bacteria released after the death of infected cells. These results suggest that bacteriophages are both inactive in the intracellular compartment after being internalized in infected osteoblasts and present a delayed killing effect on bacteria released after cell lysis into the extracellular compartment, which avoids preventing them from infecting other osteoblasts.

We demonstrate that loss of rhamnose biosynthesis causes a phenotype similar to strains with disrupted RGP assembly (ΔrgpG and ΔrgpF strains). Deletion of rmlD not only caused a severe growth defect under non-stress growth conditions, but also elevated susceptibility of the strain to acid and oxidative stress, common conditions found in the oral cavity. A genetic complement of the ΔrmlD strain completely restored wild-type levels of growth; whereas, addition of exogenous rhamnose did not. The loss of rhamnose production also significantly disrupted biofilm formation, an important aspect of S. mutans' growth in the oral cavity. Further, we demonstrate that loss of either rmlD or rgpG results in ablation of rhamnose content in the S. mutans cell wall.

The biofilm was visible significantly at the end of stage 3, and the total relative abundance of resistance genes in biofilm was higher than water from stage 5 onwards. Evolution of AmpC β-lactamase resistance genes was more obvious than MRGs, especially for MOX, which increased by 3 orders of magnitude. The abundance of Flavobacterium was higher in biofilm than in water. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that both arsB and MOX were significantly correlated with intI1 (p < 0.05), which suggested a potentially dissemination risk of resistance genes. This study provides a reference for health risk assessment in integrated aquaculture environment contaminated with duck manure, antibiotics and metalloids.","authors":[{"name":"Min Zhou"},{"name":"Yanbin Xu"},{"name":"Pengqian Ouyang"},{"name":"Jiayin Ling"},{"name":"Qiujie Cai"},{"name":"Lu Huang"},{"name":"Xiao Zhou"},{"name":"Li Zheng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial community"},{"word":"Duck manure"},{"word":"Fish-duck integrated pond"},{"word":"Resistance genes"},{"word":"Stress factor"}]},"article92":{"pmid":"31869619","title":"Performance evaluation of two trickling filters removing LAS and caffeine from wastewater: Light reactor (algal-bacterial consortium) vs dark reactor (bacterial consortium).","abs":"Micropollutant removal efficiencies of two trickling filters - operated under light and dark conditions were studied and compared.

In some cases, PilB has been demonstrated to regulate the production of exopolysaccharide (EPS) during bacterial biofilm development independently of or in addition to its function in pilus assembly. While the ATPase activity of PilB resides at its C-terminal region, the N terminus of a subset of PilBs forms a novel cyclic-di-GMP (cdG)-binding domain. This multi-domain structure suggests that PilB binds cdG and adenine nucleotides through separate domains which may influence the functionality of PilB in both motility and biofilm development. Here, Chloracidobacterium thermophilum PilB is used to investigate ligand binding by its separate domains and by the full-length protein. Our results confirm the specificity of these individual domains for their respective ligands and demonstrate communications between these domains in the full-length protein. It is clear that when the N- and the C-terminal domains of PilB bind to cdG and ADP, respectively, they mutually influence each other in conformation and in their binding to ligands.

Hypericin is believed to act as an antibiotic, antidepressant, antiviral and non-specific kinase inhibitor. In the current study, we investigated the impact of hypericin on β-lactam antibiotics susceptibility and mechanism(s) of its activity. We demonstrated that hypericin significantly decreased the minimum inhibitory concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., oxacillin, cefazolin and nafcillin), biofilm formation and fibronectin binding in MRSA strain JE2.

This study reports the in vitro antibacterial effect of the oleoresin from Copaifera officinalis Jacq. L. in natura (copaiba oil) and loaded into carbomer-hydrogel against planktonic and sessile cells of GBS. First, the naturally extracted copaiba oil was tested for the ability to inhibit the growth and metabolic activity of planktonic and sessile GBS cells. The time-kill kinetics showed that copaiba oil exhibited a dose-dependent bactericidal activity against planktonic GBS strains, including those resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin [minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranged from 0.06 mg/mL to 0.12 mg/mL]. Copaiba oil did not inhibit the growth of different Lactobacillus species, the indigenous members of the human microbiota. The mass spectral analyses of copaiba oil showed the presence of diterpenes, and the kaurenoic acid appears to be one of the active components of oleoresin from C. officinalis related to antibacterial activity against GBS. Microscopy analyses of planktonic GBS cells treated with copaiba oil revealed morphological and ultrastructural alterations, displaying disruption of the cell wall, damaged cell membrane, decreased electron density of the cytoplasm, presence of intracellular condensed material, and asymmetric septa. Copaiba oil also exhibited antibacterial activity against established biofilms of GBS strains, inhibiting the viability of sessile cells. Low-cost and eco-friendly carbomer-based hydrogels containing copaiba oil (0.5% - CARB-CO 0.5; 1.0% - CARB-CO 1.0) were then developed. However, only CARB-CO 1.0 preserved the antibacterial activity of copaiba oil against GBS strains. This formulation was homogeneous, soft, exhibited a viscoelastic behavior, and showed good biocompatibility with murine vaginal mucosa. Moreover, CARB-CO 1.0 showed a slow and sustained release of the copaiba oil, killing the planktonic and sessile (established biofilm) cells and inhibiting the biofilm formation of GBS on pre-coated abiotic surface. These results indicate that carbomer-based hydrogels may be useful as topical systems for delivery of copaiba oil directly into de vaginal mucosa and controlling S. agalactiae colonization and infection.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Elisa Belotto Morguette"},{"name":"Briani Gisele Bigotto"},{"name":"Renata de Lima Varella"},{"name":"Gabriella Maria Andriani"},{"name":"Laís Fernanda de Almeida Spoladori"},{"name":"Patrícia Moraes Lopes Pereira"},{"name":"Fabio Goulart de Andrade"},{"name":"Cesar Armando Contreras Lancheros"},{"name":"Celso Vataru Nakamura"},{"name":"Nilton Syogo Arakawa"},{"name":"Marcos Luciano Bruschi"},{"name":"José Carlos Tomaz"},{"name":"Audrey Alesandra Stinghen Garcia Lonni"},{"name":"Gilselena Kerbauy"},{"name":"Eliandro Reis Tavares"},{"name":"Lucy Megumi Yamauchi"},{"name":"Sueli Fumie Yamada-Ogatta"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"carbomer"},{"word":"copaiba oil"},{"word":"group B Streptococcus"},{"word":"semi-solid formulation"}]},"article101":{"pmid":"31866973","title":"Polymicrobial Interactions Induce Multidrug Tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus Through Energy Depletion.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a high number of relapsing infections, which are often mediated by the protective nature of biofilms.

The possibility of C. albicans matrix components physically blocking antibiotic molecules from reaching S. aureus was ruled out as oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, delafloxacin, and rifampicin were able to diffuse through polymicrobial biofilms. Based on previous findings that S. aureus forms drug tolerant persister cells through ATP depletion, we examined nutrient deprivation by determining glucose availability, which indirectly correlates to ATP production via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Using an extracellular glucose assay, we confirmed that S. aureus and C. albicans polymicrobial cultures depleted available glucose faster than the respective monocultures. Supporting this finding, S. aureus exhibited decreased TCA cycle activity, specifically fumarase expression, when grown in the presence of C. albicans. In addition, S. aureus grown in polymicrobial cultures displayed 2.2-fold more cells with low membrane potential and a 13% reduction in intracellular ATP concentrations than in monocultures.

A total of 109 S. aureus strains isolated from a variety of infections like ocular diseases, wound infection, and sputum were included in the study. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined against 8 antimicrobials. PCR determined the presence of 16S rRNA, nuc, mecA, czrC, qacA/B, pvl, and toxin genes in S. aureus isolates. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), SCCmec, spa-, and agr-typing and serotyping determined the diversity among them. All isolates of S. aureus were resistant to two or more than two antibiotics and generated 32 resistance patterns. These isolates were positive for 16S rRNA and S. aureus-specific nuc gene, but showed variable results for mecA, czrC, and qacA/B and pvl genes. Of the 32 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 13 strains carried SCCmec type V, seven type IV, two type III, and nine carried unreported type UT6.

Serotypes VII and VI were prevalent among S. aureus strains. PFGE analysis grouped the 109 strains into 77 clusters. MLST classified the strains into 33 sequence types (ST) and eight clonal complexes (CCs) of which 12 were singletons, and two belong to new allelic profiles. Isolates showed 46 spa-types that included two new spa-types designated as t14911 and t14912.

These seeps flow across iron duricrusts (referred to as canga in Brazil) into hydraulically restricted lakes in northern Brazil. Canga caps all of the iron ore deposits in Brazil, protecting them from being destroyed by erosion in this active weathering environment. Biofilm samples collected from these seeps demonstrated heightened biogeochemical iron cycling, contributing to the relatively rapid, seasonal formation of iron-rich cements. The seeps support iron-oxidising lineages including Sideroxydans, Gallionella, and an Azoarcus species revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In contrast, a low relative abundance of putative iron reducers; for example, Geobacter species (<5% of total sequences in any sample), corresponds to carbon limitation in this canga-associated ecosystem. This carbon limitation is likely to restrict anoxic niches to within biofilms. Examination of a canga rock sample collected from the edge of Lake Violão revealed an array of well- to poorly-preserved microbial fossils in secondary iron cements. These heterogeneous cements preserved bacterial cell envelopes and possibly extracellular polymeric substances within the microfossil iron-rich cements (termed biocements). Bacterial iron reduction initiates the sequence, and intuitively is the rate-limiting step in this broadly aerobic environment. The organic framework of the active- and paleo-biofilms appears to provide a scaffold for the formation of some cements within canga and likely expedites cement formation. The accelerated development of these resilient iron-rich biocements in the lake edge environment compared with surroundings duricrust-associated environments may provide insights into new approaches to remediate mined land, aiding to stabilise slopes, reduce erosion, restore functional hydrogeology and provide a substrate akin to natural canga for revegetation using endemic canga plant species, which have adapted to grow on iron-rich substrates.","authors":[{"name":"Alan Levett"},{"name":"Emma J Gagen"},{"name":"Paulo M Vasconcelos"},{"name":"Yitian Zhao"},{"name":"Anat Paz"},{"name":"Gordon Southam"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocements"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Iron precipitation"},{"word":"Iron reduction"},{"word":"Iron seep"},{"word":"Organic scaffold"}]},"article112":{"pmid":"31864088","title":"Enhanced anti-lung carcinoma and anti-biofilm activity of fungal molecules mediated biogenic zinc oxide nanoparticles conjugated with β-D-glucan from barley.","abs":"This work reports the optimization, synthesis, characterization, anticancer, and antibacterial activity of the Trichoderma-β-D-glucan‑zinc oxide nanoparticles (T-β-D-glu-ZnO NPs).

Environmental factors within RBCs are known to impact the performance of key AOM, such that only some operational RBCs have shown ability for elevated ammonia removal. In this work, long-term treatment performance of seven full-scale RBC systems along with the structure and abundance of the ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) communities within microbial biofilms were examined. Long term data showed the dominance of AOB in most RBCs, although two RBCs had demonstrable shift toward an AOA dominated AOM community.

AOA were more abundant in the biofilms subject to lower organic loading and higher oxygen concentration found at the distal end of RBC systems. Modelling revealed a distinct nitrogen cycling community present within high performing RBCs, linked to efficient control of RBC process variables (retention time, organic loading and oxygen concentration). We present a novel template for enhancing the resilience of RBC systems through microbial community analysis which can guide future strategies for more effective ammonia removal.

On the background of an aging population, the number of joint replacements and associated complications is expected to increase. The capability for biofilm formation and the increasing resistance of different microbes to antibiotics have complicated the treatment of PPI, requiring the need for the development of alternative treatment options. The bactericidal effect of the naturally occurring amino alcohol sphingosine has already been reported. In our study, we demonstrate the antimicrobial efficacy of sphingosine on three different strains of biofilm producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, representing one of the most frequent microbes involved in PPI. In an in vitro analysis, sphingosine's capability for prevention and treatment of biofilm-contamination on different common orthopedic implant surfaces was tested. Coating titanium implant samples with sphingosine not only prevented implant contamination but also revealed a significant reduction of biofilm formation on the implant surfaces by 99.942%. When testing the antimicrobial efficacy of sphingosine on sessile biofilm-grown Staphylococcus epidermidis, sphingosine solution was capable to eliminate 99.999% of the bacteria on the different implant surfaces, i.e., titanium, steel, and polymethylmethacrylate. This study provides evidence on the antimicrobial efficacy of sphingosine for both planktonic and sessile biofilm-grown Staphylococcus epidermidis on contaminated orthopedic implants. Sphingosine may provide an effective and cheap treatment option for prevention and reduction of infections in joint replacement surgery.

In addition, protein-repellent effects and inhibitory effects on Streptococcus mutans adhesion and saliva-derived biofilm accumulation of LCFV were estimated. Finally, the preventive effect of LCFV on enamel demineralization was assessed in vitro on extracted human teeth specimens stored in S. mutans-containing medium. The film thickness of LCFV significantly decreased with the incorporation of zwitterionic materials compared to the control LCFV, whereas there were no significant differences in the DC among all of the LCFV groups.

Given the increasing prevalence of S. aureus drug-resistant strains, it is imperative to search for new strategies for treatment and prevention. Thus, we investigated the activity of molecules produced by a commensal S. epidermidis isolate against S. aureus biofilms. We showed that molecules present in S. epidermidis cell-free conditioned media (CFCM) caused a significant reduction in biofilm formation in most S. aureus clinical isolates, including all 4 agr types and agr-defective strains, without any impact on growth. S. epidermidis molecules also disrupted established S. aureus biofilms and reduced the antibiotic concentration required to eliminate them. Preliminary characterization of the active compound showed that its activity is resistant to heat, protease inhibitors, trypsin, proteinase K, and sodium periodate treatments, suggesting that it is not proteinaceous. RNA sequencing revealed that S. epidermidis-secreted molecules modulate the expression of hundreds of S. aureus genes, some of which are associated with biofilm production. Biofilm formation is one of the main virulence factors of S. aureus and has been associated with chronic infections and antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, molecules that can counteract this virulence factor may be promising alternatives as novel therapeutic agents to control S. aureus infections.","authors":[{"name":"Thaís Glatthardt"},{"name":"Juliana Curityba de Mello Campos"},{"name":"Raiane Cardoso Chamon"},{"name":"Thiago Freitas de Sá Coimbra"},{"name":"Giulia de Almeida Rocha"},{"name":"Marília Alves Figueira de Melo"},{"name":"Thiago Estevam Parente"},{"name":"Leandro Araujo Lobo"},{"name":"Luis Caetano Martha Antunes"},{"name":"Kátia Regina Netto Dos Santos"},{"name":"Rosana Barreto Rocha Ferreira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"antivirulence"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"skin microbiota"}]},"article123":{"pmid":"31862559","title":"Rationally designed magnetic poly(catechol-hexanediamine) particles for bacteria removal and on-demand biofilm eradication.","abs":"In this study, we proposed a green, facile and low-cost approach for the fabrication of multifunctional particles with robust bacteria removal capability and on-demand biofilm eradication activity.

Along with the mycobiont, numerous non-obligate microfungi live in lichen thalli. These microfungi are called endolichenic fungi (ELF). In recent years, the ELF are emerging as promising natural sources because of their capability to exert unique drug molecules. The current study aimed to isolate the ELF from the lichen, Usnea longissima Ach., to control of biofilm formation and quorum sensing phenomenon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an opportunistic multidrug resistance pathogen that uses quorum sensing network to produce an array of pathogenic agents. Therefore, inhibiting quorum sensing to manage the infection caused by PAO1 could be the paramount alternative approach to conventional antibiotics. The isolated ELF was identified by amplifying the long subunit region of the fungal genome. The extracted metabolites of ELF (MELE) using the acetone solvent was further investigated for anti-quorum sensing activity using the biomarker strain Chromobacterium violaceum 12472 which exerts violacein pigment via the AHL mediated quorum sensing signalling. Moreover, the effect of MELE was also evaluated on the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1. The molecular identification revealed that ELF (accession number MN171299) exhibited 100% similarity with Aspergillus quandricinctus strain CBS 135.52. The MELE showed significant anti-quorum sensing activity at the concentration of 4 mg/mL without affecting the bacterial cell viability of P. aeruginosa PAO1. The MELE diminished the production of virulence factors, including pyocyanin, protease, elastase, rhamnolipids, and extracellular polysaccharides of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The MELE also disturbed biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1. The 3-D analysis of biofilm architecture showed that the thickness and surface area covered by microcolonies was decreased as the concentration of MELE was increased. The GC-MS analysis of MELE exhibited that organic acids and fatty acids are major constituents of the MELE.

Fluorescent microscopy as well as Congo red agar plating showed the immobilization of the bacterial cells in the lignin matrix and crystal violet dyeing showed the biofilms formation in lignin particles.

However, recent studies have linked it with cases of mastitis in cows. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a bioactive compound with pharmacological functions including antibacterial activity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ISL on S. xylosus in vitro and in vivo. The MIC of ISL against S. xylosus was 80 μg/mL. It was observed that sub-MICs of ISL (1/2MIC, 1/4MIC, 1/8MIC) significantly inhibited the formation of S. xylosus biofilm in vitro. Previous studies have observed that inhibiting imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase (IGPD) concomitantly inhibited biofilm formation in S. xylosus. So, we designed experiments to target the formation of IGPD or inhibits its activities in S. xylosus ATCC 700404. The results indicated that the activity of IGPD and its histidine content decreased significantly under 1/2 MIC (40 μg/mL) ISL, and the expression of IGPD gene (hisB) and IGPD protein was significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, Bio-layer interferometry experiments showed that ISL directly interacted with IGPD protein (with strong affinity; KD = 234 μM). In addition, molecular docking was used to predict the binding mode of ISL and IGPD. In vivo tests revealed that, ISL significantly reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels, mitigated the destruction of the mammary glands and reversed the production of inflammatory cells in mice. The results of the study suggest that, ISL may inhibit S. xylosus growth by acting on IGPD, which can be used as a target protein to treat infections caused by S. xylosus.","authors":[{"name":"Qianwei Qu"},{"name":"Jinpeng Wang"},{"name":"Wenqiang Cui"},{"name":"Yonghui Zhou"},{"name":"Xiaoxu Xing"},{"name":"Ruixiang Che"},{"name":"Xin Liu"},{"name":"Xueying Chen"},{"name":"God'spower Bello-Onaghise"},{"name":"Chunliu Dong"},{"name":"Zhengze Li"},{"name":"Xiubo Li"},{"name":"Yanhua Li"}],"keywords":[]},"article136":{"pmid":"31860439","title":"SufT is required for growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis under iron limiting conditions.","abs":"Iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters are versatile cofactors required for a range of biological processes within cells.

This study used targeted gene deletion to investigate the role of SufT in the physiology of mycobacteria, using Mycobacterium smegmatis as a model organism. Deletion of the sufT gene in M. smegmatis had no impact on growth under standard culture conditions and did not significantly alter activity of the FeS cluster dependent enzymes succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and aconitase (ACN). Furthermore, the ΔsufT mutant was no more sensitive than the wild-type strain to the redox cycler 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ), or the anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid, clofazimine or rifampicin.

Based on the quorum-sensing signalling molecules 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ) and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (PQS) from the nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, modifications have been developed with markedly enhanced anti-biofilm bioactivity towards important fungal and bacterial pathogens, including Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Here we show that antibacterial activity of HHQ against Vibrionaceae is species-specific and it requires an exquisite level of structural fidelity within the alkyl-quinolone molecular framework. Antibacterial activity was demonstrated against the serious human pathogens Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio cholerae as well as a panel of bioluminescent squid symbiont Allivibrio fischeri isolates. In contrast, Vibrio parahaemolyticus growth and biofilm formation was unaffected in the presence of HHQ and all the structural variants tested. In general, modification to almost all of the molecule except the alkyl-chain end, led to loss of activity. This suggests that the bacteriostatic activity of HHQ requires the concerted action of the entire framework components. The only exception to this pattern was deuteration of HHQ at the C3 position. HHQ modified with a terminal alkene at the quinolone alkyl chain retained bacteriostatic activity and was also found to activate PqsR signalling comparable to the native agonist.

In this study, we demonstrated that the interaction between silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and Butea monosperma seed lectin (BMSL) forms efficient surface-functionalized AgNPs with excellent antibiofilm competency against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of AgNPs and the BMSL-AgNP conjugate (BAgNP) against UPEC was 75 and 9.37 μM, respectively. The eight-fold reduction in the MBIC of AgNPs was attributed to lectin functionalization. The chemical modification of serine amino acids affects the hemagglutination activity of BMSL but not its interaction with the AgNPs. At the same time, AgNPs surface-functionalized with modified BMSL display poor antibiofilm activity. Molecular docking studies revealed that BMSL binds to galactose with a free energy of -5.72 kcal/mol, whereas the serine residue-modified BMSL showed the lowest free energy values, suggesting incompetence for binding galactose. These results showcase that the sugar binding site of BMSL aids in the adhesion of AgNPs to the biofilm matrix and disturbs the formation of the biofilm, which was confirmed by light microscopy using crystal violet staining. At 37.5 μM, BAgNPs also have the capability to eradicate preformed biofilm. As a proof of concept, UPEC biofilm prevention and eradication were demonstrated on a urinary catheter. A scanning electron microscopy study showed that BAgNPs prevent bacterial colonization and thereby curtail biofilm growth. In addition to antibiofilm activity, BAgNPs exert antibacterial activity at 18.75 μM, which is four-fold lower than the MIC of AgNPs. A mechanistic study revealed that BAgNPs affect the integrity of the bacterial outer membrane and generate an imbalance in the antioxidant defense, which induces cell death. The results highlight that lectin functionalization can be extended to other nanoparticles and different antibiotics to enhance their efficacy against drug-resistant bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Siva Bala Subramaniyan"},{"name":"Rajendran Senthilnathan"},{"name":"Jothi Arunachalam"},{"name":"Veerappan Anbazhagan"}],"keywords":[]},"article139":{"pmid":"31859706","title":"Anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory effect of a herbal nanoparticle mouthwash: a randomized crossover trial.","abs":"Laboratory evidence has demonstrated the antimicrobial effect of Melaleuca alternifolia (MEL) against oral microorganisms.

Chronic S. epidermidis infections are often recalcitrant to traditional therapies due to antibiotic resistance and formation of robust biofilms. The accessory gene regulator (agr) QS system plays an important role in biofilm formation in this opportunistic pathogen, and the binding of an autoinducing peptide (AIP) signal to its cognate transmembrane receptor (AgrC) is responsible for controlling agr. Small molecules or peptides capable of modulating this binding event are of significant interest as probes to investigate both the agr system and QS as a potential antivirulence target. We used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the structures of the three native S. epidermidis AIP signals and five non-native analogs with distinct activity profiles in the AgrC-I receptor from S. epidermidis. These studies revealed a suite of structural motifs critical for ligand activity. Interestingly, a unique β-turn was present in the macrocycles of the two most potent AgrC-I modulators, in both an agonist and an antagonist, which was distinct from the macrocycle conformation in the less-potent AgrC-I modulators and in the native AIP-I itself. This previously unknown β-turn provides a structural rationale for these ligands' respective biological activity profiles. Development of analogs to reinforce the β-turn resulted in our first antagonist with subnanomolar potency in AgrC-I, while analogs designed to contain a disrupted β-turn were dramatically less potent relative to their parent compounds. Collectively, these studies provide new insights into the AIP:AgrC interactions crucial for QS activation in S. epidermidis and advance the understanding of QS at the molecular level.","authors":[{"name":"Joseph K Vasquez"},{"name":"Korbin H J West"},{"name":"Tian Yang"},{"name":"Thomas J Polaske"},{"name":"Gabriel Cornilescu"},{"name":"Marco Tonelli"},{"name":"Helen E Blackwell"}],"keywords":[]},"article141":{"pmid":"31859287","title":"Effect of Silver Fluoride in Preventing the Formation of Artificial Dentinal Caries Lesions in vitro.","abs":"To investigate the effect of silver fluoride in preventing the development of artificial caries lesions in root dentine using an artificial mouth system (AMS).","authors":[{"name":"Bao Ying Liu"},{"name":"Lei Mei"},{"name":"Chun Hung Chu"},{"name":"Edward Chin Man Lo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"artificial mouth system"},{"word":"dental biofilm"},{"word":"dentine caries lesion"},{"word":"prevention"},{"word":"silver fluoride"}]},"article142":{"pmid":"31858707","title":"The role of rhizodeposits in shaping rhizomicrobiome.","abs":"Rhizomicrobiome, the communities of microorganisms surrounding the root of the plant, plays a vital role in promoting plant growth and health.

Bacteroides fragilis is one of the least abundant Bacteroides species, yet is the most common anaerobe isolated from extraintestinal infections in humans. A subset of B. fragilis strains carry a genetic element that encodes a metalloprotease enterotoxin named Bacteroides fragilis toxin, or BFT. Toxin-bearing strains, or Enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) cause acute and chronic intestinal disease in children and adults. Despite this association with disease, around twenty percent of the human population appear to be asymptomatic carriers of ETBF. BFT damages the colonic epithelial barrier by inducing cleavage of the zonula adherens protein E-cadherin and initiating a cell signaling response characterized by inflammation and c-Myc-dependent pro-oncogenic hyperproliferation. As a consequence, mice harboring genetic mutations that predispose to colonic inflammation or tumor formation are uniquely susceptible to toxin-mediated injury. The recent observation of ETBF-bearing biofilms in colon biopsies from humans with colon cancer susceptibility loci strongly suggests that ETBF is a driver of colorectal cancer.

In addition to confirming the findings from previous studies, new putative pathogens and novel genes that have not previously been associated with periodontitis, emerge. For example, multiple studies have reported that Synergistetes bacteria are associated with periodontitis. Genes involved in epithelial barrier defense were downregulated in periodontitis, while excessive expression of interleukin-17 was associated with a hyperinflammatory response in periodontitis and with a unique microbial community. Bioinformatics-enabled gene ontology pathway analyses provide a panoramic view of the bacterial and host activities as they shift from periodontal health to disease. Additionally, host innate factors, such as genetic variants identified by either a candidate-gene approach or genome-wide association analyses, have an impact on subgingival bacterial colonization. Transgenic mice carrying candidate genetic variants, or with the deletion of candidate genes mimicking the deleterious loss-of-function variant effect, provide experimental evidence validating the biologic relevance of the novel markers associated with the microbial phenotype identified through a statistical approach.

Subsequently, in the 1980s, host-response mechanisms were identified as the mediators of the destruction of the collagen-rich periodontal tissues (gingiva, periodontal ligament, alveolar bone), and the periodontopathogens were now regarded as the trigger of the inflammatory/collagenolytic response that characterizes actively destructive periodontitis. Also at this time a new pharmacologic strategy emerged, entitled host-modulation therapy, based on 2 major findings: (1) that the ability of tetracycline antibiotics to inhibit periodontal breakdown was due (in large part) to their previously unrecognized ability to inhibit the host-derived matrix metalloproteinases (notably, the collagenases, gelatinases, macrophage metalloelastase), and by mechanisms unrelated to the antimicrobial properties of these medications; and (2) that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as flurbiprofen, again by nonantimicrobial mechanisms, could reduce the severity of periodontitis (however, the adverse effects of long-term therapy precluded their development as safe and effective host-modulatory agents). Additional mechanistic studies resulted in the development of novel nonantimicrobial formulations (Periostat® [now generic] and Oracea®) and compositions of tetracyclines (notably chemically modified tetracycline-3) as host-modulator drugs for periodontitis, arthritis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, cancer, and, more recently, for local and systemic bone loss in postmenopausal women. Identification of the cation-binding active site in the tetraphenolic chemically modified tetracycline molecules drove the development of a new category of matrix metalloproteinase-inhibitor compounds, with a similar active site, the biphenolic chemically modified curcumins. A lead compound, chemically modified curcumin 2.24, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in vitro, in cell culture, and in vivo in mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog models of disease. In conclusion, novel host-modulation compounds have shown significant promise as adjuncts to traditional local therapy in the clinical management of periodontal disease; appear to reduce systemic complications of this all-too-common inflammatory/collagenolytic disease; and Oracea® is now commonly prescribed for inflammatory dermatologic diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Lorne M Golub"},{"name":"Hsi-Ming Lee"}],"keywords":[]},"article174":{"pmid":"31850377","title":"Brazilian Green Propolis as a Therapeutic Agent for the Post-surgical Treatment of Caseous Lymphadenitis in Sheep.","abs":"As antibiotics are ineffective when used to treat caseous lymphadenitis, the surgical excision of lesions is often required. Iodine solution (10%) is currently the choice for the post-surgical treatment; however, it may cause histotoxicity. Propolis are resinous substances composed by a mixture of different plants parts and molecules secreted by bees. As green propolis has already proven to possess anti-bacterial and wound healing properties, this study aimed to evaluate the use of a green propolis-based ointment as a therapeutic agent for the post-surgical treatment of caseous lymphadenitis. The caseous lesions of 28 sheep were surgically excised before dividing animals into two groups: (1) iodine-treated animals and (2) sheep treated with an ointment made with a previously characterized green propolis extract. Clinical data of animals, size of the scar area, the presence of moisture and secretion in the surgical wound, the humoral immune response against the bacterium and the susceptibility of C. pseudotuberculosis clinical isolates to the green propolis extract were analyzed. The green propolis-treated group presented complete healing of the surgical wound 1 week before the iodine-treated group. Additionally, animals treated with the green propolis ointment had fewer cases of wound secretion, but it was not statistically different from the iodine-treated group. No clinical signs indicating green propolis toxicity or other side effects were found, associated with a faster and more organized hair recovery by propolis use. The green propolis extract was able to inhibit the growth of 23 from the 27 C. pseudotuberculosis clinical isolates, with minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericide concentrations ranging from 01 to 08 mg/mL, and did not interfere with the humoral immune response against the bacterium. In addition, green propolis was able to inhibit biofilm formation by four of the C. pseudotuberculosis clinical isolates. We concluded that green propolis is a promising therapeutic agent to be used in the post-surgical treatment of caseous lymphadenitis in small ruminants due to its effects on surgical wound healing, hair recovery, inhibition of wound contamination and bacterial growth.","authors":[{"name":"Mauricio Alcântara Kalil"},{"name":"Laerte Marlon Santos"},{"name":"Thiago Doria Barral"},{"name":"Daniela Méria Rodrigues"},{"name":"Neila Paula Pereira"},{"name":"Maria da Conceição Aquino Sá"},{"name":"Marcelo Andres Umsza-Guez"},{"name":"Bruna Aparecida Souza Machado"},{"name":"Roberto Meyer"},{"name":"Ricardo Wagner Portela"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis"},{"word":"anti-microbials"},{"word":"natural products"},{"word":"sheep"},{"word":"wound healing"}]},"article175":{"pmid":"31850313","title":"Bacterial Biofilm Eradication Agents: A Current Review.","abs":"Most free-living bacteria can attach to surfaces and aggregate to grow into multicellular communities encased in extracellular polymeric substances called biofilms.

Based on recent tentative breakpoints by the CDC, it appears that in the USA about 90, 30, and < 5% of isolates have been resistant to fluconazole, amphotericin B, and echinocandins, respectively. To date, this has lead to a low therapeutic success. Furthermore, C. auris is prone to cause outbreaks, especially since it can persist for weeks in a nosocomial environment and survive high-end disinfection procedures. In this review, we describe the molecular resistance mechanisms to antifungal drugs identified so far in C. auris and compare them to those previously discovered in other Candida species. Additionally, we examine the role that biofilm formation plays in the reduced antifungal sensitivity of this organism. Finally, we summarize the few insights on how this yeast survives on hospital surfaces and discuss the challenge it presents regarding nosocomial environment disinfection.","authors":[{"name":"Farid Chaabane"},{"name":"Artan Graf"},{"name":"Léonard Jequier"},{"name":"Alix T Coste"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida auris"},{"word":"MIC"},{"word":"antifungal resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"emerging pathogen"},{"word":"outbreaks"}]},"article178":{"pmid":"31849912","title":"A Broad Spectrum Protein Glycosylation System Influences Type II Protein Secretion and Associated Phenotypes in Vibrio cholerae.","abs":"Protein secretion plays a crucial role for bacterial pathogens, exemplified by facultative human-pathogen Vibrio cholerae, which secretes various proteinaceous effectors at different stages of its lifecycle.

For these studies, we used our chronic wound model in diabetic mice that has similar characteristics as human chronic wounds, including naturally developed biofilm. We hypothesize that OS levels in wound tissues are critical for chronic wound initiation and development. We show that increased OS levels in the wound correlate with increased chronicity. Moreover, without increased OS levels, biofilm taken from chronic wounds and placed in new excision wounds do not create chronic wounds. Similarly, high OS levels in the wound tissue in the absence of the skin microbiome do not lead to chronic wounds. These findings show that both high OS levels and bacteria are needed for chronic wound initiation and development. In conclusion, OS levels in the wound at time of injury are critical for biofilm formation and chronic wound development and may be a good predictor of the degree of wound chronicity.

In addition, the MqsA antitoxin was shown to be a master regulator that represses the transcription of the csgD, cspD, and rpoS global regulator genes, thereby displaying a pleiotropic regulatory role. Here, we identified two promoters located in the toxin sequence driving the constitutive expression of mqsA, allowing thereby excess production of the MqsA antitoxin compared to the MqsR toxin. Our results show that both antitoxin-specific and operon promoters are not regulated by stresses such as amino acid starvation, oxidative shock, or bile salts.

Here, the effects of aquifer recharge (AR) on three levels of parameters were investigated: dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quantity and quality, global biofilm characteristics, and diversity changes of bacterial communities. As DOC enrichment by AR can be mitigated by vadose zone (VZ) thickness, three AR sites with thin VZ (< 3 m) and three sites with thick VZ (> 10 m) were selected. For each AR site, clay beads were incubated over a 10-day-long rainy period through wells in recharged and non-recharged groundwaters. Total proteins, dehydrogenase, and hydrolytic activities were monitored from clay beads to assess biofilm development. Bacterial richness on beads was estimated by 16S rRNA-based metabarcoding. AR was found to significantly increase DOC and biodegradable DOC (BDOC) concentrations, biofilm development, and bacterial richness especially in sites with thin VZ. VZ thickness was inversely related to microbial growth indicators and bacterial richness in groundwater, through a control of DOC availability. The proportion of Bacteroidetes 16S rRNA gene reads was higher in recharged groundwater than in non-recharged groundwater, suggesting that this phylum could be used as an indicator of DOC enrichment associated with AR. Quantitative PCR assays for Bacteroides DNA confirmed these trends and showed an enrichment of this bacterial group in DOC-rich aquifer waters. The positive linear relationships between BDOC concentrations and biofilm variables highlighted a strong C-limitation of groundwater impacting bacterial species sorting and activity.","authors":[{"name":"Jérémy Voisin"},{"name":"Benoit Cournoyer"},{"name":"Laurence Marjolet"},{"name":"Antonin Vienney"},{"name":"Florian Mermillod-Blondin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aquifer 16S rRNA metabarcoding profiling"},{"word":"Clay bead biofilms bacterial communities"},{"word":"Nutrient-driven diversity changes"},{"word":"Stormwater infiltration"},{"word":"Vadose zone thickness"}]},"article226":{"pmid":"31838458","title":"Electron donor availability controls scale up of anodic biofilms.","abs":"The scale up of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) is a challenging problem that limits the advancement and practical implementation of the technology.

The biomass granulation process, however, is significantly affected by the micro-environment surrounding these biomass aggregates. In this research, an in silico computational approach was adopted to study the impact of the micro-environment on the biomass granulation process. A 2-D biofilm model based on the cellular automata algorithm and computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate the development of an individual biomass aggregate under specific hydrodynamic and substrate availability conditions. The simulation results indicated that shear and bulk substrate concentration combined to create the optimal conditions for aerobic granule formation. This process can be characterized by the RT (reversed Thiele) modulus value, which is the ratio of the maximum substrate transport over the maximum substrate reaction rate and an indicator of substrate availability. For AGS formation, the RT value should be greater than 0.1. Many common strategies, such as the application of batch reactors, selection for slow-growing microorganism, F/M (food/mass) ratio adjustment, feast and famine condition, and short settling time, for biomass granulation production can be explained by the RT value.

Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) plays a central role in controlling this transition and regulating biofilm formation via various effectors. As an effector of c-di-GMP in Escherichia coli and related species, the PilZ domain-containing protein YcgR responds to elevated c-di-GMP concentrations and acts on the flagellar motor to suppress bacterial motility in a brakelike fashion, which promotes bacterial surface attachment. To date, several target proteins within the motor, MotA, FliG, and FliM, along with different regulatory mechanisms have been reported. However, how YcgR acts on these components remains unclear. Here, we report that activated YcgR stably binds to MotA at the MotA-FliG interface and thereby regulates bacterial swimming. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that c-di-GMP rearranges the PilZ domain configuration, resulting in the formation of a MotA-binding patch consisting of an RXXXR motif and the C-tail helix α3. Moreover, we noted that a conserved region in the YcgR-N domain, which is independent of MotA interaction, is necessary for motility regulation. On the basis of these findings, we infer that the YcgR-N domain is required for activity on other motor proteins. We propose that activated YcgR appends to MotA via its PilZ domain and thereby interrupts the MotA-FliG interaction and simultaneously interacts with other motor proteins via its YcgR-N domain to inhibit flagellar motility. Our findings suggest that the mode of interaction between YcgR and motor proteins may be shared by other PilZ family proteins.","authors":[{"name":"Yan-Jie Hou"},{"name":"Wen-Si Yang"},{"name":"Yuan Hong"},{"name":"Ying Zhang"},{"name":"Da-Cheng Wang"},{"name":"De-Feng Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MotA"},{"word":"PilZ domain"},{"word":"biofilm regulation"},{"word":"cell signaling"},{"word":"crystal structure"},{"word":"cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP)"},{"word":"flagellar motility"},{"word":"molecular motor"},{"word":"multiple targets"},{"word":"second messenger"},{"word":"structure-function"}]},"article239":{"pmid":"31835971","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus communication in biofilm infections: insights through network and database construction.","abs":"The polymicrobial nature of most infections is often characterized by complex biofilm communities, where pathogen interactions promote infection progression and severity.

The lipid A of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be hydroxylated in both secondary acyl chains, but the genetic basis and physiological role of these hydroxylations are still unknown. Through the generation of single and double deletion mutants in the lpxO1 and lpxO2 homologs of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and lipid A analysis by mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that both LpxO1 and LpxO2 are responsible for lipid A hydroxylation, likely acting on different secondary acyl chains.

Our results showed that all Cryptococcus spp. isolates were able to produce capsule and biofilms, and were virulent using G. mellonella model. The VRC has inhibitory activity on planktonic cells with MIC values ranging from 0.03 to 0.25 μg/mL on Cryptococcus spp.; and these isolates were more tolerant to fluconazole (ranging from 0.25 to 16 μg/mL), the triazol agent often recommended alone or in combination with amphotericin B in the cryptococcosis therapy. In contrast, mature biofilms were less susceptible to the VRC treatment. The VRC (10 or 20 mg/kg) treatment of infected G. mellonella larvae significantly increased the larval survival when compared to the untreated group for the both Cryptococcus species and significantly decreased the fungal burden and dissemination in the larval tissue.

To test the sensitivity of AC, aggregates of the same strains were treated with nitric oxide (NO), a dispersal agent that reduces the biomass of surface attached biofilms. Strains unresponsive to NO were reflected by comparable AC indexes, while those undergoing dispersal showed a significant reduction in AC index, mirroring the changes in average aggregate sizes and proportions.

A common lifestyle choice that bacteria make is whether to exhibit individual behavior and exist in the free-living planktonic state or to engage in collective behavior and form sessile communities called biofilms. Transitions between individual and collective behaviors are controlled by the chemical cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing. Here, we show that quorum sensing represses Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation and virulence by activating expression of genes encoding the KinB-AlgB two-component system (TCS). Phospho-AlgB represses biofilm and virulence genes, while KinB dephosphorylates and thereby inactivates AlgB. We discover that the photoreceptor BphP is the kinase that, in response to light, phosphorylates and activates AlgB. Indeed, exposing P. aeruginosa to light represses biofilm formation and virulence gene expression. To our knowledge, P. aeruginosa was not previously known to detect and respond to light. The KinB-AlgB-BphP module is present in all pseudomonads, and we demonstrate that AlgB is the partner response regulator for BphP in diverse bacterial phyla. We propose that in the KinB-AlgB-BphP system, AlgB functions as the node at which varied sensory information is integrated. This network architecture provides a mechanism enabling bacteria to integrate at least two different sensory inputs, quorum sensing (via RhlR-driven activation of algB) and light (via BphP-AlgB), into the control of collective behaviors.

NUFEB is fully parallelised and allows for the simulation of large numbers of microbes (107 individuals and beyond). The parallelisation is based on a domain decomposition scheme that divides the domain into multiple sub-domains which are distributed to different processors. NUFEB also offers a collection of post-processing routines for the visualisation and analysis of simulation output. In this article, we give an overview of NUFEB's functionalities and implementation details. We provide examples that illustrate the type of microbial systems NUFEB can be used to model and simulate.","authors":[{"name":"Bowen Li"},{"name":"Denis Taniguchi"},{"name":"Jayathilake Pahala Gedara"},{"name":"Valentina Gogulancea"},{"name":"Rebeca Gonzalez-Cabaleiro"},{"name":"Jinju Chen"},{"name":"Andrew Stephen McGough"},{"name":"Irina Dana Ofiteru"},{"name":"Thomas P Curtis"},{"name":"Paolo Zuliani"}],"keywords":[]},"article273":{"pmid":"31829617","title":"Self-Assemblies Based on Traditional Medicine Berberine and Cinnamic Acid for Adhesion-Induced Inhibition Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"S. aureus is resistant to various first-line antibiotics, and seeking multifarious strategies aimed at effective control of antibiotic-resistant behavior is urgently needed. Here, we report a two-component directed self-assembly mode: the phytochemicals berberine and cinnamic acid can directly self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) displaying good bacteriostastic activity. Compared with several first-line antibiotics, the obtained nanostructures have a better inhibitory effect on multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and stronger ability for biofilm removal. These qualities are attributed to the fact that organic assemblies can first spontaneously adhere to the surface of the bacteria, infiltrate into the cell, and then lead to converging attack against MRSA; thereafter, multipath bactericidal mechanisms of NPs on MRSA are found by both transcriptomic analysis and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis. Moreover, when combined with spectral data and single crystal X-ray diffraction, the NPs' self-assembly mechanism governed by hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions is clearly elucidated. These non-covalent interactions induce the NPs' formation of butterfly-like one-dimensional self-assembled units and finally layered three-dimensional spatial configuration. In addition, biocompatibility tests show that the NPs are nonhemolytic with little toxicity in vitro and in vivo. This directed self-assembly mode can offer a new perspective toward the design of biocompatible antimicrobial nanomedicines for clinical translation.","authors":[{"name":"Xuemei Huang"},{"name":"Penglong Wang"},{"name":"Tong Li"},{"name":"Xuehao Tian"},{"name":"Wenbo Guo"},{"name":"Bing Xu"},{"name":"Guangrui Huang"},{"name":"Desheng Cai"},{"name":"Fei Zhou"},{"name":"Hao Zhang"},{"name":"Haimin Lei"}],"keywords":[{"word":"berberine"},{"word":"multidrug-resistant S. aureus"},{"word":"phytochemicals"},{"word":"self-assemblies"},{"word":"single crystal X-ray diffraction"}]},"article274":{"pmid":"31828715","title":"Genotypic and phenotypic changes of Staphylococcus epidermidis during relapse episodes in prosthetic joint infections.","abs":"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a coagulase-negative bacterium capable of causing recurrent relapses in prosthetic joint infection (PJI).

Four patients with PJI recurrent relapses were evaluated clinically and microbiologically. Genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of 31 S. epidermidis isolates were determined. In all cases, PJI was treated with antimicrobial therapy and resection of the prosthesis without reimplantation. Months later, all patients had a relapse episode and treated with rifampin plus vancomycin and surgical debridement. Changes in the antibiotics resistance profile in isolates from patients 1 and 2 were observed in the two episodes. Patient 1 had four clones A, B, C, and D that were distributed differentially in the two episodes. Similarly, patients 2 and 3 had two clones and subclones (E-E1 and F-F1, respectively), and patient 4 had only the clone G in both episodes. The clone F formed small-colony variants (SCVs). High level of biofilm formation was found in all clones, except for clones D and G. Clones/subclones showed a genotypic variation in icaA, sdrF, bap, sesI, and embp genes.

Specifically, LfQi6 biofilms demonstrated improved in vitro performance versus LfQi6 planktonic cultures for host gastrointestinal survival and engraftment, strain-specific antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity against clinically significant pathogens, concurrent promotion of beneficial gastrointestinal commensal biofilms, beneficial commensal enzyme activities, and host cellular-protective glutathione antioxidant activity.

In summary, in vitro evaluation of Lact. fermentum LfQi6 demonstrates significant evidence for strain-specific probiotic characteristics and safety. Moreover, strain-specific as well as biofilm-phenotype-specific benefits demonstrated in vitro furthermore suggest that in vivo use of LfQi6 biofilm biomass may be of greater benefit to the human host than the use of standard planktonic cultures.

In this study, we compared the resistance of C. albicans strains with different CSH to the most commonly prescribed antifungal drug, fluconazole, and the newly described synergistic combination, fluconazole and gentamicin. The hydrophobic strain was more resistant to fluconazole due to, among others, overexpression of the ERG11 gene encoding the fluconazole target protein (CYP51A1, Erg11p), which leads to overproduction of ergosterol in this strain. Additionally, the hydrophobic strain displayed high efflux activity of the multidrug resistance Cdr1 pump due to high expression of the CDR1 gene. On the other hand, the hydrophobic C. albicans strain was more susceptible to fluconazole-gentamicin combination because of its different effect on lipid content in the two strains. The combination resulted in ergosterol depletion with subsequent Cdr1p mislocalization and loss of activity in the hydrophobic strain.

Combination therapy involving current antibiotics and other biological or chemical molecules represents an attractive novel strategy. In this study, we investigated the synergistic antibacterial activity of a series of Trp-containing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with four classes of traditional chemical antibiotics that are inactive against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in vitro and in vivo. Among the antibiotics that we studied, penicillin, ampicillin and erythromycin showed a distinct synergistic effect in combination with all of the Trp-containing AMPs, represented by a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of <0.5. The antibacterial activities were noticeably improved, with 32-to 64-fold reductions in the MIC values for ampicillin and 16- to 32-fold reductions in the MIC values for erythromycin and penicillin. Tetracycline showed synergistic activity with only I1WL5W but additive activity with L11W, L12W, and I4WL5W. Ceftazidime exhibited additive activity with the Trp-containing peptides. In addition, the antibiotics in combination with the peptide significantly inhibited biofilm formation by MRSE 1208. A mechanistic study demonstrated that the Trp-containing peptides, especially I1WL5W and I4WL5W, which contain two tryptophan residues, disrupted bacterial inner and outer membranes, which promoted antibiotic delivery into the cytoplasm and access to cytoplasmic targets; however, L11W and L12W may have increased intracellular antibiotic concentrations by decreasing blaZ, tet(m) and msrA expression. Importantly, strong synergistic activity against the MRSE 1208 strain was observed for the combination of I1WL5W and penicillin in a mouse infection model. Thus, the combination of AMPs and traditional antibiotics could be a promising option for the prevention of acute and chronic infections caused by MRSE.","authors":[{"name":"Dejing Shang"},{"name":"Yue Liu"},{"name":"Fengquan Jiang"},{"name":"Fangyu Ji"},{"name":"He Wang"},{"name":"Xue Han"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Trp-containing peptide"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"membrane"},{"word":"synergism"}]},"article285":{"pmid":"31824466","title":"Biofilm Formation of Listeria monocytogenes Strains Under Food Processing Environments and Pan-Genome-Wide Association Study.","abs":"Concerns about food contamination by Listeria monocytogenes are on the rise with increasing consumption of ready-to-eat foods.

Distinct extrinsic factors affected specific steps of biofilm formation. Sudden nutrient deprivation enhanced cellular adhesion while a prolonged nutrient deficiency impeded biofilm maturation. Salt addition increased biofilm production, moreover, nutrient limitation supplemented by salt significantly stimulated biofilm formation.

Here, we report that ASvicR overexpression significantly impeded bacterial growth, biofilm exopolysaccharide synthesis, and cariogenicity in vivo. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the ASvicR RNA mainly regulated carbohydrate metabolism. In particular, overproducing ASvicR demonstrated a reduction in galactose and glucose metabolism by monosaccharide composition analysis. The results of high-performance gel permeation chromatography revealed that the water-insoluble glucans isolated from ASvicR presented much lower molecular weights. Furthermore, direct evidence showed that total RNAs were disrupted by rnc-encoded RNase III.

Furthermore, ASvicR regulation revealed a sponge regulatory-mediated network for msRNA associated with adjacent RNase III-encoding genes. There was an increase in ASvicR transcript levels in clinical S. mutans strains from caries-free children, while the expression of ASvicR was decreased in early childhood caries patients; this outcome may be explored as a potential strategy contributing to the management of dental caries. Taken together, our findings suggest an important role of ASvicR-mediated sponge regulation in S. mutans, indicating the characterization of lactose metabolism by a vital response regulator in cariogenicity. These findings have a number of implications and have reshaped our understanding of bacterial gene regulation from its transcriptional conception to the key roles of regulatory RNAs.","authors":[{"name":"L Lei"},{"name":"B Zhang"},{"name":"M Mao"},{"name":"H Chen"},{"name":"S Wu"},{"name":"Y Deng"},{"name":"Y Yang"},{"name":"H Zhou"},{"name":"T Hu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"noncoding RNA"},{"word":"polysaccharides"},{"word":"regulation"}]},"article293":{"pmid":"31820066","title":"Streptomycin mediated biofilm inhibition and suppression of virulence properties in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known as an opportunistic pathogen whose one of the antibiotic resistance mechanisms includes biofilm formation and virulence factor production.

The undulatory surface waves of the dynamic composite induce local and global vortices near the material surface and thereby sweep away foulants from the surface, fundamentally inhibiting their initial attachment.

Therefore, the availability of safe, pathogen-free drinking water is vital to public health. This need has resulted in global initiatives to develop sustainable urban water infrastructure for the treatment of wastewater for different purposes such as reuse water for irrigation, and advanced waste water purification systems for domestic water supply. In developed countries, most of the water goes through primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments combined with disinfectant, microfiltration (MF), reverse osmosis (RO), etc. to produce potable water. During this process the total bacterial load of the water at different stages of the treatment will decrease significantly from the source water. Microbial diversity and load may decrease by several orders of magnitude after microfiltration and reverse osmosis treatment and falling to almost non-detectable levels in some of the most managed wastewater treatment facilities. However, one thing in common with the different end users is that the water goes through massive distribution systems, and the pipes in the distribution lines may be contaminated with diverse microbes that inhabit these systems. In the main distribution lines, microbes survive within biofilms which may contain opportunistic pathogens. This review highlights the role of microbial community composition in the final effluent treated wastewater, biofilms formation in the distribution systems as the treated water goes through, and the subsequent health effects from potential pathogens associated with poorly treated water. We conclude by pointing out some basic steps that may be taken to reduce the accumulation of biofilms in the water distribution systems.","authors":[{"name":"Abasiofiok Mark Ibekwe"},{"name":"Shelton E Murinda"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"drinking water"},{"word":"pathogen"},{"word":"public health"},{"word":"water distribution systems"}]},"article306":{"pmid":"31817588","title":"Antibiotic Susceptibility Patterns of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis Strains from Different Decades.","abs":"The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of 57 Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 56 Porphyromonas gingivalis strains isolated from subgingival biofilm samples of periodontitis patients in Switzerland from 1980 to 2017.

Local bone infections were treated with antibiotics directly or by controlled drug-releasing scaffolds, like polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spheres, which have to be removed at a later stage, but there is a risk of a bacterial contamination during the removement. Therefore, biomaterials loaded with antibiotics for controlled release could be the method of choice: The biomaterials degrade during the drug release, therefore, there is no need for a second surgery to remove the drug eluting agent. Even non-resorbable bone materials are available (e.g., hydroxyapatite (HA)) or resorbable bone graft materials (e.g., beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP)) that will be replaced by newly formed bone. Composite materials with organic additives (e.g., collagen) supports the handling during surgery and enhances the drug loading capacity, as well as the drug releasing time. The purpose of this study was to investigate the loading capacity and the release rate of Vancomycin and Gentamicin on TCP and HA granules in the shape of a degradable scaffold compared to composite materials from TCP mixed with porcine collagen. Its antibacterial efficacy to a more elementary drug with eluting in aqueous solution was examined. The loading capacity of the biomaterials was measured and compared according to the Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) of a bacterial biofilm after 24 h aging. Antibiotic elution and concentration of gentamycin and vancomycin, as well as inhibition zones, were measured by using the Quantitative Microparticle Systems (QMS) immunoassays. The antibiotic concentration was determined by the automated Beckman Coulter (BC) chemistry device. For examination of the antibacterial activity, inhibition zone diameters were measured. Generally, the antibiotic release is more pronounced during the first couple of days than later. Both TCP granules and HA granules experienced a significantly decline of antibiotics release during the first three days. After the fourth day and beyond, the antibiotic release was below the detection threshold. The antibiotic release of the composite material TCP and porcine collagen declined less drastically and was still in the frame of the specification during the first nine days. There was no significant evidence of interaction effect between antibiotic and material, i.e., the fitted lines for Gentamycin and Vancomycin are almost parallel.

The best performing sanitizer across all three pathogens was a combination of modified QAC, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetin which resulted in ~6-7 log reduction, reaching levels below our limit of detection (LOD) within 1-2.5 min. All treatments were performed in triplicate replication and analyzed by one way repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) to determine significant differences (p < 0.05) in the response to sanitizer treatment over time.

Biofilm formation is initiated by bacterial adhesion to the surface. In this work, the ability of R. equi to adhere to the surface of human lung epithelial cells was detected by a fluorometric adhesion test performed on 40 clinical isolates. Subsequently, the capability of R. equi to produce biofilm was investigated by colorimetric, fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy analysis, revealing a general slow growth of rhodococcal biofilm and different sessile phenotypes among field isolates, some also including filamented bacteria. Azithromycin treatment produced a higher long-term inhibition and dissolution of R. equi biofilms than rifampicin, while the two antibiotics combined boosted the anti-biofilm effect in a statistically significant manner, although this was not equally effective for all R. equi isolates. Increasing the MIC concentrations of drugs tenfold alone and in combination did not completely eradicate pre-formed R. equi biofilms, while a rifampicin-resistant isolate produced an exceptionally abundant extracellular matrix.

However, the peri-implant soft tissue complex lacks Sharpey's fibers, thus offering less resistance to clinical probing and biofilm penetration compared to the natural dentition. Therefore, the proper restorative emergence profile design is essential to facilitate favorable esthetic outcomes and maintain peri-implant health. The aim of this article is to review the currently available evidence related to the design of subgingival (critical and subcritical) and supragingival contours of the implant restorative emergence profile (IREP) as well as provide a flowchart for decision-making in clinical practice. Theoretically, the subgingival contours of the crown/abutment complex should mimic the morphology of the root and the cervical third of the anatomic crown as much and as often as possible. However, this is highly dependent upon the three-dimensional spatial position of the implant relative to the hard and soft tissue complex, in addition to the location of the definitive restoration. Frequently, a convex critical contour is required on the facial aspect of a palatally or incisally positioned implant to support an adequate gingival-margin architecture. Conversely, if the implant is placed too far facially, then a flat or concave contour is recommended. In instances where soft tissue support is not needed, the subcritical area may be undercontoured to increase the thickness, height, and stability of the soft tissue cuff.","authors":[{"name":"Stephen J Chu"},{"name":"Joseph Yk Kan"},{"name":"Ernesto A Lee"},{"name":"Guo-Hao Lin"},{"name":"Leila Jahangiri"},{"name":"Myron Nevins"},{"name":"Hom-Lay Wang"}],"keywords":[]},"article323":{"pmid":"31815139","title":"Efficacy of Artesunate against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Mediated by Iron.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of causing a variety of chronic infections due to the formation of biofilms.

Bacterial strains that express β-lactamases have been found to detoxify liquid cultures and thus to protect genetically susceptible strains, constituting a clear laboratory example of social protection. These results are not necessarily general; on solid media, for instance, the rapid bactericidal action of β-lactams largely prevents social protection. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the greater tolerance of biofilm bacteria for β-lactams would facilitate social interactions. We used a recently isolated E. coli strain, capable of strong biofilm formation, to compare how cooperation and exploitation in colony biofilms and broth culture drives the dynamics of a non-conjugative plasmid encoding a clinically important β-lactamase. Susceptible cells in biofilms were tolerant of ampicillin-high doses and several days of exposure were required to kill them. In support of our hypothesis, we found robust social protection of susceptible E. coli in biofilms, despite fine-scale physical separation of resistant and susceptible cells and lower rates of production of extracellular β-lactamase. In contrast, social interactions in broth were restricted to a relatively narrow range of ampicillin doses. Our results show that β-lactam selection pressure on Gram-negative biofilms leads to cooperative resistance characterized by a low equilibrium frequency of resistance plasmids, sufficient to protect all cells.","authors":[{"name":"Elli Amanatidou"},{"name":"Andrew C Matthews"},{"name":"Ute Kuhlicke"},{"name":"Thomas R Neu"},{"name":"James P McEvoy"},{"name":"Ben Raymond"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobials"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Evolution"},{"word":"Pathogens"}]},"article325":{"pmid":"31814741","title":"Combined Effects Of Low Incubation Temperature, Minimal Growth Medium, And Low Hydrodynamics Optimize Acinetobacter baumannii Biofilm Formation.","abs":"Biofilm formation is an important virulence factor expressed by Acinetobacter baumannii.

The known structure and functions of biofilm indicate that it is one of the most widespread and most successful life forms on earth. The quorum sensing (QS) system plays a key role in biofilm because it is a mechanism by which bacteria regulate the gene expression profile according to the size of the microbial population, causing the formation of different forms of biofilm. The QS includes the auto-inducer-1 (AI- 1) system, which uses N-acyl-homoserine lactones as a signaling factor in the formation of biofilm by Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the auto-inducer-2 (AI-2) system identified as furanosyl borate diester present in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) have a natural antibacterial effect, which are produced by eukaryocytes and prokaryocytes, and have the ability to form pores in the bacterial cell membrane or interfere with its function. On the other hand, biofilm degrading enzymes - DNase I, alpha-amylase and dispersin B - reduce the weight of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and the number of cells in the biofilm. Natural compounds that inhibit the formation of bacterial biofilm have been distinguished, so-called QS inhibitors (QSI) and which quench active process (QSQ). In turn, genetic diversification of microorganisms in biofilm is largely responsible for shaping antibiotic resistance. The combined use of antibiotics with nanoparticles seems to be the most promising therapeutic option for bacterial biofilm. Silver nanoparticles with citrate in combination with aztreonam have been shown to have significant biofilm-destroying efficacy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and selenium nanoparticles used together with ampicillin, oxacillin and penicillin in 94% inhibited and interrupted the MRSA (methicillin-resistent) biofilm.

The molecular weight of chitosan modulated its effect on the planktonic form of S. brasiliensis, presenting lower MIC values for LMW chitosan. With regards both the adhesive and mature phases of biofilm, the LMW chitosan reduced biomass and metabolic activity most effectively. This study confirms the effects of the molecular weight and deacetylation degree of chitosan on its antifungal properties for potentially pathogenic fungi.","authors":[{"name":"Lana Glerieide Silva Garcia"},{"name":"Glaucia Morgana de Melo Guedes"},{"name":"Xhaulla Maria Quariguasi Cunha Fonseca"},{"name":"Waldemiro Aquino Pereira-Neto"},{"name":"Débora Souza Collares Maia Castelo-Branco"},{"name":"José Júlio Costa Sidrim"},{"name":"Rossana de Aguiar Cordeiro"},{"name":"Marcos Fábio Gadelha Rocha"},{"name":"Rodrigo Silveira Vieira"},{"name":"Raimunda Sâmia Nogueira Brilhante"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Chitosan"},{"word":"Sporothrix brasiliensis"}]},"article338":{"pmid":"31812702","title":"Two phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the efficacy and safety of Astodrimer 1% Gel for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.","abs":"Astodrimer is a dendrimer formulated in a vaginal gel to treat bacterial vaginosis (BV) and prevent recurrence.

The study assessed performance at a range of sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations of 0.6, 14 and 20 g/L. Biofilm coverage rate decreased significantly with increasing NaCl concentrations. High NaCl concentrations resulted in more compact and smoother biofilm morphologies. NaCl concentrations affected bacterial community variation at the class and genus level, with Gammaproteobacteria being the most dominant Proteobacteria, exhibiting NaCl tolerance at concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 g/L. Also, NaCl sensitive or tolerant species were identified, such as Pseudomonas and Planococcus, respectively. Dominant metabolites in wastewater treatment biofilms belonging to nucleotide, lipid, vitamin, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations. High concentrations of NaCl regulated cell motility, transcription and membrane transport functions. In particular, the activity of ABC transporters were up-regulated at NaCl concentrations of 0.6 g/L and down-regulated at higher salinity concentrations. In addition, transcription machinery were inhibited under the stress of 14 g/L NaCl.

Bacterial colonization is predicted to be prevented by alkaline magnesium surfaces. However, in experimental animal studies, magnesium implants prolonged infections. The reason for this peculiarity likely lies within the ‒still largely hypothetical‒ mechanism by which infection arises. Investigating subcutaneous magnesium implants infected with bioluminescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa via in vivo imaging, we found that the rate of implant infections was critically dependent on a surprisingly high quantity of injected bacteria. At high inocula, bacteria were antibiotic-refractory immediately after infection. High cell densities are known to limit nutrient availability, restricting proliferation and trigger quorum sensing which could both contribute to the rapid initial resistance. We propose that gas bubbles such as those formed during magnesium corrosion, can then act as interfaces that support biofilm formation and permit long-term survival. This model could provide an explanation for the apparent ineffectiveness of innovative contact-dependent bactericidal implant surfaces in patients. In addition, the model points toward air bubbles in tissue, either by inclusion during surgery or by spontaneous gas bubble formation later on, could constitute a key risk factor for clinical implant infections.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Imran Rahim"},{"name":"Szymon P Szafrański"},{"name":"Alexandra Ingendoh-Tsakmakidis"},{"name":"Meike Stiesch"},{"name":"Peter P Mueller"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Animal model"},{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"Bioluminescence"},{"word":"Gas interfaces"},{"word":"Magnesium alloy implant"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"in vivo imaging"}]},"article343":{"pmid":"31812063","title":"The haloacetic acid leap in effluent of a biologically active carbon filter experiencing a disinfectant switch.","abs":"Water utilities must disinfect their water despite the formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) such as haloacetic acids (HAAs) upon chlorination.

We also examined pathological changes in organ paraffin sections by challenging chicks with the strains. After loss of tolC, the chick symptoms of pericarditis and liver and spleen enlargement were alleviated, and pathogenicity to the host cells was decreased. Additionally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that tolC deletion downregulated secA/secB/secE/secY transcript levels, which are part of the T2SS secreting virulence effector element.

Due to its use as a solvent, wetting agent, and stabilizer for chlorinated solvents employed in metal vapor degreasing, 1,4-dioxane has often been found to occur with a variety of co-contaminants, including heavy metals such as hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)]. Cr(VI) also occurs naturally in groundwater due to geological formations, but also has sources that can coincide with 1,4-dioxane from anthropogenic activities such as metal vapor degreasing. Biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane can be accomplished by microbes that use it as a source of carbon or energy as well as those that cometabolize it after growth on other organic substrates. A propanotroph, Mycobacterium austroafricanum JOB5, was grown in planktonic pure cultures and biofilms to determine its ability to cometabolize 1,4-dioxane in the presence of varying concentrations of Cr(VI). 1,4-Dioxane cometabolism by JOB5 planktonic cells was uninhibited by Cr(VI) at levels up to 10 mg/L, while biofilms were only mildly inhibited at 10 mg/L. As an important part of the biofilms commonly found in subsurface aquifers and engineered systems, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were found to play an important role in preventing Cr(VI) exposure to cells. We observed that soluble EPS were able to bind to Cr(VI) and theorize that biofilm-associated EPS additionally served to impede penetration of the biofilm structure by Cr(VI), thus mitigating exposure and toxicity.

One promising method of disrupting biofilm formation and growth is to employ passive surface structures to inhibit bacterial adhesion and aggregation. However, most studies thus far have mainly focused on the early stages of biofilm formation and it is unclear if the influence of surface topography in the early phase will propagate to later stages. Here, we attempt to address this with an investigation into the biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on 25 different nanograting geometries, with dimensions that were systematically varied from subcellular to cellular sizes. The biofilms were characterized from the exponential growth phase to the decline phase, in intervals of 24 H over 4 days, using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Comparing the maximum volume of biofilm formed on each surface over 96 H, it was found that approximately 1/3 of the nanograting geometries exhibited 72 ± 16 % lower biovolume density than a flat surface. Bacteria on these nanogratings were also observed to form 40 ± 11 % smaller microcolonies that were 17 ± 6 % less compact than that found on the control surface. The majority of these nanogratings had deep trenches (i.e. depth ≥ 70% of the cell diameter). Furthermore, P. aeruginosa cells were observed to multiply at approximately twice the rate on almost all the nanogratings compared to flat surfaces, but these cell populations also began to decline 24 H earlier than those on a flat surface. Using available literature on P. aeruginosa, a qualitative model was put forth, attributing the results to increased cell motility, decreased exopolysaccharide formation and disrupted psl adhesin/ signal trails on nanogratings. These factors, together, led to the net effects of reduced attachment, increased scattering of cells and rapid decline of the biofilms on nanogratings.

To clarify the role of nanofibrils in filament formation in L. cholodnii SP-6, we analyze the behavior of individual cells and multicellular filaments in high-aspect ratio microfluidic chambers using time-lapse and intermittent in situ fluorescent staining of nanofibrils, complemented with atmospheric scanning electron microscopy. We show that in SP-6 nanofibrils are important for attachment and their distribution on young filaments post-attachment is correlated to the directionality of filament elongation. Elongating filaments demonstrate a surprising ability to adapt to their physical environment by changing direction when they encounter obstacles: they bend or reverse direction depending on the angle of the collision. We show that the forces involved in the collision can be used to predict the behavior of filament. Finally, we show that as filaments grow in length, the older region becomes confined by the sheath, while the newly secreted nanofibrils at the leading edge of the filament form a loose, divergent, structure from which cells periodically escape.","authors":[{"name":"Tatsuki Kunoh"},{"name":"Kana Morinaga"},{"name":"Shinya Sugimoto"},{"name":"Shun Miyazaki"},{"name":"Masanori Toyofuku"},{"name":"Kenji Iwasaki"},{"name":"Nobuhiko Nomura"},{"name":"Andrew S Utada"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Leptothrix"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"filamentous bacterium"},{"word":"nanofibrils"},{"word":"two-dimensional microfluidics"}]},"article384":{"pmid":"31804792","title":"Ultrasmall TPGS-PLGA Hybrid Nanoparticles for Site-Specific Delivery of Antibiotics into Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms in Lungs.","abs":"Inhaled antibiotic treatment of cystic fibrosis-related bacterial biofilm infections is challenging because of the pathological environment of the lungs.

The hybrid nanoparticles with ultrasmall size were self-assembled via a nanoprecipitation process by using a facile microfluidic method. The interactions of the nanoparticles with the biological barriers were comprehensively investigated by using cutting-edge techniques (e.g., quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy-based particle tracking, in vitro biofilm model cultured in a flow-chamber system, and quantitative imaging analysis). Our results suggest that the mucus-inert, enzymatically cleavable TPGS shell enables the nanoparticles to penetrate through the mucus, accumulate in the deeper layer of the biofilms, and serve as sustained release depot, thereby improving the killing efficacy of azithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic) against biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In conclusion, the ultrasmall TPGS-PLGA hybrid nanoparticles represent an efficient delivery system to overcome the multiple barriers and release antibiotics in a sustained manner in the vicinity of the biofilm-forming bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Feng Wan"},{"name":"Søren S-R Bohr"},{"name":"Sylvia Natalie Kłodzińska"},{"name":"Haidar Jumaa"},{"name":"Zheng Huang"},{"name":"Tommy Nylander"},{"name":"Mikkel Boas Thygesen"},{"name":"Kasper Kildegaard Sørensen"},{"name":"Knud Jørgen Jensen"},{"name":"Claus Sternberg"},{"name":"Nikos Hatzakis"},{"name":"Hanne Mørck Nielsen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm"},{"word":"TPGS−PLGA hybrid nanoparticles"},{"word":"aerosol administration"},{"word":"bio−nano interaction"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"}]},"article386":{"pmid":"31804652","title":"Spatiotemporal pattern formation in E. coli biofilms explained by a simple physical energy balance.","abs":"While the biofilm growth mode conveys notable thriving advantages to bacterial populations, the mechanisms of biofilm formation are still strongly debated.

Using a viable LTA-deficient strain of the human oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii, we demonstrated that LTA plays an important role in surface protein presentation. Cell wall fractions derived from the wild-type and LTA-deficient strains of S. gordonii were analyzed using label-free mass spectroscopy.

P. aeruginosa PA14 in vitro mature biofilms were challenged with supra-MIC ciprofloxacin concentrations. Cell viability was quantified by fluorescein diacetate assay. Population dynamics were determined by counts of surviving culturable cells. Biofilms were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and the expression of genes involved in stringent response, toxin-antitoxin HigB/HigA, and type 3 secretion system (T3SS) was quantified by RT-qPCR in untreated and treated biofilms. Ciprofloxacin exposure resulted in an initial reduction of bacterial counts following a biphasic time-kill curve. After 24 h of treatment, the overall cell activity and the density of culturable cells significantly decreased as compared to untreated biofilm. No resistant mutant was isolated among the <1% surviving cells. Phenotypic adaptation toward persistence appeared to start after only 1 h of antibiotic exposure, by an overexpression of the genes involved in stringent response and in the toxin-antitoxin system, whereas the expression of genes encoding for the T3SS remained unchanged. After 4 h of ciprofloxacin exposure, stringent response genes returned to their basal level of expression. After a prolonged ciprofloxacin exposure, a deep alteration in the matrix structure that became thinner and lost mushroom-like aggregates was observed, in relation with reduced biovolumes of exopolysaccharides and extracellular DNA. These results support that ciprofloxacin might first induce the bacterial killing of most bacterial cells, but simultaneously activate stringent response mechanisms contributing to the switch of a subpopulation toward a persister phenotype.

By analyzing a collection of S. mitis strains isolated from the oral cavity at commensal states or from systemic infections (blood strains), we established that S. mitis ubiquitously express the surface immunodominant protein, PcsB (also called GbpB), required for binding to sucrose-derived exopolysaccharides (EPS). Immuno dot blot assays with anti-PcsB antibodies and RT-qPCR transcription analyses revealed strain-specific profiles of PcsB production associated with diversity in pcsB transcriptional activities. Additionally, blood strains showed significantly higher levels of PcsB expression compared to commensal isolates. Because Streptococcus mutans co-colonizes S. mitis dental biofilms, and secretes glucosyltransferases (GtfB/C/D) for the synthesis of highly insoluble EPS from sucrose, profiles of S. mitis binding to EPS, biofilm formation and evasion of the complement system were assessed in sucrose-containing BHI medium supplemented or not with filter-sterilized S. mutans culture supernatants. These analyses showed significant S. mitis binding to EPS and biofilm formation in the presence of S. mutans supernatants supplemented with sucrose, compared to BHI or BHI-sucrose medium. In addition, these phenotypes were abolished if strains were grown in culture supernatants of a gtfBCD-defective S. mutans mutant. Importantly, GtfB/C/D-associated phenotypes were enhanced in high PcsB-expressing strains, compared to low PcsB producers. Increased PcsB expression was further correlated with increased resistance to deposition of C3b/iC3b of the complement system after exposure to human serum, when strains were previously grown in the presence of S. mutans supernatants. Finally, analyses of PcsB polymorphisms and bioinformatic prediction of epitopes with significant binding to MHC class II alleles revealed that blood isolates harbor PcsB polymorphisms in its functionally conserved CHAP-domain, suggesting antigenic variation. These findings reveal important roles of PcsB in S. mitis-host interactions under commensal and pathogenic states, highlighting the need for studies to elucidate mechanisms regulating PcsB expression in this species.","authors":[{"name":"Erika N Harth-Chu"},{"name":"Lívia A Alves"},{"name":"Jéssica D Theobaldo"},{"name":"Mariana F Salomão"},{"name":"José F Höfling"},{"name":"William F King"},{"name":"Daniel J Smith"},{"name":"Renata O Mattos-Graner"}],"keywords":[{"word":"GbpB"},{"word":"PcsB"},{"word":"Streptococcus mitis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"complement immunity"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides"},{"word":"microbial ecology"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article409":{"pmid":"31798183","title":"Adhesion of biofilms on titanium measured by laser-induced spallation.","abs":"Eradication of established implant-associated and bacterial biofilm-forming infections remains difficult in part because these biofilms remain well-adhered to the implant surface. Few experimental techniques are available to measure macro-scale strength of bacterial biofilm-implant adhesion. We have adapted the laser spallation technique to compare the macro-scale adhesion strength of biofilms formed on titanium. By using a rapid pressure wave (35 ns) to load the interface, we prevent disturbance of the biofilm surface prior to measurement, and preclude the time necessary for the biofilm to respond to and adapt under loading. Biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, a Gram-positive bacterium associated with human dental caries (cavities) were cultured directly on commercially pure titanium within our custom substrate assembly. Growth conditions were varied by adding sucrose to the Todd Hewitt Yeast (THY) broth: THY control, 37.5 mM, 75 mM, 375 mM, and 750 mM sucrose. Multiple locations on each biofilm were loaded using the laser spallation technique. Loading pressure wave amplitude was controlled by adjusting laser fluence, energy per area. Initially, addition of sucrose to the media increased biofilm adhesion to titanium. However, once a saturation concentration of 75 mM sucrose was reached, increasing the sucrose concentration further resulted in a decrease in biofilm adhesion. This study is the first demonstration of the adaptation of the laser spallation technique to measure bacterial biofilm adhesion. Establishment of this macro-scale biofilm adhesion measurement technique opens the door for many biofilm-surface adhesion studies. We anticipate further work in this area towards understanding the complex relationships among bacteria species, environmental factors, surface characteristics, and biofilm adhesion strength.","authors":[{"name":"J D Boyd"},{"name":"N Korotkova"},{"name":"M E Grady"}],"keywords":[]},"article410":{"pmid":"31797934","title":"Self-regenerating giant hyaluronan polymer brushes.","abs":"Tailoring interfaces with polymer brushes is a commonly used strategy to create functional materials for numerous applications.

However, the combination of various AMPs with different action mechanisms is rarely investigated. A newly designed lytic AMP ZXR-2.3 combined with antibiofilm peptide IDR-1018 or KT2 was tested for the antibiofilm effect on mature Streptococcus mutans biofilms. In general, the combination of ZXR-2.3 + IDR-1018 displayed synergistic effect on both biofilm eradication and bacterial killing, while ZXR-2.3 + KT2 showed no obvious synergism.

Furthermore, cell-free filtrates of some isolates produced Mn oxides at specific time points, but this activity was not induced by Mn(II). Manganese oxide formation in cell-free filtrates occurred via reaction with the oxygen radical superoxide produced by soluble extracellular proteins.

The inhibitory effect on photocurrent of three commonly used herbicides (i.e., atrazine, diuron, and paraquat) was used as a means of measuring their concentrations in aqueous solution. The injection of atrazine and diuron into the algal medium caused an immediate photocurrent drop due to the inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport.

In contrast, paraquat caused an initial increase (~2 h) of the photocurrent effect of about 200%, as this compound can act as a redox mediator between the cells and the anode. A relatively long-term stability of the biosensor was demonstrated, by keeping anodes colonized with cyanobacterial biofilm in the dark at 4 °C. After 22 days of storage, the performance in terms of the photocurrent was comparable with the freshly prepared biosensor.

Escherichia coli epitomizes these obstacles: this gram-negative bacterial species is the most prevalent agent of UTIs worldwide and can also colonize the urogenital tract in a phenomenon known as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Unfortunately, at the level of the individual E. coli strains, the relationship between UTI and ASB is poorly defined, confounding our understanding of microbial pathogenesis and strategies for clinical management. Unlike diarrheagenic pathotypes of E. coli, the definition of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) remains phenomenologic, without conserved phenotypes and known genetic determinants that rigorously distinguish UTI- and ASB-associated strains. This article provides a cross-disciplinary review of the current issues from interrelated mechanistic and diagnostic perspectives and describes new opportunities by which clinical resources can be leveraged to overcome molecular challenges. Specifically, we present our work harnessing a large collection of patient-derived isolates to identify features that do (and do not) distinguish UTI- from ASB-associated E. coli strains. Analyses of biofilm formation, previously reported to be higher in ASB strains, revealed extensive phenotypic heterogeneity that did not correlate with symptomatology. However, metabolomic experiments revealed distinct signatures between ASB and cystitis isolates, including in the purine pathway (previously shown to be critical for intracellular survival during acute infection). Together, these studies demonstrate how large-scale, wild-type approaches can help dissect the physiology of colonization versus infection, suggesting that the molecular definition of UPEC may rest at the level of global bacterial metabolism.","authors":[{"name":"Allison R Eberly"},{"name":"Connor J Beebout"},{"name":"Ching Man Carmen Tong"},{"name":"Gerald T Van Horn"},{"name":"Hamilton D Green"},{"name":"Madison J Fitzgerald"},{"name":"Shuvro De"},{"name":"Emily K Apple"},{"name":"Alexandra C Schrimpe-Rutledge"},{"name":"Simona G Codreanu"},{"name":"Stacy D Sherrod"},{"name":"John A McLean"},{"name":"Douglass B Clayton"},{"name":"Charles W Stratton"},{"name":"Jonathan E Schmitz"},{"name":"Maria Hadjifrangiskou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Asymptomatic bacteriuria"},{"word":"Cystitis"},{"word":"Metabolomics"},{"word":"Urinary tract infection"},{"word":"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli"}]},"article430":{"pmid":"31794255","title":"Antibiotic Susceptibility, Biofilm-Forming Ability, and Incidence of Class 1 Integron of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Various Foods in a School Canteen in China.","abs":"In recent years, the food poisoning incidents from school canteens have aroused widespread concern in China. Microbial contamination to the foods is the main factor responsible for these food poisoning events. In this study, identification of microbial pathogens including Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus in samples (frozen pork, fresh pork, fresh chicken, and different fresh vegetables) of a school canteen in China during 2017 to 2018 was performed. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern, class 1 integron, and biofilm formation ability of the isolated pathogens were also investigated. In total, 96 strains were isolated (32 Salmonella spp., 32 E. coli, and 32 S. aureus). The antibiogram study results demonstrated that 61.5% strains were found resistant to at least one type of antibiotics, and 17.7% were resistant to three or more antibiotics. In addition, 31.3% strains possessed class 1 integron. Among the integron-positive isolates, 38.9% Salmonella spp. and 87.5% E. coli contained ∼800 or/and 1500 bp size gene cassette within the integrons. However, four S. aureus strains possessing class 1 integron without gene cassette were found. Although none of the isolated strains were found strong biofilm producer, 44.8% were found to have weak or moderate biofilm formation ability. Despite biofilm formation ability or not, the Salmonella spp. containing positive class 1 integron showed significant resistance to cefazolin and gentamicin. In addition, class 1 integron-positive E. coli isolates having the biofilm formation ability hardly showed sensitive to four antibiotics, such as amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, and gentamicin. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the prevalence of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes containing antibiotic resistance genes by the prudent use of antibiotics in livestock farms, and the improvement of food processing and storage environment.","authors":[{"name":"Wen Wang"},{"name":"Li Wang"},{"name":"Jianyu Su"},{"name":"Zhenbo Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic susceptibility"},{"word":"class 1 integron"},{"word":"foodborne pathogens"}]},"article431":{"pmid":"31793753","title":"Influence of carbon source complexity on porosity, water retention and extracellular matrix composition of Neurospora discreta biofilms.","abs":"To evaluate carbon source complexity as a process lever to impact the microstructure, chemical composition and water retention capacity of biofilms produced by Neurospora discreta.","authors":[{"name":"A Ahmed"},{"name":"R A Narayanan"},{"name":"A R Veni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"biopolymers"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"fungi"},{"word":"metabolism"}]},"article432":{"pmid":"31793092","title":"Chemotaxis and cyclic-di-GMP signalling control surface attachment of Escherichia coli.","abs":"Attachment to surfaces is an important early step during bacterial infection and during formation of submerged biofilms. Although flagella-mediated motility is known to be important for attachment of Escherichia coli and other bacteria, implications of motility regulation by cellular signalling remain to be understood. Here, we show that motility largely promotes attachment of E. coli, including that mediated by type 1 fimbriae, by allowing cells to reach, get hydrodynamically trapped at and explore the surface. Inactivation or inhibition of the chemotaxis signalling pathway improves attachment by suppressing cell reorientations and thereby increasing surface residence times. The attachment is further enhanced by deletion of genes encoding the cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP)-dependent flagellar brake YcgR or the diguanylate cyclase DgcE. Such increased attachment in absence of c-di-GMP signalling is in contrast to its commonly accepted function as a positive regulator of the sessile state. It is apparently due to the increased swimming speed of E. coli in absence of YcgR-mediated motor control, which strengthens adhesion mediated by the type 1 fimbriae. Thus, both signalling networks that regulate motility of E. coli also control its engagement with both biotic and abiotic surfaces, which has likely implications for infection and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Verena Maria Suchanek"},{"name":"María Esteban-López"},{"name":"Rémy Colin"},{"name":"Olga Besharova"},{"name":"Kirstin Fritz"},{"name":"Victor Sourjik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"chemotaxis"},{"word":"fimbriae"},{"word":"flagella"},{"word":"motility"}]},"article433":{"pmid":"31792794","title":"Towards sustainable system configuration for the treatment of fish processing wastewater using bioreactors.","abs":"The wastewater generated from fish processing industry contains a credible level of biodegradable proteins and low biodegradable fats, oils, and grease (FOG).

Here we demonstrate that exogenous alginate protects S. aureus from P. aeruginosa in both planktonic and biofilm co-culture models under a variety of nutritional conditions. S. aureus protection in the presence of exogenous alginate is due to transcriptional downregulation of pvdA, a gene required for the production of the iron scavenging siderophore pyoverdine, as well as down-regulation of the PQS (Pseudomonas quinolone signal; 2-heptyl-3,4-dihydroxyquinoline) quorum sensing system. The impact of exogenous alginate is independent of endogenous alginate production. We further demonstrate that co-culture of mucoid P. aeruginosa with non-mucoid P. aeruginosa can mitigate the killing of S. aureus by the non-mucoid strain of P. aeruginosa, indicating that the mechanism we describe here may function in vivo in the context of mixed infections. Finally, we investigated a panel of mucoid clinical isolates that retain the ability to kill S. aureus at late time points, and show that each strain has a unique expression profile, indicating that mucoid isolates can overcome the S. aureus-protective effects of mucoidy in a strain-specific manner.","authors":[{"name":"Courtney E Price"},{"name":"Dustin G Brown"},{"name":"Dominique H Limoli"},{"name":"Vanessa V Phelan"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"}],"keywords":[]},"article436":{"pmid":"31791952","title":"LysR-Type Transcriptional Regulator MetR Controls Prodigiosin Production, Methionine Biosynthesis, Cell Motility, H","abs":"Prodigiosin, a secondary metabolite produced by Serratia marcescens, has attracted attention due to its immunosuppressive, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties.
