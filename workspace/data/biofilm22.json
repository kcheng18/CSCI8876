Tooth cavity restorations cost more than $46 billion annually in the United States alone. The current generation of esthetic polymeric restorations have unsatisfactory failure rates. Replacing the failed restorations accounts for 50⁻70% of all the restorations. This article reviewed developments in producing a new generation of bioactive and therapeutic restorations. This includes: Protein-repellent and anti-caries polymeric dental composites, especially the use of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM); protein-repellent adhesives to greatly reduce biofilm acids; bioactive cements to inhibit tooth lesions; combining protein-repellency with antibacterial nanoparticles of silver; tooth surface coatings containing calcium phosphate nanoparticles for remineralization; therapeutic restorations to suppress periodontal pathogens; and long-term durability of bioactive and therapeutic dental polymers. MPC was chosen due to its strong ability to repel proteins. DMAHDM was selected because it had the most potent antibacterial activity when compared to a series of antibacterial monomers. The new generation of materials possessed potent antibacterial functions against cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, and reduced biofilm colony-forming units by up to 4 logs, provided calcium phosphate ions for remineralization and strengthening of tooth structures, and raised biofilm pH from a cariogenic pH 4.5 to a safe pH 6.5. The new materials achieved a long-term durability that was significantly beyond current commercial control materials. This new generation of bioactive and nanostructured polymers is promising for wide applications to provide therapeutic healing effects and greater longevity for dental restorations.","authors":[{"name":"Ning Zhang"},{"name":"Ke Zhang"},{"name":"Xianju Xie"},{"name":"Zixiang Dai"},{"name":"Zeqing Zhao"},{"name":"Satoshi Imazato"},{"name":"Yousif A Al-Dulaijan"},{"name":"Faisal D Al-Qarni"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Mark A Reynolds"},{"name":"Yuxing Bai"},{"name":"Lin Wang"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"caries inhibition"},{"word":"dental restorations"},{"word":"polymer nanocomposites"},{"word":"protein-repellent"},{"word":"tooth mineral regeneration"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"29865153","title":"Monohexosylceramides from Rhizopus Species Isolated from Brazilian Caatinga: Chemical Characterization and Evaluation of Their Anti-Biofilm and Antibacterial Activities.","abs":"Monohexosylceramides (CMHs) are highly conserved fungal glycosphingolipids playing a role in several cellular processes such as growth, differentiation and morphological transition.

In addition, the non-bactericidal effect of DTBMP was determined through growth curve and 2,3-bis (2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay. Real-time PCR studies revealed the down-regulation of master quorum sensing (QS) regulator genes of V. harveyi such as luxR, luxS, luxP, luxQ and luxO on treatment with DTBMP. In vivo results confirmed that DTBMP augmented the survival rate of Litopenaeus vannamei larvae up to 75, 88 and 66% upon infection with V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, respectively.

Of growing interest is the presence and potential role of anaerobic microorganisms in the pathology of DFUs and how they may contribute to the infective process or delayed healing. The presence of anaerobes in DFUs has been greatly underestimated, largely due to the limitations of conventional culture methods in identifying them from samples. Advancements in molecular and microscopy techniques have extended our view of the wound microbiome in addition to observing the growth and behaviour (planktonic or biofilm) of microorganisms in situ. This review paper will reflect on the evidence for the role and significance of anaerobes in DFUs and infection.

High concentration of V(V) (60 and 100 mg/L) inhibited the denitrification activities, while 30 mg/L V(V) had a very slight effect. V(V) induced increases of lactate dehydrogenase release and reactive oxygen species production, which may inhibit nitrate and nitrite reductases activities and abundances of denitrifying functional genes. Moreover, the extracellular polymeric substance production was also suppressed under V(V) stress, thereby decreasing the amount of biofilm biomass. Microbial community analyses suggesting the genus Bacillus may have higher tolerance to V(V). These findings can provide scientific basis for the optimized design of treatment system to remove nitrate and V(V) simultaneously.","authors":[{"name":"Dan Chen"},{"name":"Zhixing Xiao"},{"name":"Hongyu Wang"},{"name":"Kai Yang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Autotrophic denitrification"},{"word":"Denitrifying functional genes"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Vanadium (V)"}]},"article25":{"pmid":"29859473","title":"Transformation, CO","abs":"A tiered process was developed to assess the transformation, CO","authors":[{"name":"Per Falås"},{"name":"Kevin S Jewell"},{"name":"Nina Hermes"},{"name":"Arne Wick"},{"name":"Thomas A Ternes"},{"name":"Adriano Joss"},{"name":"Jeppe Lund Nielsen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biological wastewater treatment"},{"word":"Microautoradiography"},{"word":"Micropollutants"},{"word":"Moving bed biofilm reactors"},{"word":"Transformation"}]},"article26":{"pmid":"29859464","title":"Simulation experiments to elucidate variable fluorescence as a potential proxy for bulk microalgal viability from natural water, sediments and biofilms: Implication in ships ballast water management.","abs":"The variable fluorescence fluorometry measuring microalgal biomass (initial fluorescence - F","authors":[{"name":"Jagadish S Patil"},{"name":"Arga Chandrashekar Anil"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Assessment"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Microalgae"},{"word":"Sediments"},{"word":"Stress"},{"word":"Variable fluorescence"},{"word":"Viability"}]},"article27":{"pmid":"29859293","title":"Carbon storage regulator CsrA plays important roles in multiple virulence-associated processes of Clostridium difficile.","abs":"The carbon storage regulator CsrA is a global regulator that controls multiple virulence-associated processes including host cell invasion, virulence secretion, quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and motility in many pathogenic bacteria.

We apply our approach to 17 industrially relevant multispecies biofilm models, based on species isolated from 58 contaminating biofilms in three breweries. Sulfathiazole was used as antimicrobial agent because it showed the highest activity out of 22 biofilm inhibitors tested. Our analysis reveals that competitive interactions dominate among species within brewery biofilms. We show that antimicrobial treatment can reduce the level of competition and therefore cause a subset of species to bloom. The result is a 1.2-42.7-fold lower percentage inhibition of these species and increased overall tolerance. In addition, we show that the presence of Raoultella can also directly enhance the inherent tolerance of Pseudomonas to antimicrobial treatment, either because the species protect each other or because they induce specific tolerance phenotypes as a response to competitors. Overall, our study emphasizes that the dominance of competitive interactions is central to the enhanced antimicrobial tolerance of the multispecies biofilms, and that the activity of antimicrobials against multispecies biofilms cannot be predicted based on their effect against monocultures.","authors":[{"name":"Ilse Parijs"},{"name":"Hans P Steenackers"}],"keywords":[]},"article34":{"pmid":"29858205","title":"Functional Determinants of Extracellular Polymeric Substances in Membrane Biofouling: Experimental Evidence from Pure-Cultured Sludge Bacteria.","abs":"The aim of this work was to better understand the roles of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in membrane biofouling at the single-strain level.

When antibiotic pressure drops, persisters that switch back to a normal phenotype can resume growth, ensuring survival of the bacterial population. Persister cells have been identified in every major pathogen, contribute to the antibiotic tolerance observed in biofilms, and are responsible for the recalcitrant nature of chronic infections. Also, evidence is accumulating that persister cells can contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Consequently, effective treatment of persister cells could greatly improve patient outcome. The small number of persisters and the redundancy in mechanisms of persister formation impede target-based development of anti-persister therapies.

The synthesized TzAgNPs showed considerable antimicrobial activity wherein the MIC value of TzAgNPs was found at 40 μg/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiofilm activity of TzAgNPs was also tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by carrying out an array of experiments like microscopic observation, crystal violet assay, and protein count using the sub-MIC doses of TzAgNPs. Since TzAgNPs showed efficient antibiofilm activity, thus, in the present study, efforts were put together to investigate the underlying cause of biofilm attenuation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using TzAgNPs. To this end, we discerned that the sub-MIC doses of TzAgNPs increased ROS level considerably in the bacterial cell. The result showed that the ROS level and microbial biofilm formation are inversely proportional. Thus, the attenuation in microbial biofilm could be attributed to the accumulation of ROS level. Furthermore, it was also duly noted that microorganisms upon treatment with TzAgNPs exhibited considerable diminution in virulence factors (protease and pyocyanin) in contrast to the control where the organisms were not treated with TzAgNPs. Thus, the results indicated that TzAgNPs exhibit considerable reduction in the development of biofilms and spreading of virulence factors.

Fractioning was done using increasing solvents polarity. Standard phytochemical methods were used for phytochemical screening. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of the methanol extract and fractions were determined using broth microdilution method. The studied mode of action of both methanol extract and n-butanol fraction included antibiofilm activity, H+-ATPase-mediated proton pumping assay, salt tolerance, and cells cycle. The methanol extract of E. chlorantha stem barks was found to be active on all the bacteria tested (32 ≤ MIC ≤ 512 μg/mL), its activity being significant (MIC < 100 μg/ml) out of 5 of the 28 clinical isolates used.

This has occurred especially due to an increasing occurrence of drugresistant in Candida spp. strains. The overuse of antifungal medications, systemic toxicity, cross-reactivity with other drugs and a presently low number of drug molecules with antifungal activity, have contributed to important clinical limitations.

One possible approach is to mutate bacteria to enhance their binding to cancer cells. In the present study, Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis were randomly mutated, and then were positively and negatively selected for binding cancer vs normal cells. With repetitive mutation and selection both bacteria successfully evolved to increase affinity to the pancreatic cancer cell line (Mia PaCa-2) but not normal cells (HPDE: immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells). The mutant E. coli and B. subtilis strains bound to Mia PaCa-2 cells about 10 and 25 times more than to HPDE cells. The selected E. coli strain had mutations in biofilm-related genes and the regulatory region for a type I pilus gene. Consistent with type I pili involvement, mannose could inhibit the binding to cells. The results suggest that weak but specific binding is involved in the initial step of adhesion. To test their ability to kill Mia PaCa-2 cells, hemolysin was expressed in the mutant strain. The hemolysin released from the mutant strain was active and could kill Mia PaCa-2 cells. In the case of B. subtilis, the initial binding to the cells was a weak interaction of the leading pole of the motile bacteria. The frequency of this interaction to Mia PaCa-2 cells dramatically increased in the evolved mutant strain. This mutant strain could also specifically invade beneath Mia PaCa-2 cells and settle there.

Research strategies to prevent peri-implantitis have focused on modifying dental implants to incorporate different antimicrobial agents. An alternative strategy consists of barring the expansion of the biofilm subgingivally by forming a long-lasting permucosal seal between the soft tissue and the implant surface. Here, we innovatively biofunctionalized titanium with bioinspired peptide coatings to strengthen biological interactions between epithelial cells and the titanium surface. We selected laminin 332- and ameloblastin-derived peptides (Lam, Ambn). Laminin 332 participates in the formation of hemidesmosomes by keratinocytes and promotes epithelial attachment around teeth; and ameloblastin, an enamel derived protein, is involved in tissue regeneration events following disruption of the periodontium. Lam, Ambn or combinations of both peptides were covalently immobilized on titanium discs. Successful immobilization of the peptides was confirmed by contact angle goniometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and fluorescent labelling of the peptides. Additionally, we confirmed the mechanical and thermochemical stability of the peptides on Ti substrates. Proliferation and hemidesmosome formation of human keratinocytes (TERT-2/OKF-6) were assessed by immunofluorescence labelling. The peptide-coated surfaces increased cell proliferation for up to 48 h in culture compared to control surfaces. Most importantly, formation of hemidesmosomes by keratinocytes was significantly increased on surfaces coated with Ambn + Lam peptides compared to control (p < 0.01) and monopeptide coatings (p < 0.005).

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the susceptibilities of DUWL isolates in planktonic and biofilm states to cetylpyridinium chloride, as well as to the four chemical agents currently used for DUWL management.

These organisms still belong to the genera of the skin coryneform group, and the most-studied species remains Cutibacterium acnes. Cutibacterium avidum is also a known skin commensal. This underrecognized microorganism can, however, act as a pathogen after bacterial seeding and can be considered opportunistic, causing either superficial or deep/invasive infections. It can cause numerous infections, including but not limited to breast infections, skin abscesses, infective endocarditis, and device-related infections. The ecological niche of C. avidum is clearly different from that of other members of the genus: it is found in the axillary region or at wet sites rather than in dry, exposed areas, and the number of microorganisms increases during puberty. Historically, it has been used for its ability to modulate the immune response and for its antitumor properties. Conventional microbial culture methods and identification processes allow for its accurate identification and characterization. Thanks to the modern omics tools used for phylogenomic approaches, understanding C. avidum pathogenesis (including host-bacterium interactions and virulence factor characterization) is becoming easier, allowing for more thorough molecular characterization. These analyses have revealed that C. avidum causes diverse diseases mediated by multiple virulence factors. The recent genome approach has revealed specific genomic regions within this species that are involved in adherence and biofilm formation as well as fitness, survival, and defense functions. Numerous regions show the presence of phages and horizontal gene transfer.

Recent findings indicated SagS to function as a switch to control biofilm formation and drug tolerance independently. Moreover, findings suggested the periplasmic sensory HmsP domain of SagS is likely to be the control point in the regulation of biofilm formation and biofilm cells transitioning to a drug-tolerant state. We thus asked whether specific amino acid residues present in the HmsP domain contribute to the switch function of SagS. HmsP domain residues were therefore subjected to alanine replacement mutagenesis to identify substitutions that block the sensory function(s) of SagS, which is apparent by attached cells being unable to develop mature biofilms and/or prevent transition to an antimicrobial-resistant state. Mutant analyses revealed 32 residues that only contribute to blocking one sensory function. Moreover, amino acid residues affecting attachment and subsequent biofilm formation but not biofilm tolerance also impaired histidine kinase signaling via BfiS. In contrast, residues affecting biofilm drug tolerance but not attachment and subsequent biofilm formation negatively impacted BrlR transcription factor levels. Structure prediction suggested the two sets of residues affecting sensory functions are located in distinct areas that were previously described as being involved in ligand binding interactions.

We previously showed that the effectiveness of Lactobacillus reuteri ( Lr) in preventing NEC is enhanced when Lr is grown as a biofilm on the surface of dextranomer microspheres (DM). Here we sought to test the efficacy of Lr administration by manipulating the Lr biofilm state with the addition of biofilm-promoting substances (sucrose and maltose) to DM or by mutating the Lr gtfW gene (encoding an enzyme central to biofilm production). Using an animal model of NEC, we determined that Lr adhered to sucrose- or maltose-loaded DM significantly reduced histologic injury, improved host survival, decreased intestinal permeability, reduced intestinal inflammation, and altered the gut microbiome compared with Lr adhered to unloaded DM. These effects were abolished when DM or GtfW were absent from the Lr inoculum. This demonstrates that a single dose of Lr in its biofilm state decreases NEC incidence. Importantly, preloading DM with sucrose or maltose further enhances Lr protection against NEC in a GtfW-dependent fashion, demonstrating the tunability of the approach and the potential to use other cargos to enhance future probiotic formulations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous clinical trials of probiotics to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis have had variable results. In these studies, probiotics were delivered in their planktonic, free-living form. We have developed a novel probiotic delivery system in which Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr) is delivered in its biofilm state.

An important virulence property of A. actinomycetemcomitans is its ability to form tenacious biofilms that can attach to abiotic as well as biotic surfaces. The histone-like (H-NS) family of nucleoid-structuring proteins act as transcriptional silencers in many Gram-negative bacteria. To evaluate the role of H-NS in A. actinomycetemcomitans, hns mutant derivatives of serotype a strain D7S were generated. Characteristics of the hns mutant phenotype included shorter and fewer pili, and substantially lower monospecies biofilm formation relative to the wild type. Furthermore, the D7S hns mutant exhibited significantly reduced growth within a seven-species oral biofilm model. However, no apparent difference was observed regarding the numbers and proportions of the remaining six species regardless of being co-cultivated with D7S hns or its parental strain. Proteomics analysis of the strains grown in monocultures confirmed the role of H-NS as a repressor of gene expression in A. actinomycetemcomitans. Interestingly, proteomics analysis of the multispecies biofilms indicated that the A. actinomycetemcomitans wild type and hns mutant imposed different regulatory effects on the pattern of protein expression in the other species, i.e., mainly Streptococcus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Veillonella dispar. Gene ontology analysis revealed that a large portion of the differentially regulated proteins was related to translational activity.

The cell clumps rather than single cells went downward due to gravity and adhered to the bottom surface. Under appropriate shear stress, a twin vortex was caused by a separated flow generated at the rear of the pre-immobilized cell clumps and carried the small cell clumps to this location, resulting in their stacking there. The rearward immobilized cell clumps developed into a large, stable aggregate with a streamlined shape, independent of cell growth. Cell clumps hardly ever developed under weak shear stress that could not generate a twin vortex and were broken up under excessively strong shear stress.

Interestingly, MFS had postantifungal effect on Cryptococcus, with a proliferation delay of up to 8.15 h after a short exposure to fungicidal doses. MFS at fungicidal concentrations increased the plasma membrane permeability, likely due to a direct interaction with ergosterol, as suggested by competition assays with exogenous ergosterol. Moreover, MFS reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and induced DNA fragmentation and condensation, all of which are hallmarks of apoptosis. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that MFS-treated yeasts had a reduced mucopolysaccharide capsule (confirmed by morphometry with light microscopy), plasma membrane irregularities, mitochondrial swelling, and a less conspicuous cell wall. Our results suggest that MFS increases the plasma membrane permeability in Cryptococcus via an interaction with ergosterol and also affects the mitochondrial membrane, eventually leading to apoptosis, in line with its fungicidal activity. These findings confirm the potential of MFS as an antifungal against C. neoformans and C. gattii and warrant further studies to establish clinical protocols for MFS use against cryptococcosis.","authors":[{"name":"Cristina de Castro Spadari"},{"name":"Taissa Vila"},{"name":"Sonia Rozental"},{"name":"Kelly Ishida"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cryptococcus"},{"word":"apoptosis"},{"word":"ergosterol"},{"word":"fungicidal effect"},{"word":"membrane permeability"},{"word":"miltefosine"},{"word":"mitochondria"},{"word":"postantifungal effect"}]},"article95":{"pmid":"29844050","title":"Antimicrobial Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Gas Plasma-Activated Catheter Lock Solution.","abs":"Antimicrobial lock solutions are important for prevention of microbial colonization and infection of long-term central venous catheters.

While temporin-1Ga and temporin-1OLa showed higher antifungal and anticancer activity, most of these peptides were active primarily against Gram-positive bacteria. Temporin-1OLa, with the highest cell selectivity index, could preferentially kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), consistent with a reduced hemolysis in the presence of bacteria.

Using micelles as a membrane-mimetic model, we determined the three-dimensional structure of temporin-1OLa by NMR spectroscopy. The peptide adopted a two-domain structure where a hydrophobic patch is followed by a classic amphipathic helix covering residues P3-I12.

Microbial biofilm has been linked to both wound chronicity and infection. Close to 1 in 2 diabetics with a DFU are predicted to go on to develop a diabetic foot infection (DFI).

The development of an infection in a DFU is critical at least in part because paradigms of infection prevention and management are evolving. The effectiveness of our current practice standards is being challenged by a growing body of research related to the prevalence and recalcitrance of the microbes in biofilm to topical and systemic antimicrobials.

We report a novel hydrogel that eradicates biofilm bacteria by non-leaching-based debridement followed by ex situ contact-killing (DESCK) away from the infection site. The debridement effect is likely due to the high water swellability and microporosity of the cross-linked network which is made from polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate tethered with a dangling polyethylenimine (PEI) star copolymer. The large pore size of the hydrogel makes the cationic pore walls highly accessible to bacteria. The hydrogel also degrades in the presence of infection cells, releasing star cationic PEI into the infection site to contact-kill bacteria remaining there.

Genetic engineering shows promise to modulate the properties of the peptide building blocks, protein nanowires and current-harvesting biofilms for various applications. This minireview discusses what is known about the pilus material properties and reactions they catalyse and how this information can be harnessed in nanotechnology, bioremediation and bioenergy applications.","authors":[{"name":"Gemma Reguera"}],"keywords":[]},"article120":{"pmid":"29806143","title":"Exploiting the Versatility of Polydopamine-Coated Nanoparticles to Deliver Nitric Oxide and Combat Bacterial Biofilm.","abs":"In this study, an antimicrobial platform in the form of nitric oxide (NO) gas-releasing polydopamine (PDA)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) is developed for combating bacterial biofilms.

Initial infection may be cleared without inducing immunological memory, or progress directly to primary disease. Alternatively, the infection may be controlled as latent TB infection, that may progress to active tuberculosis at a later stage. There is now a greater understanding that these infection states are part of a continuum, and studies using PET/CT imaging have shown that individual lung granulomas may respond to infection independently, in an un-synchronized manner. In addition, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms themselves can exist in different states: as nonculturable forms, as 'persisters', as rapidly growing bacteria and a biofilm-forming cording phenotype. The 'omics' approaches of transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics can help reveal the mechanisms underlying these different infection states in the host, and identify biosignatures with diagnostic potential, that can predict the development of disease, in 'progressors' as early as 12-18 months before it can be detected clinically, or that can monitor the success of anti-TB therapy. Further insights can be obtained from studies of BCG vaccination and new TB vaccines. For example, epigenetic changes associated with trained immunity and a stronger immune responses following BCG vaccination can be identified. These omics approaches may be particularly valuable when linked to studies of mycobacterial growth inhibition, as a direct read-out of the ability to control mycobacterial growth. The second generation of omics studies is identifying much smaller signatures based on as few as 3 or 4 genes.

Recombinant TasA fibres form spontaneously, and share the biological activity of TasA fibres extracted from B. subtilis, whereas a TasA variant restricted to a monomeric form is inactive and subjected to extracellular proteolysis. The biophysical properties of both native and recombinant TasA fibres indicate that they are not functional amyloid-like fibres.

Biofilm transmission is different from bacterial adhesion, because it involves biofilm compression in between two surfaces, followed by a separation force leading to the detachment of the biofilm from the donor surface and subsequent adhesion to the receiver surface. Therewith, the transmission depends on a balance between donor and receiver surface properties and the cohesiveness of the biofilm itself. Here, we compare bacterial transmission from biofilms of an extracellular-polymeric-substance (EPS)-producing and a non-EPS-producing staphylococcal strain and a dual-species oral biofilm from smooth silicon (Si) donor surfaces to smooth and nanopillared Si receiver surfaces. Biofilms were fully covering the donor surface before transmission. However, after transmission, the biofilms only partly covered the donor and receiver surfaces regardless of nanopillaring, indicating bacterial transmission through adhesive failure at the interface between biofilms and donor surfaces as well as through cohesive failure in the biofilms. The numbers of bacteria per unit volume in EPS-producing staphylococcal biofilms before transmission were 2-fold smaller than in biofilms of the non-EPS-producing strain and of dual species. This difference increased after transmission in the biofilm left behind on the donor surfaces due to an increased bacterial density for the non-EPS-producing strain and a dual-species biofilm. This suggests that biofilms of the non-EPS-producing strain and dual species remained compressed after transmission, while biofilms of the EPS-producing strain were induced to produce more EPS during transmission and relaxed toward their initial state after transmission due to the viscoelasticity conferred to the biofilm by its EPS.","authors":[{"name":" Gusnaniar"},{"name":"Ferdi Hizal"},{"name":"Chang-Hwan Choi"},{"name":"Jelmer Sjollema"},{"name":"Titik Nuryastuti"},{"name":"Minie Rustema-Abbing"},{"name":"Rene T Rozenbaum"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"},{"name":"Stefan W Wessel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"antimicrobials"},{"word":"cohesive failure"},{"word":"detachment"},{"word":"dual-species biofilm"},{"word":"structure of a biofilm"}]},"article137":{"pmid":"29800910","title":"Carbon-dependent chromate toxicity mechanism in an environmental Arthrobacter isolate.","abs":"Arthrobacter spp. are widespread in soil systems and well-known for their Cr(VI) reduction capabilities making them attractive candidates for in situ bioremediation efforts.

In spite of the challenges, nanomaterials will be extremely promising for promoting the EET process application in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Peng Zhang"},{"name":"Jia Liu"},{"name":"Youpeng Qu"},{"name":"Da Li"},{"name":"Weihua He"},{"name":"Yujie Feng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Extracellular electron transfer"},{"word":"Inside-biofilm"},{"word":"Inside-membrane"},{"word":"Interface"},{"word":"Interspecie"},{"word":"Nanomaterials"}]},"article143":{"pmid":"29800146","title":"Regulatory effects of Shewanella putrefaciens isolated from shrimp Penaeus orientalis on the virulence factors of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and evaluation of the role of quorum sensing in virulence factors regulation.","abs":"As an aquatic pathogen widely present in aquatic food, Vibrio parahaemolyticus causes outbreaks of gastroenteritis across the globe. Virulence factors of V. parahaemolyticus increases with the amount of spoilage in aquatic organisms including shrimp, but mechanisms regulating its virulence factors are not well understood. In this study, five spoilage bacteria isolated from shrimp were investigated for their regulatory effects on the virulence factors including haemolysin and biofilm of V. parahaemolyticus. Among these isolates, Shewanella putrefaciens induced haemolytic activity in V. parahaemolyticus in a time-dose-temperature-dependent manner and we found the main component responsible for this effect to be the supernatant or cell-free extract of S. putrefaciens. Total haemolytic activity, expression of the thermostable direct haemolysin gene tdh and biofilm production of V. parahaemolyticus were significantly up-regulated by S. putrefaciens, but also by deletion of quorum-sensing luxM or luxS gene of V. parahaemolyticus. However, this regulation by S. putrefaciens was significantly impaired by deletion of the luxM gene, but not by deletion of the luxS gene. Further study showed that S. putrefaciens exhibited a strong degradation ability on the signalling molecule acylated homoserine lactone (AHL) synthesised by the LuxM enzyme. This study revealed a novel virulence regulatory mechanism that S. putrefaciens can significantly increase the virulence factors of V. parahaemolyticus via interfering with the luxM- type quorum-sensing signalling pathway through its AHL-degradation ability.","authors":[{"name":"Zhijia Fang"},{"name":"Dongfang Sun"},{"name":"Can Li"},{"name":"Lijun Sun"},{"name":"Yaling Wang"},{"name":"Muhan Guo"},{"name":"Rundong Wang"},{"name":"Qi Deng"},{"name":"Hanqiao Hu"},{"name":"Ying Liu"},{"name":"Defeng Xu"},{"name":"Ravi Gooneratne"}],"keywords":[]},"article144":{"pmid":"29799387","title":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from patients exposed to invasive devices in a university hospital in Argentina: molecular typing, susceptibility and detection of potential virulence factors.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Eliana Alcaraz"},{"name":"Carlos Garcia"},{"name":"Mariana Papalia"},{"name":"Carlos Vay"},{"name":"Laura Friedman"},{"name":"Beatriz Passerini de Rossi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"invasive devices"},{"word":"molecular typing"},{"word":"potential virulence factors"},{"word":"susceptibility"}]},"article146":{"pmid":"29798967","title":"Tea polyphenols suppress growth and virulence-related factors of Haemophilus parasuis.","abs":"The bacterium Haemophilus parasuis (H. parasuis) is the primary cause of Glässer's disease.

In order to anticipate the specific requirements to optimize their metabolism and growth during a day-and-night cycle, Cyanobacteria possess a unique molecular timing mechanism known as the circadian clock that is well-studied under laboratory conditions but little is known about its function in a natural complex community. Here, we investigated daily rhythmicity of gene expression in a coastal microbial mat community sampled at 6 time points during a 24-h period. In order to identify diel expressed genes, meta-transcriptome data was fitted to periodic functions. Out of 24,035 conserved gene transcript clusters, approximately 7% revealed a significant rhythmic expression pattern. These rhythmic genes were assigned to phototrophic micro-eukaryotes, Cyanobacteria but also to Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Analysis of MG-RAST annotated genes and mRNA recruitment analysis of two cyanobacterial and three proteobacterial microbial mat members confirmed that homologs of the cyanobacterial circadian clock genes were also found in other bacterial members of the microbial mat community. These results suggest that various microbial mat members other than Cyanobacteria have their own molecular clock, which can be entrained by a cocktail of Zeitgebers such as light, temperature or metabolites from neighboring species. Hence, microbial mats can be compared to a complex organism consisting of multiple sub-systems that have to be entrained in a cooperative way such that the corpus functions optimally.","authors":[{"name":"Christine Hörnlein"},{"name":"Veronique Confurius-Guns"},{"name":"Lucas J Stal"},{"name":"Henk Bolhuis"}],"keywords":[]},"article157":{"pmid":"29796251","title":"How long is enough?

We show here that a highly conserved sensory-transduction system, BfmRS, mediates the coordinate development of both enhanced virulence and resistance in this microorganism. Hyperactive alleles of BfmRS conferred increased protection from serum complement killing and allowed lethal systemic disease in mice. BfmRS also augmented resistance and tolerance against an expansive set of antibiotics, including dramatic protection from β-lactam toxicity. Through transcriptome profiling, we showed that BfmRS governs these phenotypes through global transcriptional regulation of a post-exponential-phase-like program of gene expression, a key feature of which is modulation of envelope biogenesis and defense pathways. BfmRS activity defended against cell-wall lesions through both β-lactamase-dependent and -independent mechanisms, with the latter being connected to control of lytic transglycosylase production and proper coordination of morphogenesis and division. In addition, hypersensitivity of bfmRS knockouts could be suppressed by unlinked mutations restoring a short, rod cell morphology, indicating that regulation of drug resistance, pathogenicity, and envelope morphogenesis are intimately linked by this central regulatory system in A. baumannii. This work demonstrates that BfmRS controls a global regulatory network coupling cellular physiology to the ability to cause invasive, drug-resistant infections.","authors":[{"name":"Edward Geisinger"},{"name":"Nadav J Mortman"},{"name":"Germán Vargas-Cuebas"},{"name":"Albert K Tai"},{"name":"Ralph R Isberg"}],"keywords":[]},"article160":{"pmid":"29795121","title":"Extraction and quantification of biofilm bacteria: Method optimized for urinary catheters.","abs":"Bacterial biofilms are responsible for the failure of many medical devices such as urinary catheters and are associated with many infectious and non-infectious complications.

Lack of clear messages and communication over recommendations hampers moving evidence into practice. The International Caries Consensus Collaboration (ICCC) recommendations on terminology are one part of improving communication for discussing the diagnosis and management of dental caries and dental carious lesions. The term dental caries is the name of the disease, its use being limited to situations involving control of the disease using preventive and noninvasive measures at the patient level. Carious lesion management should be used where management is directly related to disease symptoms at the tooth level. As terminology cannot be used to directly relate the visual appearance of the carious lesion to the histopathology, the terms have been based around the clinical consequences of the disease: soft, leathery, firm and hard dentine. The 3 main carious tissue removal options are described as: (1) selective removal of carious tissue (to both soft and firm dentine), (2) stepwise removal, and (3) non-selective removal to hard dentine (previously known as complete removal and no longer recommended).

This chapter focuses on sealants and restorative materials. Sealant materials are a viable treatment option for controlling non-cavitated lesions in occlusal and proximal surfaces where there is no significant breach in the surface integrity of the tooth, even if the lesion extends into dentine. Resin infiltration can also be used to manage proximal non-cavitated lesions. Even when the exact depth of lesion that can be sealed has not been established, evidence supports sealing shallow and moderate deep lesions into dentine. For cavitated lesions, sealing lesions without carious tissue removal might be an option when removal of tooth tissue is not required to provide a hard periphery around the lesion/cavity margin (to enhance bonding or to increase cavity depth for enough restorative material to be placed to last). There is little evidence for placing a restorative material over cavitated carious lesions without tissue removal or preparation.

In this study, various concentrations of sucrose were provided to Streptococcus mutans biofilms for 1 h per exposure (three times per day) to imitate a human meal pattern. And then the relationship between sucrose concentration and changes in the treated biofilms was determined. The results indicated that the components and acid production of the treated biofilms changed in a second-order polynomial curve pattern with sucrose concentration increase, which were confirmed by CLSM and SEM analyses. However, gene expression related to extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) formation, acid production and tolerance was up-regulated with sucrose concentration increase, which might have been due to compensation for the decrease in EPS formation and acid production by the biofilms at higher concentrations of sucrose. These findings suggest that sucrose in the range of 1%-5% can support the highest acid production and accumulation of S. mutans biofilms, which may further increase its cariogenic potential.

It is widely accepted that iron is a key nutrient for pathogenic bacteria, but little is known about its impact on microbiota associated with IBD. We used a model device to grow human mucosa-associated microbiota in its physiological anaerobic biofilm phenotype. Compared to microbiota from healthy donors, microbiota from IBD patients generate biofilms ex vivo that were larger in size and cell numbers, contained higher intracellular iron concentrations, and exhibited heightened virulence in a model of human intestinal epithelia in vitro and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We also describe an unexpected iron-scavenging property for an experimental hydrogen sulfide-releasing derivative of mesalamine. The findings demonstrate that this new drug reduces the virulence of IBD microbiota biofilms through a direct reduction of microbial iron intake and without affecting bacteria survival or species composition within the microbiota. Metabolomic analyses indicate that this drug reduces the intake of purine nucleosides (guanosine), increases the secretion of metabolite markers of purine catabolism (urate and hypoxanthine), and reduces the secretion of uracil (a pyrimidine nucleobase) in complex multispecies human biofilms. These findings demonstrate a new pathogenic mechanism for dysbiotic microbiota in IBD and characterize a novel mode of action for a class of mesalamine derivatives. Together, these observations pave the way towards a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of patients with IBD.","authors":[{"name":"Jean-Paul Motta"},{"name":"Thibault Allain"},{"name":"Luke E Green-Harrison"},{"name":"Ryan A Groves"},{"name":"Troy Feener"},{"name":"Hena Ramay"},{"name":"Paul L Beck"},{"name":"Ian A Lewis"},{"name":"John L Wallace"},{"name":"Andre G Buret"}],"keywords":[]},"article187":{"pmid":"29788056","title":"Bacterial biofilm formation on the hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi: a widespread ability under controls?","abs":"Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi establish symbiosis with roots of most trees of boreal and temperate ecosystems and are major drivers of nutrient fluxes between trees and the soil.

Here we investigated the ability of bacteria to form biofilm on the hyphae of the ECM fungus Laccaria bicolor. We showed that the ability to form biofilms on the hyphae of the ECM fungus is widely shared among soil bacteria. Conversely, some fungi, belonging to the Ascomycete class, did not allow for the formation of bacterial biofilms on their surfaces. The formation of biofilms was also modulated by the presence of tree roots and ectomycorrhizae, suggesting that biofilm formation does not occur randomly in soil but that it is regulated by several biotic factors.

Although progress has been made in understanding how microbes transfer electrons to insoluble substrates, the process of receiving electrons has largely remained unexplored. We investigated redox potentials favourable for donating electrons to dissolved and insoluble components in Catalina Harbor marine sediment by combining electrochemical techniques with geochemistry and molecular methods. Working electrodes buried in sediment microcosms were poised at seven redox potentials between -300 and -750 mV versus Ag/AgCl using a three-electrode system. In electrode biofilms recovered after 2-month incubations, overall community diversity increased with more negative redox potentials. Abundances of known EET-capable groups (e.g., Alteromonadales and Desulfuromonadales) varied with redox potential. Motility and chemotaxis genes were found in greater abundance in electrode communities, suggesting a possible selective advantage of these pathways for colonization and utilization of the electrode. Our enrichments demonstrated the validity of this approach in capturing groups known, as well as novel groups (e.g., Campylobacterales) that perform EET. The diverse nature of the enriched cathode communities suggest that insoluble substrate oxidation may be a critical, although poorly described microbial metabolic process in marine sediment.","authors":[{"name":"Bonita R Lam"},{"name":"Annette R Rowe"},{"name":"Kenneth H Nealson"}],"keywords":[]},"article195":{"pmid":"29785845","title":"Bromate and Nitrate Bioreduction Coupled with Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate Production in a Methane-Based Membrane Biofilm Reactor.","abs":"This work demonstrates bromate (BrO","authors":[{"name":"Chun-Yu Lai"},{"name":"Pan-Long Lv"},{"name":"Qiu-Yi Dong"},{"name":"Shi Lei Yeo"},{"name":"Bruce E Rittmann"},{"name":"He-Ping Zhao"}],"keywords":[]},"article196":{"pmid":"29785840","title":"Exploring photoinactivation of microbial biofilms using laser scanning microscopy and confined 2-photon excitation.","abs":"One pertinent complication in bacterial infection is the growth of biofilms, that is, communities of surface-adhered bacteria resilient to antibiotics.

Locally applied antibiotics, commonly embedded in polymethylmethacrylate, deliver high doses of drug directly to the fracture site. Direct application of antibiotic powder, which is being applied prophylactically in spine surgery, is a recent interest in the trauma sector, where bacterial biofilms are more prevalent. Traditional antibiotics, such as vancomycin, are poor performers against bacterial biofilms thus are ineffective in delayed treatment. Rifampin is an effective eradicator of Staphylococcal biofilms. Here, a rat model of musculoskeletal trauma was used to evaluate the utility of locally applied rifampin powder for reducing established orthopedic Staphylococcal infections in a delayed treatment scenario that previously indicated the limited use of local vancomycin. By applying rifampin powder directly to the contaminated segmental defect, the number of bacteria, as well as clinical indications of infection, were significantly reduced compared to vancomycin and daptomycin. Considering the Infectious Disease Society of America's recommendation to use rifampin in combination with another antibiotic to reduce the onset of rifampin resistance, rifampin powder was also applied in combination with vancomycin or daptomycin with insignificant changes in eradication performance.

This article gives an overview on these activities and links them to other relevant research. Results from the NCA springs and comparable sites revealed that spring water harbors abundant natural microbial communities even in aquifers with high water residence times and the absence of immediate surface influence. Apparently, hydrogeology has a strong impact on the concentration and size of the observed microbes, and total cell counts (TCC) were suggested as a useful means for spring type classification. Measurement of microbial activities at the NCA springs revealed extremely low microbial growth rates in the base flow component of the studied spring waters and indicated the importance of biofilm-associated microbial activities in sediments and on rock surfaces. Based on genetic analysis, the autochthonous microbial endokarst community (AMEC) versus transient microbial endokarst community (TMEC) concept was proposed for the NCA springs, and further details within this overview article are given to prompt its future evaluation. In this regard, it is well known that during high-discharge situations, surface-associated microbes and nutrients such as from soil habitats or human settlements-potentially containing fecal-associated pathogens as the most critical water-quality hazard-may be rapidly flushed into vulnerable karst aquifers. In this context, a framework for the comprehensive analysis of microbial pollution has been proposed for the NCA springs to support the sustainable management of drinking water safety in accordance with recent World Health Organization guidelines. Near-real-time online water quality monitoring, microbial source tracking (MST) and MST-guided quantitative microbial-risk assessment (QMRA) are examples of the proposed analytical tools. In this context, this overview article also provides a short introduction to recently emerging methodologies in microbiological diagnostics to support reading for the practitioner.

Over the years extensive use and misuse of antimicrobial agents has led to emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensive drug resistant (XDR) pathogens. This drastic escalation in resistant phenotype has limited the efficacy of available therapeutic options. Thus, the need of the hour is to look for alternative therapeutic approaches to mitigate healthcare concerns caused due to MDR bacterial infections. Nanoparticles have gathered much attention as potential candidates for antibacterial therapy. Equipped with advantages of, wide spectrum bactericidal activity at very low dosage, inhibitor of biofilm formation and ease of permeability, nanoparticles have been considered as leading therapeutic candidates to curtail infections resulting from MDR bacteria. However, substrate non-specificity of efflux pumps, particularly those belonging to resistance nodulation division super family, have been reported to reduce efficacy of many potent antibacterial therapeutic drugs. Previously, we had reported antibacterial activity of polysaccharide-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) toward MDR bacteria. We showed that AgNPs inhibits biofilm formation and alters expression of cytoskeletal proteins FtsZ and FtsA, with minimal cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. In the present study, we report no reduction in antibacterial efficacy of silver nanoparticles in presence of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump proteins. Antibacterial tests were performed according to CLSI macrobroth dilution method, which revealed that both silver nanoparticles exhibited bactericidal activity at very low concentrations. Further, immunoblotting results indicated that both the nanoparticles modulate the transporter AcrB protein expression. However, expression of the membrane fusion protein AcrA did show a significant increase after exposure to AgNPs. Our results indicate that both silver nanoparticles are effective in eliminating MDR Enterobacter cloacae isolates and their action was not inhibited by AcrAB-TolC efflux protein expression. As such, the above nanoparticles have strong potential to be used as effective and alternate therapeutic candidates to combat MDR gram-negative Enterobacterial pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Mitali Mishra"},{"name":"Satish Kumar"},{"name":"Rakesh K Majhi"},{"name":"Luna Goswami"},{"name":"Chandan Goswami"},{"name":"Harapriya Mohapatra"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AcrAB-TolC"},{"word":"Enterobacter cloacae"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"efflux pump"},{"word":"nanoparticles"}]},"article224":{"pmid":"29780361","title":"Challenges and Promises for Planning Future Clinical Research Into Bacteriophage Therapy Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic Fibrosis. An Argumentative Review.","abs":"Although early aggressive and prolonged treatment with specific antibiotics can extend survival in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) colonized by opportunistic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), antibiotics fail to eradicate the infecting multidrug-resistant (MDR) PA strains in CF. Century-long research has suggested treating patients with bacteriophages (phages, prokaryotic viruses) naturally hosted by bacteria. Although the only phage types used in therapy, lytic phages, lyse PA aggregated in biofilm matrix by depolymerase degrading enzymes, how they can effectively, safely, and persistently do so in patients with CF is unclear. Even though advanced techniques for formulating phage cocktails, training phages and collecting phage libraries have improved efficacy in vitro, whether personalized or ready-to-use therapeutic approaches or phages and antibiotics combined are effective and safe in vivo, and can reduce PA biofilms, remains debatable. Hence, to advance clinical research on phage therapy in clinical trials, also involving mucoid and non-mucoid multidrug-resistant PA in CF, and overcome problems in Western international regulations, we need reliable and repeatable information from experiments in vitro and in vivo on phage characterization, cocktail selection, personalized approaches, and phages combined with antibiotics. These findings, challenges, and promises prompted us to undertake this argumentative review to seek up-to-date information from papers describing lytic phage activity tested in vitro on PA laboratory strains, and PA strains from chronic infections including CF. We also reviewed in vivo studies on phage activity on pulmonary and non-pulmonary animal host models infected by laboratory or CF PA strains. Our argumentative review provides essential information showing that future phage clinical research in CF should use well-characterized and selected phages isolated against CF PA, tested in vitro under dynamic conditions in cocktails or combined with antibiotics, and in vivo on non-pulmonary and pulmonary host models infected with mucoid and non-mucoid CF MDR PA. Our findings should encourage pharmaceutical industries to conduct clinical trials in vitro and in vivo testing patented genomic engineered phages from phage libraries combined with antibiotics to treat or even prevent multidrug-resistant PA in CF, thus helping international regulatory agencies to plan future clinical research on phage therapy in CF.","authors":[{"name":"Martina Rossitto"},{"name":"Ersilia V Fiscarelli"},{"name":"Paola Rosati"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteriophage therapy"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"efficiency of plating"},{"word":"lytic phages"},{"word":"multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"phage cocktails"},{"word":"phages and antibiotics combined"}]},"article225":{"pmid":"29780184","title":"Pore-Scale Hydrodynamics in a Progressively Bioclogged Three-Dimensional Porous Medium: 3-D Particle Tracking Experiments and Stochastic Transport Modeling.","abs":"Biofilms are ubiquitous bacterial communities that grow in various porous media including soils, trickling, and sand filters. In these environments, they play a central role in services ranging from degradation of pollutants to water purification. Biofilms dynamically change the pore structure of the medium through selective clogging of pores, a process known as bioclogging. This affects how solutes are transported and spread through the porous matrix, but the temporal changes to transport behavior during bioclogging are not well understood. To address this uncertainty, we experimentally study the hydrodynamic changes of a transparent 3-D porous medium as it experiences progressive bioclogging. Statistical analyses of the system's hydrodynamics at four time points of bioclogging (0, 24, 36, and 48 h in the exponential growth phase) reveal exponential increases in both average and variance of the flow velocity, as well as its correlation length. Measurements for spreading, as mean-squared displacements, are found to be non-Fickian and more intensely superdiffusive with progressive bioclogging, indicating the formation of preferential flow pathways and stagnation zones. A gamma distribution describes well the Lagrangian velocity distributions and provides parameters that quantify changes to the flow, which evolves from a parallel pore arrangement under unclogged conditions, toward a more serial arrangement with increasing clogging. Exponentially evolving hydrodynamic metrics agree with an exponential bacterial growth phase and are used to parameterize a correlated continuous time random walk model with a stochastic velocity relaxation. The model accurately reproduces transport observations and can be used to resolve transport behavior at intermediate time points within the exponential growth phase considered.","authors":[{"name":"M Carrel"},{"name":"V L Morales"},{"name":"M Dentz"},{"name":"N Derlon"},{"name":"E Morgenroth"},{"name":"M Holzner"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3‐D porous medium"},{"word":"3‐D‐PTV"},{"word":"anomalous transport"},{"word":"bioclogging"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"correlated CTRW"}]},"article226":{"pmid":"29778938","title":"Effects of short- and long-term exposure of silver nanoparticles and silver ions to Nitrosomonas europaea biofilms and planktonic cells.","abs":"The increasing use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in consumer products, and their resulting influx into wastewater, may pose a threat to biological nutrient removal in wastewater treatment plants.

In the medium-term study (66 days), the removal of four OMPs in all the columns increased by 2-58% from day 25 to day 66, and was mainly attributed to microbial degradation. Furthermore, Community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis indicates that material presence shaped the microbial community metabolic function not only in the interstitial water but also in the biofilm.

Here, we describe a set of tools that can be used to rapidly engineer deletions and insertions in the V. fischeri chromosome without cloning. We developed a uniform approach for generating deletions using PCR splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) with antibiotic cassettes flanked by standardized linker sequences. PCR SOEing of the cassettes to sequences up- and downstream of the target gene generates a DNA product that can be directly introduced by natural transformation. Selection for the introduced antibiotic resistance marker yields the deletion of interest in a single step. Because these cassettes also contain FRT (FLP recognition target) sequences flanking the resistance marker, Flp recombinase can be used to generate an unmarked, in-frame deletion. We developed a similar methodology and tools for the rapid insertion of specific genes at a benign site in the chromosome for purposes such as complementation. Finally, we generated derivatives of these tools to facilitate different applications, such as inducible gene expression and assessing protein production.

Quorum sensing (QS) plays a crucial role in the regulation of many cell functions; however, whether QS systems play a role in P. denitrificans is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that iron uptake systems in P. denitrificans were directly regulated by a newly identified QS system. Genes coding for TonB-dependent systems, which transport chelated iron, were transcribed at higher levels in the QS-defective mutants. In contrast, genes coding for the Fbp system, which is TonB independent and transports unchelated ferric iron, were downregulated in the mutants. In brief, QS in P. denitrificans triggers a switch in iron uptake from TonB-dependent to TonB-independent transport during biofilm formation as higher concentrations of iron accumulate in the exopolysaccharide (EPS). Switching from TonB-dependent iron uptake systems to TonB-independent systems not only prevents cells from absorbing excess iron but also conserves energy. Our data suggest that iron uptake strategies are directly regulated by QS in Paracoccus denitrificans to support their survival in available ecological niches.","authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang"},{"name":"Jie Gao"},{"name":"Lushan Wang"},{"name":"Shuangjiang Liu"},{"name":"Zhihui Bai"},{"name":"Xuliang Zhuang"},{"name":"Guoqiang Zhuang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"RNA-seq"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"iron transport system"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article238":{"pmid":"29776416","title":"Rapid urease test (RUT) for evaluation of urease activity in oral bacteria in vitro and in supragingival dental plaque ex vivo.","abs":"Urease is an enzyme produced by plaque bacteria hydrolysing urea from saliva and gingival exudate into ammonia in order to regulate the pH in the dental biofilm.

These flexible fibres mediate twitching motility, biofilm maturation, surface adhesion, and virulence. The pilus is composed mainly of major pilin subunits while the low abundance minor pilins FimU-PilVWXE and the putative adhesin PilY1 prime pilus assembly and are proposed to form the pilus tip. The minor pilins and PilY1 are encoded in an operon that is positively regulated by the FimS-AlgR two-component system. Independent of pilus assembly, PilY1 was proposed to be a mechanosensory component that-in conjunction with minor pilins-triggers up-regulation of acute virulence phenotypes upon surface attachment. Here, we investigated the link between the minor pilins/PilY1 and virulence. pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants had reduced virulence towards Caenorhabditis elegans relative to wild type or a major pilin mutant, implying a role in pathogenicity that is independent of pilus assembly. We hypothesized that loss of specific minor pilins relieves feedback inhibition on FimS-AlgR, increasing transcription of the AlgR regulon and delaying C. elegans killing. Reporter assays confirmed that FimS-AlgR were required for increased expression of the minor pilin operon upon loss of select minor pilins. Overexpression of AlgR or its hyperactivation via a phosphomimetic mutation reduced virulence, and the virulence defects of pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants required FimS-AlgR expression and activation. We propose that PilY1 and the minor pilins inhibit their own expression, and that loss of these proteins leads to FimS-mediated activation of AlgR that suppresses expression of acute-phase virulence factors and delays killing. This mechanism could contribute to adaptation of P. aeruginosa in chronic lung infections, as mutations in the minor pilin operon result in the loss of piliation and increased expression of AlgR-dependent virulence factors-such as alginate-that are characteristic of such infections.","authors":[{"name":"Victoria A Marko"},{"name":"Sara L N Kilmury"},{"name":"Lesley T MacNeil"},{"name":"Lori L Burrows"}],"keywords":[]},"article243":{"pmid":"29775462","title":"Analytical scaling relations to evaluate leakage and intrusion in intermittent water supply systems.","abs":"Intermittent water supplies (IWS) deliver piped water to one billion people; this water is often microbially contaminated. Contaminants that accumulate while IWS are depressurized are flushed into customers' homes when these systems become pressurized. In addition, during the steady-state phase of IWS, contaminants from higher-pressure sources (e.g., sewers) may continue to intrude where pipe pressure is low. To guide the operation and improvement of IWS, this paper proposes an analytic model relating supply pressure, supply duration, leakage, and the volume of intruded, potentially-contaminated, fluids present during flushing and steady-state. The proposed model suggests that increasing the supply duration may improve water quality during the flushing phase, but decrease the subsequent steady-state water quality. As such, regulators and academics should take more care in reporting if water quality samples are taken during flushing or steady-state operational conditions. Pipe leakage increases with increased supply pressure and/or duration. We propose using an equivalent orifice area (EOA) to quantify pipe quality. This provides a more stable metric for regulators and utilities tracking pipe repairs. Finally, we show that the volume of intruded fluid decreases in proportion to reductions in EOA. The proposed relationships are applied to self-reported performance indicators for IWS serving 108 million people described in the IBNET database and in the Benchmarking and Data Book of Water Utilities in India.

LEDs emit broad-spectrum white light, with a significant amount of photosynthetically active radiation, and typically a high content of blue light that regulates circadian rhythms in many organisms. While effects of the shift to LED have been investigated in nocturnal animals, its impact on primary producers is unknown. We performed three field experiments in a lowland agricultural drainage ditch to assess the impacts of a transition from high-pressure sodium (HPS) to white LED illumination (color temperature 4000 K) on primary producers in periphyton. In all experiments, we compared biomass and pigment composition of periphyton grown under a natural light regime to that of periphyton exposed to nocturnal HPS or, consecutively, LED light of intensities commonly found in urban waters (approximately 20 lux). Periphyton was collected in time series (1-13 weeks). We found no effect of HPS light on periphyton biomass; however, following a shift to LED the biomass decreased up to 62%. Neither light source had a substantial effect on pigment composition. The contrasting effects of the two light sources on biomass may be explained by differences in their spectral composition, and in particular the blue content. Our results suggest that spectral composition of the light source plays a role in determining the impacts of ALAN on periphyton and that the ongoing transition to LED may increase the ecological impacts of artificial lighting on aquatic primary producers.

Improving methods for controlling the immobilization of bacteria provides powerful experimental tools for testing hypotheses regarding microbiome interactions, studying the transfer of nutrients between bacterial species, and developing microbial communities for green energy production and pollution remediation.","authors":[{"name":"Ariel L Furst"},{"name":"Matthew J Smith"},{"name":"Matthew B Francis"}],"keywords":[]},"article260":{"pmid":"29771309","title":"Identification of a specific domain of Porphyromonas gingivalis Hgp44 responsible for adhesion to Treponema denticola.","abs":"Interaction between two periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola, contributes to plaque biofilm formation.

Six plasmids harboring fragments in this region were generated by PCR amplification and self-ligation, and recombinant proteins r-Hgp44 (residues 1-419), r-Hgp441 (residues 1-124), r-Hgp442 (1-199), r-Hgp443 (1-316), r-Hgp444 (199-419), r-Hgp445 (124-198) and r-Hgp446 (199-316) were produced, as confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. r-Hgp44, r-Hgp443 and r-Hgp446 showed greater adhesion to T. denticola sonicates than the control, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. r-Hgp446 reduced the coaggregation of P. gingivalis and T. denticola. Scanning electron and confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses revealed that r-Hgp446 reduced dual-species biofilm formation. Our results indicate that residues 199-316 of P. gingivalis Hgp44 are mainly responsible for adhesion to T. denticola; inhibiting this domain could potentially disrupt periodontopathic biofilm formation and maturation.","authors":[{"name":"Kouki Yoshikawa"},{"name":"Yuichiro Kikuchi"},{"name":"Eitoyo Kokubu"},{"name":"Kentaro Imamura"},{"name":"Atsushi Saito"},{"name":"Kazuyuki Ishihara"}],"keywords":[]},"article261":{"pmid":"29771236","title":"Can dalbavancin be used as a catheter lock solution?","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Cristina Díaz-Ruíz"},{"name":"Beatriz Alonso"},{"name":"Emilia Cercenado"},{"name":"Raquel Cruces"},{"name":"Emilio Bouza"},{"name":"Patricia Muñoz"},{"name":"María Guembe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Catheter-related bloodstream infection"},{"word":"dalbavancin"},{"word":"lock therapy"},{"word":"vancomycin"}]},"article262":{"pmid":"29771131","title":"Mouthwash containing Croton doctoris essential oil: in vitro study using a validated model of caries induction.","abs":"To validate an in vitro caries model and to evaluate an experimental mouthwash containing Croton doctoris essential oil.  Materials & methods: To validate the experimental model, we used McBain medium and polymicrobial biofilms.

The relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria, Pseudoalteromonas, and Planococcaceae decreased, possibly due to the phage-induced disruption of the biofilm matrix. Lastly, when applied to mitigate biofouling of ultrafiltration membranes, bacteriophages were determined to reduce the transmembrane pressure increase by 18% when utilized alone, and by 49% when used in combination with citric acid. The combined treatment was more effective compared with the citric acid treatment alone, which reported ca. 30% transmembrane pressure reduction.

The profound clinical success of SDF has drawn many clinicians and researchers to study the mechanism of SDF in arresting dentine caries. This critical review discusses how silver and fluoride contribute to caries arrest, in terms of their effects on bacteria as well as on the mineral and organic content of dentine. Silver interacts with bacterial cell membrane and bacterial enzymes, which can inhibit bacterial growth. Silver can also dope into hydroxyapatite and have an antibacterial effect on silver-doped hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, silver is also a strong inhibitor of cathepsins and inhibits dentine collagen degradation. Early studies proposed that silver hardened caries lesions by forming silver phosphate. However, recent studies found that little silver phosphate remained on the arrested dentine lesion. The principal silver precipitate was silver chloride, which could not contribute to the significant hardening of the arrested lesions. On the other hand, fluoride enhances mineral formation by forming fluorohydroxyapatite with reduced solubility. A significant increase in microhardness occurs with an elevated level of calcium and phosphorus but not silver on the surface layer of the arrested dentine caries lesion following SDF treatment. Fluoride also inhibits matrix metalloproteinases activities and therefore inhibits dentine collagen degradation. The combination of silver and fluoride in an alkaline solution has a synergistic effect in arresting dentine caries. The alkaline property of SDF provides an unfavorable environment for collagen enzyme activation. Understanding the mechanisms of SDF in arresting dentine caries helps clinicians to develop appropriate protocols for the use of SDF in clinical care.","authors":[{"name":"M L Mei"},{"name":"E C M Lo"},{"name":"C H Chu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"apatites"},{"word":"biofilm(s)"},{"word":"collagen(s)"},{"word":"demineralization"},{"word":"hydroxyapatite"},{"word":"remineralization"}]},"article269":{"pmid":"29768936","title":"Nutrient removal and biomass production: advances in microalgal biotechnology for wastewater treatment.","abs":"Owing to certain drawbacks, such as energy-intensive operations in conventional modes of wastewater treatment (WWT), there has been an extensive search for alternative strategies in treatment technology.

Using a model of bacterial colonization of the anterior nares, we investigate oscillatory patterns related to intermittent carriage of S. aureus. Following several studies using global sensitivity analysis techniques, various insights into the model's behaviour were made including interacting effects of the bacteria's growth rate and movement in the mucus, suggesting parameter connections associated with biofilm-like behaviour. Here the bacterial growth rate and bacterial movement are explicitly connected, leading to expanded oscillatory behaviour in the model. We suggest possible implications that this oscillatory behaviour can have on the definition of intermittent carriage and discuss differences in the bacterial virulence dependent upon individual host health.

Therefore, it is imperative for implants not only to depress microbial activity and biofilm colonization but also to prompt osteoblast functions and osseointegration. As part of the coating development for implants, the interest of in vitro studies on the interaction between implant substrate morphology and the coating's biological performances is growing. In this study, by harnessing the adhesion and reactivity of bioinspired polydopamine, nano-silver was successfully anchored onto micro/nanoporous as well as smooth titanium surfaces to analyse the effect of substrate morphology on biological performances of the coatings. Compared with the smooth surface, a small size of nano-silver and high silver content was found on the micro/nanoporous surface. More mineralization happened on the coating on the micro/nanoporous structure than on the smooth surface, which led to a more rapid decrease of silver release from the micro/nanoporous surface. Antimicrobial tests indicated that both surfaces with resulting coating inhibit microbial colonization on them and growth around them, indicating that the coating eliminates the shortcoming of the porous structure which render the implant extremely susceptible to BAI. Besides, the multiple osteoblast responses of nano-silver-loaded dopamine coatings on both surfaces, i.e. attachment, proliferation and differentiation, have deteriorated, however the mineralized surfaces of these coatings stimulated osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, especially for the micro/nanoporous surface. Therefore, nano-silver-loaded dopamine coatings on micro/nanoporous substratum may not only reduce the risk of infection but also facilitate mineralization during the early post-operative period and then promote osseointegration owing to the good osteoblast-biocompatibility of the mineralized surface.

Recently, we have described an engineered antimicrobial peptide derived from the human RNase3, also named the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), RN3 (5-36), which combines bactericidal activity with high cell agglutination and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affinity. Through a single replacement scan library using the SPOT methodology we have evaluated both the contribution of sequence positioning and amino acid singularity towards the peptide biological and physicochemical properties. Results indicate that the ECP N-terminus has already been extensively improved through evolution to provide high antimicrobial activity; hence most substitutions improving its antimicrobial performance are in detriment of safety towards host tissues. Only three positions were identified, occupied by polar residues on the first α-helix of the protein and replaceable by a hydrophobic residue, allowing an extended N-terminal patch that mediates bacterial agglutination. Among the best candidates, an Ile replacement proved best in improving the peptide therapeutic window. The novel engineered peptides encompass both the LPS-binding and aggregation-prone regions of parental ECP, providing the appropriate structural features for peptide attachment to the bacterial exopolysaccharide layer and bacterial cell membrane destabilization, thereby promoting biofilm removal at micro molar concentrations. We conclude that the novel engineered peptides are promising lead candidates against Gram-negative biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"David Pulido"},{"name":"Guillem Prats-Ejarque"},{"name":"Clara Villalba"},{"name":"Marcel Albacar"},{"name":"Mohammed Moussaoui"},{"name":"David Andreu"},{"name":"Rudolf Volkmer"},{"name":"Marc Torrent"},{"name":"Ester Boix"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Single replacement scan library"}]},"article286":{"pmid":"29763755","title":"Salmonella enterica growth and biofilm formation in flesh and peel cantaloupe extracts on four food-contact surfaces.","abs":"Salmonella enterica is responsible for the highest number of foodborne disease outbreaks pertaining to cantaloupe industry.

In addition, Salmonella is able to perform a type of cell-to-cell communication called quorum sensing, which leads to differential gene expression. The quorum sensing system mediated by AI-1, acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), is incomplete in Salmonella because the luxI homolog gene, which encodes for AI-1 synthase, is missing in the genome. However, a homologue of LuxR, known as SdiA, is present and allows the detection of signaling molecules produced by other species of bacteria, leading to regulation of gene expression, mainly related to virulence and biofilm formation. Thus, in view of the importance of quorum sensing on the physiology regulation of microorganisms, the aim of the present study was to perform a virtual screening of plant compounds and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NASIDs) for inhibition of quorum sensing by molecular docking and biofilm formation in Salmonella. In general, most plant compounds and all NSAIDs bound in, at least, one of the three modeled structures of SdiA proteins of Salmonella Enteritidis PT4 578. In addition, many tested compounds had higher binding affinities than the AHLs and the furanones which are inducers and inhibitors of quorum sensing, respectively. The Z-phytol and lonazolac molecules were good candidates for the in vitro inhibition tests of quorum sensing mediated by AI-1 and biofilm formation in Salmonella. Thus, this study directs future prospecting of plant extracts for inhibition of quorum sensing mechanism depending on AHL and biofilm formation. In addition, the use of inhibitors of quorum sensing and biofilm formation can be combined with antibiotics for better treatment efficacy, as well as the use of these compounds to design new drugs.","authors":[{"name":"Felipe Alves de Almeida"},{"name":"Erika Lorena Giraldo Vargas"},{"name":"Deisy Guimarães Carneiro"},{"name":"Uelinton Manoel Pinto"},{"name":"Maria Cristina Dantas Vanetti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-biofilm"},{"word":"Lonazolac"},{"word":"Quorum quenching"},{"word":"SdiA protein"},{"word":"Z-phytol"}]},"article289":{"pmid":"29763724","title":"Influence of environmental and genotypic factors on biofilm formation by clinical isolates of group B streptococci.","abs":"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonizes the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts of approximately 30% of women, and it can cause sepsis and meningitis in neonates.

Several E. coli mechanisms are regulated by Quorum sensing (QS), including virulence factors and biofilm formation.

Suppressor of division inhibitor (SdiA) is a QS receptor present in atypical enteropathogenic E.coli (aEPEC) that detects acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) type autoinducers. However, these bacteria do not encode an AHL synthase, but they are capable of sensing AHL molecules produced by other species, establishing an inter-species bacterial communication. In this study, we performed experiments to evaluate pellicle, ring-like structure and biofilm formation on wild type, sdiA mutants and complemented strains. We also evaluated the transcription of genes involved in different stages of biofilm formation, such as bcsA, csgA, csgD, fliC and fimA. The sdiA mutants were capable of forming thicker biofilm structures and showed increased motility when compared to wild type and complemented strains. Moreover, they also showed denser pellicles and ring-like structures. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated increased csgA, csgD and fliC transcription on mutant strains. Biofilm formation, as well as csgD, csgA and fimA transcription decreased on wild type strains by the addition of AHL.

However, the MICs of ciprofloxacin were lower in CIP-resistant isolates selected from the biofilm population than the MICs of CIP-resistant isolates from the planktonic cultures. We found common evolutionary trajectories between the different lineages, with mutations in known CIP resistance determinants as well as growth condition-dependent adaptations. We observed a general trend toward a reduction in type IV-pilus-dependent motility (twitching) in CIP-evolved populations and a loss of virulence-associated traits in the populations evolved in the absence of antibiotic.

Several pathways, including the bacterium's primary quorum sensing system, had significantly lower expression in human infections than in many laboratory conditions.

Here, the effects of the species, concentrations, and speciation of the heavy metals Cu, Pb, and Cr, and the metalloid As on the sorption of pentachlorophenol (PCP), as a model OCP, by river biofilms were investigated through batch experiments.

The inhibitory effects of heavy metals on PCP sorption by biofilms were enhanced as the cation valence state increased, while the effects were weakened as the anionic acid radical valence state increased.

Also, the size of silver nanoparticles in the products' suspensions was determined using single particle (sp)ICPMS. Two of the six nanoproducts inhibited growth of Escherichia coli and Bacillus atrophaeus bacteria (MICs of 40,000 and 160,000 ppm).

Yet, they had the smallest nanosilver particles: mean size of ~20 to 30 nm vs. ~45 nm for the other products. Their suspensions were more acidic (pH ~3-5) and had higher concentrations of zinc and magnesium compared to other products. This research illustrates that some consumer nanoproducts have antibacterial potential and may affect our microbiota.

Biofilm cells appeared to be encased in a dense matrix material, and the total biomass of the biofilm increased with incubation time. To gain insight into the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between biofilm and planktonic cells, we carried out comparative transcriptomic analysis using RNA sequencing. In total, 91 genes were significantly differentially expressed, with 40 being up-regulated and 51 down-regulated. In particular, genes encoding sortase, ribosomal proteins, and ATP synthase were up-regulated in biofilms, while genes coding for clostripain and phospholipase C were down-regulated. To validate the RNA sequencing results, qRT-PCR analysis was performed using five randomly selected DEGs. Results showed that all five genes were up-regulated, which was in accordance with the RNA sequencing results. To examine the functional differences, the DEGs were characterized by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Results showed that the up-regulated genes were divided into 32 significantly enriched GO terms, with macromolecular complex being the most common.

The bacterial community operating in this innovative reactor was studied, and its composition and response to different operating conditions were characterized. A stable biomass, dominated by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Acidithiobacillus was selected from inside the MBBTF reactor, and temperature, pH and bed rotation were shown to be the main factors driving the community structure. Moreover, data from different approaches indicated an uneven spatial distribution of biofilm inside the studied reactor, due to the combined effect of fluid dynamics and substrate gradients within the bed volume. Despite the high removal efficiency achieved by this innovative prototype (80% on average), the data suggested that the result could be improved by adopting solutions for a more stable and even biofilm distribution. It was shown that short frequent bed rotations, rather than long scattered rotations, ensured biomass stability.

In view of their potential application in marine environments, degradation of the developed composites was evaluated under simulated and real marine environmental conditions for 1 year. Using 10 wt % of acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) as a plasticizer, smooth processing was achieved for up to 30 wt % of PO fibers, despite the reduction of the melt fluidity observed with increasing fiber loading. The tensile modulus slightly increased (from 2 to 2.4 GPa) while the tensile strength and the elongation decreased (from 23.6 to 21.5 MPa and from 3.2 to 1.9%, respectively) by increasing the PO fiber content from 0 to 30 wt %. Interestingly, the impact resistance of the composites increased with the increasing of the PO content: the Charpy&rsquo;s impact energy increased from 3.6 (without fiber) to 4.4 kJ/m² for the composite with 30 wt %. The results of the aerobic biodegradation under simulated marine conditions showed that the presence of PO fibers favored the physical disintegration of the composite increasing the biodegradation rate of the polymeric matrix: after 216 days, the composite with 20 wt % PO fibers showed a biodegradability of about 30% compared to 20% of the composite without fibers. Under real marine conditions, the specimens containing PO fibers showed higher weight losses and deterioration of tensile properties compared to those without fibers. Presumably, biodegradation occurred after colonization of the specimen, and the specimens with 20 wt % PO fibers showed well-developed biofilm consisting of bacteria and fungi on the surface after only 3 months of incubation in marine sediments, unlike the no-fiber specimens. Consequently, the persistence of an adequate mechanical performance for a relatively long period (1 year), due to a moderate rate of biodegradation in the marine environment, make the developed PHBV/PO composites particularly suitable for the production of relatively low-cost and biodegradable items which are usable in the sea and/or sand dunes, increasing the market opportunities for biopolymers such as PHBV and, at the same time, finding an eco-sustainable valorization for the PO fibrous residues accumulated in large quantities on Mediterranean beaches, which represents a problem for coastal municipalities.","authors":[{"name":"Maurizia Seggiani"},{"name":"Patrizia Cinelli"},{"name":"Elena Balestri"},{"name":"Norma Mallegni"},{"name":"Eleonora Stefanelli"},{"name":"Alessia Rossi"},{"name":"Claudio Lardicci"},{"name":"Andrea Lazzeri"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PHBV"},{"word":"Posidonia oceanica"},{"word":"biocomposites"},{"word":"biodegradability"},{"word":"degradation"},{"word":"poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate)"}]},"article345":{"pmid":"29751512","title":"Screening of Natural Product Derivatives Identifies Two Structurally Related Flavonoids as Potent Quorum Sensing Inhibitors against Gram-Negative Bacteria.","abs":"Owing to the failure of conventional antibiotics in biofilm control, alternative approaches are urgently needed.

Additional studies also confirmed that introducing high doses of the predators into animals does not negatively impact animal well-being and might assist in reducing bacterial burden in vivo.

Recently, many ncRNAs have been discovered to be transcribed or processed from 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs). Here we reported a novel 3' UTR-derived ncRNA, RibS, which could influence biofilm formation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). RibS was confirmed to be a ∼700 nt processed product produced by RNase III-catalyzed cleavage from the 3' UTR of riboflavin synthase subunit alpha mRNA, RibE. Overexpression of RibS increased the expression of the cyclopropane fatty acid synthase gene, cfa, which was located at the antisense strand. Biofilm formation of S. Typhi was enhanced by overexpressing RibS both in the wild type strain and cfa deletion mutant. Deletion of cfa attenuated biofilm formation of S. Typhi, while complementation of cfa partly restored the phenotype. Moreover, overexpressing cfa enhanced the biofilm formation of S. Typhi. In summary, RibS has been identified as a novel ncRNA derived from the 3' UTR of RibE that promotes biofilm formation of S. Typhi, and it appears to do so, at least in part, by increasing the expression of cfa.","authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhao"},{"name":"Rui Liu"},{"name":"Hao Tang"},{"name":"George Osei-Adjei"},{"name":"Shungao Xu"},{"name":"Ying Zhang"},{"name":"Xinxiang Huang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Non-coding RNA"},{"word":"RibS"},{"word":"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi"},{"word":"cfa"}]},"article353":{"pmid":"29751064","title":"Mechanistic and phenotypic studies of bicarinalin, BP100 and colistin action on Acinetobacter baumannii.","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii has been identified by the WHO as a high priority pathogen.

Due to protein complexity, most evaluations of protein conductivity are based on the simple estimation of protein's molecular orbital energy levels and spatial distributions without analysing its protein interaction with electrodes and the calculation of the rates of electron transfer (ET). In the present work, we included in our density functional theory (DFT) analysis an approach based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) allowing for calculation from the first principles the molecular interaction with electrodes and thus the role of electrode materials, Fermi level, the thermal distribution of electronic energy levels, and the coupling efficiency between the molecule and the electrodes. Compared to proteins studied so far, mainly artificial peptides, heme-containing cytochromes, and bacterial pili, we choose rubredoxin for our calculation. Rubredoxin contains a non-heme iron that, as we have discovered recently, can be involved in extracellular ET in electroactive bacterial biofilms (Yates et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2016, 9, 3544-3558). Our calculations show that an iron atom incorporated into the protein structure as an iron-sulfur cluster opens a transmission path at the energy corresponding to the Fermi level of the electrodes. This allows the protein to become an extremely efficient conductor at very low bias voltages (<±350 mV). Calculation of the role of protein amino acids based on the local density of states and electron transfer paths reveals that neither aromatic amino acid Tyr nor Phe at any ring orientation participates in coherent ET through the FeS cluster of the protein. Moreover, direct ET through surrounding amino acids, bypassing FeS, is possible only at biases ±1.5 to ±2 V. The polar amino acid Asn might participate in ET at these bias voltages. The conductivity of the protein core substantially depends on the polarity of the applied electric field, allowing for unidirectional ET and operation of the protein as a molecular rectifier. These results can be used for a wise de novo design of proteins for molecular electronics and cellular energy converting devices, particularly for utilization of iron doping in the construction of conductive protein wires.","authors":[{"name":"Nikolai Lebedev"},{"name":"Igor Griva"},{"name":"Anders Blom"},{"name":"Leonard M Tender"}],"keywords":[]},"article361":{"pmid":"29748556","title":"Regulatory protein SrpA controls phage infection and core cellular processes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind bacteria-phage interactions remains limited.

The development of a novel bioassay to assess the activity of NP-containing and biocide-containing coatings against marine biofilm formation has been achieved using a high-throughput microplate reader and highly sensitive confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), as well as nucleic acid staining. Juglone, an isolated NP that has previously shown efficacy against bacterial attachment, was incorporated into a simple coating matrix. Biofilm formation over 48 h was assessed and compared against coatings containing the NP and the commonly used booster biocide, cuprous oxide. Leaching of the NP from the coating was quantified at two time points, 24 h and 48 h, showing evidence of both juglone and cuprous oxide being released. Results from the microplate reader showed that the NP coatings exhibited antifouling efficacy, significantly inhibiting biofilm formation when compared to the control coatings, while NP coatings and the cuprous oxide coatings performed equally well. CLSM results and COMSTAT analysis on biofilm 3D morphology showed comparable results when the NP coatings were tested against the controls, with higher biofilm biovolume and maximum thickness being found on the controls.

Here we describe a method for the development of a trifunctional coating that repels contaminating bacteria, kills those that adhere, and promotes osteoblast adhesion. To this end, titanium surfaces were functionalized by electrodeposition of an antifouling polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer and subsequent binding of a peptidic platform with cell-adhesive and bactericidal properties. The physicochemical characterization of the samples via SEM, contact angle, FTIR and XPS analysis verified the successful binding of the PEG layer and the biomolecules, without altering the morphology and topography of the samples. PEG coatings inhibited protein adsorption and osteoblast-like (SaOS-2) attachment; however, the presence of cell adhesive domains rescued osteoblast adhesion, yielding higher values of cell attachment and spreading compared to controls (p < 0.05). Finally, the antibacterial potential of the coating was measured by live/dead assays and SEM using S. sanguinis as a model of early colonizer in oral biofilms. The presence of PEG layers significantly reduced bacterial attachment on the surfaces (p < 0.05). This antibacterial potential was further increased by the bactericidal peptide, yielding values of bacterial adhesion below 0.2% (p < 0.05).

Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.","authors":[{"name":"Bingbing Cheng"},{"name":"Yonatan Chatzinoff"},{"name":"Debby Szczepanski"},{"name":"Chenchen Bing"},{"name":"Sumbul Shaikh"},{"name":"Omar Wyman"},{"name":"Cameron E Perry"},{"name":"James A Richardson"},{"name":"Dennis K Burns"},{"name":"Bret M Evers"},{"name":"David E Greenberg"},{"name":"Rajiv Chopra"}],"keywords":[]},"article368":{"pmid":"29746527","title":"Characterization of a nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae thermonuclease.","abs":"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) has been shown to form biofilms, comprised of extracellular DNA (eDNA), in the middle ear and bronchus during clinical infections.

The efficacy of Se in rapid inactivation of preformed, mature EHEC biofilm was investigated by treating biofilms on polystyrene plates with the MBC of Se in combination with hot water at 80°C with a contact time of 0 min, 30 s, 2 min, and 5 min. Furthermore, the effect of Se on EHEC biofilm architecture was visualized using confocal microscopy, whereas the effect of Se on EHEC biofilm genes was determined using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Finally, the potential feasibility of coating stainless steel surfaces with Se nanoparticles to inhibit EHEC biofilm formation was studied. Se reduced early attachment of planktonic cells, biofilm formation, and EPS synthesis in EHEC ( P < 0.05). Se in combination with hot water reduced biofilm-associated bacterial counts by 3 to 4 log CFU/mL at 5 min of exposure compared with the control ( P < 0.05). However, hot water treatment alone decreased biofilm-associated bacterial counts by only 1.0 log CFU/mL. RT-qPCR results revealed that Se down-regulated the transcription of critical genes associated with biofilm synthesis in EHEC ( P < 0.05). The results collectively suggest that Se could potentially be used to control EHEC biofilms in food processing environments, but appropriate applications need to be validated.","authors":[{"name":"Meera Surendran Nair"},{"name":"Abhinav Upadhyay"},{"name":"Samantha Fancher"},{"name":"Indu Upadhyaya"},{"name":"Swayandipta Dey"},{"name":"Anup Kollanoor-Johny"},{"name":"Jing Zhao"},{"name":"Kumar Venkitanarayanan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"Selenium"}]},"article372":{"pmid":"29745728","title":"Aspergillus ochraceopetaliformis SSP13 modulates quorum sensing regulated virulence and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen causing the majority of acute and persistent infections in human beings.

Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a nonoxide biomaterial widely used in spinal implants, has shown bacteriostatic effects against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; however, the physicochemical interactions between Si3N4 and bacteria yet remain conspicuously unexplored. In situ time-lapse Raman spectroscopic experiments were conducted by exposing S. epidermidis for 12, 24, and 48 h to Si3N4 substrates to understand the evolution of bacterial metabolism and to elucidate the ceramics antimicrobial behavior. The Raman probe captured an initial metabolic response of the bacteria to the adverse chemistry of the Si3N4 surface, which included peroxidation of membrane phospholipids and protein structural modifications to adjust for survivorship. However, beyond 24 h of exposure, the Raman signals representing DNA, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates showed clear fingerprints of bacterial lysis. Bands related to biofilm formation completely disappeared or underwent drastically reduced intensity. Bacterial lysis was confirmed by conventional fluorescence microscopy methods. Spectroscopic experiments suggested that a pH change at the Si3N4's surface induced variations in the membrane structure and D-alanylation of teichoic acids in its peptidoglycan layer. Concurrent stimulation of peptidoglycan hydrolase (i.e., an enzyme involved with autolysis) ultimately led to membrane degradation and cellular death. An additional finding was that modulating the Si3N4 surface by increasing the population of amine groups improved the efficiency of the substrate against S. epidermidis, thus suggesting that optimization of the near-surface (alkaline) conditions may be a viable approach to bacterial reduction.","authors":[{"name":"Francesco Boschetto"},{"name":"Tetsuya Adachi"},{"name":"Satoshi Horiguchi"},{"name":"Danny Fainozzi"},{"name":"Fulvio Parmigiani"},{"name":"Elia Marin"},{"name":"Wenliang Zhu"},{"name":"Bryan McEntire"},{"name":"Toshiro Yamamoto"},{"name":"Narisato Kanamura"},{"name":"Osam Mazda"},{"name":"Eriko Ohgitani"},{"name":"Giuseppe Pezzotti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Raman spectroscopy"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"bacteriostatic behavior"},{"word":"silicon nitride"}]},"article377":{"pmid":"29744925","title":"Microcalorimetric detection of staphylococcal biofilm growth on various prosthetic biomaterials after exposure to daptomycin.","abs":"Primary aim of this in vitro study was to test the efficacy of daptomycin to eradicate staphylococcal biofilms on various orthopedic implant materials. Secondary aim was to quantitatively estimate the formation of staphylococcal biofilm. We tested six clinically important biomaterials: Cobalt chrome, pure titanium, grid-blasted titanium, porous plasma-coated titanium with/without hydroxyapatite, and polyethylene. Biofilms of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were formed on the samples and thereafter exposed to daptomycin. Samples were subsequently sonicated in order to detect dislodged biofilm bacteria and transferred to a microcalorimeter for real-time measurement of growth-related heat flow. Minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was determined as the lowest concentration of daptomycin required to eradicate biofilm bacteria on the sample. Median MBEC of S. aureus biofilm on smooth metallic surfaces was lower than the rough metallic surfaces. In experiments with S. epidermidis, no pattern was seen in relation to the surface roughness. Regarding the quantitative estimation of staphylococcal biofilm formation on the sample, we found a significantly higher amount of biofilm growth on the rough surfaces than the smooth samples and polyethylene. In conclusion, the presented study showed that daptomycin could eradicate S. aureus biofilm at lower concentrations on the smooth surfaces compared to the rough surfaces, as well as polyethylene. In experiments with daptomycin against S. epidermidis biofilms, no pattern was seen in relation to the surface roughness.

It can occur in any bone in the body, but it most often affects the long bones (leg and arm), vertebral (spine), and bones of the foot. Microbial success in osteomyelitis is due to their ability to form biofilms which inhibit the wound healing process and increases resistance to anti-infective agents. Also, biofilms do not allow easy penetration of antibiotics into their matrix making clinical treatment a challenge. The development of local antibiotic delivery systems that deliver high concentrations of antibiotics to the affected site is an emerging area of research with great potential. Standard treatment includes antibiotic therapy, either locally or systemically and refractory cases of osteomyelitis may lead to surgical intervention and a prolonged course of antibiotic treatment involving placement of antibiotic-doped beads or spacers within the wound site. There are disadvantages with this treatment modality including insufficient mixing of the antibiotic, lack of uniform bead size, resulting in lower antibiotic availability, and limitations on the antibiotics employed. Thus, a method is needed to address biofilm formations in the wound and on the surface of the surgical implants to prevent osteomyelitis.

Streptococcus mutans has an important role in oral bacterial biofilm formation in early stage biofilm before the microbiota shift to late stage and become more virulent.

This study aims to compare the S. mutans bacterial biofilm formation and migration on 2 different surfaces, tooth root and titanium miniscrew. The biofilm was grown with a flow cells system to imitate the oral dynamic system with PDL cells. The migration distances were measured, and the biofilm morphology was observed. Data showed that the biofilm formation on miniscrew was slower than those on tooth root at 24 hr. However, there were no difference in the morphology of the biofilm formed on the tooth root with those formed on the miniscrew at both 24 and 48 hr.

Disadvantages associated with the use of antiseptics and the growing worldwide problem of antibiotic resistance have necessitated the search for alternative agents. In this study, the antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of AM404, an active metabolite of paracetamol, were tested against P. gingivalis and other bacterial pathogens. The activity of AM404 was tested against 10 bacteria, including both oral and nonoral human pathogens. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AM404 was determined by measuring optical density (OD) values. The minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) was detected by crystal violet staining. The activity of structural analogs of AM404 was tested by MIC determinations. The effect of AM404 on P. gingivalis biofilms formed on titanium disks as a model for dental implants was evaluated by colony forming unit counting. Potential cytotoxicity of AM404 towards HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney cells), HepG2 (human hepatoma cells), IEC-6 (rat intestinal cells), and Panc-1 cells (pancreatic cancer cells) was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays.

Over half of the world's population is infected by H. pylori, which is a major cause of duodenal and gastric ulcers as well as gastric cancer. During chronic infection, H. pylori localizes within the gastric mucosal layer, including deep within invaginations called glands; thanks to its impressive ability to survive despite the harsh acidic environment, it can persist for the host's lifetime. This ability to survive and persist in the stomach is associated with urease production, chemotactic motility, and the ability to adapt to the fluctuating environment. Additionally, biofilm formation has recently been suggested to play a role in colonization. Biofilms are surface-associated communities of bacteria that are embedded in a hydrated matrix of extracellular polymeric substances. Biofilms pose a substantial health risk and are key contributors to many chronic and recurrent infections. This link between biofilm-associated bacteria and chronic infections likely results from an increased tolerance to conventional antibiotic treatments as well as immune system action. The role of this biofilm mode in antimicrobial treatment failure and H. pylori survival has yet to be determined. Furthermore, relatively little is known about the H. pylori biofilm structure or the genes associated with this mode of growth.

Objectives To evaluate the activity against S. mutans biofilm of model resin composites incorporating different concentrations of ZnO-nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) and characterize their physicochemical properties. Materials and Methods Different concentrations of ZnO-NP (wt.%): E1=0, E2=0.5, E3=1, E4=2, E5=5 and E6=10 were incorporated into a model resin composite consisting of Bis-GMA-TEGDMA and barium borosilicate particles. The activity against S. mutans biofilm was evaluated by metabolic activity and lactic acid production. The following physicochemical properties were characterized: degree of conversion (DC%), flexural strength (FS), elastic modulus (EM), hardness (KHN), water sorption (Wsp), water solubility (Wsl) and translucency (TP). Results E3, E4, E5 and E6 decreased the biofilm metabolic activity and E5 and E6 decreased the lactic acid production (p<0.05). E6 presented the lowest DC% (p<0.05). No significant difference in FS and EM was found for all resin composites (p>0.05). E5 and E6 presented the lowest values of KHN (p<0.05). E6 presented a higher Wsp than E1 (p<0.05) and the highest Wsl (p<0.05). The translucency significantly decreased as the ZnO- NP concentration increased (p<0.05). Conclusions The incorporation of 2 - 5 wt.% of ZnO-NP could endow antibacterial activity to resin composites, without jeopardizing their physicochemical properties.","authors":[{"name":"Natasha Lamego Brandão"},{"name":"Maristela Barbosa Portela"},{"name":"Luciane Cople Maia"},{"name":"Andréa Antônio"},{"name":"Vanessa Loureiro Moreira E Silva"},{"name":"Eduardo Moreira da Silva"}],"keywords":[]},"article391":{"pmid":"29741280","title":"Evaluating the role of total organic carbon in predicting the treatment efficacy of biosand filters for the removal of Vibrio cholerae in drinking water during startup.","abs":"In biosand filters (BSF), treatment is largely driven by the development of a biolayer (schmutzdecke) which establishes itself during the startup phase.

Studied mainly in prokaryotes, polyP and its associated enzymes are vital in diverse metabolic activities, in some structural functions, and most importantly in stress responses. Bacterial species, including many pathogens, encode a homolog of a major polyP synthesis enzyme, Poly Phosphate Kinase (PPK) with 2 different genes coding for PPK1 and PPK2. Genetic deletion of the ppk1 gene leads to reduced polyP levels and the consequent loss of virulence and stress adaptation responses. This far, no PPK1 homolog has been identified in higher-order eukaryotes, and, therefore, PPK1 represents a novel target for chemotherapy. The aim of the current study is to investigate PPK1 from Escherichia coli with comprehensive understanding of the enzyme's structure and binding sites, which were used to design pharmacophores and screen a library of compounds for potential discovery of selective PPK1 inhibitors. Verification of the resultant inhibitors activities was conducted using a combination of mutagenic and chemical biological approaches. The metabolic phenotypic maps of the wild type E. coli (WT) and ppk1 knockout mutant were generated and compared with the metabolic map of the chemically inhibited WT. In addition, biofilm formation ability was measured in WT, ppk1 knockout mutant, and the chemically inhibited WT.

V. cholerae is known to form biofilms on the gut epithelium, and the biofilms once formed are resistant to the action of antibiotics. Therefore agents that prevent the biofilm formation and disperse the preformed biofilms are associated with therapeutic benefits. The use of antibiotics for the treatment of cholera is associated with side effects such as gut dysbiosis due to depletion of gut microflora, and the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Thus search for safe alternative therapeutic agents is warranted. Herein, we screened the lactobacilli spp. isolated from the fecal samples of healthy children for their abilities to prevent biofilm formation and to disperse the preformed biofilms of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus by using an in vitro assay. The results showed that the culture supernatant (CS) of all the seven isolates of Lactobacillus spp. used in the study inhibited the biofilm formation of V. cholerae by more than 90%. Neutralization of pH of CS completely abrogated their antimicrobial activities against V. cholera, but had negligible effects on their biofilm inhibitory potential. Further, CS of all the lactobacilli isolates caused the dispersion of preformed V. cholerae biofilms in the range 62-85%; however, pH neutralization of CS reduced the biofilm dispersal potential of the 4 out of 7 isolates by 19-57%. Furthermore, the studies showed that CS of none of the lactobacilii isolates had antimicrobial activity against V. parahaemolyticus, but 5 out of 7 isolates inhibited the formation of its biofilm in the range 62-82%. However, none of the CS dispersed the preformed biofilms of V. parahaemolyticus. The ability of CS to inhibit the adherence of Vibrio spp. to the epithelial cell line was also determined. Thus, we conclude that the biofilm dispersive action of CS of lactobacilli is strain-specific and pH-dependent. As Vibrio is known to form biofilms in the intestinal niche having physiological pH in the range 6-7, the probiotic strains that have dispersive action at high pH may have better therapeutic potential.","authors":[{"name":"Sumanpreet Kaur"},{"name":"Preeti Sharma"},{"name":"Namarta Kalia"},{"name":"Jatinder Singh"},{"name":"Sukhraj Kaur"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio"},{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm-dispersion"},{"word":"lactobacilli"},{"word":"probiotic"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"29740417","title":"The Small Regulatory Antisense RNA PilR Affects Pilus Formation and Cell Motility by Negatively Regulating pilA11 in Synechocystis sp.

Cell motility in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 relies on expression of the putative pilA9-pilA10-pilA11-slr2018 operon. In this study, we identified the antisense RNA PilR encoded in the noncoding strand of the prepilin-encoding gene pilA11. Analysis of overexpressor [PilR(+)] and suppressor [PilR(-)] mutant strains revealed that PilR is a direct negative regulator of PilA11 protein. Although overexpression of PilR did not affect cell growth, it greatly reduced levels of pilA11 mRNA and protein and decreased both the thickness and number of pili, resulting in limited cell motility and small, distinct colonies. Suppression of PilR had the opposite effect. A hypothetical model on the regulation of pilA9-pilA10-pilA11-slr2018 operon expression by PilR was proposed.

Application of insect infection model Galleria mellonella revealed high, intermediate and low virulence phenotypes of these clinical isolates, which showed good correlation with osteoblast invasion and biofilm formation assays. Comparative genomics of selected high (EDCC 5458) and low (EDCC 5464) virulent strains enabled the identification of molecular factors responsible for the development of acute and chronic IABI. Accordingly, the low virulent strain EDCC 5464 harbored point mutations resulting in frame shift mutations in agrC (histidine kinase in agr system), graS (histidine kinase in graSR, a two component system) and efeB (peroxidase in efeOBU operon, an iron acquisition system) genes.

All these results are in good support with the low virulence behavior of EDCC 5464.

The paper in addition to examination of the factors which enhance virulence in bacterial pathogens also x-rayed the concept of pathogenicity islands and the next generation approaches or rather current trends/methods used in the bacterial pathogenicity investigations. In terms of pathogenicity which of course is the capacity to cause disease in animals, requires that the attacking bacterial strain is virulent, and has ability to bypass the host immune defensive mechanisms. In order to achieve or exhibit pathogenicity, the virulence factors required by microorganisms include capsule, pigments, enzymes, iron acquisition through siderophores. Bacterial Pathogenicity Islands as a distinct concept in bacterial pathogenesis are just loci on the chromosome or extra chromosomal units which are acquired by horizontal gene transfer within pathogens in a microbial community or biofilm. In the area of laboratory investigations, bacterial pathogenesis was initially carried out using culture dependent approaches, which can only detect about 1% of human and veterinary-important pathogens.

Mechanism of bacterial inactivation caused by SML was revealed through comprehensive factors including cell morphology, cellular lysis, membrane permeability, K⁺ leakage, zeta potential, intracellular enzyme, and DNA assay. Results demonstrated that bacterial inactivation against Gram-positive bacteria was primarily induced by the pronounced damage to the cell membrane integrity. SML may interact with cytoplasmic membrane to disturb the regulation system of peptidoglycan hydrolase activities to degrade the peptidoglycan layer and form a hole in the layer. Then, the inside cytoplasmic membrane was blown out due to turgor pressure and the cytoplasmic materials inside leaked out. Leakage of intracellular enzyme to the supernatants implied that the cell membrane permeability was compromised. Consequently, the release of K⁺ from the cytosol lead to the alterations of the zeta potential of cells, which would disturb the subcellular localization of some proteins, and thereby causing bacterial inactivation.

Consistent with the phenotypic maturation, CNF1 further triggered secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the capacity of moDCs to stimulate proliferation of allogenic naïve CD4+ T cells. A catalytically inactive form of the toxin did not induce moDC maturation, indicating that the enzymatic activity of CNF1 triggers immature moDCs to undergo phenotypic and functional maturation.

In this regard, new antimicrobial strategies must be considered, one of which is to use antibiofilm/antimicrobial combinations to disrupt biofilm, thereby facilitating effectiveness of antimicrobial agents, and reducing the opportunity for antibiotic resistance gene transfer within biofilm. This strategy is being considered in several clinical conditions, one of which is chronic non-healing wounds, where antibiotics are used excessively and often indiscriminately. A combination antibiofilm/antimicrobial wound dressing has been shown to facilitate healing in previously biofilm-impaired non-healing wounds. This approach must be considered as part of antibiotic stewardship programmes to reduce the usage and implications of antibiotic therapy, and improve outcomes associated with chronic infections.","authors":[{"name":"Philip G Bowler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronicity"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"wound"}]},"article412":{"pmid":"29737589","title":"LL-37 fragments have antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms and wound healing potential in HaCaT cell line.","abs":"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common nosocomial pathogen able to form biofilms in indwelling devices, resulting in chronic infections, which are refractory to antibiotics treatment.

Caspofungin (CAS), micafungin (MICA) and anidulafungin (ANID) are the three most widely used EC antifungal agents. The treatment of biofilm-associated fungal infections affecting patients in tertiary health-care facilities has been identified as a challenge, particularly in Indian Intensive Care Unit (ICU) settings. With the rising number of critically ill patients requiring invasive devices such as central venous catheters for treatment, especially in ICUs, these devices serve as a potential source of nosocomial infections. Candida spp. colonisation is a major precursor of these infections and further complicates and prolongs treatment procedures, adding to increasing costs both for hospitals and the patient. Analysing studies involving the use of these agents can help in making critical decisions for antifungal therapy in the event of a fungal infection in the ICU. In addition, the development of resistance to antifungal agents is a crucial factor for assessing the appropriate antifungals that can be used for treatment.

CsuE exposes three hydrophobic finger-like loops at the tip of the pilus. Decreasing the hydrophobicity of these abolishes bacterial attachment, suggesting that archaic pili use tip-fingers to detect and bind to hydrophobic cavities in substrates. Antitip antibody completely blocks biofilm formation, presenting a means to prevent the spread of the pathogen. The use of hydrophilic materials instead of hydrophobic plastics in medical devices may represent another simple and cheap solution to reduce pathogen spread.

This process, which we have termed dynamic switching, distributes bacterial subpopulations upstream and downstream in flow through two phases: movement on surfaces and cellular movement via the bulk. The model equations that describe dynamic switching are identical to those that describe dynamic instability, a process that enables microtubules in eukaryotic cells to search space efficiently to capture chromosomes. Our results show that dynamic switching enables bacteria to explore flow networks efficiently, which maximizes dispersal and colonization and establishes the organizational structure of biofilms. A number of eukaryotic and mammalian cells also exhibit movement in two phases in flow, which suggests that dynamic switching is a modality that enables efficient dispersal for a broad range of cell types.","authors":[{"name":"Anerudh Kannan"},{"name":"Zhenbin Yang"},{"name":"Minyoung Kevin Kim"},{"name":"Howard A Stone"},{"name":"Albert Siryaporn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacterial dispersal"},{"word":"bacterial mechanics"},{"word":"biofilm organization"},{"word":"colonization dynamics"}]},"article425":{"pmid":"29735564","title":"Impact of Bacterial Membrane Fatty Acid Composition on the Failure of Daptomycin To Kill Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"Daptomycin is a last-resort membrane-targeting lipopeptide approved for the treatment of drug-resistant staphylococcal infections, such as bacteremia and implant-related infections.

We show that daptomycin bactericidal activity against S. aureus varies significantly with the growth state and strain, according to the membrane fatty acid composition. Daptomycin efficacy as an antibiotic relies on its ability to oligomerize within membranes and form pores that subsequently lead to cell death. Our findings ascertain that daptomycin interacts with tolerant bacteria and reaches its membrane target, regardless of its bactericidal activity. However, the final step of pore formation does not occur in cells that are daptomycin tolerant, strongly suggesting that it is incapable of oligomerization. Importantly, membrane fatty acid contents correlated with poor daptomycin bactericidal activity, which could be manipulated by fatty acid addition. In conclusion, daptomycin failure to treat S. aureus is not due to a lack of antibiotic-target interaction, but is driven by its capacity to form pores, which depends on membrane composition. Manipulation of membrane fluidity to restore S. aureus daptomycin bactericidal activity in vivo could open the way to novel antibiotic treatment strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Rym Boudjemaa"},{"name":"Clément Cabriel"},{"name":"Florence Dubois-Brissonnet"},{"name":"Nicolas Bourg"},{"name":"Guillaume Dupuis"},{"name":"Alexandra Gruss"},{"name":"Sandrine Lévêque-Fort"},{"name":"Romain Briandet"},{"name":"Marie-Pierre Fontaine-Aupart"},{"name":"Karine Steenkeste"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"bacterial membranes"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"daptomycin"},{"word":"fatty acids"},{"word":"fluorescence"},{"word":"tolerance"}]},"article426":{"pmid":"29734815","title":"Dynamic field testing of coating chemistry candidates by a rotating disk system.","abs":"Quick and reliable testing is crucial for the development of new fouling release (FR) coatings.

Moreover, poor water solubility further restricts its applications on anti-infection therapy. Inulins are a group of polysaccharides produced by many types of plants, and are widely used in processed foods. Compared to chitosan, inulin is very soluble in water and possesses a mild antibacterial activity against certain pathogenic bacteria. In order to develop an effective strategy to treat biofilm-related infections, we introduce a method by covalent conjugation of inulin to chitosan. The physicochemical characterization of the inulin⁻chitosan conjugate was assayed, and the anti-biofilm activity was evaluated against S. aureus biofilm. The results indicated that, as compared to chitosan, this novel polysaccharide⁻polysaccharide conjugate significantly enhanced activities against S. aureus either in a biofilm or planktonic state. Of note, the conjugate also showed a broad spectrum anti-biofilm activity on different bacteria strains and low cellular toxicity to mammalian cells.

Biofilm of C. albicans was formed on resins, and immersed in various concentrations of each oil and distilled water (DW). The biofilm removal effect was determined by incubating specimens in RPMI medium containing Alamar blue (AB) and measuring absorbance. Wear test was also conducted, and surface condition of resins was determined using laser scanning microscope and digital microscope. Specimens immersed in the TO and LO solutions tended to have a lower AB value at higher concentrations and longer soaking times. Use of these agents resulted in less surface roughness as compared to DW. Our results suggest that TO and LO were valid to remove biofilm attached to resin with lower levels of abrasion, and these are effective for use in denture cleaner.","authors":[{"name":"Yusaku Koseki"},{"name":"Rika Tanaka"},{"name":"Hiroshi Murata"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. albicans"},{"word":"Denture cleaner"},{"word":"Lemongrass oil"},{"word":"Tea tree oil"},{"word":"Wear test"}]},"article437":{"pmid":"29730766","title":"A novel whole-cell biosensor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to monitor the expression of quorum sensing genes.","abs":"A novel whole-cell biosensor was developed to noninvasively and simultaneously monitor the in situ genetic activities of the four quorum sensing (QS) networks in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, including the las, rhl, pqs, and iqs systems. P. aeruginosa PAO1 is a model bacterium for studies of biofilm and pathogenesis while both processes are closely controlled by the QS systems. This biosensor worked well by selectively monitoring the expression of one representative gene from each network. In the biosensor, the promoter regions of lasI, rhlI, pqsA, and ambB (QS genes) controlled the fluorescent reporter genes of Turbo YFP, mTag BFP2, mNEON Green, and E2-Orange, respectively. The biosensor was successful in monitoring the impact of an important environmental factor, salt stress, on the genetic regulation of QS networks.

This study aimed to assess the effect of AFD on enamel demineralization and on the microbial and biochemical compositions of biofilm formed under different frequencies of sucrose exposure. It consisted of an in situ split-mouth design, where 12 adult volunteers who used FD for at least 2 months prior to the beginning of this study wore acrylic palatal appliances containing 4 bovine enamel specimens (1 pair at each side of the appliance) during 2 phases of 14 days each. FD slurry (3×/day) and 20% sucrose solution (4× and 8×/day) were dripped on the specimens during the first experimental phase. The same volunteers then used AFD during a 2-month washout period, followed by a second experimental phase where the AFD slurry and sucrose solution were applied onto a new subset of specimens. The percentage of enamel surface hardness loss (%SHL), the lesion depth (LD), the integrated mineral loss (IML), microbial counts on biofilms, the biomass, and inorganic and insoluble extracellular polysaccharide (IEPS) biofilm concentrations were determined. Higher %SHL, biomass, and IEPS and lower fluoride values were found at sucrose 8×/day exposure. Lower IEPS were found in the presence of AFD compared to FD. Similar %SHL, LD, and IML values were found between FD and AFD, irrespectively of the cariogenic challenge. The results suggest that AFD have an anticaries effect similar to that of regular FD.","authors":[{"name":"Angel Y Sanchez"},{"name":"Caroline L de Oliveira"},{"name":"Thais C Negrini"},{"name":"Lina N Hashizume"},{"name":"Anderson T Hara"},{"name":"Marisa Maltz"},{"name":"Rodrigo A Arthur"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Arginine"},{"word":"Demineralization"},{"word":"Dental caries"},{"word":"Dentifrice"},{"word":"Enamel"},{"word":"Fluoride"},{"word":"Sucrose"}]},"article439":{"pmid":"29730574","title":"Reduction of bacterial attachment on hydroxyapatite surfaces: Using hydrophobicity and chemical functionality to enhance surface retention and prevent attachment.","abs":"Water-soluble, linear polymers with high-acid functionality are commonly used in oral care formulations to provide benefits such as bioactive complexation and delivery, as well as inhibition of the bacteria deposition and colonization, commonly referred to as 'anti-attachment'. Unfortunately, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of these polymers are scarce, thus, a systematic approach to design polymers with a desired property (e.g. anti-attachment) is limited. Multifunctional anti-attachment amphiphilic molecules (AMs) featuring a sugar backbone, hydrophobic arms, a poly(ethylene glycol) tail, and a chemical anchor effectively deposited on soft ceramic surfaces and reduced bacterial adhesion. The chemical compositions of the AMs were fine-tuned to better coordinate with dental enamel surfaces and prevent bacterial colonization. A graft-to approach was used to investigate the effect of the chemical anchor on AM deposition and retention. The chemical composition, absorption/desorption, and wettability properties of the bioactives and bioactive-coated surfaces were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photon spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance, and contact angle. In addition, the ability of the AMs to provide anti-bacterial attachment on a simulated enamel surface was evaluated in vitro using bacterial repulsion assays. The SAR between surface retention and anti-attachment properties of the AMs demonstrates the feasibility and tunability of using these polymers as bioactive agents that provide anti-attachment benefits on dental enamel surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Jeannette Marine"},{"name":"Carl P Myers"},{"name":"Guillaume A Picquet"},{"name":"Lynette A Zaidel"},{"name":"Donghui Wu"},{"name":"Kathryn E Uhrich"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-bacterial attachment"},{"word":"Biofilm prevention"},{"word":"Hydroxyapatite"},{"word":"Surface modification"}]}}
