Marine environments are precious sources of AMPs, as shown by the recent discovery of antibiofilm properties of Holothuroidin 2 (H2), an AMP produced by the Mediterranean sea cucumber Holothuria tubulosa. In this study, we considered the properties of a new H2 derivative, named H2d, and we tested it against seven strains of the dangerous foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. This peptide was more active than H2 in inhibiting the growth of planktonic L. monocytogenes and was able to interfere with biofilm formation at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed insights related to the enhanced inhibitory activity of H2d, showing that the peptide is characterized by a more defined tertiary structure with respect to its ancestor. This allows the peptide to better exhibit an amphipathic character, which is an essential requirement for the interaction with cell membranes, similarly to other AMPs. Altogether, these results support the potential use of our synthetic peptide, H2d, as a template for the development of novel AMP-based drugs able to fight foodborne that are resistant to conventional antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Maria Grazia Cusimano"},{"name":"Angelo Spinello"},{"name":"Giampaolo Barone"},{"name":"Domenico Schillaci"},{"name":"Stella Cascioferro"},{"name":"Alessandra Magistrato"},{"name":"Barbara Parrino"},{"name":"Vincenzo Arizza"},{"name":"Maria Vitale"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Holothuria tubulosa"},{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"foodborne pathogens"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"30856644","title":"Adhesion of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans to Parylene-C-Coated Polymethyl Methacrylate.","abs":"To determine whether coating polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) discs with Parylene-C would reduce Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Ingrid M Green"},{"name":"Ioanna Margoni"},{"name":"Sean P Nair"},{"name":"Haralampos Petridis"}],"keywords":[]},"article3":{"pmid":"30856560","title":"Biochemical changes of polysaccharides and proteins within EPS under Pb(II) stress in Rhodotorula mucilaginosa.","abs":"Microorganisms have been widely applied to heavy metal adsorption due to their strong secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS).

Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is an essential component for biofilm development and maturation in many bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the eDNA released by B. pseudomallei during biofilm formation using DNase treatment. The extent of biofilm formation and quantity of eDNA were assessed by crystal-violet staining and fluorescent dye-based quantification, respectively, and visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Variation in B. pseudomallei biofilm formation and eDNA quantity was demonstrated among isolates. CLSM images of biofilms stained with FITC-ConA (biofilm) and TOTO-3 (eDNA) revealed the localization of eDNA in the biofilm matrix. A positive correlation of biofilm biomass with quantity of eDNA during the 2-day biofilm-formation observation period was found. The increasing eDNA quantity over time, despite constant living/dead ratios of bacterial cells during the experiment suggests that eDNA is delivered from living bacterial cells. CLSM images demonstrated that depletion of eDNA by DNase I significantly lessened bacterial attachment (if DNase added at 0 h) and biofilm developing stages (if added at 24 h) but had no effect on mature biofilm (if added at 45 h). Collectively, our results reveal that eDNA is released from living B. pseudomallei and is correlated with biofilm formation. It was also apparent that eDNA is essential during bacterial cell attachment and biofilm-forming steps. The depletion of eDNA by DNase may provide an option for the prevention or dispersal of B. pseudomallei biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Rattiyaphorn Pakkulnan"},{"name":"Chitchanok Anutrakunchai"},{"name":"Sakawrat Kanthawong"},{"name":"Suwimol Taweechaisupapong"},{"name":"Pisit Chareonsudjai"},{"name":"Sorujsiri Chareonsudjai"}],"keywords":[]},"article9":{"pmid":"30855954","title":"n → π* Interactions in N-Acyl Homoserine Lactone Derivatives and Their Effects on Hydrolysis Rates.","abs":"N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) mediate population-wide behavioral changes in Gram-negative bacteria through quorum sensing (QS), a process shown to regulate virulence, biofilm formation, and other phenotypes that impact human health.

The infection incidence after craniotomy ranges from 0.8 to 3%, with approximately half caused by Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus). To mitigate infectious complications following craniotomy, we engineered a three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted bone scaffold to harness the potent antibacterial activity of macrophages (MΦs) together with antibiotics using a mouse S. aureus craniotomy-associated biofilm model that establishes a persistent infection on the bone flap, subcutaneous galea, and brain. The 3D scaffold contained rifampin and daptomycin printed in a composite slurry, with viable MΦs incorporated into a hydrogel-based bioink, which was assessed for both the treatment and prevention of craniotomy-associated infections in the mouse model. For the treatment paradigm, the bone flap was removed at day 7 post infection after a mature biofilm had formed and was replaced with a 3D printed antibiotic scaffold, with or without MΦ incorporation. Bacterial burdens in the galea and brain were reduced by at least 100-fold at early time points, which was potentiated by bioprinting viable MΦs into the 3D antibiotic scaffold. We also examined a prevention paradigm, where the scaffolds were placed at the time of surgery and challenged with S. aureus one day later at the surgical site. Interestingly, unlike the treatment paradigm, the incorporation of viable MΦs into the 3D antibiotic scaffold did not enhance bacterial clearance compared to that of antibiotic alone. With further refinement, our 3D bioprinted scaffold represents a potential treatment modality, as it delivers therapeutic antibiotic levels more rapidly than systemic administration, based on its proximity to the infection site. In addition, the incorporation of viable MΦs into the 3D scaffold is an important advance, which demonstrated an improved therapeutic benefit for the treatment of established biofilms that represent the most clinically challenging scenario.","authors":[{"name":"Amy Aldrich"},{"name":"Mitchell A Kuss"},{"name":"Bin Duan"},{"name":"Tammy Kielian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3D bioprinting"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm infection"},{"word":"craniotomy"},{"word":"macrophage"}]},"article14":{"pmid":"30855050","title":"Pyrazolopyrimidinones, a novel class of copper-dependent bactericidal antibiotics against multi-drug resistant S. aureus.","abs":"The treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections poses a therapeutic challenge as even last resort drugs become increasingly ineffective. As the demand for antibiotics with novel modes of action is growing, new approaches are needed to probe a greater spectrum of antimicrobial activities for their potential efficacy against drug-resistant pathogens. The use of copper (Cu) by the innate immune system to mount an antimicrobial response against bacterial invaders has created an opportunity to explore a role for Cu in antimicrobial therapy. Here we describe pyrazolopyrimidinones (PZP) as novel copper-dependent inhibitors (CDI) of S. aureus. 5-Benzyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-methyl-4H,7H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-one (PZP-915) showed potent bactericidal properties at sub-micromolar concentrations and activity against clinical MRSA isolates and biofilms cultures. This cupricidal activity is founded on the molecule's ability to coordinate Cu and induce accumulation of Cu ions inside S. aureus cells. We demonstrate that exposure to 915 + Cu led to an almost instantaneous collapse of the membrane potential which was accompanied by a complete depletion of cellular ATP, loss of cell-associated K+, a substantial gain of cell associated Na+, and an inability to control the influx of protons in slightly acidic medium, while the integrity of the cell membrane remained intact. These findings highlight PZP-915 as a novel membrane-directed metalloantibiotic against S. aureus that is likely to target a multiplicity of membrane associated protein functions rather than imposing physical damage to the membrane structure.","authors":[{"name":"Cameron L Crawford"},{"name":"Alex G Dalecki"},{"name":"Whitney T Narmore"},{"name":"Jessica Hoff"},{"name":"Audra A Hargett"},{"name":"Matthew B Renfrow"},{"name":"Man Zhang"},{"name":"Madumali Kalubowilage"},{"name":"Stefan H Bossmann"},{"name":"Stacy L Queern"},{"name":"Suzanne E Lapi"},{"name":"Robert N Hunter"},{"name":"Donghui Bao"},{"name":"Corinne E Augelli-Szafran"},{"name":"Olaf Kutsch"},{"name":"Frank Wolschendorf"}],"keywords":[]},"article15":{"pmid":"30854956","title":"Medicinal Plant Compounds for Combating the Multi-drug Resistant Pathogenic Bacteria: A Review.","abs":"Globally, people utilize plants as the main source of remedy to heal various ailments.

Thus, we cultivated S. aureus biofilms in a flow system and comprehensively profiled intracellular and extracellular (ECM and flow-through (FT)) biofilm proteomes, as well as the extracellular metabolome compared with planktonic cultures. Our analyses revealed the expression of many pathogenicity factors within S. aureus biofilms as indicated by a high abundance of capsule biosynthesis proteins along with various secreted virulence factors, including hemolysins, leukotoxins, and lipases as a part of the ECM. The activity of ECM virulence factors was confirmed in a hemolysis assay and a Galleria mellonella pathogenicity model. In addition, we uncovered a so far unacknowledged moonlighting function of secreted virulence factors and ribosomal proteins trapped in the ECM: namely their contribution to biofilm integrity. Mechanistically, it was revealed that this stabilizing effect is mediated by the strong positive charge of alkaline virulence factors and ribosomal proteins in an acidic ECM environment, which is caused by the release of fermentation products like formate, lactate, and acetate because of oxygen limitation in biofilms. The strong positive charge of these proteins most likely mediates electrostatic interactions with anionic cell surface components, eDNA, and anionic metabolites. In consequence, this leads to strong cell aggregation and biofilm stabilization.

In situ specific heat spectroscopy and XPS analysis revealed the formation of a modified polymer layer around the NPs which propagates on the scale of a few nanometers from the Cu NP/polymer interface and then transforms into a bulk polymer phase. The chemical composition of the modified layer is found to be ether-deficient due to the catalytic influence of copper whereas the bulk polymer phase exhibits the chemical composition close to the original PEO. Two cooperative glass transition phenomena are revealed that belong to the modified polymer layer and the bulk phase. The former is characterized by constrained mobility of polymer segments which manifests itself via a 30 K increase of dynamic glass transition temperature. Furthermore, the modified layer is characterized by the heterogeneous structure which results in higher fragility of this layer as compared to the bulk phase.

The reaction dynamics of PapB, as well as dynamics of signal transduction in the PapB-PapA complex, were studied mostly by time-resolved transient grating and CD methods. It was found that although PapB exists as a monomer in both dark and light states, the diffusion coefficient slightly increases and partial molar volume changes upon light irradiation with time constants of 80 μs, 3.2 ms, and 24 ms.

Interestingly, when PapA is added to a PapB solution to form a PapB-PapA complex, the diffusion coefficient decreases significantly, with a time constant of 26 ms, which is similar to the rate of the last conformational change of PapB. It was found that this change is due to the conformational change of PapA, and the light signal from PapB is transmitted through the conformational change of PapB.

A consortium based consolidated bioprocess (CBP) was designed. The rumen microbiome was used as the converting microbial consortium, co-cultivated with selected individual aerobic fungi which formed a biofilm on the tubular membrane flushed with oxygen. The beneficial effect of the fungal biofilm on the process yields and productivities was attributed to the enhanced cellulolytic activities compared with those achieved by the rumen microbiome alone. At 30 °C, the MBM system with Trichoderma reesei biofilm reached a concentration 39% higher (7.3 g/L SCFAs), than the rumen microbiome alone (5.1 g/L) using 15 g/L crystalline cellulose as the substrate. Fermentation temperature was crucial especially for the composition of the short chain fatty acids produced. The temperature increase resulted in shorter fatty acids produced.

Previous studies have shown that biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes and presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the biofilm matrix varies with environmental conditions and may involve agr peptide sensing. Experiments in normal and diluted (hypoosmotic) complex media at different temperatures revealed reduced biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes EGD-e ΔagrD, a mutant deficient in agr peptide sensing, specifically in diluted Brain Heart Infusion at 25°C. This defect was not related to reduced sensitivity to DNase treatment suggesting sufficient levels of eDNA. Re-analysis of a previously published transcriptional profiling indicated that a total of 132 stress-related genes, that is 78.6% of the SigB-dependent stress regulon, are differentially expressed in the ΔagrD mutant. Additionally, a number of genes involved in flagellar motility and a large number of other surface proteins including internalins, peptidoglycan binding and cell wall modifying proteins showed agr-dependent gene expression. However, survival of the ΔagrD mutant in hypoosmotic conditions or following exposure to high hydrostatic pressure was comparable to the wild type. Also, flagellar motility and surface hydrophobicity were not affected. However, the ΔagrD mutant displayed a significantly reduced viability upon challenge with lysozyme. These results suggest that the biofilm phenotype of the ΔagrD mutant is not a consequence of reduced resistance to hypoosmotic or high pressure stress, motility or surface hydrophobicity.

Tobramycin accumulation assays demonstrated that deletion of TctD-TctE resulted in an increase in the amount of tobramycin retained in biofilm cells. The PA14 wild type responded to increasing concentrations of citric acid by producing less biofilm. In contrast, the amount of ΔtctED mutant biofilm formation remained constant or enhanced. Furthermore, the ΔtctED strain was incapable of growing on citric acid as a sole carbon source and was highly reduced in its ability to grow in the presence of citric acid even when an additional carbon source was available. Use of phenotypic and genetic microarrays found that this growth deficiency of the ΔtctED mutant is unique to citric acid and that multiple metabolic genes are dysregulated.

However, the formation of bacterial biofilms on nanofiber membranes and application of the biofilm-integrated nanofiber membranes remain largely unknown. Here, electrospun cellulose acetate nanofiber membranes are first utilized as scaffold materials for Lactobacillus plantarum ( L. plantarum) biofilm formation. Nanofiber membranes proved to be an excellent scaffold for bacteria biofilm with high stability, where biofilms were interlocked with nanofibers forming a cohesive structure. In comparison with planktonic bacteria, L. plantarum biofilms on nanofiber membranes show excellent gastrointestinal resistance. Instead of decreasing, the number of viable cells increased after 3 h digestion in vitro. The L. plantarum biofilm-integrated nanofiber membranes were used as reusable starter cultures for fermented milk production showing excellent fermentative ability and higher survival of L. plantarum during shelf life. The viable cells in fermented milk remained at 11 log CFU/g throughout the reusable batches, which is far above the required value of 7 log CFU/g in commercial products. In addition, the produced fermented milk possesses shorter fermentation time and higher survival of probiotics during shelf life. The results suggest electrospun nanofiber membranes are ideal scaffold materials for bacteria biofilms immobilization in biotechnology and fermentation engineering, which broaden the potential use of electrospun nanofiber membranes in microbiology and strengthen the application of biofilms in fermentation engineering.","authors":[{"name":"Meng-Xin Hu"},{"name":"Ji-Nian Li"},{"name":"Qian Guo"},{"name":"Ya-Qian Zhu"},{"name":"Hong-Mei Niu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"electrospun nanofiber membrane"},{"word":"fermented milk"},{"word":"probiotics"},{"word":"scaffold"}]},"article73":{"pmid":"30838765","title":"Visualization and characterization of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 pellicles.","abs":"Cellulose, whose production is controlled by c-di-GMP, is a commonly found exopolysaccharide in bacterial biofilms. Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000, a model organism for molecular studies of plant-pathogen interactions, carries the wssABCDEFGHI operon for the synthesis of acetylated cellulose. The high intracellular levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP induced by the overexpression of the heterologous diguanylate cyclase PleD stimulate cellulose production and enhance air-liquid biofilm (pellicle) formation. To characterize the mechanisms involved in Pto DC3000 pellicle formation, we studied this process using mutants lacking flagella, biosurfactant or different extracellular matrix components, and compared the pellicles produced in the absence and in the presence of PleD. We have discovered that neither alginate nor the biosurfactant syringafactin are needed for their formation, whereas cellulose and flagella are important but not essential. We have also observed that the high c-di-GMP levels conferred more cohesion to Pto cells within the pellicle and induced the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies and extracellular fibres and vesicles. Since the pellicles were very labile and this greatly hindered their handling and processing for microscopy, we have also developed new methods to collect and process them for scanning and transmission electron microscopy.

A comprehensive understanding of these genomic factors is necessary for the realization of precision medicine in the oral health domain. To aid in this direction, the advent and increasing affordability of high-throughput genotyping has enabled the simultaneous interrogation of millions of genetic polymorphisms for association with oral and craniofacial traits. Specifically, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of dental caries and periodontal disease have provided initial insights into novel loci and biological processes plausibly implicated in these two common, complex, biofilm-mediated diseases. This paper presents a summary of protocols, methods, tools, and pipelines for the conduct of GWAS of dental caries, periodontal disease, and related traits. The protocol begins with the consideration of different traits for both diseases and outlines procedures for genotyping, quality control, adjustment for population stratification, heritability and association analyses, annotation, reporting, and interpretation. Methods and tools available for GWAS are being constantly updated and improved; with this in mind, the presented approaches have been successfully applied in numerous GWAS and meta-analyses among tens of thousands of individuals, including dental traits such as dental caries and periodontal disease.

The control of this bacterium is difficult especially when Salmonella spp. is organized into biofilms. We hypothesized that the novel nanocomposites of ZnO nanocrystals doped with silver (Ag) and silver oxide (AgO) nanocrystals (ZnO:Ag-AgO) synthesized by the coprecipitation method could control or prevent the formation of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) and Salmonella Heidelberg (SH) biofilm and its entry into turkey eggs. The diffraction characteristics of ZnO and AgO showed sizes of 28 and 30 nm, respectively. The Zn to Ag substitution into the ZnO crystalline structure was evidenced by the ionic radius of Ag+2 (1.26 Å), which is greater than Zn+2 (0.74 Å). For the SE analyses post-biofilm formation, the ZnO:Ag-AgO was not able to eliminate the biofilm, but the bacterial load was lower than that of the control group. Additionally, SE was able to infiltrate into the eggs and was found in both albumen and yolk. For the SH analyses applied onto the eggshells before biofilm formation, the ZnO:Ag-AgO treatment prevented biofilm formation, and although the bacterium infiltration into the eggs was observed in all treated groups, it was significantly smaller in ZnO:Ag-AgO pre-treated eggs, and SH could not reach the yolk. There was no difference in pore size between groups; therefore, the inhibition of biofilm formation and the prevention of bacterium entry into the egg were attributable to the use of ZnO:Ag-AgO, which was not influenced by the egg structure. Although the amount of Ag and Zn in the shell of the ZnO:Ag-AgO group was greater in relation to the control, this difference was not detected in the other egg components.

Restoring the activity of existing drugs is an attractive alternative to address this challenge. One of the most efficient mechanisms of bacterial resistance involves the expression of efflux pump systems capable of expelling antibiotics from the cell. Although there are efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) available, these molecules are toxic for humans. We hypothesized that permeability-increasing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) could lower the amount of EPI necessary to sensitize bacteria to antibiotics that are efflux substrates. To test this hypothesis, we measured the ability of polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), to synergize with antibiotics in the presence of EPIs. Assays were performed using planktonic and biofilm-forming cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains overexpressing the MexAB-OprM efflux system. Synergy between PMBN and EPIs boosted azithromycin activity by a factor of 2,133 and sensitized P. aeruginosa to all tested antibiotics. This reduced several orders of magnitude the amount of inhibitor needed for antibiotic sensitization. The selected antibiotic-EPI-PMBN combination caused a 10 million-fold reduction in the viability of biofilm forming cells. We proved that AMPs can synergize with EPIs and that this phenomenon can be exploited to sensitize bacteria to antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Raquel Ferrer-Espada"},{"name":"Hawraa Shahrour"},{"name":"Betsey Pitts"},{"name":"Philip S Stewart"},{"name":"Susana Sánchez-Gómez"},{"name":"Guillermo Martínez-de-Tejada"}],"keywords":[]},"article84":{"pmid":"30837494","title":"Probabilistic variable-length segmentation of protein sequences for discriminative motif discovery (DiMotif) and sequence embedding (ProtVecX).","abs":"In this paper, we present peptide-pair encoding (PPE), a general-purpose probabilistic segmentation of protein sequences into commonly occurring variable-length sub-sequences. The idea of PPE segmentation is inspired by the byte-pair encoding (BPE) text compression algorithm, which has recently gained popularity in subword neural machine translation. We modify this algorithm by adding a sampling framework allowing for multiple ways of segmenting a sequence. PPE segmentation steps can be learned over a large set of protein sequences (Swiss-Prot) or even a domain-specific dataset and then applied to a set of unseen sequences. This representation can be widely used as the input to any downstream machine learning tasks in protein bioinformatics. In particular, here, we introduce this representation through protein motif discovery and protein sequence embedding. (i) DiMotif: we present DiMotif as an alignment-free discriminative motif discovery method and evaluate the method for finding protein motifs in three different settings: (1) comparison of DiMotif with two existing approaches on 20 distinct motif discovery problems which are experimentally verified, (2) classification-based approach for the motifs extracted for integrins, integrin-binding proteins, and biofilm formation, and (3) in sequence pattern searching for nuclear localization signal. The DiMotif, in general, obtained high recall scores, while having a comparable F1 score with other methods in the discovery of experimentally verified motifs. Having high recall suggests that the DiMotif can be used for short-list creation for further experimental investigations on motifs. In the classification-based evaluation, the extracted motifs could reliably detect the integrins, integrin-binding, and biofilm formation-related proteins on a reserved set of sequences with high F1 scores. (ii) ProtVecX: we extend k-mer based protein vector (ProtVec) embedding to variablelength protein embedding using PPE sub-sequences. We show that the new method of embedding can marginally outperform ProtVec in enzyme prediction as well as toxin prediction tasks. In addition, we conclude that the embeddings are beneficial in protein classification tasks when they are combined with raw amino acids k-mer features.","authors":[{"name":"Ehsaneddin Asgari"},{"name":"Alice C McHardy"},{"name":"Mohammad R K Mofrad"}],"keywords":[]},"article85":{"pmid":"30837355","title":"D-Tryptophan governs biofilm formation rates and bacterial interaction in P. mendocina and S. aureus.","abs":"Biofilm genesis by Pseudomonasand Staphylococcus sp is associated with biofouling in natural settings.

Though planktonic cells typically grow faster, bacteria in aggregates are more resistant to stress such as desiccation, antibiotics and predation. Here we ask if and to what extent informed surface-attachments improve fitness during early surface colonization under periodic stress conditions. We use an individual-based modeling approach to simulate foraging planktonic cells colonizing a surface under alternating wet-dry cycles. Such cycles are common in the largest terrestrial microbial habitats-soil, roots, and leaf surfaces-that are not constantly saturated with water and experience daily periods of desiccation stress. We compared different surface-attachment strategies, and analyzed the emerging spatio-temporal dynamics of surface colonization and population yield as a measure of fitness. We demonstrate that a simple strategy of preferential attachment (PA), biased to dense sites, carries a large fitness advantage over any random attachment across a broad range of environmental conditions-particularly under periodic stress.","authors":[{"name":"Maor Grinberg"},{"name":"Tomer Orevi"},{"name":"Nadav Kashtan"}],"keywords":[]},"article93":{"pmid":"30835535","title":"Antimicrobial photodynamic activity of toluidine blue encapsulated in mesoporous silica nanoparticles against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"In the present study, the antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy of toluidine blue (TB) encapsulated in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) was investigated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus treated with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) using a red diode laser 670 nm wavelength, 97.65 J cm","authors":[{"name":"Paramanantham Parasuraman"},{"name":"Asha P Antony"},{"name":"Sruthil Lal S B"},{"name":"Alok Sharan"},{"name":"Busi Siddhardha"},{"name":"Kaviyarasu Kasinathan"},{"name":"Needa A Bahkali"},{"name":"Turki M S Dawoud"},{"name":"Asad Syed"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"encapsulation"},{"word":"mesoporous silica nanoparticles"},{"word":"photosensitizer"},{"word":"reactive oxygen species"},{"word":"toluidine blue"}]},"article94":{"pmid":"30835168","title":"Source or Sink: Examining the Role of Biofilms in Transmission of Mycobacterium spp. in Laboratory Zebrafish.","abs":"Zebrafish health is a primary research concern because diseases can have unintended impacts on experimental endpoints. Ideally, research would be conducted using disease-free fish or fish with known disease status. Mycobacteriosis is a common bacterial disease in wild and captive fishes, including zebrafish. Despite its prevalence, the dynamics of transmission and potential sources of mycobacterial infections in zebrafish are only partially understood. One suspected natural infection source is surface biofilms on tanks and other system components. This study investigates the role that tank biofilms play in mycobacteriosis in laboratory zebrafish by evaluating the establishment of biofilms from bacteria shed from fish, and conversely, the acquisition of infections in fish from surface biofilms. We found that zebrafish infected with Mycobacterium chelonae shed bacteria through feces, and bacteria are transmitted to tank biofilms from one to 16 weeks postinfection. We also found that zebrafish acquire M. chelonae infections as soon as 2 weeks when introduced to tanks with established M. chelonae biofilms. The results from this study highlight the role that tank biofilms play as both a reservoir and source of mycobacterial infections in zebrafish.

All isolates were screened for multifarious PGP traits viz. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), phosphate (P) and zinc (Zn) solubilization, siderophore, cell wall degrading enzymes and pathogenicity. Compatible of LSBR-3 and LSE-2 enhanced IAA, P-solubilization, 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylate deaminase and biofilm formation over the single inoculant treatment. Further, consortium was evaluated in vivo for growth, symbiotic traits, nutrient acquisition, soil quality parameters and yield attributes of soybean. Improvement in growth parameters were recorded with dual inoculant LSBR-3 + LSE-2 as compared to LSBR-3 alone and un-inoculated control treatments. Significantly (p ≥ 0.05) high symbiotic and soil quality parameters (phosphatase and soil dehydrogenase activity) was recorded with LSBR-3 + LSE-2 at vegetative and flowering stage as compared to LSBR-3 alone and un-inoculated control treatments. Single inoculation of LSBR-3 improved grain yield by 4.25% over the un-inoculated control treatment, further, enhancement in yield was recorded with consortium inoculant (LSBR-3 and LSE-2) by 3.47% over the LSBR-3 alone. Application of consortium inoculant (LSBR-3 + LSE-2) gave an additional income of Rs. 5089/ha over the un-inoculated control treatment.

However, instead of replacing antibiotics, the combination of both types of antimicrobials can be superior over the use of single agents. Enhanced bacterial suppression, more efficient penetration into biofilms, and lowered chances for the emergence of phage resistance are the likely advantages of the combined strategy. While a number of studies have provided experimental evidence in support of this concept, negative interference between phages and antibiotics have been reported as well. Neutral effects have also been observed, but in those cases, combined approaches may still be important for at least hampering the development of resistance. In any case, the choice of phage type and antibiotic as well as their mixing ratios must be given careful consideration when deciding for a dual antibacterial approach. The most frequently tested bacterium for a combined antibacterial treatment has been Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but encouraging results have also been reported for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, and Burkholderia cepacia.

Herboheal at ≥0.1% v/v was able to inhibit (19-55%) in vitro production of quorum sensing-regulated pigments in all these bacteria and seemed to interfere with bacterial quorum sensing by acting as a signal-response inhibitor. This formulation could compromise haemolytic activity of all three bacteria by ∼18-69% and induced their catalase activity by ∼8-21%. Herboheal inhibited P. aeruginosa biofilm formation up to 40%, reduced surface hydrophobicity of P. aeruginosa cells by ∼9%, and also made them (25%) more susceptible to lysis by human serum. Antibiotic susceptibility of all three bacteria was modulated owing to pretreatment with Herboheal. Exposure of these test pathogens to Herboheal (≥0.025% v/v) effectively reduced their virulence towards the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Repeated subculturing of P. aeruginosa on the Herboheal-supplemented growth medium did not induce resistance to Herboheal in this mischievous pathogen, and this polyherbal extract was also found to exert a post-extract effect on P. aeruginosa, wherein virulence of the Herboheal-unexposed daughter cultures, of the Herboheal-exposed parent culture, was also found to be attenuated.

The prevention of biofilm formation and the treatment of existing biofilms is currently a difficult challenge; therefore, the discovery of new multi-targeted or combinatorial therapies is growing. The development of anti-bioﬁlm agents is considered of major interest and represents a key strategy as non-biocidal molecules are highly valuable to avoid the rapid appearance of escape mutants. Among bacteria, staphylococci are predominant causes of biofilm-associated infections. Staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an extraordinarily versatile pathogen that can survive in hostile environmental conditions, colonize mucous membranes and skin, and can cause severe, non-purulent, toxin-mediated diseases or invasive pyogenic infections in humans. Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) has also emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen in infections associated with medical devices (such as urinary and intravascular catheters, orthopaedic implants, etc.), causing approximately from 30% to 43% of joint prosthesis infections. The scientific community is continuously looking for new agents endowed of anti-biofilm capabilities to fight S. aureus and S epidermidis infections. Interestingly, several reports indicated in vitro efficacy of non-biocidal essential oils (EOs) as promising treatment to reduce bacterial biofilm production and prevent the inducing of drug resistance. In this report were analyzed 89 EOs with the objective of investigating their ability to modulate bacterial biofilm production of different S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. Results showed the assayed EOs to modulated the biofilm production with unpredictable results for each strain. In particular, many EOs acted mainly as biofilm inhibitors in the case of S. epidermidis strains, while for S. aureus strains, EOs induced either no effect or stimulate biofilm production. In order to elucidate the obtained experimental results, machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to the EOs' chemical compositions and the determined associated anti-biofilm potencies. Statistically robust ML models were developed, and their analysis in term of feature importance and partial dependence plots led to indicating those chemical components mainly responsible for biofilm production, inhibition or stimulation for each studied strain, respectively.","authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Patsilinakos"},{"name":"Marco Artini"},{"name":"Rosanna Papa"},{"name":"Manuela Sabatino"},{"name":"Mijat Božović"},{"name":"Stefania Garzoli"},{"name":"Gianluca Vrenna"},{"name":"Raissa Buzzi"},{"name":"Stefano Manfredini"},{"name":"Laura Selan"},{"name":"Rino Ragno"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus species"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"essential oil"},{"word":"machine learning"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"30831512","title":"A novel comparative study of modified carriers in moving bed biofilm reactor for the treatment of wastewater: Process optimization and kinetic study.","abs":"In this work, modified plastic carriers; polypropylene (PP), low-density polyethylene- polypropylene (LDPE-PP), and polyurethane foam-polypropylene (PUF-PP) were developed and used in moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) for the wastewater treatment containing naphthalene.

Current treatments for S. aureus infections involve the systemic delivery of antibiotics and additional surgeries, increasing health-care costs and affecting patient's quality of life. As a step toward the development of new strategies that can prevent these infections, we build upon previous work demonstrating that the colonization of catheters by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans can be prevented by coating them with thin polymer multilayers composed of chitosan (CH) and hyaluronic acid (HA) designed to release a β-amino acid-based peptidomimetic of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We demonstrate here that this β-peptide is also potent against S. aureus (MBPC = 4 μg/mL) and characterize its selectivity toward S. aureus biofilms. We demonstrate further that β-peptide-containing CH/HA thin-films can be fabricated on the surfaces of rough planar titanium substrates in ways that allow mammalian cell attachment and permit the long-term release of β-peptide. β-Peptide loading on CH/HA thin-films was then adjusted to achieve release of β-peptide quantities that selectively prevent S. aureus biofilms on titanium substrates in vitro for up to 24 days and remained antimicrobial after being challenged sequentially five times with S. aureus inocula, while causing no significant MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cytotoxicity compared to uncoated and film-coated controls lacking β-peptide. We conclude that these β-peptide-containing films offer a novel and promising localized delivery approach for preventing orthopaedic implant infections. The facile fabrication and loading of β-peptide-containing films reported here provides opportunities for coating other medical devices prone to biofilm-associated infections. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are used widely in orthopaedic devices due to their mechanical strength and long-term biocompatibility. However, these devices are susceptible to bacterial colonization and the subsequent formation of biofilms. Here we report a chitosan and hyaluronic acid polyelectrolyte multilayer-based approach for the localized delivery of helical, cationic, globally amphiphilic β-peptide mimetics of antimicrobial peptides to inhibit S. aureus colonization and biofilm formation. Our results reveal that controlled release of this β-peptide can selectively kill S. aureus cells without exhibiting toxicity toward MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells. Further development of this polymer-based coating could result in new strategies for preventing orthopaedic implant-related infections, improving outcomes of these titanium implants.","authors":[{"name":"Angélica de L Rodríguez López"},{"name":"Myung-Ryul Lee"},{"name":"Benjamín J Ortiz"},{"name":"Benjamin D Gastfriend"},{"name":"Riley Whitehead"},{"name":"David M Lynn"},{"name":"Sean P Palecek"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial β-peptides"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Polyelectrolyte multilayers"},{"word":"S. aureus"},{"word":"Titanium substrates"}]},"article121":{"pmid":"30831229","title":"Influence of catecholamines on biofilm formation by Salmonella Enteritidis.","abs":"Salmonella spp. are the main pathogens responsible for foodborne disease worldwide. Bacterial communities use the quorum sensing system to control biofilm formation. These systems function through the secretion of substances, called auto-inducers (AI), into the environment. AI-3 is structurally similar to epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NOR) -catecholamines secreted by eukaryotic cells to communicate with each other. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate the effect of EPI and NOR on biofilm formation by S. Enteritidis at 12 °C and 25 °C. Also, we detected the presence of the csgD, adrA, and fimA genes in these strains. Biofilm formation was investigated at two temperatures (12 °C and 25 °C) using a microtiter plate assay, under four different treatments (50 mM EPI, 100 mM EPI, 50 mM NOR; 100 mM NOR) and a control group. PCR was used to detect the virulence genes associated with biofilm production. A greater number of biofilm producer isolates were observed at 25 °C than at 12 °C, regardless of the treatment. The number of biofilms forming strains at 12 °C was significantly higher in the treatment with norepinephrine at 100 μM. The proportion of non-producer and biofilm producer strains at 25 °C did not differ significantly among the treatments. All strains presented the three genes (csgD, adrA, and fimA). The approach carried out in this work is a precursor in veterinary medicine, focusing on both public and poultry health, and evaluates the influence of catecholamines on the formation of biofilms with S.

Because many bacterial infections are caused by pathogens that reside in biofilms, we sought to investigate how biofilms influence the evolution of antibiotic resistance. We hypothesize that the inherent spatial structure of biofilms facilitates the accumulation and persistence of spontaneously evolved antibiotic-resistant mutants. To test this, we tracked the frequency of mutants resistant to kanamycin and rifampicin in biofilm populations of Escherichia coli before, during, and after an antibiotic treatment regimen. Our results show that biofilms accumulate resistant mutants even in the absence of antibiotics. This resistance was found to be heritable and thus unlike the phenotypic plasticity of so-called persister cells that have been shown to occur in biofilms. Upon exposure to an antibiotic, resistant mutants swept to high frequency. Following the conclusion of treatment, these resistant mutants remained at unexpectedly high frequencies in the biofilms for over 45 days. In contrast, when samples from kanamycin-treated biofilms were used to found well-mixed liquid cultures and propagated by serial transfer, the frequency of resistant cells dramatically decreased as they were outcompeted by sensitive clones. These observations suggest that the emergence of antibiotic resistance through spontaneous mutations in spatially structured biofilms may significantly contribute to the emergence and persistence of mutants that are resistant to antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Michael T France"},{"name":"Ana Cornea"},{"name":"Hanna Kehlet-Delgado"},{"name":"Larry J Forney"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adaptation"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"selection"}]},"article128":{"pmid":"30827805","title":"Biofilm prevention concentrations (BPC) of minocycline compared to polymyxin B, meropenem, and amikacin against Acinetobacter baumannii.","abs":"Infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to treat as they are often multidrug resistant (MDR) and frequently form biofilms.

Like most implant-associated infections, spinal infections persist through colonization and biofilm formation on spinal instrumentation, which can include metal screws and rods for fixation and an intervertebral cage commonly comprised of polyether ether ketone (PEEK). We have designed a PEEK antibiotic reservoir that would clip to the metal fixation rod and that would achieve slow antibiotic release over several days, followed by a bolus release of antibiotics triggered by ultrasound (US) rupture of a reservoir membrane. We have found using human physiological fluid (synovial fluid), that higher levels (100-500 μg) of vancomycin are required to achieve a marked reduction in adherent bacteria vs. that seen in the common bacterial medium, trypticase soy broth. To achieve these levels of release, we applied a polylactic acid coating to a porous PEEK puck, which exhibited both slow and US-triggered release. This design was further refined to a one-hole or two-hole cylindrical PEEK reservoir that can clip onto a spinal rod for clinical use. Short-term release of high levels of antibiotic (340 ± 168 μg), followed by US-triggered release was measured (7420 ± 2992 μg at 48 h).

The central theme in most of these studies is that the functional unit under study is the protein itself. Recent rapid progress has radically challenged and extended this protein-function paradigm, by demonstrating that novel function(s) may emerge when proteins form dynamic and non-stoichiometric supramolecular assemblies. There is an increasing number of cases for such collective functions, such as targeting, localization, protection/shielding and filtering effects, as exemplified by signaling complexes and prions, biominerals and mucus, amphibian adhesions and bacterial biofilms, and a broad range of membraneless organelles (bio-condensates) formed by liquid-liquid phase separation in the cell.

Resveratrol displays antimicrobial activity against a surprisingly wide range of bacterial, viral and fungal species. At subinhibitory concentrations, resveratrol can alter bacterial expression of virulence traits leading to reduced toxin production, inhibition of biofilm formation, reduced motility and interference with quorum sensing. In combination with conventional antibiotics, resveratrol enhances the activity of aminoglycosides against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas it antagonises the lethal activity of fluoroquinolones against S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Whilst the antimicrobial properties of the compound have been extensively studied in vitro, little is known about its efficacy in vivo. Nonetheless, following topical application resveratrol has alleviated acne lesions caused by the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. There are currently no in vivo studies addressing its effect in combination with antibiotics, but recent research suggests that there may be a potential for enhancing the antimicrobial efficacy of certain existing antibiotic classes in combination with resveratrol.

The biofilm formation was found to be highly correlated with the antibiotic resistance of H. pylori in the last decades. Moreover, H. pylori colonizes on the digestive tract epithelium located under the mucus layers, which further reduces therapeutic efficacy as mucus layers trap and remove exogenous substances including drugs. Herein, we reported a novel lipid polymer nanoparticles (LPNs) to overcome both biofilm and mucus layers obstruction. LPNs employed chitosan nanoparticle (CS NPs) as the core, mixed lipid layer containing rhamnolipids (RHL) as the shell and the surface of LPNs was further modified with DSPE-PEG2000 to improve hydrophilicity. Clarithromycin (CLR), a first-line drug for H. pylori infection, was encapsulated in LPNs. LPNs, especially the formulation utilizing 100% of RHL as the lipid shell, exhibited excellent eradicating ability to H. pylori biofilm, which was mainly reflected in the significant reduction of biofilm biomass and viability, destruction of biofilm architecture and elimination of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The anti-biofilm activities of LPNs are related to: 1) the disrupting effect of RHL on biofilm matrix; 2) antibacterial effects of CLR and CS NPs on biofilm bacteria and 3) inhibitory effects of CS NPs and RHL on bacteria adhesion and biofilm formation. Furthermore, PEGylated LPNs could rapidly penetrate through mucus without interacting with mucins and effectively eradicate H. pylori biofilm under mucus layer.

Biofilms containing C. albicans and selected bacterial species were grown on denture acrylic, and analysed by microscopy and by qPCR for expression of putative virulence genes. Candida albicans-only biofilms showed limited hyphal production. Hyphal development was significantly (P < 0·001) increased when biofilms also contained four species of oral bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces odontolyticus and Actinomyces viscosus), as was the expression of virulence genes (P < 0·05).

The in vitro expression of C. albicans virulence factors was modulated in polymicrobial biofilms. The complexity of this modulation was highlighted by the reversal of effects following introduction of a single bacterial species into a biofilm community.

The possibility to selectively modulate microbial virulence by addition of, or treatment with pro- or prebiotics avoids the use of conventional antimicrobial compounds, thus reducing the contribution to potential drug resistance.

Bacterial central metabolism is crucial for catabolic processes and provides precursors for anabolic pathways, such as the biosynthesis of essential biomolecules like amino acids or vitamins. However, most essential pathways are not regarded as good targets for antibiotic therapy since their products might be acquired from the environment. This issue raises doubts about the essentiality of such targets during infection. A putative target in bacterial anabolism is the methionine biosynthesis pathway. In contrast to humans, almost all bacteria carry methionine biosynthesis pathways which have often been suggested as putative targets for novel anti-infectives. While the growth of methionine auxotrophic strains can be stimulated by exogenous methionine, the extracellular concentrations required by most bacterial species are unknown. Furthermore, several phenotypic characteristics of methionine auxotrophs are only partly reversed by exogenous methionine. We investigated methionine auxotrophic mutants of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli (all differing in methionine biosynthesis enzymes) and found that each needed concentrations of exogenous methionine far exceeding that reported for human serum (∼30 µM). Accordingly, these methionine auxotrophs showed a reduced ability to proliferate in human serum. Additionally, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa methionine auxotrophs were significantly impaired in their ability to form and maintain biofilms. Altogether, our data show intrinsic defects of methionine auxotrophs.

Adsorption of polymer coatings, often polyelectrolytes, is typically used to alter hydroxyapatite biointerfaces and alter their bioactivity, for example to promote cell adhesion or prevent biofilm formation. The morphology of the resulting coatings is typically expected to play an important role in determining its bioactivity, yet a full picture of such structures at the surface of hydroxyapatite remains incomplete. In this study, a combination of three model substrates was characterized via in situ ellipsometry, in combination with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), to study the in situ conformation of hyaluronic acid films adsorbed at the surface of hydroxyapatite. The modes of adsorption of such polyelectrolytes are found to strongly depend on the ability of the bioceramic to readily undergo ion exchange, resulting in the remodeling and partial dissolution of the mineral phase, prior to complexation and re-precipitation at the surface, therefore forming a relatively compact, poorly solvated coating. This is in contrast to the very open and swollen polymer film that is formed on more chemically stable interfaces. Finally, the chemical structure of polyelectrolytes, their molecular weight and crosslinking are observed to impact the morphology of the films generated.","authors":[{"name":"Shoghik Hakobyan"},{"name":"Nima Roohpour"},{"name":"Julien E Gautrot"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biointerfaces"},{"word":"Ellipsometry"},{"word":"Hyaluronic acid"},{"word":"Hydroxyapatite"},{"word":"Polyelectrolyte"}]},"article162":{"pmid":"30822632","title":"Effects of Fe/S ratio on the kinetics and microbial ecology of an Fe(III)-dosed anaerobic wastewater treatment system.","abs":"Effects of Fe(III)/sulfate (Fe/S) ratio on organic carbon oxidation kinetics and microbial ecology of a novel Fe(III)-dosed anaerobic wastewater treatment system were investigated in this study.

Then the extracted amyloid fibers from biofilm were studied for their characteristics. Further, the influencing factors, PH, temperature and eDNA, were investigated. Results showed there were mainly two morphologies of amyloid fibers in S. mutans, different in width. Amyloid fibers inhibitor-EGCG obviously destroyed biofilm at different stages, which is dose-dependent. The amount of amyloid fibers positively correlated with biofilm biomass in clinical isolates. Acidic pH and high temperature obviously accelerated amyloid fibrillation. During amyloid fibrillation, amyloid growth morphologies were observed by TEM and results showed two growth morphologies.

Chitosan-propolis nanoparticles (CPNP) were prepared using Malaysian propolis and tested for their effect against S. epidermidis.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) depicted that CPNP effectively disrupted biofilm formation by S. epidermidis and decreased viability to ~25% compared to Eth and EA with viability of ~60-70%. CPNP was more effective in reducing the viability of both planktonic as well as biofilm bacteria compared to Eth and EA. At 100 μg/mL concentration, CPNP decreased the survival of biofilm bacteria by ~70% compared to Eth or EA extracts which decreased viability by only 40%-50%. The morphology of bacterial biofilm examined by scanning electron microscopy depicted partial disruption of biofilm by Eth and EA extracts and significant disruption by CPNP reducing bacterial number in the biofilm by ~90%. Real time quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression in treated bacteria showed that genes involved in intercellular adhesion such as IcaABCD, embp and other related genes were significantly downregulated by CPNP. In addition to having a direct inhibitory effect on the survival of S. epidermidis, CPNP showed synergism with the antibiotics rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and doxycycline suggestive of effective treatment regimens.

The viability of the fungal cells was controlled by the culture of planktonic cells and by examination of the biofilms using fluorescence microscopy following staining with fluorescein diacetate and ethidium bromide. Farnesol at 3 mM exerted a stronger action when added at the beginning of biofilm formation (>50% inhibition) than when added to preformed biofilms (<10% inhibition). Similarly, tyrosol at 20 mM had a greater effect on biofilm formation (>80% inhibition) than on preformed biofilms (<40% inhibition). Despite significant reductions in attached biomass, yeast growth varied little in the presence of the investigated molecules, as corroborated by the turbidimetry, culture of supernatants on solid culture medium followed by counting of colony‑forming units and viability tests using fluorescence microscopy. At the highest tested concentration, the molecules had a greater effect during the initial phases of biofilm formation. The effect of farnesol during anaerobiosis was not significantly different from that observed during aerobiosis, unlike that of tyrosol during anaerobiosis, which exhibited slightly reduced yeast biofilm inhibition. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the specific anti‑biofilm effect, independent of fungicidal or fungistatic action, of farnesol and tyrosol, as tested in C. albicans ATCC 10231 and 6 strains isolated from dentures. Prior to suggesting the use of these molecules for preventive purposes in oral hygiene, further studies are required in order to clarify the metabolic pathways and cellular mechanisms involved in their antibiofilm effect, as well as the repercussions on the oral microbiome.","authors":[{"name":"Sarra Sebaa"},{"name":"Zahia Boucherit-Otmani"},{"name":"Philippe Courtois"}],"keywords":[]},"article184":{"pmid":"30816474","title":"Effects of the antimicrobial peptide L12 against multidrug‑resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"Methicillin‑resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus; MRSA) is one of the most common bacterial pathogens and MRSA infections are characterized by high mortality rates.

However, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of L12 were not correlated with antibiotic resistance, the strains resistant to more antibiotics were not more resistant to L12. A sub‑MIC of L12 was able to inhibit biofilm formation in a dose‑dependent manner; however, concentrations of L12 ≤10 times the MIC were not sufficient to degrade previously formed biofilm.

Here, using phenotypic assays, phenotypic microarray and transcriptomic assays we show that NMP creates membrane destabilization in MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 strain. The NMP mediated membrane destabilization activity was measured using β-lactamase activity, membrane potential alteration studies, and transmission electron microscopy assays. Results from both β-lactamase and membrane potential alteration studies shows that both outer and inner membranes are destabilized in NMP exposed K. pneumoniae MGH 78578 cells. Phenotypic Microarray and RNA-seq were further used to elucidate the metabolic and transcriptional signals underpinning membrane destabilization. Membrane destabilization happens as early as 15 min post-NMP treatment. Our RNA-seq data shows that many genes involved in envelope stress response were differentially regulated in the NMP treated cells. Up-regulation of genes encoding the envelope stress response and repair systems show the distortion in membrane homeostasis during survival in an environment containing sub-inhibitory concentration of NMP. In addition, the lsr operon encoding the production of autoinducer-2 responsible for biofilm production was down-regulated resulting in reduced biofilm formation in NMP treated cells, a phenotype confirmed by crystal violet-based assays.

Infectious and inflammatory response leads to an increase in mucus viscosity and mucus plugging of small and medium-size bronchioles. Eventually, neutrophils chronically infiltrate the airways with biofilm or chronic bacterial infection. Perpetual infection and airway inflammation destroy the lungs, which leads to increased morbidity and eventual mortality in most of the patients with CF. Studies have now established that neutrophil cytotoxins, extracellular DNA, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are associated with increased mucus clogging and lung injury in CF. In addition to opportunistic pathogens, various aspects of the CF airway milieux (e.g., airway pH, salt concentration, and neutrophil phenotypes) influence the NETotic capacity of neutrophils. CF airway milieu may promote the survival of neutrophils and eventual pro-inflammatory aberrant NETosis, rather than the anti-inflammatory apoptotic death in these cells. Degrading NETs helps to manage CF airway disease; since DNAse treatment release cytotoxins from the NETs, further improvements are needed to degrade NETs with maximal positive effects. Neutrophil-T cell interactions may be important in regulating viral infection-mediated pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bacterial infections.

After incubation with a robust biofilm-forming methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolate, disks were rinsed and sonicated to collect biofilm bacteria. Serial dilutions were plated on blood agar, and colony forming units were counted log (ln) transformed for analysis of variance. Interference microscopy quantified surface roughness for comparison to biofilm growth. Scanning electron microscopy on both pre- and post-sonicated disks confirmed biofilm presence and subsequent removal, and visualized surface features on cleaned disks. Significantly more bacteria grew on rough versus polished metal preparations (p < 0.0001). Titanium alloy had more bacterial biofilm growth compared to cobalt chromium alloy (p = 0.0001) and stainless steel (p < 0.0001).

Several bacteria contribute to burn infections; among these, Pseudomonas aeruginosa majorly contributes to these infections revealing significant drug resistance. Similar to other bacteria, P. aeruginosa reveals various mechanisms to attain highest pathogenicity and resistance; among these, efflux pumps and quorum sensing are crucial. Quorum sensing enables effective communication between bacteria and synchronizes their gene expression resulting in optimum effect of the secreted proteins; alternatively, efflux pumps increase the bacterial resistance by pumping out the antimicrobial factors as well as the QS signals and precursors. Of recent, increasing episodes of drug resistance led to new findings and approaches for killing pathogenic bacteria without inducing the drug-resistant species. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), considered as an adjuvant and innovative method for conventional antibiotic therapy, is a photochemical reaction that includes visible light, oxygen, and a photosensitizer (PS). In this therapy, after exposure to visible light, the PS generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Furthermore, this oxidative stress can disrupt the coordination of gene expression and alter the bacterial behavior. Considering the fact that the adaption and several gene expression patterns of microorganisms within the biofilm make them notably resistant to the recent antimicrobial treatments, this study aimed to emphasize the relationship between the efflux pump and QS under oxidative stress and their role in P. aeruginosa's reaction to PDT.","authors":[{"name":"Parizad Rezaie"},{"name":"Maryam Pourhajibagher"},{"name":"Nasim Chiniforush"},{"name":"Nava Hosseini"},{"name":"Abbas Bahador"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"}]},"article214":{"pmid":"30809273","title":"Nitric oxide increases biofilm formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by activating the transcriptional factor Mac1p and thereby regulating the transmembrane protein Ctr1.","abs":"Biofilms with immobilized cells encased in extracellular polymeric substance are beneficial for industrial fermentation.

As yet, we know little about how various benthic cyanobacteria are distributed in river networks, or how environmental conditions or other associated microbes in their consortia affect their biosynthetic capacities. We performed metagenomic sequencing for 22 Oscillatoriales-dominated (Cyanobacteria) microbial mats collected across the Eel River network in Northern California and investigated factors associated with anatoxin-a producing cyanobacteria. All microbial communities were dominated by one or two cyanobacterial species, so the key mat metabolisms involve oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon oxidation. Only a few metabolisms fueled the growth of the mat communities, with little evidence for anaerobic metabolic pathways. We genomically defined four cyanobacterial species, all which shared <96% average nucleotide identity with reference Oscillatoriales genomes and are potentially novel species in the genus Microcoleus. One of the Microcoleus species contained the anatoxin-a biosynthesis genes, and we describe the first anatoxin-a gene cluster from the Microcoleus clade within Oscillatoriales. Occurrence of these four Microcoleus species in the watershed was correlated with total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, and the species that contains the anatoxin-a gene cluster was found in sites with higher nitrogen concentrations. Microbial assemblages in mat samples with the anatoxin-a gene cluster consistently had a lower abundance of Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria) species than did mats without the anatoxin-producing genes. The associations of water nutrient concentrations and certain co-occurring microbes with anatoxin-a producing Microcoleus motivate further exploration for their roles as potential controls on the distributions of toxigenic benthic cyanobacteria in river networks.","authors":[{"name":"Keith Bouma-Gregson"},{"name":"Matthew R Olm"},{"name":"Alexander J Probst"},{"name":"Karthik Anantharaman"},{"name":"Mary E Power"},{"name":"Jillian F Banfield"}],"keywords":[]},"article217":{"pmid":"30808979","title":"Glyoxylate cycle gene ICL1 is essential for the metabolic flexibility and virulence of Candida glabrata.","abs":"The human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata appears to utilise unique stealth, evasion and persistence strategies in subverting the onslaught of host immune response during systemic infection.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of the glyoxylate cycle gene ICL1 in alternative carbon utilisation and its importance for the virulence of C. glabrata. The data showed that disruption of ICL1 rendered C. glabrata unable to utilise acetate, ethanol or oleic acid. In addition, C. glabrata icl1∆ cells displayed significantly reduced biofilm growth in the presence of several alternative carbon sources. It was also found that ICL1 is crucial for the survival of C. glabrata in response to macrophage engulfment. Disruption of ICL1 also conferred a severe attenuation in the virulence of C. glabrata in the mouse model of invasive candidiasis. In conclusion, a functional glyoxylate cycle is essential for C. glabrata to utilise certain alternative carbon sources in vitro and to display full virulence in vivo. This reinforces the view that antifungal drugs that target fungal Icl1 have potential for future therapeutic intervention.","authors":[{"name":"Shu Yih Chew"},{"name":"Kok Lian Ho"},{"name":"Yoke Kqueen Cheah"},{"name":"Tzu Shan Ng"},{"name":"Doblin Sandai"},{"name":"Alistair J P Brown"},{"name":"Leslie Thian Lung Than"}],"keywords":[]},"article218":{"pmid":"30808968","title":"Bactericidal ZnO glass-filled thermoplastic polyurethane and polydimethyl siloxane composites to inhibit biofilm-associated infections.","abs":"This study investigates a novel approach to controlling biofilms of the most frequent pathogens implicated in the etiology of biomaterials-associated infections.

Clinical isolates included CAP (n=41), healthcare-associated pneumonia (n=7) and nosocomial bloodstream (n=7) isolates.

Patients with A. baumannii CAP were almost all critically unwell; 82 % required intensive care unit admission and 18 % died during their inpatient stay. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that community-onset strains were not phylogenetically distinct from nosocomial strains. Some non-multidrug-resistant local strains were closely related to multidrug-resistant strains from geographically distant locations. Pasteur sequence type (ST)10 was the dominant ST and accounted for 31/60 (52 %) northern Australian strains; the remainder belonged to a diverse range of STs.

In addition to Lactobacilli, other microorganisms populate the cervicovaginal microbiota, like Candida spp. and Gardnerella vaginalis. The overgrowth of Candida spp. or G. vaginalis, known as biofilm-producing microorganisms in the genital ecosystem, may lead to microbial dysbiosis that increases the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, like Chlamydia trachomatis. C. trachomatis, the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases, is still considered an important public health problem worldwide because of the impact of asymptomatic infections on long-term reproductive sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. The aim of our study was to investigate the interaction between C. trachomatis and the biofilm produced by Candida albicans or Gardnerella vaginalis, evaluating whether the biofilm can harbor C. trachomatis and influence its survival as well as its infectious properties. In order to do so, we developed an in vitro coculture transwell-based biofilm model. Our findings proved, for the first time, that C. trachomatis, an intracellular obligate pathogen, survived, for up to 72 hours after exposure, inside the biofilm produced by C. albicans or G. vaginalis, retaining its infectious properties, as evidenced by the typical chlamydial inclusions observed in the cell monolayer (chlamydial inclusion-forming units at 72 h: 9255 ± 1139 and 9873 ± 1015, respectively). In conclusion, our results suggest that the biofilm related to Candida or Gardnerella genital infections may act as a reservoir of C. trachomatis and, thus, contribute to the transmission of the infection in the population as well as to its dissemination into the upper genital tract, increasing the risk of developing severe reproductive sequelae.","authors":[{"name":"Simone Filardo"},{"name":"Marisa Di Pietro"},{"name":"Giulia Tranquilli"},{"name":"Rosa Sessa"}],"keywords":[]},"article233":{"pmid":"30804914","title":"Positive Regulation of Spoilage Potential and Biofilm Formation in Shewanella baltica OS155 via Quorum Sensing System Composed of DKP and Orphan LuxRs.","abs":"The spoilage potential and biofilm formation of Shewanella baltica are reported to be regulated by Quorum sensing (QS) system from the phenotype point of view, but the specific mechanism is not fully understood.

Consequently, the addition of riboflavin to a bioelectrochemical system (BES) containing S. oneidensis cells as biocatalyst leads to a strong current increase. Still, an external application of riboflavin to increase current production in continuously operating BESs does not seem to be applicable due to the constant washout of the soluble flavin compound. In this study, we developed a recyclable electron shuttle to overcome the limitation of mediator addition to BES. Riboflavin was coupled to magnetic beads that can easily be recycled from the medium. The effect on current production and cell distribution in a BES as well as the recovery rate and the stability of the beads was investigated. The addition of synthesized beads leads to a more than twofold higher current production, which was likely caused by increased biofilm production.

We explored the potential of a 10 μm thin polyester filter membrane (PE-filter) as a versatile sample substrate for high-pressure freezing. Planktonic bacteria, bacterial spores and suspended eukaryotic cells could be concentrated on the PE-filter, whereas biofilm, bacterial microcolonies and HeLa cells were able to grow directly on the PE-filter. These microorganism-loaded PE-filters were used for high-pressure freezing, freeze-substitution and plastic embedding in Epon or Lowicryl.

The fact that microorganism-loaded PE-filters could be also examined with confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy under fully hydrated conditions, and freeze-substituted PE-filters samples with scanning electron microscopy, demonstrates the versatility of the PE-filter as a sample substrate for a wide array of microorganisms. LAY DESCRIPTION: In order to investigate biological samples in the transmission electron microscope it is imperative to remove all their water content, or the specimens will be destroyed by boiling in the high vacuum of the microscope. In order to avoid dramatic morphology-changes due to drying artefacts or the impact of chemical stabilisers, high-pressure freezing (HPF) was developed. This protocol allows freezing biological samples in an instant (within a few milliseconds) down to -196°C while applying high pressure at the same time so that the specimen retains all its water in a solidified noncrystalline form. However, the formation of morphology-destroying ice crystals is only avoided, if the cooling of the sample is faster than the ice crystal formation, which is only possible with very thin samples (up to a maximum of 200 μm in optimal cases). High-pressure freezing is regarded as the gold-standard for sample preparation of cells, tissues and small organisms. However, all of these samples must fit into the dimensions of the specific sample holder of the high-pressure freezer and their transfer into the high-pressure freezing machine must be achieved without significant impact on sample physiology. Additionally, it may also necessary to concentrate and immobilise a biological specimen before they can be placed in the HPF sample holder. Although a few number of strategies and sample substrates have been used for different types of biological samples, we explored the potential of a 10 μm thin polyester filter membrane (PE-filter) as a versatile sample substrate for HPF. In culture medium suspended bacteria, suspended bacterial spores and in medium suspended higher cells could be concentrated on the PE-filter, whereas bacterial biofilm or bacterial microcolonies from an agar plate, and surface-adhering higher cells were able to grow directly on the PE-filter. These microorganism-loaded PE-filters could be directly used for high-pressure freezing, and were finally embedded in a plastic resin like Epon or Lowicryl. Embedded filters were cross-sectioned so that the interface between microorganism and substrate or overlying medium was revealed. Although the structural preservation was good for thin samples and samples with lower water content, such as biofilms, adherent HeLa-cell cultures were likewise sufficiently preserved for transmission electron microscopy imaging.

The initial adhesion behaviors of BF modified with CPAM (CMBF) were interpreted by thermodynamics and extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. According to the total interaction energy calculated by the extended DLVO theory, insurmountable energy barrier between BF and Escherichia coli (E. coli) made irreversible adhesion unachievable due to hydrophobicity and electronegativity of BF, but allowed reversible adhesion at second minimum. By contrast, the energy barrier between CMBF and E. coli could be overcome allowing irreversible bacterial adhesion and thus a huge amount of biomass because of hydrophilicity and electropositivity of CMBF. The results showed the total interaction energies were dominated by Lewis acid-base and electrostatic interactions and coating BF with CPAM could promote initial bacterial adhesion on carrier surface.

To gain a deeper understanding of the genetic basis for the development of a transmissible biofilm infection in the flea foregut, we evaluated additional gene differences and performed in vivo transcriptional profiling of Y. pestis, a Y. pseudotuberculosis wild-type strain (unable to form biofilm in the flea foregut), and a Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant strain (able to produce foregut-blocking biofilm in fleas) recovered from fleas 1 day and 14 days after an infectious blood meal. Surprisingly, the Y. pseudotuberculosis mutations that increased c-di-GMP levels and enabled biofilm development in the flea did not change the expression levels of the hms genes responsible for the synthesis and export of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix required for mature biofilm formation. The Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant uniquely expressed much higher levels of Yersinia type VI secretion system 4 (T6SS-4) in the flea, and this locus was required for flea blockage by Y. pseudotuberculosis but not for blockage by Y. pestis. Significant differences between the two species in expression of several metabolism genes, the Psa fimbrial genes, quorum sensing-related genes, transcription regulation genes, and stress response genes were evident during flea infection.

This highly prevalent disease is the costliest in dairy industry. Adherence and biofilm production are important factors in streptoccocal pathogenesis. We have previously described the adhesion and internalization of SDSD isolates in human cells and now we describe the biofilm production capability of this bacterium. In this work we integrated microbiology, imaging and computational methods to evaluate the biofilm production capability of SDSD isolates; to assess the presence of biofilm regulatory protein BrpA homolog in the biofilm producers; and to predict a structural model of BrpA-like protein and its binding to putative inhibitors. Our results show that SDSD isolates form biofilms on abiotic surface such as glass (hydrophilic) and polystyrene (hydrophobic), with the strongest biofilm formation observed in glass. This ability was mainly associated with a proteinaceous extracellular matrix, confirmed by the dispersion of the biofilms after proteinase K and trypsin treatment. The biofilm formation in SDSD isolates was also confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Under SEM observation, VSD16 isolate formed cell aggregates during biofilm growth while VSD9 and VSD10 formed smooth and filmy layers. We show that brpA-like gene is present and expressed in SDSD biofilm-producing isolates and its expression levels correlated with the biofilm production capability, being more expressed in the late exponential phase of planktonic growth compared to biofilm growth. Fisetin, a known biofilm inhibitor and a putative BrpA binding molecule, dramatically inhibited biofilm formation by the SDSD isolates but did not affect planktonic growth, at the tested concentrations. Homology modeling was used to predict the 3D structure of BrpA-like protein. Using high throughput virtual screening and molecular docking, we selected five ligand molecules with strong binding affinity to the hydrophobic cleft of the protein, making them potential inhibitor candidates of the SDSD BrpA-like protein.

These bacteria form thicker biofilms and stay more active than soluble-respiring bacteria biofilms because their electron acceptor is always accessible. In bioelectrochemical systems such as microbial fuel cells, corrosion-resistant metals uptake current from the bacteria, producing power. While beneficial for engineering applications, collecting current using corrosion resistant metals induces pH stress in the biofilm, unlike the naturally occurring process where a reduced metal combines with protons released during respiration. To reduce pH stress, some bioelectrochemical systems use forced convection to enhance mass transport of both nutrients and byproducts; however, biofilms' small pore size limits convective transport, thus, reducing pH stress in these systems remains a challenge. Understanding how convection is necessary but not sufficient for maintaining biofilm health requires decoupling mass transport from momentum transport (i.e. fluidic shear stress). In this study we use a rotating disc electrode to emulate a practical bioelectrochemical system, while decoupling mass transport from shear stress. This is the first study to isolate the metabolic and structural changes in electroactive biofilms due to shear stress. We find that increased shear stress reduces biofilm development time while increasing its metabolic rate. Furthermore, we find biofilm health is negatively affected by higher metabolic rates over long-term growth due to the biofilm's memory of the fluid flow conditions during the initial biofilm development phases. These results not only provide guidelines for improving performance of bioelectrochemical systems, but also reveal features of biofilm behavior. Results of this study suggest that optimized reactors may initiate operation at high shear to decrease development time before decreasing shear for steady-state operation. Furthermore, this biofilm memory discovered will help explain the presence of channels within biofilms observed in other studies.","authors":[{"name":"A-Andrew D Jones"},{"name":"Cullen R Buie"}],"keywords":[]},"article285":{"pmid":"30795855","title":"Synthetic nanoparticles for selective hydrolysis of bacterial autoinducers in quorum sensing.","abs":"N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are signal molecules used by a large number of gram-negative bacteria in quorum sensing and their hydrolysis is known to inhibit biofilm formation.

It functions by inhibiting glucan synthase thus weakening the fungal cell wall leading to death. Recently reports of resistance to caspofungin have been reported mainly through mutations in the FKS encoded subunits of glucan synthase at hot spot 1 (amino acids 641 to 649, FSTLSLRDP) and hot spot 2 (amino acids 1357 to 1364, DWIRRYTL). Our study aimed at sequencing both hot spots from 16 C. albicans Lebanese hospital isolates resistant and sensitive to caspofungin to determine whether mutations in these hot spots are present, and whether such mutations also impart resistance to our isolates. In addition, we wanted to determine any relationship between resistance and pathogenicity related attributes such as virulence, resistance to cell wall disrupting agents, biofilm formation, and cell wall chitin deposition. Five isolates were found to contain mutations with the mutations restricted to resistant strains. Within hot spot 1 substitution at positions S642, T643, L644, R647, and D648 were found, while within hot spot 2 substitutions at positions L1364, T1363, and R1360, W1358 and R1361 were identified with some of the mutations not previously documented. Strains that were resistant to caspofungin also showed increased resistance to Congo red but decreased biofilm formation and attenuated virulence in a mouse model of infection. Caspofungin sensitive strains showed decreased resistance to Congo red yet increased virulence and biofilm formation. Chitin content analysis showed that caspofungin resistant strains had elevated levels of chitin resulting in cell wall thickening that counters the effect of caspofungin, while sensitive strains showed decreased chitin content.

DO sensor designs can employ selectively permeable membranes to isolate DO from untargeted compounds or organisms in waterbodies. Hence, the DO concentration can be monitored and the health of the water can be evaluated over time. However, the presence of bacteria in natural waterbodies can lead to the formation of biofilms that can block pores and prevent analyte from permeating the membrane, resulting in inaccurate readings. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of a fluorosilane-based omniphobic lubricant-infused (OLI) coating on a selectively permeable membrane and investigate the rate of biofilm formation for a commercially available DO sensor. Coated and unmodified membranes were incubated in an environment undergoing accelerated bacterial growth, and the change in sensitivity was evaluated after 40, 100, 250, and 500 h. Our findings show that the OLI membranes attenuate biofouling by 70% and maintain sensitivity after 3 weeks of incubation, further demonstrating that oxygen transfer through the OLI coating is achievable. Meanwhile, unmodified membranes exhibit significant biofouling that results in a 3.35 higher rate of decay in oxygen measurement sensitivity and an over 70% decrease in static contact angle. These results show that the OLI coating can be applied on commercially available membranes to prevent biofouling.

In the present study, Bacillus velezensis BS-37, initially identified as a strain of Bacillus subtilis, was used to efficiently produce surfactin with the addition of glycerol, an inexpensive by-product of biodiesel production. After 36 hr of growth in glycerol medium, the total surfactin concentration reached more than 1,000 mg/L, which was two times higher than that in sucrose medium. Moreover, the addition of l- and d-Leu to the culture medium had opposite effects on surfactin production by BS-37. While surfactin production increased significantly to nearly 2,000 mg/L with the addition of 10 mM l-Leu, it was dramatically reduced to about 250 mg/L with the addition of 10 mM d-Leu. To systemically elucidate the mechanisms influencing the efficiency of this biosynthesis process, we sequenced the genome of BS-37 and analyzed changes of the transcriptome in glycerol medium in response to d-/l-leucine. The RPKM analysis of the transcriptome of BS-37 showed that the transcription levels of genes encoding modular surfactin synthase, the glycerol utilization pathway, and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) synthesis pathways were all at a relatively high level, which may offered an explanation why this strain can efficiently use glycerol to produce surfactin with a high yield. Neither l-Leu nor d-Leu had a significant effect on the expression of genes in these pathways, indicating that l-Leu plays an important role as a precursor or substrate involved in surfactin production, while d-Leu appears to act as a competitive inhibitor.

To help understand the genome-wide characteristics of RTE food isolates, the complete genomes of 27 RTE food isolates were sequenced and compared to those of 20 clinical and 19 other environmental (e.g., water and aquatic product source) isolates using a comparative genomics approach. Analysis revealed that V. parahaemolyticus RTE food isolates had higher numbers of genes on average and possessed more accessory genes than isolates from other sources. Most RTE food isolates were positive for some known virulence-associated genes and pathogenicity islands (PAIs), and some of these isolates were genetically homologous to clinical isolates. Genome-wide association analysis revealed 79 accessory genes and 78 missense single-nucleotide polymorphisms that affected 11 protein-coding genes were significantly associated with RTE food sources. These genes were mostly involved in defense mechanisms and energy production and conversion according to functional annotation in the COG database. KEGG Pathway analysis showed that these genes mainly affected the biofilm formation of V. parahaemolyticus, and subsequent experiments confirmed that nearly all RTE food isolates possessed the ability to form biofilm. The biofilm formation can facilitate the persistence of V. parahaemolyticus in RTE foods, and the presence of virulence-associated genes poses a pathogenic potential to humans.

For many reasons, the emergence/re-emergence of threatening pathogens has increased and poses a serious challenge to health care services. Considering the changing dynamics of 21st-century materials with medical potentialities, the integration of bioactive agents into materials to engineer antibacterial matrices has received limited attention so far. Thus, antimicrobial active conjugates are considered potential candidates to eradicate infections and reduce microbial contaminations in healthcare facilities. In this context, eco-friendly and novel conjugates with antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and anticancer potentialities were developed using biogenic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from Convolvulus arvensis (C. arvensis) extract and chitosan (CHI). A range of instrumental and imaging tools, i.e., UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), were employed to characterize the freshly extracted C. arvensis AgNPs. Biogenic AgNPs obtained after a 24-h reaction period were used to engineer CHI-based conjugates and designated as CHI‒AgNPs1 to CHI‒AgNPs5, subject to the C. arvensis AgNPs concentration. After the stipulated loading period, 92% loading efficiency (LE) was recorded for a CHI‒AgNPs3 conjugate. Gram+ and Gram- bacterial isolates, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, were used to test the antibacterial activities of newly developed CHI‒AgNPs conjugates. In comparison to the control sample with bacterial cell count 1.5 × 10⁸ CFU/mL, a notable reduction in the log values was recorded for the CHI‒AgNPs3 conjugate. The antibiofilm potential of CHI‒AgNPs conjugates was tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, the CHI‒AgNPs3 conjugate also showed substantial cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell line. In summary, the newly engineered CHI‒AgNPs conjugates with antibacterial, antibiofilm, and anticancer potentialities are potential candidate materials for biomedical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Bilal"},{"name":"Yuping Zhao"},{"name":"Tahir Rasheed"},{"name":"Ishtiaq Ahmed"},{"name":"Sherif T S Hassan"},{"name":"Muhammad Zohaib Nawaz"},{"name":"Hafiz M N Iqbal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AgNPs"},{"word":"Convolvulus arvensis"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"anticancer"},{"word":"chitosan"}]},"article305":{"pmid":"30790754","title":"Removal of petroleum hydrocarbons and sulfates from produced water using different bioelectrochemical reactor configurations.","abs":"Produced water (PW) is a wastewater generated in large quantities from the extraction of oil and gas.

However, RpoS-dependent genes in P. fluorescens remained undefined.

A total of 375 differentially expressed coding sequences (DECs) and 212 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified. The DECs were further verified by qRT-PCR. The combined transcriptome and proteome analyses revealed the involvement of this regulator in several cellular processes, mainly including polysaccharide metabolism, intracellular secretion, extracellular structures, cell wall biogenesis, stress responses, and amino acid and biogenic amine metabolism, which may contribute to the biofilm formation, stress resistance, and spoilage activities of P. fluorescens.

Biofilms are highly tolerant to antifungal therapy. This phenomenon has been partially explained by the appearance of so-called persister cells, phenotypic variants of wild-type cells, capable of surviving very high concentrations of antimicrobial agents. Persister cells in C. albicans were found exceptionally in biofilms, while none were detected in planktonic cultures of this fungus. Yet, this topic remains controversial, as others could not observe persister cells in biofilms formed by the C. albicans SC5314 laboratory strain. Due to ambiguous data in the literature, this work aimed to reevaluate the presence of persister cells in C. albicans biofilms. We demonstrated that the isolation of C. albicans persister cells as described previously was likely to be the result of the survival of biofilm cells that were not reached by the antifungal. We tested biofilms of SC5314 and its derivatives, as well as 95 clinical isolates, using an improved protocol, demonstrating that persister cells are not a characteristic trait of C. albicans biofilms. Although some clinical isolates are able to yield survivors upon the antifungal treatment of biofilms, this phenomenon is rather stochastic and inconsistent.","authors":[{"name":"Iryna Denega"},{"name":"Christophe d'Enfert"},{"name":"Sophie Bachellier-Bassi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"antifungal tolerance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"persistence"}]},"article329":{"pmid":"30782994","title":"Iron/Heme Metabolism-Targeted Gallium(III) Nanoparticles Are Active against Extracellular and Intracellular Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.","abs":"Iron/heme acquisition systems are critical for microorganisms to acquire iron from the human host, where iron sources are limited due to the nutritional immune system and insolubility of the ferric form of iron.

We found that depleting the anionic phospholipid cardiolipin reduces biofilm formation in Escherichia coli cells by as much as 50%. The absence of cardiolipin activates the regulation of colanic acid synthesis (Rcs) envelope stress response, which represses the production of flagella, disrupts initial biofilm attachment, and reduces biofilm growth.

In this study, we examine V. fischeri isolates worldwide to understand the landscape of biofilm regulation during beneficial colonization. We provide a detailed study of three distinct evolutionary groups of V. fischeri and find that while the RscS-Syp biofilm pathway is required in one of the groups, two other groups of squid symbionts require Syp independent of RscS. Mediterranean squid symbionts, including V. fischeri SR5, colonize without an RscS homolog encoded by their genome. Additionally, group A V. fischeri strains, which form a tightly related clade of Hawaii isolates, have a frameshift in rscS and do not require the gene for squid colonization or competitive fitness. These same strains have a frameshift in sypE, and we provide evidence that this group A sypE allele leads to an upregulation in biofilm activity.

Nystatin is a widely-used high spectrum antifungal due to its low systemic absorption. However, nystatin has high hydrophobicity which hinders the contact with the internal lumen of the devices. In this work, hydrophilic micellar systems of nystatin were developed with sodium deoxycholate on silicone endotracheal tubes. The physical characteristics of the micellar system at different nystatin:deoxycholate ratios were studied using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The electron microscopy results reveal that the deoxycholate micellar system altered the surface morphology, and the size of the aggregates was observed to be smaller. The hydrophilic structures of deoxycholate produce systems with a high surface area containing nystatin molecules on their interior. The X-ray and differential scanning calorimetry assays revealed a typical change in the crystallinity of micellar systems when the deoxycholate proportion increases. The endothermic peak of nystatin was not observed in the micellar systems as a consequence of the reduced crystallinity. Nystatin was homogenously dispersed in the surfactant matrix. Micellar systems with 1:0.8 nystatin:deoxycholate ratio (MS-N:DC [1:0.8]) showed increased antifungal activity compared to nystatin raw material. Micellar systems also achieved an over 40% inhibition of Candida albicans biofilm formation.

Because CDNs are possibly absorbed and delivered into the bone marrow, where bone-resorbing osteoclasts are derived from monocyte/macrophage lineages, CDNs could affect bone metabolism by regulating osteoclast differentiation. In this study, we investigated the effect of CDNs on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. When bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were differentiated into osteoclasts with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in the presence of CDNs, the differentiation was inhibited by CDNs in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, CDNs did not influence the differentiation of committed osteoclasts or osteoblast precursors. STING signaling pathway appeared to be critical for CDNs-mediated inhibition of osteoclast differentiation since CDNs induced the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, a representative feature of STING activation, and osteoclast differentiation was restored in STING knockdown BMMs with siRNA. Moreover, CDNs increased the mRNA expression of STING-meditated IFN-β, which is a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis.

The results show that the dynamic model can satisfactorily predict the dynamic concentrations of sulfide and ammonium (with measured and simulated values differing by less than 6%). The model was employed to systematically assess the long-term effects of three commonly used control strategies, i.e. addition of nitrate salts, addition of biocides, and hydraulic flushing, on sulfide formation and to predict sewer biofilm compositions. The modeling results reveal that the effect of odor mitigation measures on sulfide control varied with time due to the re-establishment of sulfate-reducing bacteria community in sewer biofilm. The long-term effect of nitrate addition would be diminishing because of the growth of heterotrophic denitrifies in sewer biofilms (increased from 7% to 21% after 55 days of nitrate addition) to consumed more nitrate. After dosing biocide or hydraulic flushing in sewers, sulfide production would rebound in the following several days due to the regrowth of sewer biofilms, indicating that the optimization of odor mitigation strategies is necessary. This study highlights that the biofilm dynamics shall be involved in the simulation of odor formation and emission, to evaluate and optimize the long-term effects of mitigation measures.","authors":[{"name":"Zhen-Sheng Liang"},{"name":"Liang Zhang"},{"name":"Di Wu"},{"name":"Guang-Hao Chen"},{"name":"Feng Jiang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Hydrogen sulfide"},{"word":"Odor control"},{"word":"Sewer biofilm"},{"word":"Sewer management"},{"word":"Sewer modelling"}]},"article353":{"pmid":"30776544","title":"Phenotypic characterization, virulence, and immunogenicity of Pseudomonas plecoglossicida rpoE knock-down strain.","abs":"Pseudomonas plecoglossicida, a temperature dependent bacterial pathogen in fish, expresses rpoE gene that is sensitive to temperature and probably critical for pathogen virulence and disease development.

We have assessed the bacteriological effects of two candidate Lactobacillus probiotics and the established pharyngeal probiotic Streptococcus salivarius K12. Antagonism towards S. pyogenes and potential off-target effects were determined using sessile monospecies biofilms and pharyngeal microcosms, respectively. The candidate probiotics were antagonistic towards S. pyogenes (rank order of increasing potency, Lactobacillus acidophilus < Lactobacillus plantarum < Streptococcus salivarius) in the absence of significant acidification or cell-cell contact. Streptococcus salivarius and L. plantarum caused significant reductions in viable counts of streptococci in pharyngeal microbiotas, whilst S. salivarius also caused reductions in staphylococci. In contrast, changes in pharyngeal eubacterial DNA profiles were limited overall. In summary, the three candidate probiotics suppressed axenic Streptococcus pyogenes biofilms by mechanisms that did not depend on cell-cell contact or acidification and did not markedly destabilize complex pharyngeal microbiotas derived from healthy individuals. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Candidate probiotic bacteria deployed to prevent or treat bacterial pharyngitis will interact with the target bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes as well as with the microbiota of the throat, where off-target effects are possible. Three candidate probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Streptococcus salivarius reduced viability within extant S. pyogenes biofilms through the elaboration of diffusible factors other than fermentation acids but did not markedly disrupt ex situ pharyngeal microcosms.

Similarly, community diversity is believed to relate to ecosystem functions, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we tested the effect of disturbance on the structure, assembly, and ecosystem function of complex microbial communities within an engineered system. We carried out a microcosm experiment where activated sludge bioreactors operated in daily cycles were subjected to eight different frequency levels of augmentation with a toxic pollutant, from never (undisturbed) to every day (press-disturbed), for 35 days. Microbial communities were assessed by combining distance-based methods, general linear multivariate models, α-diversity indices, and null model analyses on metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene amplicon data. A stronger temporal decrease in α-diversity at the extreme, undisturbed and press-disturbed, ends of the disturbance range led to a hump-backed pattern, with the highest diversity found at intermediate levels of disturbance. Undisturbed and press-disturbed levels displayed the highest community and functional similarity across replicates, suggesting deterministic processes were dominating. The opposite was observed amongst intermediately disturbed levels, indicating stronger stochastic assembly mechanisms. Trade-offs were observed in the ecosystem function between organic carbon removal and both nitrification and biomass productivity, as well as between diversity and these functions. Hence, not every ecosystem function was favoured by higher community diversity. Our results show that the assessment of changes in diversity, along with the underlying stochastic-deterministic assembly processes, is essential to understanding the impact of disturbance in complex microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Ezequiel Santillan"},{"name":"Hari Seshan"},{"name":"Florentin Constancias"},{"name":"Daniela I Drautz-Moses"},{"name":"Stefan Wuertz"}],"keywords":[]},"article356":{"pmid":"30774968","title":"Citrullination mediated by PPAD constrains biofilm formation in P. gingivalis strain 381.","abs":"Porphyromonas gingivalis is the only known human-associated prokaryote that produces a peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD), a protein-modifying enzyme that is secreted along with a number of virulence factors via a type IX secretion system (T9SS). While the function of PPAD in P. gingivalis physiology is not clear, human peptidylarginine deiminases are known to convert positively charged arginine residues within proteins to neutral citrulline and, thereby, impact protein conformation and function. Here, we report that the lack of citrullination in a PPAD deletion mutant (Δ8820) enhances biofilm formation. More Δ8820 cells attached to the surface than the parent strain during the early stages of biofilm development and, ultimately, mature Δ8820 biofilms were comprised of significantly more cell-cell aggregates and extracellular matrix. Imaging by electron microscopy discovered that Δ8820 biofilm cells secrete copious amounts of protein aggregates. Furthermore, gingipain-derived adhesin proteins, which are also secreted by the T9SS were predicted by mass spectrometry to be citrullinated and citrullination of these targets by wild-type strain 381 in vitro was confirmed. Lastly, Δ8820 biofilms contained more gingipain-derived adhesin proteins and more gingipain activity than 381 biofilms. Overall, our findings support the model that citrullination of T9SS cargo proteins known to play a key role in colonization, such as gingipain-derived adhesin proteins, is an underlying mechanism that modulates P. gingivalis biofilm development.","authors":[{"name":"Danielle M Vermilyea"},{"name":"Gregory K Ottenberg"},{"name":"Mary E Davey"}],"keywords":[]},"article357":{"pmid":"30774454","title":"Enhanced efficacy of chemically modified curcumin in experimental periodontitis: systemic implications.","abs":"Dental microbial biofilm initiates gingival inflammation, and its suppression is the current dominant strategy for treating periodontitis.

The identified risk factors correspond to virulence, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. Therefore, we aimed to characterize S. epidermidis isolated along the artisanal raw milk production chain. Seventy artisanal cheeses samples from unpasteurized cow milk purchased in Podlasie and Warmia and Mazury region in Poland, were included in this study. A total of 26 S. epidermidis isolates were obtained. Most of them were antimicrobial resistant, such as to penicillin (84,6%), clindamycin (46,2%), tetracycline (42,3%), erythromycin (42,3%) and cefoxitin (26,9%). Only one isolate was susceptible to all antibiotics used in the study. All methicillin resistant S. epidermidis strains (26,9%) harbored mecA gene. Isolates, phenotypic resistant to tetracycline, harbored at least one tetracycline resistance determinant on which tet(M) was most frequent. Moreover, all tetracycline resistant strains harbored Tn916-Tn1545-like integrase family gene. In the erythromycin resistant isolates, the macrolide resistance genes ermC, ermB or msrA/B were present. Seven strains demonstrated a strong ability to form biofilm and moderate and weak biofilm was demonstrated by 4 strains, whereas 11 of S. epidermidis isolates were found to be unable to form a biofilm.

Although it is a healthy microbiota, genetic and epigenetic alterations in host and pathogen, and microenvironment changes would lead to thrush, vaginal yeast infection, and even hematogenously disseminated infection. Despite the fact that cytotoxicity is well-characterized, few studies discuss the genome-wide genetic and epigenetic molecular mechanisms between host and C. albicans. The aim of this study is to identify drug targets and design a multiple-molecule drug to prevent the infection from C. albicans. To investigate the common and specific pathogenic mechanisms in human oral epithelial OKF6/TERT-2 cells during the C. albicans infection in different strains, systems modeling and big databases mining were used to construct candidate host⁻pathogen genetic and epigenetic interspecies network (GEIN). System identification and system order detection are applied on two-sided next generation sequencing (NGS) data to build real host⁻pathogen cross-talk GEINs. Core host⁻pathogen cross-talk networks (HPCNs) are extracted by principal network projection (PNP) method. By comparing with core HPCNs in different strains of C. albicans, common pathogenic mechanisms were investigated and several drug targets were suggested as follows: orf19.5034 (YBP1) with the ability of anti-ROS; orf19.939 (NAM7), orf19.2087 (SAS2), orf19.1093 (FLO8) and orf19.1854 (HHF22) with high correlation to the hyphae growth and pathogen protein interaction; orf19.5585 (SAP5), orf19.5542 (SAP6) and orf19.4519 (SUV3) with the cause of biofilm formation.

A well-designed active release coating might assist host immunity in clearing bacterial contaminants within the narrow perioperative window and ultimately prevent microbial colonization of the joint prosthesis. A first-in-class compound (CZ-01127) was tested as the active release agent in a silicone (Si) coating using an in vitro dynamic flow model of surgical site contamination and compared with analogous coatings containing clinical gold-standard antibiotics vancomycin and gentamicin; the CZ-01127 coating outperformed both vancomycin and gentamicin coatings and was the only to decrease the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) inocula below detectable limits for the first 3 days. The antimicrobial activity of CZ-01127, and for comparison vancomycin and gentamicin, were characterized against both planktonic and biofilm MRSA using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, serial passages, and serial dilution tests against established biofilms grown with a CBR 90 CDC biofilm reactor. Despite a similar MIC (1 µg/ml) and behavior in a 25-day serial passage analysis, CZ-01127 displayed much greater bactericidal activity against established biofilms and was the only to decrease biofilm colony forming units (CFUs) below detectable limits at the highest concentration tested (500 µg/ml). Coating release profiles were characterized using ATR-FTIR and displayed burst release kinetics within the decisive period of the perioperative window suggesting the silicon carrier is broadly useful for screening antibiotic compound for local delivery applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: With an aging population, an increasing number of people are undergoing total joint replacement procedures in which diseased joint tissues are replaced with permanent metallic implants. Some of these procedures are burdened by costly and debilitating infections. A promising approach to prevent infections is the use of an antimicrobial coating on the surface of the implant which releases antibiotics into the surgical site to prevent infection. In this study, we tested a new antibiotic compound formulated in a silicone coating. Data showed that this compound was more effective at killing pathogenic methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria than two clinical gold-standard antibiotics-vancomycin and gentamicin-and could be a promising agent for antimicrobial coating technologies.","authors":[{"name":"Nicholas N Ashton"},{"name":"Gina Allyn"},{"name":"Scott T Porter"},{"name":"Travis J Haussener"},{"name":"Paul R Sebahar"},{"name":"Ryan E Looper"},{"name":"Dustin L Williams"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiofilm"},{"word":"Antibiotic"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Coating"},{"word":"Norspermidine"},{"word":"Prosthetic joint infection"}]},"article376":{"pmid":"30769118","title":"Evolved Biofilm: Review on the Experimental Evolution Studies of Bacillus subtilis Pellicles.","abs":"For several decades, laboratory evolution has served as a powerful method to manipulate microorganisms and to explore long-term dynamics in microbial populations. Next to canonical Escherichia coli planktonic cultures, experimental evolution has expanded into alternative cultivation methods and species, opening the doors to new research questions. Bacillus subtilis, the spore-forming and root-colonizing bacterium, can easily develop in the laboratory as a liquid-air interface colonizing pellicle biofilm. Here, we summarize recent findings derived from this tractable experimental model. Clonal pellicle biofilms of B. subtilis can rapidly undergo morphological and genetic diversification creating new ecological interactions, for example, exploitation by biofilm non-producers. Moreover, long-term exposure to such matrix non-producers can modulate cooperation in biofilms, leading to different phenotypic heterogeneity pattern of matrix production with larger subpopulation of ON cells. Alternatively, complementary variants of biofilm non-producers, each lacking a distinct matrix component, can engage in a genetic division of labor, resulting in superior biofilm productivity compared to the generalist wild type. Nevertheless, inter-genetic cooperation appears to be evanescent and rapidly vanquished by individual biofilm formation strategies altering the amount or the properties of the remaining matrix component. Finally, fast-evolving mobile genetic elements can unpredictably shift intra-species interactions in B. subtilis biofilms. Understanding evolution in clonal biofilm populations will facilitate future studies in complex multispecies biofilms that are more representative of nature.","authors":[{"name":"Ákos T Kovács"},{"name":"Anna Dragoš"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"experimental evolution"},{"word":"heterogeneity"},{"word":"sociomicrobiology"}]},"article377":{"pmid":"30768738","title":"Susceptibility to Oral Antiseptics and Virulence Factors Ex Vivo Associated with Candida spp. Isolated from Dental Prostheses.","abs":"To isolate Candida spp. from dental prosthesis users' saliva and to evaluate the isolates for the presence of several virulence factors.

It remains unclear, however, whether the interaction between plants and B. cereus AR156 may facilitate composition changes of plant root exudates and whether these changes directly affect the growth of both plant pathogens and B. cereus AR156 itself. Here, we addressed these questions by analyzing the influences of root exudate changes mediated by B. cereus AR156 during biocontrol against tomato bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. Indeed, some upregulated metabolites in tomato root exudates induced by B. cereus AR156 (REB), such as lactic acid and hexanoic acid, induced the growth and motile ability of in vitro B. cereus AR156 cells. Exogenously applying hexanoic acid and lactic acid to tomato plants showed positive biocontrol efficacy (46.6 and 39.36%) against tomato bacterial wilt, compared with 51.02% by B. cereus AR156 itself. Furthermore, fructose, lactic acid, sucrose and threonine at specific concentrations stimulated the biofilm formation of B. cereus AR156 in Luria-Bertan- Glycerol- Magnesium medium (LBGM), and we also detected more colonized cells of B. cereus AR156 on the tomato root surface after adding these four compounds to the system.

Silver electrodes were overlaid with agar and lawn biofilms grown for 24 h. A 6 V battery with 1 kΩ ballast resistor was used to treat the biofilms for 1 h or 24 h.

Based on possible electrochemical ractions of silver electrodes in chlorine containing medium; pH measurements of the medium post treatment; the time delay between initiation of treatment and observed bactericidal effects; and the presence of chlorotyrosine in the cell lysates, hypochlorous acid is hypothesized to be the chemical agent responsible for the observed (destruction/killing/eradication) of these biofilm forming bacteria.

OMVs are observed in lab-grown and environmental biofilms, but our understanding of their function comes primarily from planktonic studies. Planktonic OMVs assist in toxin delivery, cell-cell communication, horizontal gene transfer, small RNA trafficking, and immune system evasion. Previous studies reported differences in size and proteomic cargo between planktonic and agar plate biofilm OMVs, suggesting possible differences in function between OMV types. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa interstitial biofilms, extracellular vesicles were reported to arise through cell lysis, in contrast to planktonic OMV biogenesis that involves the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) without appreciable autolysis. Differences in biogenesis mechanism could provide a rationale for observed differences in OMV characteristics between systems. Using nanoparticle tracking, we found that P. aeruginosa PAO1 planktonic and biofilm OMVs had similar characteristics. However, P. aeruginosa PA14 OMVs were smaller, with planktonic OMVs also being smaller than their biofilm counterparts. Large differences in Staphylococcus killing ability were measured between OMVs from different strains, and a smaller within-strain difference was recorded between PA14 planktonic and biofilm OMVs. Across all conditions, the predatory ability of OMVs negatively correlated with their size. To address biogenesis mechanism, we analyzed vesicles from wild type and pqsA mutant biofilms. This showed that PQS is required for physiological-scale production of biofilm OMVs, and time-course analysis confirmed that PQS production precedes OMV production as it does in planktonic cultures. However, a small sub-population of vesicles was detected in pqsA mutant biofilms whose size distribution more resembled sonicated cell debris than wild type OMVs. These results support the idea that, while a small and unique population of vesicles in P. aeruginosa biofilms may result from cell lysis, the PQS-induced mechanism is required to generate the majority of OMVs produced by wild type communities.","authors":[{"name":"Adam C Cooke"},{"name":"Alexander V Nello"},{"name":"Robert K Ernst"},{"name":"Jeffrey W Schertzer"}],"keywords":[]},"article399":{"pmid":"30763337","title":"TyrR is involved in the transcriptional regulation of biofilm formation and D-alanine catabolism in Azospirillum brasilense Sp7.","abs":"Azospirillum brasilense is one of the most studied species of diverse agronomic plants worldwide. The benefits conferred to plants inoculated with Azospirillum have been primarily attributed to its capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen and synthesize phytohormones, especially indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The principal pathway for IAA synthesis involves the intermediate metabolite indole pyruvic acid. Successful colonization of plants by Azospirillum species is fundamental to the ability of these bacteria to promote the beneficial effects observed in plants. Biofilm formation is an essential step in this process and involves interactions with the host plant. In this study, the tyrR gene was cloned, and the translated product was observed to exhibit homology to TyrR protein, a NtrC/NifA-type activator. Structural studies of TyrR identified three putative domains, including a domain containing binding sites for aromatic amino acids in the N-terminus, a central AAA+ ATPase domain, and a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif domain in the C-terminus, which binds DNA sequences in promoter-operator regions. In addition, a bioinformatic analysis of promoter sequences in A. brasilense Sp7 genome revealed that putative promoters encompass one to three TyrR boxes in genes predicted to be regulated by TyrR. To gain insight into the phenotypes regulated by TyrR, a tyrR-deficient strain derived from A. brasilense Sp7, named A. brasilense 2116 and a complemented 2116 strain harboring a plasmid carrying the tyrR gene were constructed. The observed phenotypes indicated that the putative transcriptional regulator TyrR is involved in biofilm production and is responsible for regulating the utilization of D-alanine as carbon source. In addition, TyrR was observed to be absolutely required for transcriptional regulation of the gene dadA encoding a D-amino acid dehydrogenase. The data suggested that TyrR may play a major role in the regulation of genes encoding a glucosyl transferase, essential signaling proteins, and amino acids transporters.","authors":[{"name":"Saúl Jijón-Moreno"},{"name":"Beatriz Eugenia Baca"},{"name":"Diana Carolina Castro-Fernández"},{"name":"Alberto Ramírez-Mata"}],"keywords":[]},"article400":{"pmid":"30763098","title":"Spray-Dried Particles of Nitric Oxide-Modified Glutathione for the Treatment of Chronic Lung Infection.","abs":"Antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria has emerged as a big challenge to human and animal health and significant economy loss worldwide.

The fluidity and conformational flexibilities of different MAs in the bacterial cell wall significantly influence its properties, function, and observed pathogenicity; thus, a proper conformational description of different MAs in different environments (e.g., in vacuum, in solution, in monolayers) can inform about their potential role in the complex setup of the bacterial cell wall. Previously, we have shown that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of MA folding in vacuo can be used to characterize MA conformers in seven groupings relating to bending at the functional groups (W, U and Z-conformations). Providing a new OPLS-based forcefield parameterization for the critical cyclopropyl group of MAs and extensive simulations in explicit solvents (TIP4P water, hexane), we now present a more complete picture of MA folding properties together with improved simulation analysis techniques. We show that the 'WUZ' distance-based analysis can be used to pinpoint conformers with hairpin bends at the functional groups, with these conformers constituting only a fraction of accessible conformations. Applying principle component analysis (PCA) and refinement using free energy landscapes (FELs), we are able to discriminate a complete and unique set of conformational preferences for representative alpha-, methoxy- and keto-MAs, with overall preference for folded conformations. A control backbone-MA without any mero-chain functional groups showed significantly less folding in the mero-chain, confirming the role of functionalization in directing folding. Keto-MA showed the highest percentage of WUZ-type conformations and, in particular, a tendency to fold at its alpha-methyl trans-cyclopropane group, in agreement with results from Villeneuve et al. MAs demonstrate similar folding in vacuum and water, with a majority of folded conformations around the W-conformation, although the molecules are more flexible in vacuum than in water. Exchange between conformations, with a disperse distribution that includes unfolded conformers, is common in hexane for all MAs, although with more organization for Keto-MA.

At the outset, our initial hypothesis was that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) possess antimicrobial and antivirulence activities. Early on, we discovered that HMOs do indeed modulate bacterial growth and biofilm production for numerous bacterial pathogens. In light of this discovery, three priorities emerged for our program moving forward. The first was to decode the mode of action behind this activity. The second was to decipher the functional effects of HMO structural diversity as there are ca. 200 unique HMOs present in human milk. Finally, we set our sights on discovering novel uses for HMOs as we believed this would uniquely position our team to achieve a major breakthrough in human health and wellness. Through a combination of fractionation techniques, chemical synthesis, and industrial partnerships, we have determined the identities of several HMOs with potent antimicrobial activity against the important neonate pathogen Group B Streptococcus (Group B Strep; GBS).

They are able to proliferate under both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor conditions. This adaptation is what makes these fungi successful pathogens. For both species, sugars are very important nutrients and as the sugar level differs depending on the host niche, different sugar sensing systems must be present. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model for the identification of these sugar sensing systems. One of the main carbon sources for yeast is glucose, for which three different pathways have been described. First, two transporter-like proteins, ScSnf3 and ScRgt2, sense glucose levels resulting in the induction of different hexose transporter genes. This situation is comparable in C. albicans and C. glabrata, where sensing of glucose by CaHgt4 and CgSnf3, respectively, also results in hexose transporter gene induction. The second glucose sensing mechanism in S. cerevisiae is via the G-protein coupled receptor ScGpr1, which causes the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, resulting in rapid adaptation to the presence of glucose. The main components of this glucose sensing system are also conserved in C. albicans and C. glabrata. However, it seems that the ligand(s) for CaGpr1 are not sugars but lactate and methionine. In C. glabrata, this pathway has not yet been investigated. Finally, the glucose repression pathway ensures repression of respiration and repression of the use of alternative carbon sources. This pathway is not well characterized in Candida species. It is important to note that, apart from glucose, other sugars and sugar-analogs, such as N-acetylglucosamine in the case of C. albicans, are also important carbon sources. In these fungal pathogens, sensing sugars is important for a number of virulence attributes, including adhesion, oxidative stress resistance, biofilm formation, morphogenesis, invasion, and antifungal drug tolerance. In this review, the sugar sensing and signaling mechanisms in these Candida species are compared to S. cerevisiae.","authors":[{"name":"Mieke Van Ende"},{"name":"Stefanie Wijnants"},{"name":"Patrick Van Dijck"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Candida glabrata"},{"word":"Gpr1/Gpa2"},{"word":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae"},{"word":"Snf1/Mig1"},{"word":"Snf3/Rgt2-Hgt4"},{"word":"sugar sensing"},{"word":"sugar transport"}]},"article408":{"pmid":"30761113","title":"Concentration Dependent Effect of Plant Root Exudates on the Chemosensory Systems of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.","abs":"Plant root colonization by rhizobacteria can protect plants against pathogens and promote plant growth, and chemotaxis to root exudates was shown to be an essential prerequisite for efficient root colonization. Since many chemoattractants control the transcript levels of their cognate chemoreceptor genes, we have studied here the transcript levels of the 27 Pseudomonas putida KT2440 chemoreceptor genes in the presence of different maize root exudate (MRE) concentrations. Transcript levels were increased for 10 chemoreceptor genes at low MRE concentrations, whereas almost all receptor genes showed lower transcript levels at high MRE concentrations. The exposure of KT2440 to different MRE concentrations did not alter c-di-GMP levels, indicating that changes in chemoreceptor transcripts are not mediated by this second messenger. Data suggest that rhizosphere colonization unfolds in a temporal fashion. Whereas at a distance to the root, exudates enhance chemoreceptor gene transcript levels promoting in turn chemotaxis, this process is reversed in root vicinity, where the necessity of chemotaxis toward the root may be less important. Insight into KT2440 signaling processes were obtained by analyzing mutants defective in the three cheA paralogous genes. Whereas a mutant in cheA1 showed reduced c-di-GMP levels and impaired biofilm formation, a cheA2 mutant was entirely deficient in MRE chemotaxis, indicating the existence of homologs of the P. aeruginosawsp and che (chemotaxis) pathways.

The present proteomics study of B. thailandensis biofilms provides a global snapshot of protein abundance differences and antimicrobial sensitivities in planktonic and sessile bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Mohd M Khan"},{"name":"Supaksorn Chattagul"},{"name":"Bao Q Tran"},{"name":"Jeffrey A Freiberg"},{"name":"Aleksandra Nita-Lazar"},{"name":"Mark E Shirtliff"},{"name":"Rasana W Sermswan"},{"name":"Robert K Ernst"},{"name":"David R Goodlett"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial tolerance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"liquid chromatography mass spectrometry"},{"word":"melioidosis"},{"word":"proteomics"}]},"article423":{"pmid":"30758305","title":"Metagenomic study on the composition of culturable and non-culturable bacteria in tap water and biofilms at intensive care units.","abs":"Bacterial community diversity of bulk water and corresponding biofilms of four intensive care units' (ICUs) drinking water systems were studied and compared using 16S rRNA gene amplicons and next generation sequencing.

We expected that harder woods would harbor aquatic insect communities with species richness and functional food group profile different from softwoods. We also expected that collector-gatherers and collector-filterers will be more abundant in softwood because harder woods are less substrate suitable for biofilm production. Aquatic insects associated with the following plants were analyzed: Gomidesia lindeniana with high-density, Psychotria grandis with medium-density, and Meriania leucantha with low-density wood. Diptera and Ephemeroptera were the most abundant groups sampled in the woods. Psychotria grandis shows higher concentrations of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, followed by G. lindeniana and M. leucantha. Breakdown rates are different among plant species with M. leucantha having four times highest breakdown rates and on average three more species in the species richness value. We did not find significant differences in the composition of insect species associated with the plants. We found evidence that the richness and functional organization of aquatic insect communities were mostly related to the breakdown rates and lignin amount of the woods. Plants that decompose faster on average have three more species and two more insect functional groups. Our findings suggest that the loss of high carbon density trees in tropical forests can affect aquatic biodiversity.","authors":[{"name":"B T Martínez"},{"name":"A T Quintana"},{"name":"Y T Cambas"},{"name":"F O Roque"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aquatic macroinvertebrates"},{"word":"Cuban stream"},{"word":"carbon densities"},{"word":"colonization"},{"word":"riparian forest"},{"word":"wood decomposition"}]},"article426":{"pmid":"30755841","title":"Determination of Tobramycin and Vancomycin Exposure Required to Eradicate Biofilms on Muscle and Bone Tissue In Vitro.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Vajra Badha"},{"name":"Rex Moore"},{"name":"John Heffernan"},{"name":"Paulo Castaneda"},{"name":"Alex McLaren"},{"name":"Derek Overstreet"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial susceptibility"},{"word":"biofilm susceptibility"},{"word":"bone and joint infection"},{"word":"local antimicrobial delivery"},{"word":"minimum biofilm eradication concentration"},{"word":"surgical site infection"}]},"article427":{"pmid":"30755738","title":"In vitro activities of antimicrobial peptides and ceragenins against Legionella pneumophila.","abs":"Legionella pneumophila is a waterborne intracellular pathogenic bacterium, the most frequent cause of human legionellosis and a relatively common cause of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia.

Carious lesions are commonly treated using dental resin composite restorations. However, resin composite restorations are prone to recurrent caries, i.e., reinfection of the surrounding dental hard tissues. Recurrent caries is mainly a consequence of waterborne and/or biofilm-mediated degradation of the tooth-restoration interface through hydrolytic, acidic and/or enzymatic challenges. Here we use amphipathic antimicrobial peptides to directly coat dentin to provide resin composite restorations with a 2-tier protective system, simultaneously exploiting the physicochemical and biological properties of these peptides. Our peptide coatings modulate dentin's hydrophobicity, impermeabilize it, and are active against multispecies biofilms derived from caries-active individuals. Therefore, the coatings hinder water penetration along the otherwise vulnerable dentin/restoration interface, even after in vitro aging, and increase its resistance against degradation by water, acids, and saliva. Moreover, they do not weaken the resin composite restorations mechanically. The peptide-coated highly-hydrophobic dentin is expected to notably improve the service life of resin composite restorations and to enable the development of entirely hydrophobic restorative systems. The peptide coatings were also antimicrobial and thus, they provide a second tier of protection preventing re-infection of tissues in contact with restorations. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We present a technology using designer peptides to treat the most prevalent chronic disease worldwide; dental caries. Specifically, we used antimicrobial amphipathic peptides to coat dentin with the goal of increasing the service life of the restorative materials used to treat dental caries, which is nowadays 5 years on average. Water and waterborne agents (enzymes, acids) degrade restorative materials and enable re-infection at the dentin/restoration interface. Our peptide coatings will hinder degradation of the restoration as they produced highly hydrophobic and antimicrobial dentin/material interfaces. We anticipate a high technological and economic impact of our technology as it can notably reduce the lifelong dental bill of patients worldwide. Our findings can enable the development of restorations with all-hydrophobic and so, more protective components.","authors":[{"name":"Dina G Moussa"},{"name":"Alex Fok"},{"name":"Conrado Aparicio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"Dental restoration"},{"word":"Dentin"},{"word":"GL13K"},{"word":"Hydrophobic coating"},{"word":"Recurrent caries"}]},"article431":{"pmid":"30753649","title":"The serine peptidase inhibitor TPCK induces several morphophysiological changes in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto.","abs":"Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (C. parapsilosis) has emerged as the second/third commonest Candida species isolated from hospitals worldwide. Candida spp. possess numerous virulence attributes, including peptidases that play multiple roles in both physiological and pathological events. So, fungal peptidases are valid targets for new drugs development. With this premise in mind, we have evaluated the effect of serine peptidase inhibitors (SPIs) on both cell biology and virulence aspects of C. parapsilosis. First, five different SPIs, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, N-α-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride, and N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) were tested, and TPCK showed the best efficacy to arrest fungal growth. Subsequently, the ability of TPCK to modulate physiopathological processes was investigated. Overall, TPCK was able to (i) inhibit the cell-associated serine peptidase activities, (ii) promote morphometric and ultrastructural alterations, (iii) induce an increase in the intracellular oxidation level, which culminates in a vigorous lipid peroxidation and accumulation of neutral lipids in cytoplasmic inclusions, (iv) modulate the expression/exposition of surface structures, such as mannose/glucose-rich glycoconjugates, N-acetylglucosamine-containing molecules, chitin, polypeptides and surface aspartic peptidases, (v) reduce the adhesion to either polystyrene or glass surfaces as well as to partially disarticulate the mature biofilm, (vi) block the fungal interaction with macrophages, and (vii) protect Galleria mellonella from fungal infection, enhancing larvae survivability. Altogether, these results demonstrated that TPCK induced several changes over fungal biology besides the interference with aspects associated to C. parapsilosis virulence and pathogenesis, which indicates that SPIs could be novel promising therapeutic agents in dealing with candidiasis.","authors":[{"name":"Rafael M Gandra"},{"name":"Laura N Silva"},{"name":"Xênia M Souto"},{"name":"Leandro S Sangenito"},{"name":"Lucas P S Cruz"},{"name":"Lys A Braga-Silva"},{"name":"Diego S Gonçalves"},{"name":"Sergio H Seabra"},{"name":"Marta H Branquinha"},{"name":"André L S Santos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Candida parapsilosis        "},{"word":"          Galleria mellonella        "},{"word":"TPCK"},{"word":"proteolytic inhibitors"},{"word":"serine peptidases"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article432":{"pmid":"30753506","title":"Efficacy of T-2307, a novel arylamidine, against ocular complications of disseminated candidiasis in mice.","abs":"T-2307, a novel arylamidine, shows broad-spectrum activity against pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans.

The haemolytic, cytotoxic, antifungal and anti-biofilm activities of LL-III/43 and peptide VIII were then tested. LL-III/43 and VIII showed moderate cytotoxicity to HUVEC-2 cells and had comparable inhibitory activity against C. albicans and non-albicans spp. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of LL-III/43 was observed towards Candida tropicalis (0.8 µM).
