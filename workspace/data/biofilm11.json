In the present study, single-factor experiments were performed. Sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, glucose and starch served as different substrates for MEC anodic culture experiments under the same condition. The effects of different substrates on the bioactivity, biomass and hydrogen production performance of MEC anodic films were analyzed. Also, the effects of different microbial communities on hydrogen production were studied using 16S rRNA sequencing. According to the experimental results, all the five substrates here can serve as hydrogen-producing raw materials for MEC. All indicators revealed that sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate are excellent biofilm culture materials. The serious acidification of glucose and starch was identified at the same substrate concentration, and the environment of the culture medium was difficult to control, which affected the growth and metabolism of electroactive microorganisms. In comparison, sodium acetate was the best, achieving a maximum output of 23.4 mA and a maximum hydrogen content of 25.85%. The other four were ranked as sodium butyrate > sodium propionate > glucose > starch. According to the results of high-throughput sequencing, when sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, glucose and starch served as substrates, the number of operational taxonomic units reached 464, 728, 636, 784, and 1,083, respectively. Furthermore, when MEC was cultured with sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate as substrates, the electroactive microorganism Desulfuromonas in the Proteobacteria would contribute the most to producing hydrogen. The relative abundance of the five substrates was ranked as sodium acetate > sodium butyrate > sodium propionate > glucose > starch, suggesting that the MEC anodic film cultured with sodium acetate as the substrate exhibited the best hydrogen production performance, and the starch showed the worst. It is noteworthy that Desulfuromonas was the most abundant species according to sequencing results. When glucose and starch served as substrates, they exhibited high biodiversity. The anodic membranes cultured with sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate were not as good as those cultured with glucose and starch, yet the electroactive microorganisms were up-regulated.","authors":[{"name":"Qiongli Shao"},{"name":"Jianchang Li"},{"name":"Sixia Yang"},{"name":"Helin Sun"}],"keywords":[]},"article3":{"pmid":"31070474","title":"Thymoquinone Inhibits Biofilm Formation and Attachment-Invasion in Host Cells of Vibrio parahaemolyticus.","abs":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a halophilic Gram-negative foodborne pathogen that is widely distributed in marine environments.

Exopolysaccharide Psl (ePsl) is a key biofilm matrix component that initiates attachment, maintains biofilms architecture, and protects bacteria within biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen. There are at least 12 Psl proteins involved in the biosynthesis of this exopolysaccharide. However, it remains unclear about the function of each Psl protein and how these proteins work together during the biosynthesis of ePsl. PslG has been characterized as a degrader of ePsl in extracellular or periplasm and PslD is predicted to be a transporter. In this study, we found that PslG and its glycoside hydrolytic activity were also involved in the biosynthesis of ePsl. PslG localized mainly in the inner membrane and some in the periplasm. The inner membrane association of PslG was critical for the biosynthesis of ePsl. The expression of PslA, PslD, and PslE helped PslG remain in the inner membrane. The bacterial two-hybrid results suggested that PslE could interacted with either PslA, PslD, or PslG. The strongest interaction was found between PslE and PslD. Consistently, PslD was disabled to localize on the outer membrane in the ΔpslE strain, suggesting that the PslE-PslD interaction affected the localization of PslD.

In fact, prokaryotic genomes frequently contain several copies of the core biosynthesis genes, pilB and pilC, encoding an ATPase and membrane anchor, respectively. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that in haloarchaea, a subset of pilB-C paralogs, such as the Haloferax volcanii pilB1-C1, were gained via horizontal transfer from the crenarchaea, while the co-regulated type IV pilus subunits, the pilins, evolved by duplication, followed by diversification of the ancestral euryarchaeal pilins. Here, we report the identification of an H. volcanii pilB1 transposon mutant that exhibits an adhesion defect in defined media. A similar defect observed in an H. volcanii ∆pilB1-C1 strain can be rescued by expressing pilB1-C1 in trans. However, these proteins cannot rescue the severe adhesion defect of a previously reported ∆pilB3-C3 strain. Conversely, pilB3-C3, which are not predicted to have been laterally transferred, expressed in trans can rescue the adhesion defect of a ∆pilB1-C1 strain. This cross-complementation supports the proposed hybrid origin of the operon containing pilB1-C1 and shows that at least certain euryarchaeal PilB paralogs can work with different pilin sets. Efficient recognition of the euryarchaeal pilins by the crenarchaeal PilB1-C1 may have required some degree of pilin modification, but perhaps the modifications were minor enough that PilB3 recognition of these pilins was not precluded, resulting in modular evolution and an extensive combinatorial diversity that allows for adaptation to a variety of stress conditions and attachment to varied surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Georgio Legerme"},{"name":"Mechthild Pohlschroder"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Haloferax volcanii"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"archaea"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"pilin"},{"word":"pilus biosynthesis"},{"word":"type IV pili"}]},"article8":{"pmid":"31068825","title":"Role of Fibroblast Populations in Periodontal Wound Healing and Tissue Remodeling.","abs":"After injury to periodontal tissues, a sequentially phased healing response is initiated that enables wound closure and partial restoration of tissue structure and function. Wound closure in periodontal tissues involves the tightly regulated coordination of resident cells in epithelial and connective tissue compartments. Multiple cell populations in these compartments synergize their metabolic activities to reestablish a mucosal seal that involves the underlying periodontal connective tissues and the attachment of these tissues to the tooth surface. The formation of an impermeable seal around the circumference of the tooth is of particular significance in oral health since colonization of tooth surfaces by pathogenic biofilms promotes inflammation, which can contribute to periodontal tissue degradation and tooth loss. The reformation of periodontal tissue structures in the healing response centrally involves fibroblasts, which synthesize and organize the collagen fibers that link alveolar bone and gingiva to the cementum covering the tooth root. The synthesis and remodeling of nascent collagen matrices are of fundamental importance for the reestablishment of a functional periodontium and are mediated by diverse, multi-functional fibroblast populations that reside within the connective tissues of gingiva and periodontal ligament. Notably, after gingival wounding, a fibroblast sub-type (myofibroblast) arises, which is centrally involved in collagen synthesis and fibrillar remodeling. While myofibroblasts are not usually seen in healthy, mature connective tissues, their formation is enhanced by wound-healing cytokines. The formation of myofibroblasts is also modulated by the stiffness of the extracellular matrix, which is mechanosensed by resident precursor cells in the gingival connective tissue microenvironment. Here, we consider the cellular origins and the factors that control the differentiation and matrix remodeling functions of periodontal fibroblasts. An improved understanding of the regulation and function of periodontal fibroblasts will be critical for the development of new therapies to optimize the restoration of periodontal structure and function after wounding.","authors":[{"name":"Patricio C Smith"},{"name":"Constanza Martínez"},{"name":"Jorge Martínez"},{"name":"Christopher A McCulloch"}],"keywords":[{"word":"connective tissue"},{"word":"fibroblast"},{"word":"gingival"},{"word":"periodontal"},{"word":"wound healing"}]},"article9":{"pmid":"31067854","title":"Removal of Pharmaceuticals and Illicit Drugs from Wastewater Due to Ferric Dosing in Sewers.","abs":"Ferric (Fe","authors":[{"name":"Jagadeeshkumar Kulandaivelu"},{"name":"Jianfa Gao"},{"name":"Yarong Song"},{"name":"Sohan Shrestha"},{"name":"Xuan Li"},{"name":"Jiaying Li"},{"name":"Katrin Doederer"},{"name":"Jurg Keller"},{"name":"Zhiguo Yuan"},{"name":"Jochen F Mueller"},{"name":"Guangming Jiang"}],"keywords":[]},"article10":{"pmid":"31067668","title":"P4VP Modified Zwitterionic Polymer for the Preparation of Antifouling Functionalized Surfaces.","abs":"Zwitterionic polymers are suitable for replacing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymers because of their better antifouling properties, but zwitterionic polymers have poor mechanical properties, strong water absorption, and their homopolymers should not be used directly.

The presence of 4-vinylpyridine (4VP) and zwitterion chains on these polymer-coated ITO surfaces was confirmed using 1H NMR, FTIR, and GPC analyses, with successful surface functionalization confirmed using water contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies.

Here we show that A. fumigatus siderophores defend against anti-fungal P. aeruginosa effects. P. aeruginosa supernatants produced in the presence of wildtype A. fumigatus planktonic supernatants (Afsup) showed less activity against A. fumigatus biofilms than P. aeruginosa supernatants without Afsup, despite higher production of pyoverdine by P. aeruginosa. Supernatants of A. fumigatus cultures lacking the sidA gene (AfΔsidA), unable to produce hydroxamate siderophores, were less capable of protecting A. fumigatus biofilms from P. aeruginosa supernatants and pyoverdine. AfΔsidA biofilm was more sensitive towards inhibitory effects of pyoverdine, the iron chelator deferiprone (DFP), or amphothericin B than wildtype A. fumigatus biofilm. Supplementation of sidA-deficient A. fumigatus biofilm with A. fumigatus siderophores restored resistance to pyoverdine. The A. fumigatus siderophore production inhibitor celastrol sensitized wildtype A. fumigatus biofilms towards the anti-fungal activity of DFP.

Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) play critical roles in transferring the reactivity from gas plasmas to solutions to induce specific biochemical responses in living targets, e.g., pathogen inactivation and biofilm removal. While this approach works well in a single-organism system at a laboratory scale, integration of plasma-enabled biofilm removal into complex real-life systems, e.g., large aquaculture tanks, is far from trivial. This is because it is difficult to deliver sufficient concentrations of the right kind of species to biofilm-covered surfaces while carefully maintaining a suitable physiochemical environment that is healthy for its inhabitants, e.g., fish. In this work, we show that underwater microplasma bubbles (generated by a microplasma-bubble reactor that forms a dielectric barrier discharge at the gas-liquid interface with the applied voltage of 4.0 kV) act as transport vehicles to efficiently deliver reactive plasma species to the target biofilm sites on artificial and living surfaces while keeping healthy water conditions in a multispecies system. The as-generated air microplasma bubbles and plasma-activated water (PAW) both can effectively reduce the existing pathogenic biofilm load by ∼83 and 60%, respectively, after 15 min of discharge at 40 W and prevent any new biofilm from forming. The generation of underwater microplasma bubbles in a custom-made fish tank for less than a minute per day (20 s per time, twice daily) can introduce sufficient quantities of RONS into PAW to reduce the biofilm-infected area by ∼80-90% and improve the health status of Cichlasoma synspilum × Cichlasoma citrinellum blood parrot cichlid fish.

This generates a short C-terminal peptide (C-pep) that remains in the cell membrane, whereas the mature adhesin is incorporated into the cell wall. Genes encoding adhesins of the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii were differentially expressed depending on whether the bacteria were isolated from saliva or dental plaque and appeared to be coordinately regulated. Deletion of sspA and sspB (sspAB), both of which encode LPXTG-containing adhesins, unexpectedly enhanced adhesion and biofilm formation. C-peps produced from a model LPXTG-containing adhesin localized to the cell membrane and bound to and inhibited the intramembrane sensor histidine kinase SGO_1180, thus preventing activation of the cognate response regulator SGO_1181. The absence of SspAB C-peps induced the expression of the scaCBA operon encoding the lipoprotein adhesin ScaA, which was sufficient to preserve and even enhance biofilm formation. This C-pep-driven regulatory circuit also exists in pathogenic streptococci and is likely conserved among Gram-positive bacteria. This quality control mechanism ensures that the bacteria can form biofilms under diverse environmental conditions and may play a role in optimizing adhesion and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey W Hall"},{"name":"Bruno P Lima"},{"name":"Gaetan G Herbomel"},{"name":"Tata Gopinath"},{"name":"LeAnna McDonald"},{"name":"Michael T Shyne"},{"name":"John K Lee"},{"name":"Jens Kreth"},{"name":"Karen F Ross"},{"name":"Gianluigi Veglia"},{"name":"Mark C Herzberg"}],"keywords":[]},"article22":{"pmid":"31064827","title":"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae Has Evolved Preferential Use of N-Acetylneuraminic Acid as a Host Adaptation.","abs":"Nontypeable Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (NTHi) is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that is adapted exclusively to human hosts. NTHi utilizes sialic acid from the host as a carbon source and as a terminal sugar on the outer membrane glycolipid lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Sialic acid expressed on LOS is critical in NTHi biofilm formation and immune evasion. There are two major forms of sialic acids in most mammals, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), the latter of which is derived from Neu5Ac. Humans lack the enzyme to convert Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc and do not express Neu5Gc in normal tissues; instead, Neu5Gc is recognized as a foreign antigen. A recent study showed that dietary Neu5Gc can be acquired by NTHi colonizing humans and then presented on LOS, which acts as an antigen for the initial induction of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Here we examined Neu5Gc uptake and presentation on NTHi LOS. We show that, although Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac are utilized equally well as sole carbon sources, Neu5Gc is not incorporated efficiently into LOS. When equal amounts of Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac are provided in culture media, there is ∼4-fold more Neu5Ac incorporated into LOS, suggesting a bias in a step of the LOS biosynthetic pathway. CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase (SiaB) was shown to have ∼4,000-fold-higher catalytic efficiency for Neu5Ac than for Neu5Gc. These data suggest that NTHi has adapted preferential utilization of Neu5Ac, thus avoiding presentation of the nonhuman Neu5Gc in the bacterial cell surface. The selective pressure for this adaptation may represent the human antibody response to the Neu5Gc xenoantigen.","authors":[{"name":"Preston S K Ng"},{"name":"Christopher J Day"},{"name":"John M Atack"},{"name":"Lauren E Hartley-Tassell"},{"name":"Linda E Winter"},{"name":"Tal Marshanski"},{"name":"Vered Padler-Karavani"},{"name":"Ajit Varki"},{"name":"Stephen J Barenkamp"},{"name":"Michael A Apicella"},{"name":"Michael P Jennings"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"bacterial metabolism"},{"word":"glycobiology"},{"word":"microbial pathogenesis"},{"word":"sialic acid"}]},"article23":{"pmid":"31064154","title":"Modifications in Vaginal Microbiota and Their Influence on Drug Release: Challenges and Opportunities.","abs":"Vaginal drug delivery represents an attractive alternative to achieve local and systemic effects due to the high contact surface exposed, the mucoadhesion of the epithelium, and the high innervation that facilitates the absorption of drugs into the bloodstream.

Identifying and elucidating the roles of genes associated with pathogenesis has aided our understanding of the molecular basis of citrus-bacteria interactions. However, the complex virulence mechanisms of X. citri subsp. citri are still not well understood. In this study, we characterized the role of PhoP in X. citri subsp. citri using a phoP deletion mutant, ΔphoP. Compared with wild-type strain XHG3, ΔphoP showed reduced motility, biofilm formation, as well as decreased production of cellulase, amylase, and polygalacturonase. In addition, the virulence of ΔphoP on citrus leaves was significantly decreased. To further understand the virulence mechanisms of X. citri subsp. citri, high-throughput RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) was used to compare the transcriptomes of the wild-type and mutant strains. Analysis revealed 1017 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs), of which 614 were up-regulated and 403 were down-regulated in ΔphoP. Gene ontology functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses suggested that the DEGs were enriched in flagellar assembly, two-component systems, histidine metabolism, bacterial chemotaxis, ABC transporters, and bacterial secretion systems. Our results showed that PhoP activates the expression of a large set of virulence genes, including 22 type III secretion system genes and 15 type III secretion system effector genes, as well as several genes involved in chemotaxis, and flagellar and histidine biosynthesis. Two-step reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis targeting 17 genes was used to validate the RNA-seq data, and confirmed that the expression of all 17 genes, except for that of virB1, decreased significantly.

A hallmark characteristic of mature biofilms is the high-level antibiotic tolerance (up to 1,000 times) compared with that of planktonic cells. Here, we report our new findings that biofilm cells are not always more tolerant to antibiotics than planktonic cells in the same culture. Specifically, Escherichia coli RP437 exhibited a dynamic change in antibiotic susceptibility during its early-stage biofilm formation. This phenomenon was not strain specific. Upon initial attachment, surface-associated cells became more sensitive to antibiotics than planktonic cells. By controlling the cell adhesion and cluster size using patterned E. coli biofilms, cells involved in the interaction between cell clusters during microcolony formation were found to be more susceptible to ampicillin than cells within clusters, suggesting a role of cell-cell interactions in biofilm-associated antibiotic tolerance. After this stage, biofilm cells became less susceptible to ampicillin and ofloxacin than planktonic cells. However, when the cells were detached by sonication, both antibiotics were more effective in killing the detached biofilm cells than the planktonic cells. Collectively, these results indicate that biofilm formation involves active cellular activities in adaption to the attached life form and interactions between cell clusters to build the complex structure of a biofilm, which can render these cells more susceptible to antibiotics. These findings shed new light on bacterial antibiotic susceptibility during biofilm formation and can guide the design of better antifouling surfaces, e.g., those with micron-scale topographic structures to interrupt cell-cell interactions.","authors":[{"name":"Huan Gu"},{"name":"Sang Won Lee"},{"name":"Joseph Carnicelli"},{"name":"Zhaowei Jiang"},{"name":"Dacheng Ren"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell-cell interaction"},{"word":"cell-surface interaction"},{"word":"patterned biofilm"}]},"article33":{"pmid":"31061167","title":"A Multiprotein Complex Anchors Adhesive Holdfast at the Outer Membrane of Caulobacter crescentus.","abs":"Adhesion allows microbes to colonize surfaces and is the first stage in biofilm formation. Stable attachment of the freshwater alphaproteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus to surfaces requires an adhesive polysaccharide called holdfast, which is synthesized at a specific cell pole and ultimately found at the tip of cylindrical extensions of the cell envelope called stalks. Secretion and anchoring of holdfast to the cell surface are governed by proteins HfsDAB and HfaABD, respectively. The arrangement and organization of these proteins with respect to each other and the cell envelope, and the mechanism by which the holdfast is anchored on cells, are unknown. In this study, we have imaged a series of C. crescentus mutants using electron cryotomography, revealing the architecture and arrangement of the molecular machinery involved in holdfast anchoring in cells. We found that the holdfast is anchored to cells by a defined complex made up of the HfaABD proteins and that the HfsDAB secretion proteins are essential for proper assembly and localization of the HfaABD anchor. Subtomogram averaging of cell stalk tips showed that the HfaABD complex spans the outer membrane. The anchor protein HfaB is the major component of the anchor complex located on the periplasmic side of the outer membrane, while HfaA and HfaD are located on the cell surface. HfaB is the critical component of the complex, without which no HfaABD complex was observed in cells.

This organism is also well-known as the main producing strain in industrial production of hyaluronic acid (HA), which is the component of its capsule polysaccharide. How its virulence and capsule polysaccharide production is regulated remains poorly understood. Intercellular chemical signaling among bacteria provides communities of microbes the opportunity to coordinate gene expression to facilitate group behavior, such as pathogenicity, capsule polysaccharide production, etc. Yet no conserved cell-to-cell signaling system has been elucidated in S. zooepidemicus. Encoded within the genome of S. zooepidemicus is one Rgg regulator encoding gene (rgg) with low similarity to both rgg2 and rgg3 from Streptococcus pyogenes. A small ORF (named as shp) encoding a novel short hydrophobic peptide (SHP) was found in the vicinity of rgg. We found that the active form of pheromone is short and hydrophobic (LLLLKLA), corresponding to the C terminal 7 amino acids of the pre-peptide Shp, which shows divergent sequence to all peptide pheromones reported in streptococci. In response to active SHP, Rgg functions as a transcriptional activator to induce the expression of shp, forming a positive feedback circuit. Bacteria social behaviors, such as capsule polysaccharide production and biofilm formation, were significantly affected when the rgg-shp pathway was inactivated. These data provide the first demonstration that Rgg/Shp signaling pathway comprises an active quorum sensing system in S. zooepidemicus.","authors":[{"name":"Zhoujie Xie"},{"name":"Kai Meng"},{"name":"Xiaoli Yang"},{"name":"Jie Liu"},{"name":"Jie Yu"},{"name":"Chunyang Zheng"},{"name":"Wei Cao"},{"name":"Hao Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus zooepidemicus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"capsule polysaccharide"},{"word":"hyaluronic acid"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article44":{"pmid":"31057940","title":"On-chip manufacturing of synthetic proteins for point-of-care therapeutics.","abs":"Therapeutic proteins have recently received increasing attention because of their clinical potential. Currently, most therapeutic proteins are produced on a large scale using various cell culture systems. However, storing and transporting these therapeutic proteins at low temperatures makes their distribution expensive and problematic, especially for applications in remote locations. To this end, an emerging solution is to use point-of-care technologies that enable immediate and accessible protein production at or near the patient's bedside. Here we present the development of Therapeutics-On-a-Chip (TOC), an integrated microfluidic platform that enables point-of-care synthesis and purification of therapeutic proteins. We used fresh and lyophilized materials for cell-free synthesis of therapeutic proteins on microfluidic chips and applied immunoprecipitation for highly efficient, on-chip protein purification. We first demonstrated this approach by expressing and purifying a reporter protein, green fluorescent protein. Next, we used TOC to produce cecropin B, an antimicrobial peptide that is widely used to control biofilm-associated diseases. We successfully synthesized and purified cecropin B at 63 ng/μl within 6 h with a 92% purity, followed by confirming its antimicrobial functionality using a growth inhibition assay.

While initial MC removal was exclusively due to abiotic processes, significantly higher biological MC removal was observed in ExpL.

Co-occurrence network analysis revealed a pronounced modularity of the biofilm communities, with a clear hierarchic distinction according to feed water origin and treatment type. Genotypes in the network modules associated with ExpS had significantly more links to each other, indicating that these biofilms had assembled from a more coherent source community.

In the present study we show that cellulose production is a complex process regulated at multiple levels and involving different players in this bacterium. Using different in vitro approaches, including Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and footprint analysis, we demonstrated the interrelated role of two transcriptional regulators, AmrZ and FleQ, over cellulose production in Pto DC3000 and the influence of c-di-GMP in this process. Under physiological c-di-GMP levels, both regulators bind directly to adjacent regions at the wss promoter inhibiting its expression. However, just FleQ responds to c-di-GMP releasing from its wss operator site and converting from a repressor to an activator of cellulose production. The additive effect of the double amrZ/fleQ mutation on the expression of wss, together with the fact that they are not cross-regulated at the transcriptional level, suggest that FleQ and AmrZ behave as independent regulators, unlike what has been described in other Pseudomonas species.

A total of 720 RTE shrimp samples comprising sauced shrimp (n = 288), boiled shrimp (n = 216), and smoked shrimp (n = 216) obtained from open markets in Delta State, Nigeria, were assessed. Standard classical methods and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used in identifying the Enterococcus species. Potential virulence factors (β-hemolysis, gelatinase activity, S-layer, and biofilm formation) were assessed using standard procedures. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the identified enterococci isolates was assayed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. PCR was further used to screen selected antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Prevalence of Enterococcus species from shrimp varieties is as follows: sauced, 26 (9.03%); boiled, 6 (2.78%); and smoked, 27 (12.50%), with an overall prevalence of 59 (8.19%) based on the occurrence of black hallow colonies after incubation.

The phenotypic expression of the enterococci virulence revealed the following: S-layer, 59 (100%); gelatinase production, 19 (32.2%); and β-hemolysis, 21 (35.6%). An average of 3-11 virulence genes were detected in the Enterococcus species. The resistance profile of Enterococcus species is as follows: erythromycin, 29 (49.2%); vancomycin, 22 (37.3%); and tetracycline, 27 (45.8%). The frequency of occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes from the phenotypic resistant enterococci isolates to the macrolide, glycopeptide, and tetracycline antibiotics is as follows: ermA, 13/29 (44.8%); vanA, 14/22 (63.6%); tetA, 14/27 (51.9%); tetM, 15/27 (55.6%); ermB, 4/29 (13.8%); and vanB, 5/22 (22.7%). Findings from this study reveal the antibiotic resistance of enterococci strains of such species as E. durans, E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, and E. hirae.

The results indicated the existence of a positive trend particularly in summer in the relative abundance of mixotrophic flagellates with elevation, however, this trend was not linear, and exceptions along the elevational gradient were found. Changes in the relative abundance of mixotrophic flagellates were related with significant changes in water transparency, DOC and phosphorus concentrations, as well as in bacterial and flagellate abundance.

Caries and periodontal diseases are the most common bacterial diseases of the oral cavity. In both cases, the dental biofilm gives rise to the disorder, which is caused by the insufficient oral hygiene. Dental caries are mainly caused by cariogenic streptococci and lactobacilli. In the case of serious periodontal diseases, anaerob parodonto-pathogen microorganisms play the major role. Untreated caries may result in the necrosis of the pulp, which can cause an inflammation expanding towards the parodontium.

Transcriptome analysis of SpeA treated S. pyogenes biofilms revealed the involvement of many transcriptional regulators (ciaRH) and response genes (luxS, shr, shp, SPy_0572), hinting towards specific mechanisms underlying the dispersal effect by SpeA. This finding opens up a discussion towards understanding a new mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pyogenes and might help in understanding the bacterial infections in a better way.","authors":[{"name":"Anshu Babbar"},{"name":"Israel Barrantes"},{"name":"Dietmar H Pieper"},{"name":"Andreas Itzek"}],"keywords":[{"word":"RNA sequencing"},{"word":"SpeA"},{"word":"Streptococcus pyogenes"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cia-RH"},{"word":"confocal microscopy"},{"word":"superantigens"}]},"article63":{"pmid":"31054133","title":"Two novel synthetic peptides inhibit quorum sensing-dependent biofilm formation and some virulence factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) regulates virulence factor expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

This study was proposed to investigate the effects of two novel synthetic peptides on the biofilm development and virulence factor production of P. aeruginosa. The tested strain was P. aeruginosa PAO1. The results indicated that both of the synthetic peptides (LIVRHK and LIVRRK) inhibited (P < 0.05) the formation of biofilms and the production of virulence factors, including pyocyanin, protease, and rhamnolipids, without inhibiting the growth of PAO1. Additionally, we detected transcriptional changes related to QS and found a significant reduction in the levels of gene expression of lasI, lasR, rhlI, and rhlR. This study demonstrates that LIVRRK and LIVRHK are novel synthetic peptides that can act as potent inhibitors of QS-regulated virulence factors in P. aeruginosa. Moreover, these synthetic peptides have potential applications in the treatment of biofilmrelated diseases.

In yeast, multiple signaling pathways control filamentous growth, a morphogenetic response that occurs in many species including fungal pathogens. Here, we examine the role of signaling pathways that control filamentous growth in regulating adhesion-dependent surface responses, including mat formation and colony patterning. Expression profiling and mutant phenotype analysis showed that the major pathways that regulate filamentous growth [filamentous growth MAPK (fMAPK), RAS, retrograde (RTG), RIM101, RPD3, ELP, SNF1, and PHO85] also regulated mat formation and colony patterning. The chromatin remodeling complex, SAGA, also regulated these responses. We also show that the RAS and RTG pathways coregulated a common set of target genes, and that SAGA regulated target genes known to be controlled by the fMAPK, RAS, and RTG pathways. Analysis of surface growth-specific targets identified genes that respond to low oxygen, high temperature, and desiccation stresses. We also explore the question of why cells make adhesive contacts in colonies. Cell adhesion contacts mediated by the coregulated target and adhesion molecule, Flo11p, deterred entry into colonies by macroscopic predators and impacted colony temperature regulation. The identification of new regulators (e.g., SAGA), and targets of surface growth in yeast may provide insights into fungal pathogenesis in settings where surface growth and adhesion contributes to virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Jacky Chow"},{"name":"Izzy Starr"},{"name":"Sheida Jamalzadeh"},{"name":"Omar Muniz"},{"name":"Anuj Kumar"},{"name":"Omer Gokcumen"},{"name":"Denise M Ferkey"},{"name":"Paul J Cullen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MAPK pathways"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"complex colony"},{"word":"expression profiling"},{"word":"fungal pathogenesis"},{"word":"invasive growth"},{"word":"mat"},{"word":"microbial predator–prey relationships"},{"word":"pseudohyphal growth"},{"word":"signaling networks"},{"word":"temperature control"}]},"article65":{"pmid":"31053580","title":"Alternative Sigma Factor RpoX Is a Part of the RpoE Regulon and Plays Distinct Roles in Stress Responses, Motility, Biofilm Formation, and Hemolytic Activities in the Marine Pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus.","abs":"Vibrio alginolyticus is one of the most abundant microorganisms in marine environments and is also an opportunistic pathogen mediating high-mortality vibriosis in marine animals.

Hindered drug diffusion is caused on the one hand by interactions with the sticky biofilm matrix and on the other hand by the fact that bacterial cells are organized in densely packed clusters of cells. Binding interactions with the biofilm matrix can be avoided by encapsulating the antibiotics into nanocarriers, while interfering with the integrity of the dense cell clusters can enhance drug transport deep into the biofilm. Vapor nanobubbles (VNB), generated from laser irradiated nanoparticles, are a recently reported effective way to loosen up the biofilm structure in order to enhance drug transport and efficacy. In the present study, we explored if the disruptive force of VNB can be used simultaneously to interfere with the biofilm structure and trigger antibiotic release from light-responsive nanocarriers. The antibiotic tobramycin was incorporated in two types of light-responsive nanocarriers-liposomes functionalized with gold nanoparticles (Lip-AuNP) and graphene quantum dots (GQD)-and their efficacy was evaluated on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Even though the anti-biofilm efficacy of tobramycin was improved by liposomal encapsulation, electrostatic functionalization with 70 nm AuNP unfortunately resulted in premature leakage of tobramycin in a matter of hours. Laser-irradiation consequently did not further improve P. aeruginosa biofilm eradication. Adsorption of tobramycin to GQD, on the other hand, did result in a stable formulation with high encapsulation efficiency, without burst release of tobramycin from the nanocarriers. However, even though laser-induced VNB formation from GQD resulted in biofilm disruption, an enhanced anti-biofilm effect was not achieved due to tobramycin not being efficiently released from GQD. Even though this study was unsuccessful in designing suitable nanocarriers for simultaneous biofilm disruption and light-triggered release of tobramycin, it provides insights into the difficulties and challenges that need to be considered for future developments in this regard.","authors":[{"name":"Eline Teirlinck"},{"name":"Alexandre Barras"},{"name":"Jing Liu"},{"name":"Juan C Fraire"},{"name":"Tatu Lajunen"},{"name":"Ranhua Xiong"},{"name":"Katrien Forier"},{"name":"Chengnan Li"},{"name":"Arto Urtti"},{"name":"Rabah Boukherroub"},{"name":"Sabine Szunerits"},{"name":"Stefaan C De Smedt"},{"name":"Tom Coenye"},{"name":"Kevin Braeckmans"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"diffusion barrier"},{"word":"gold nanoparticles"},{"word":"graphene quantum dots"},{"word":"laser treatment"},{"word":"liposomes"},{"word":"triggered release"},{"word":"vapor nanobubbles"}]},"article68":{"pmid":"31052335","title":"Recent Advances in Non-Conventional Antimicrobial Approaches for Chronic Wound Biofilms: Have We Found the 'Chink in the Armor'?","abs":"Chronic wounds are a major healthcare burden, with huge public health and economic impact. Microbial infections are the single most important cause of chronic, non-healing wounds. Chronic wound infections typically form biofilms, which are notoriously recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics. This prompts the need for alternative or adjunct 'anti-biofilm' approaches, notably those that account for the unique chronic wound biofilm microenvironment. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in non-conventional antimicrobial approaches for chronic wound biofilms, looking beyond standard antibiotic therapies. These non-conventional strategies are discussed under three groups. The first group focuses on treatment approaches that directly kill or inhibit microbes in chronic wound biofilms, using mechanisms or delivery strategies distinct from antibiotics. The second group discusses antimicrobial approaches that modify the biological, chemical or biophysical parameters in the chronic wound microenvironment, which in turn enables the disruption and removal of biofilms. Finally, therapeutic approaches that affect both, biofilm bacteria and microenvironment factors, are discussed. Understanding the advantages and limitations of these recent approaches, their stage of development and role in biofilm management, could lead to new treatment paradigms for chronic wound infections. Towards this end, we discuss the possibility that non-conventional antimicrobial therapeutics and targets could expose the 'chink in the armor' of chronic wound biofilms, thereby providing much-needed alternative or adjunct strategies for wound infection management.","authors":[{"name":"Snehal Kadam"},{"name":"Saptarsi Shai"},{"name":"Aditi Shahane"},{"name":"Karishma S Kaushik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobials"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronic wounds"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"pH"},{"word":"phages"},{"word":"probiotics"}]},"article69":{"pmid":"31052271","title":"Current Status of In Vitro Models and Assays for Susceptibility Testing for Wound Biofilm Infections.","abs":"Biofilm infections have gained recognition as an important therapeutic challenge in the last several decades due to their relationship with the chronicity of infectious diseases.

Because PYO is both redox-active and Raman-active, we seek to simultaneously acquire both spectroscopic and redox state information about PYO. The combination of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and voltammetry is used here to provide insights into the molecular redox behavior of PYO while controlling the SERS and electrochemical (EC) response of PYO with external stimuli, such as pH and applied potential. Furthermore, PYO secretion from biofilms of different P. aeruginosa strains is compared. Both SERS spectra and EC behavior are observed to change with pH, and several pH-dependent bands are identified in the SERS spectra, which can potentially be used to probe the local environment. Comparison of the voltammetric behavior of wild-type and a PYO-deficient mutant unequivocally identifies PYO as a major component of the secretome. Spectroelectrochemical studies of the PYO standard reveal decreasing SERS intensities of PYO bands under reducing conditions. Extending these experiments to pellicle biofilms shows similar behavior with applied potential, and SERS imaging indicates that secreted PYO is localized in regions approximately the size of P. aeruginosa cells.

In a laboratory study, we investigated the single and combined effects of phosphorus (P) availability and silver, a re-emerging contaminant, on the elemental [carbon (C):nitrogen (N):P ratios] and biochemical (fatty acid profiles) compositions of a diatom-dominated biofilm initially collected in a shallow lake.

The quality of biofilms for consumers was assessed for a common crustacean species, Gammarus fossarum, by measuring organisms' survival and growth rates during a 42-days feeding experiment. Results mainly showed that species replacement induced by both stressors affected biofilm fatty acid compositions, and that P immobilization permitted to achieve low C:P biofilms, whatever the level of silver contamination. Gammarids growth and survival rates were not significantly impacted by the ingestion of silver-contaminated resource.

Cell adhesion and biofilm formation involve a family of cell surface Als (agglutinin-like sequence) proteins. It is now well documented that amyloid-like clusters of laterally arranged Als proteins activate cell-cell adhesion under mechanical stress, but whether amyloid-like bonds form between aggregating cells is not known. To address this issue, we measure the forces driving Als5-mediated intercellular adhesion using an innovative fluidic force microscopy platform. Strong cell-cell adhesion is dependent on expression of amyloid-forming Als5 at high cell surface density and is inhibited by a short antiamyloid peptide. Furthermore, there is greatly attenuated binding between cells expressing amyloid-forming Als5 and cells with a nonamyloid form of Als5. Thus, homophilic bonding between Als5 proteins on adhering cells is the major mode of fungal aggregation, rather than protein-ligand interactions. These results point to a model whereby amyloid-like β-sheet interactions play a dual role in cell-cell adhesion, that is, in formation of adhesin nanoclusters ( cis-interactions) and in homophilic bonding between amyloid sequences on opposing cells ( trans-interactions). Because potential amyloid-forming sequences are found in many microbial adhesins, we speculate that this novel mechanism of amyloid-based homophilic adhesion might be widespread and could represent an interesting target for treating biofilm-associated infections.","authors":[{"name":"Jérôme Dehullu"},{"name":"Claire Valotteau"},{"name":"Philippe Herman-Bausier"},{"name":"Melissa Garcia-Sherman"},{"name":"Maximilian Mittelviefhaus"},{"name":"Julia A Vorholt"},{"name":"Peter N Lipke"},{"name":"Yves F Dufrêne"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"fluidic force microscopy"},{"word":"functional amyloids"},{"word":"homophilic adhesion"},{"word":"nanoscale forces"}]},"article111":{"pmid":"31038919","title":"Thinking Outside the Treatment Plant: UV for Water Distribution System Disinfection.","abs":"This work critically evaluates the current paradigm of water distribution system management and juxtaposes that with the potential benefits of employing UV irradiation, which we hope will catalyze a judicial re-evaluation of the current practices in water distribution system management and spur critical research and a new way of thinking about secondary disinfection across the extent of distribution systems. Given the recent advances in UV technology and the efficacy of UV disinfection against all pathogen classes, we now see UV applications for disinfection in many aspects of consumers lives: in water coolers, dishwashers, coffee makers, and disinfection of personal items like gym bags, water bottles, and toothbrushes. Public and regulatory concern over water quality and pathogens, especially the recent interest in building plumbing, calls out for new approaches to disinfection and distribution system management. We envision a new model for secondary disinfection in water distribution systems utilizing emerging germicidal UV LED-based disinfection. UV irradiation in water treatment can achieve high levels of disinfection of all pathogens and minimize or eliminate the formation of regulated disinfection byproducts. So why is UV not considered as a secondary disinfectant for distribution systems? In this Account, we lay out the logic as to the benefits and practicality of adding distributed UV treatment to assist in protection of distribution systems and protect water quality for human exposure. The possible locations of UV irradiation in distribution systems are envisioned, potentially including UV booster stations along the distribution network, UV in storage tanks or their inlet/outlets, LEDs distributed along pipe walls, small point of use/entry treatment systems for buildings/homes/taps, or submersible swimming or rolling UV LED drones to reach problem pipes and provide a shock treatment or provide sterilization after main breaks or repairs. The benefits of UV applications in water also include high effectiveness against chlorine-resistant protozoa, no added disinfection byproducts, and compatibility of adding of UV to existing secondary disinfection strategies for enhanced protection. Potential challenges and research needs are described, such as use of UV-compatible pipe materials, implementation of sensors to monitor distributed LEDs, management of waste heat from the rear surface of the LED, and understanding the potential for regrowth of opportunistic microorganisms. Another notable challenge is the relatively stagnant regulatory environment in some countries to develop frameworks for evaluation and acceptance of UV technology in distribution systems that require a chemical secondary disinfectant. Rapid advances in UV LED research has propelled the growth of this field, but needs still remain, including understanding behavior of biofilms in pipes under UV irradiation, including any beneficial effects that may be lost, the potential for fouling of LED emission surfaces and monitoring points, and provision of a distributed power network to run the LEDs. Regulators may want specific monitoring approaches and advances in real-time monitoring of microbial viability, and engineers may need to develop new approaches to overall management.","authors":[{"name":"Karl G Linden"},{"name":"Natalie Hull"},{"name":"Vanessa Speight"}],"keywords":[]},"article112":{"pmid":"31038914","title":"Visible-Light-Induced Photocatalytic and Antibacterial Activity of TiO","abs":"Biofilm-associated diseases are one of the main causes of implant failure.

Using fluorescent microscopy, we studied in-situ the colonization of L. pneumophila in the presence of two water-related FLA species, Willaertia magna and Acanthamoeba polyphaga in drinking water biofilms. During water flow as well as after periods of long-stagnation, the attachment and colonization of L. pneumophila to predeveloped water-biofilm was limited. Furthermore, W. magna and A. polyphaga showed no immediate interactions with L. pneumophila when introduced to the same natural biofilm environment. A. polyphaga encysted within 5-7 d after introduction to the tap-water biofilms and mostly persisted in cysts till the end of the study period (850 d). W. magna trophozoites, however, exhibited a time delay in feeding on Legionella and were observed with internalized L. pneumophila cells after 3 weeks from their introduction to the end of the study period and supported putative (yet limited) intracellular growth.

The overall results suggest that L. pneumophila maintains an ecological balance with FLA within the biofilm environment, and higher temperature improve the viability of L. pneumophila cells, and intracellular growth of Legionella is possibly cell-concentration dependent. Observing the preferential feeding behavior, we hypothesize that an initial increase of FLA numbers through feeding on a range of other available bacteria could lead to an enrichment of L. pneumophila, and later force predation of Legionella by the amoeba trophozoites results in rapid intracellular replication, leading to problematic concentration of L. pneumophila in water.

This may help explaining a significant discrepancy between antibiotic efficacy in vitro and in vivo, with some antibiotics being effective in vitro but not in vivo or vice versa. Nevertheless, it is well-known that antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria is driven by environmental factors. Lung epithelial cells enhance the activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yet the mechanism behind is unknown. The present study addresses this gap and provides mechanistic understanding on how lung epithelial cells stimulate aminoglycoside activity. To investigate the influence of the local host microenvironment on antibiotic activity, an in vivo-like three-dimensional (3-D) lung epithelial cell model was used. We report that conditioned medium of 3-D lung cells, containing secreted but not cellular components, potentiated the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides against P. aeruginosa, including resistant clinical isolates, and several other pathogens. In contrast, conditioned medium obtained from the same cell type, but grown as conventional (2-D) monolayers did not influence antibiotic efficacy. We found that 3-D lung cells secreted endogenous metabolites (including succinate and glutamate) that enhanced aminoglycoside activity, and provide evidence that bacterial pyruvate metabolism is linked to the observed potentiation of antimicrobial activity. Biochemical and phenotypic assays indicated that 3-D cell conditioned medium stimulated the proton motive force (PMF), resulting in increased bacterial intracellular pH. The latter stimulated antibiotic uptake, as determined using fluorescently labelled tobramycin in combination with flow cytometry analysis. Our findings reveal a cross-talk between host and bacterial metabolic pathways, that influence downstream activity of antibiotics.

In humans, eukaryotic ALP is one of the most frequently used enzymatic signals in diagnosing various diseases, such as cholestasis and rickets. In S. aureus, ALP is detected exclusively on the cell membrane; it is also expressed as a secretory form as well. Yet, little is known about its function in biofilm formation. The purpose of this manuscript is to develop a quick and reliable assay to measure ALP activity in S. aureus biofilm that does not require protein isolation. Using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a substrate, we measured ALP activity in S. aureus biofilm formed in 96-well tissue culture plates. Activity was based on the formation of the soluble reaction product measured by 405 nm absorbance. The high throughput nature of the 96 well tissue culture plate method provides a sensitive and reproducible method for ALP activity assays.

One of the promising strategies to treat infection diseases is the use of nanomaterials. Among them, mesoporous silica materials (MSMs) have attracted burgeoning attention due to high surface area, tunable pore/particle size, and easy surface functionalization. This review discusses how one can exploit capacities of MSMs to design and fabricate multifunctional/controllable drug delivery systems (DDSs) to combat bacterial infections. At first, the emergency of bacterial and biofilm resistance toward conventional antimicrobials is described and then how nanoparticles exert their toxic effects upon pathogenic cells is discussed. Next, the main aspects of MSMs (e.g., physicochemical properties, multifunctionality, and biosafety) which one should consider in the design of MSM-based DDSs against bacterial infections are introduced. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of all the papers published dealing with the use of MSMs for delivery of antibacterial chemicals (antimicrobial agents functionalized/adsorbed on mesoporous silica (MS), MS-loaded with antimicrobial agents, gated MS-loaded with antimicrobial agents, MS with metal-based nanoparticles, and MS-loaded with metal ions) is provided.","authors":[{"name":"Andrea Bernardos"},{"name":"Elena Piacenza"},{"name":"Félix Sancenón"},{"name":"Mehrdad Hamidi"},{"name":"Aziz Maleki"},{"name":"Raymond J Turner"},{"name":"Ramón Martínez-Máñez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"controllable drug delivery systems"},{"word":"mesoporous silica materials"},{"word":"nanoparticles"}]},"article140":{"pmid":"31033028","title":"Removal of simulated biofilm at different implant crown designs with interproximal oral hygiene aids: An in vitro study.","abs":"To compare the removal of simulated biofilm at two different implant-supported restoration designs with various interproximal oral hygiene aids.","authors":[{"name":"Taskin Tuna"},{"name":"Lena Kuhlmann"},{"name":"Shaza Bishti"},{"name":"Ekaterina Sirazitdinova"},{"name":"Thomas Deserno"},{"name":"Stefan Wolfart"}],"keywords":[{"word":"health behavior"},{"word":"prosthodontics"},{"word":"soft tissue-implant interactions"}]},"article141":{"pmid":"31032943","title":"Antibiofilm effect of green engineered silver nanoparticles fabricated from Artemisia scoporia extract on the expression of icaA and icaR genes against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are at the forefront of the swiftly developing scope of nanotechnology.

One major resource for discovery of antimicrobials is the arsenal of innate immunity molecules that are part of the first line of pathogen defense in many organisms. Gene encoded cationic antimicrobial peptides are a major constituent of innate immune arsenals. Many of these peptides exhibit potent antimicrobial activity in vitro. However, a major hurdle that has impeded their development for use in the clinic is the loss of activity at physiological salt concentrations, attributed to weakening of the electrostatic interactions between the cationic peptide and anionic surfaces of the microbial cells in the presence of salt. Using plant defensins we have investigated the relationship between the charge of an antimicrobial peptide and its activity in media with elevated salt concentrations. Plant defensins are a large class of antifungal peptides that have remarkable stability at extremes of pH and temperature as well as resistance to protease digestion. A search of a database of over 1200 plant defensins identified ZmD32, a defensin from Zea mays, with a predicted charge of +10.1 at pH 7, the highest of any defensin in the database. Recombinant ZmD32 retained activity against a range of fungal species in media containing elevated concentrations of salt. In addition, ZmD32 was active against Candida albicans biofilms as well as both Gram negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, combined with a low toxicity on human cells make ZmD32 an attractive lead for development of future antimicrobial molecules.","authors":[{"name":"Bomai K Kerenga"},{"name":"James A McKenna"},{"name":"Peta J Harvey"},{"name":"Pedro Quimbar"},{"name":"Donovan Garcia-Ceron"},{"name":"Fung T Lay"},{"name":"Thanh Kha Phan"},{"name":"Prem K Veneer"},{"name":"Shaily Vasa"},{"name":"Kathy Parisi"},{"name":"Thomas M A Shafee"},{"name":"Nicole L van der Weerden"},{"name":"Mark D Hulett"},{"name":"David J Craik"},{"name":"Marilyn A Anderson"},{"name":"Mark R Bleackley"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"plant defensin"},{"word":"salt tolerance"}]},"article145":{"pmid":"31031731","title":"The Carbon Switch at the Level of Pyruvate and Phosphoenolpyruvate in Sulfolobus solfataricus P2.","abs":"Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 grows on different carbohydrates as well as alcohols, peptides and amino acids.

However, several strains of E. coli have acquired virulent genes and could cause enteric diseases, urinary tract and even brain infections. Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is an enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) which can result in bloody diarrhoea and could potentially lead to deadly heamolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). STEC is one of the important food borne pathogens that causes food poisoning leading to diarrhoea and number of STEC outbreaks have occurred across the world. The use of standard antibiotics to treat STEC infection is not recommended as it increases the production of shiga toxin which could lead to HUS. Therefore, use of alternative approaches which include use of plant products to treat STEC infections have been gaining attention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum) against STEC strains isolated from various patient and food samples using in vitro assays. The microbiological isolation of STEC from various patient and food samples resulted in eight STEC isolates of which seven strains were multidrug resistant. Antibacterial assay results indicated that all the strains exhibited dose dependent sensitivity towards garlic with zone of inhibition diameters ranging from 7 to 24 mm with 15 µl of fresh garlic extract (FGE). Minimum inhibitory  concentration (MIC) of FGE for isolates ranged from 30 to 140 µl/ml. Interestingly, the biofilm formation of all isolates in presence of 4% of FGE decreased by 35 to 59%. FTIR analysis indicated that treatment with 1% FGE results in compositional and content changes in the biofilm.

These treponemes can cause various diseases in humans and other animals, such as periodontal disease, bovine digital dermatitis and animal skin lesions. However, the most important and well-studied disease of treponemes that affects humans is 'syphilis'. This disease is caused by Treponema pallidum subspecie pallidum with 11-12 million new cases around the globe on an annual basis. In this study we analyze the transportome of ten Treponema species, with emphasis on the types of encoded transport proteins and their substrates. Of the ten species examined, two (T. primitia and T. azonutricium) reside as symbionts in the guts of termites; six (T. pallidum, T. paraluiscuniculi, T. pedis, T. denticola, T. putidum and T. brennaborense) are pathogens of either humans or animals, and T. caldarium and T. succinifaciens are avirulent species, the former being thermophilic. All ten species have a repertoire of transport proteins that assists them in residing in their respective ecological niches. For instance, oral pathogens use transport proteins that take up nutrients uniquely present in their ecosystem; they also encode multiple multidrug/macromolecule exporters that protect against antimicrobials and aid in biofilm formation. Proteins of termite gut symbionts convert cellulose into other sugars that can be metabolized by the host. As often observed for pathogens and symbionts, several of these treponemes have reduced genome sizes, and their small genomes correlate with their dependencies on the host. Overall, the transportomes of T. pallidum and other pathogens have a conglomerate of parasitic lifestyle-assisting proteins. For example, a T. pallidum repeat protein (TprK) mediates immune evasion; outer membrane proteins (OMPs) allow nutrient uptake and end product export, and several ABC transporters catalyze sugar uptake, considered pivotal to parasitic lifestyles. Taken together, the results of this study yield new information that may help open new avenues of treponeme research.","authors":[{"name":"Bora Buyuktimkin"},{"name":"Hassan Zafar"},{"name":"Milton H Saier"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Diverse lifestyles"},{"word":"Free living"},{"word":"Pathogens"},{"word":"Symbionts"},{"word":"Transport proteins"},{"word":"Treponema"}]},"article150":{"pmid":"31029705","title":"Coordinated Cell Death in Isogenic Bacterial Populations: Sacrificing Some for the Benefit of Many?","abs":"Antibiotics are classically perceived as biological weapons that bacteria produce to hold their ground against competing species in their natural habitat. But in the context of multicellular differentiation processes, antimicrobial compounds sometimes also play a role in intraspecies competition, resulting in the death of a sub-population of genetically identical siblings for the benefit of the population. Such a strategy is based on the diversification and hence phenotypic heterogeneity of an isogenic bacterial population. This review article will address three such phenomena. In Bacillus subtilis, cannibalism is a differentiation strategy that enhances biofilm formation, prolongs or potentially even prevents full commitment to endospore formation under starvation conditions, and protects cells within the biofilm against competing species. The nutrients released by lysed cells can be used by the toxin producers, thereby delaying the full activation of the master regulator of sporulation. A related strategy is associated with the initiation of competence development under nutrient excess in Streptococcus pneumoniae. This process, termed fratricide, causes allolysis in a sub-population and is thought to enhance genetic diversity within the species. In Myxococcus xanthus, a large fraction of the population undergoes programmed cell death during the formation of fruiting bodies. This sacrifice ensures the survival of the sporulating sub-population by providing nutrients and hence energy to complete this differentiation process. The biological relevance and underlying regulatory mechanisms of these three processes will be discussed in order to extract common features of such strategies. Moreover, open questions and future challenges will be addressed.","authors":[{"name":"Philipp F Popp"},{"name":"Thorsten Mascher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"autolysis"},{"word":"cannibalism"},{"word":"fratricide"},{"word":"phenotypic heterogeneity"},{"word":"programmed cell death"}]},"article153":{"pmid":"31029348","title":"Green fabrication of anti-bacterial biofilm layer on endotracheal tubing using silver nanoparticles embedded in polyelectrolyte multilayered film.","abs":"Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) are a common source of bacterial colonization, leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

For that purpose, 3D printing was used to prepare PLA scaffolds that were further multifunctionalized with collagen (Col), minocycline (MH) and bioinspired citrate- hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (cHA). PLA-Col-MH-cHA scaffolds provide a closer structural support approximation to native bone architecture with uniform macroporous, adequate wettability and an excellent compressive strength. The addition of MH resulted in an adequate antibiotic release profile that by being compatible with local drug delivery therapy was translated into antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, a main pathogen associated to bone-related infections. Subsequently, the hMSCs response to these scaffolds revealed that the incorporation of cHA significantly stimulated the adhesion, proliferation and osteogenesis-related gene expression (RUNX2, OCN and OPN) of hMSCs. Furthermore, the association of a bioinspired material (cHA) with the antibiotic MH resulted in a combined effect of an enhanced osteogenic activity.

The model predicts the community composition well in both a low-complexity community as acid mine drainage (AMD) microbiota, and a complex community as human gut microbiota. Furthermore, we define community structure shaping (CSS) genes as functional genes crucial for shaping the microbial community. We have identified CSS genes in AMD and human gut microbiota samples with FCP model and find that CSS genes change with the conditions. Compared to essential genes for microbes, CSS genes are significantly enriched in the genes involved in mobile genetic elements, cell motility, and defense mechanisms, indicating that the functions of CSS genes are focused on communication and strategies in response to the environment factors. We further find that it is the minority, rather than the majority, which contributes to maintaining community structure. Compared to health control samples, we find that some functional genes associated with metabolism of amino acids, nucleotides, and lipopolysaccharide are more likely to be CSS genes in the disease group. CSS genes may help us to understand critical cellular processes and be useful in seeking addable gene circuitries to maintain artificial self-sustainable communities. Our study suggests that functional genes are important to the assembly of microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Jiang"},{"name":"Xin Li"},{"name":"Longshu Yang"},{"name":"Chunhong Liu"},{"name":"Qi Wang"},{"name":"Weilai Chi"},{"name":"Huaiqiu Zhu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acid mine drainage"},{"word":"Community structure"},{"word":"Dynamics model"},{"word":"Human gut microbiota"},{"word":"Metagenomics"}]},"article179":{"pmid":"31026553","title":"Lonicerin, an anti-algE flavonoid against Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence screened from Shuanghuanglian formula by molecule docking based strategy.","abs":"The Shuanghuanglian formula (SF) is a famous antimicrobial and antiviral traditional Chinese medicine that is made of Lonicera japonica Thunb., Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, and Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.)

In this study, nine novel fungal DLPs were firstly identified by querying against UniProt databases and expressed in Pichia pastoris, and their antibacterial and anti-biofilm ability were tested against multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus. Results showed that among them, P2, the highest activity and expression level, showed low toxicity, no resistance, and high stability. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of P2 against Gram-positive bacteria were < 2 μg/mL. P2 exhibited the potent activity against intracellular MDR S. aureus (bacterial reduction in 80-97%) in RAW264.7 macrophages. P2 bound to/disrupted bacterial DNA, wrinkled outer membranes and permeabilized cytoplasmic membranes, but maintained the integrity of bacterial cells. P2 inhibited/eradicated the biofilm and killed 99% persister bacteria, which were resistant to 100× MIC vancomycin. P2 upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α/IL-1β) and chemokine (MCP-1) levels in RAW 264.7 macrophages and in mice, respectively. Five milligram per kilogram P2 enhanced the survival of S. aureus-infected mice (100%), superior to vancomycin (30 mg/kg), inhibited the bacterial translocation, and alleviated multiple-organ injuries (liver, spleen, kidney, and lung).

One of the main sources of contamination comes from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents that contain wide range of micro- and macropollutants. Chemical composition, toxicity levels and impact of treated effluents (TEs) on the recipient aquatic ecosystems may strongly differ depending on the wastewater origin. Compared to urban TEs, hospital ones may contain more active pharmaceutical substances. Benthic diatoms are relevant ecological indicators because of their high species and ecological diversity and rapid response to human pressure. They are routinely used for water quality monitoring. However, there is a knowledge gap on diatom communities' development and behavior in treated wastewater in relation to prevailing micro- and macropollutants. In this study, we aim to (1) investigate the response of diatom communities to urban and hospital TEs, and (2) evaluate TEs effect on communities in the recipient river. Environmental biofilms were colonized in TEs and the recipient river up- and downstream from the WWTP output to study benthic diatoms using DNA metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS). In parallel, concentrations of nutrients, pharmaceuticals and seasonal conditions were recorded. Diatom metabarcoding showed that benthic communities differed strongly in their diversity and structure depending on the habitat. TE sites were generally dominated by few genera with polysaprobic preferences belonging to the motile guild, while river sites favored diverse communities from oligotrophic and oligosaprobic groups. Seasonal changes were visible to lower extent. To categorize parameters important for diatom changes we performed redundancy analysis which suggested that communities within TE sites were associated to higher concentrations of beta-blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in urban effluents vs. antibiotics and orthophosphate in hospital effluents. Furthermore, indicator species analysis showed that 27% of OTUs detected in river downstream communities were indicator for urban or hospital TE sites and were absent in the river upstream. Finally, biological diatom index (BDI) calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the recipient river suggested water quality decrease linked to the release of TEs. Thus, in-depth assessment of diatom community composition using DNA metabarcoding is proposed as a promising technique to highlight the disturbing effect of pollutants in Alpine rivers.","authors":[{"name":"Teofana Chonova"},{"name":"Rainer Kurmayer"},{"name":"Frédéric Rimet"},{"name":"Jérôme Labanowski"},{"name":"Valentin Vasselon"},{"name":"François Keck"},{"name":"Paul Illmer"},{"name":"Agnès Bouchez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNA metabarcoding"},{"word":"WWTP effluents"},{"word":"diatom communities"},{"word":"functional traits"},{"word":"indicator species analysis"},{"word":"pharmaceuticals"},{"word":"water quality index"}]},"article190":{"pmid":"31024468","title":"Polymorphisms of a Collagen-Like Adhesin Contributes to Legionella pneumophila Adhesion, Biofilm Formation Capacity and Clinical Prevalence.","abs":"Legionellosis is a severe respiratory illness caused by the inhalation of aerosolized water droplets contaminated with the opportunistic pathogen Legionella pneumophila. The ability of L. pneumophila to produce biofilms has been associated with its capacity to colonize and persist in human-made water reservoirs and distribution systems, which are the source of legionellosis outbreaks. Nevertheless, the factors that mediate L. pneumophila biofilm formation are largely unknown. In previous studies we reported that the adhesin Legionella collagen-like protein (Lcl), is required for auto-aggregation, attachment to multiple surfaces and the formation of biofilms. Lcl structure contains three distinguishable regions: An N-terminal region with a predicted signal sequence, a central region containing tandem collagen-like repeats (R-domain) and a C-terminal region (C-domain) with no significant homology to other known proteins. Lcl R-domain encodes tandem repeats of the collagenous tripeptide Gly-Xaa-Yaa (GXY), a motif that is key for the molecular organization of mammalian collagen and mediates the binding of collagenous proteins to different cellular and environmental ligands. Interestingly, Lcl is polymorphic in the number of GXY tandem repeats. In this study, we combined diverse biochemical, genetic, and cellular approaches to determine the role of Lcl domains and GXY repeats polymorphisms on the structural and functional properties of Lcl, as well as on bacterial attachment, aggregation and biofilm formation. Our results indicate that the R-domain is key for assembling Lcl collagenous triple-helices and has a more preponderate role over the C-domain in Lcl adhesin binding properties. We show that Lcl molecules oligomerize to form large supramolecular complexes to which both, R and C-domains are required. Furthermore, we found that the number of GXY tandem repeats encoded in Lcl R-domain correlates positively with the binding capabilities of Lcl and with the attachment and biofilm production capacity of L. pneumophila strains. Accordingly, the number of GXY tandem repeats in Lcl influences the clinical prevalence of L. pneumophila strains. Therefore, the number of Lcl tandem repeats could be considered as a potential predictor for virulence in L. pneumophila isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Mena Abdel-Nour"},{"name":"Han Su"},{"name":"Carla Duncan"},{"name":"Shaopei Li"},{"name":"Deepa Raju"},{"name":"Feras Shamoun"},{"name":"Marine Valton"},{"name":"Christophe Ginevra"},{"name":"Sophie Jarraud"},{"name":"Cyril Guyard"},{"name":"Kagan Kerman"},{"name":"Mauricio R Terebiznik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Legionella pneumophila"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell–cell adhesion"},{"word":"clinical prevalence"},{"word":"collagen-like adhesion"}]},"article191":{"pmid":"31023592","title":"Activity of base analogues (5-fluorouracil, 5-flucytosine) against planktonic cells and mature biofilm of Candida yeast.

CyanoCoating was prepared by spin-coating and its bacterial anti-adhesive efficiency was evaluated against relevant etiological agents (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and platelets, both in the presence or absence of human plasma proteins. CyanoCoating cytotoxicity was assessed using the L929 fibroblasts cell line. CyanoCoating exhibited a smooth topography, low thickness and high hydrophilic properties with mild negative charge. The non-cytotoxic CyanoCoating prevented adhesion of all the bacteria tested (≤80%) and platelets (<87%), without inducing platelet activation (even in the presence of plasma proteins). The significant reduction in protein adsorption (<77%) confirmed its anti-adhesive properties.

Analysis of the pP32BP2 nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of three predicted phenotypic modules that comprise nearly 30% of the plasmid genome. These modules appear to be involved in fimbriae synthesis via the chaperone-usher pathway (FIM module) and the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of carnitine (CAR and CAI modules, respectively). The FIM module was found to be functional in diverse hosts since it facilitated the attachment of bacterial cells to abiotic surfaces, enhancing biofilm formation. The CAI module did not show measurable activity in any of the tested strains. Interestingly, the CAR module enabled the enzymatic breakdown of carnitine, but this led to the formation of the toxic by-product trimethylamine, which inhibited bacterial growth. Thus, on the one hand, pP32BP2 can enhance biofilm formation, a highly advantageous feature in cold environments, while on the other, it may prevent bacterial growth under certain environmental conditions. The detrimental effect of harboring pP32BP2 (and its CAR module) seems to be conditional, since this replicon may also confer the ability to use carnitine as an alternative carbon source, although a pathway to utilize trimethylamine is most probably necessary to make this beneficial. Therefore, the phenotype determined by this CAR-containing plasmid depends on the metabolic background of the host strain.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Ciok"},{"name":"Adrian Cegielski"},{"name":"Dariusz Bartosik"},{"name":"Lukasz Dziewit"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Arctic"},{"word":"Psychrobacter"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"carnitine metabolism"},{"word":"plasmid"},{"word":"psychrophile"},{"word":"trimethylamine"}]},"article194":{"pmid":"31022884","title":"Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm N-acetyl-L-cysteine Grafted Siloxane Polymers with Potential for Use in Water Systems.","abs":"Antibiofilm strategies may be based on the prevention of initial bacterial adhesion, the inhibition of biofilm maturation or biofilm eradication.

These infections often occur with the use of indwelling medical devices, such as endotracheal tubes (ETTs), that can result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). When examining the various routes of infection, VAP is associated with the highest incidence, rate of morbidity, and economic burden. Although ETTs are essential for the survival of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, their use comes with complications. The presence of an ETT in the airway impairs physiological host defense mechanisms for clearance of pathogens and provides a platform for oropharynx microorganism transport to the sterile tracheobronchial network. Antibiotics are administered to treat lower respiratory infections; however, they are not always effective and consequently can result in increased antibiotic resistance. Prophylactic approaches by altering the surface of ETTs to prevent the establishment and growth of bacteria have exhibited promising results. In addition, passive surface modifications that prevent bacterial establishment and growth, or active coatings that possess a bactericidal effect have also proven effective. In this review we aim to highlight the importance of preventing biofilm establishment on indwelling medical devices, focusing on ETTs. We will investigate successful antimicrobial modifications to ETTs and the future avenues that will ultimately decrease HAIs and improve patient care. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Infections that occur with indwelling medicals devices remain a constant concern in the medical field and can result in hospital-acquired infections. Specifically, ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs with the use of an endotracheal tube (ETT). Infections often require use of antibiotics and can result in patient mortality. Our review includes a summary of the recent collective work of antimicrobial ETT modifications and potential avenues for further investigations in an effort to reduce VAP associated with ETTs. Polymer modifications with antibacterial nature have been developed and tested; however, a focus on ETTs is lacking and clinical availability of new antimicrobial ETT devices is limited. Our collective work shows the successful and prospective applications to the surfaces of ETTs that can support researchers and physicians to create safer medical devices.","authors":[{"name":"Megan Barnes"},{"name":"Corbin Feit"},{"name":"Trudy-Ann Grant"},{"name":"Elizabeth J Brisbois"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial polymers"},{"word":"Endotracheal tube (ETT)"},{"word":"Hospital acquired infections (HAIs)"},{"word":"Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP)"}]},"article198":{"pmid":"31022421","title":"Underperforming light curing procedures trigger detrimental irradiance-dependent biofilm response on incrementally placed dental composites.","abs":"Insufficient radiant exposure (J/cm","authors":[{"name":"Haifa Maktabi"},{"name":"Maria Ibrahim"},{"name":"Qoot Alkhubaizi"},{"name":"Michael Weir"},{"name":"Hockin Xu"},{"name":"Howard Strassler"},{"name":"Ana Paula P Fugolin"},{"name":"Carmem S Pfeifer"},{"name":"Mary Anne S Melo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Light curing"},{"word":"Oral biofilm"},{"word":"Resin composite"},{"word":"S. mutans"},{"word":"The degree of conversion"}]},"article199":{"pmid":"31022418","title":"Electrochemical detection of food-spoiling bacteria using interdigitated platinum microelectrodes.","abs":"The fast and non-destructive detection of bacterial attachment on food contact surfaces is important for the prevention of the unwanted formation of biofilms.

Conventional strategies in controlling the contaminations are significantly limited either by biofouling or by the irreversible consumption of antimicrobial agents. Herein, we report a robust methodology to create rechargeable biocidal poly(vinyl alcohol- co-ethylene) films (SBMA@HAF films) with antifouling function via chemically incorporating both N-halamine (HAF) and zwitterionic moieties [[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide (SBMA)]. The promise of the design exhibits three features to defeat bacterial contaminations: (i) zwitterionic moieties can effectively reduce bacterial attachment onto the films, (ii) N-halamine with robust rechargeable biocidal activity can rapidly kill any attached bacteria, and (iii) any inactivated bacterial debris can be easily released to avoid biofilm formation due to the superhydrophilicity of the zwitterions. The resulting SBMA@HAF films exhibit integrated properties of high transparency, robust mechanical property, great hydrophilicity, ease of chlorine recharging (>250 ppm), long-term stability, high biocidal efficacy (>99.9999% via contact killing), and promising antifouling functions, which enable the SBMA@HAF films to serve as a biocidal material in food packaging applications.","authors":[{"name":"Yue Ma"},{"name":"Jiaying Li"},{"name":"Yang Si"},{"name":"Kang Huang"},{"name":"Nitin Nitin"},{"name":"Gang Sun"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PVA-co-PE"},{"word":"antifouling"},{"word":"photo-graft"},{"word":"rechargeable antimicrobial"},{"word":"zwitterionic surface"}]},"article202":{"pmid":"31022167","title":"Genetic dissection of Escherichia coli's master diguanylate cyclase DgcE: Role of the N-terminal MASE1 domain and direct signal input from a GTPase partner system.","abs":"The ubiquitous second messenger c-di-GMP promotes bacterial biofilm formation by playing diverse roles in the underlying regulatory networks. This is reflected in the multiplicity of diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and phosphodiesterases (PDE) that synthesize and degrade c-di-GMP, respectively, in most bacterial species. One of the 12 DGCs of Escherichia coli, DgcE, serves as the top-level trigger for extracellular matrix production during macrocolony biofilm formation. Its multi-domain architecture-a N-terminal membrane-inserted MASE1 domain followed by three PAS, a GGDEF and a degenerate EAL domain-suggested complex signal integration and transmission through DgcE. Genetic dissection of DgcE revealed activating roles for the MASE1 domain and the dimerization-proficient PAS3 region, whereas the inhibitory EALdeg domain counteracts the formation of DgcE oligomers. The MASE1 domain is directly targeted by the GTPase RdcA (YjdA), a dimer or oligomer that together with its partner protein RdcB (YjcZ) activates DgcE, probably by aligning and promoting dimerization of the PAS3 and GGDEF domains. This activation and RdcA/DgcE interaction depend on GTP hydrolysis by RdcA, suggesting GTP as an inhibitor and the pronounced decrease of the cellular GTP pool during entry into stationary phase, which correlates with DgcE-dependent activation of matrix production, as a possible input signal sensed by RdcA. Furthermore, DgcE exhibits rapid, continuous and processive proteolytic turnover that also depends on the relatively disordered transmembrane MASE1 domain. Overall, our study reveals a novel GTP/c-di-GMP-connecting signaling pathway through the multi-domain DGC DgcE with a dual role for the previously uncharacterized MASE1 signaling domain.","authors":[{"name":"Vanessa Pfiffer"},{"name":"Olga Sarenko"},{"name":"Alexandra Possling"},{"name":"Regine Hengge"}],"keywords":[]},"article203":{"pmid":"31021953","title":"Regulation of virulence and antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive microbes in response to cell wall-active antibiotics.","abs":"Antibiotic stress can evoke considerable genotypic and phenotypic changes in Gram-positive bacteria.

In the natural environment, several non-pathogenic bacteria are present as mixed population along with pathogenic bacteria and they control the behavior of microbial community by producing secondary metabolites. Similarly, non-pathogenic bacteria also take advantages of the QS signaling molecule as a sole carbon source for their growth through catabolism with enzymes. Several enzymes are produced by bacteria which disrupt the biofilm architecture by degrading the composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) such as exopolysaccharide, extracellular- DNA and protein. Thus, the interference of QS system by bacterial metabolic products and enzymatic catalysis, modification of the QS signaling molecules as well as enzymatic disruption of biofilm architecture have been considered as the alternative therapeutic approaches.

Despite important advances, how fusion modules affect the self-assembly and functional properties of amyloids remains elusive. Here, using Escherichia coli curli as a model system, we systematically studied the effect of flanking domains on the structures, assembly kinetics and functions of amyloids. The designed amyloids were composed of E. coli biofilm protein CsgA (as amyloidogenic cores) and one or two flanking domains, consisting of chitin-binding domains (CBDs) from Bacillus circulans chitinase, and/or mussel foot proteins (Mfps). Incorporation of fusion domains did not disrupt the typical β-sheet structures, but indeed affected assembly rate, morphology, and stiffness of resultant fibrils. Consequently, the CsgA-fusion fibrils, particularly those containing three domains, were much shorter than the CsgA-only fibrils. Furthermore, the stiffness of the resultant fibrils was heavily affected by the structural feature of fusion domains, with β-sheet-containing domains tending to increase the Young's modulus while random coil domains decreasing the Young's modulus. In addition, fibrils containing CBD domains showed higher chitin-binding activity compared to their CBD-free counterparts. The CBD-CsgA-Mfp3 construct exhibited significantly lower binding activity than Mfp5-CsgA-CBD due to inappropriate folding of the CBD domain in the former construct, in agreement with results based upon molecular dynamics modeling. Our study provides new insights into the assembly and functional properties of designer amyloid proteins with increasing complex domain structures and lays the foundation for the future design of functional amyloid-based structures and molecular materials.","authors":[{"name":"Mengkui Cui"},{"name":"Qi Qi"},{"name":"Thomas Gurry"},{"name":"Tianxin Zhao"},{"name":"Bolin An"},{"name":"Jiahua Pu"},{"name":"Xinrui Gui"},{"name":"Allen A Cheng"},{"name":"Siyu Zhang"},{"name":"Dongmin Xun"},{"name":"Michele Becce"},{"name":"Francesco Briatico-Vangosa"},{"name":"Cong Liu"},{"name":"Timothy K Lu"},{"name":"Chao Zhong"}],"keywords":[]},"article224":{"pmid":"31015909","title":"Using 2-aminobenzimidazole derivatives to inhibit Mycobacterium smegmatis biofilm formation.","abs":"Biofilm formation by mycobacteria can lead to enhanced antibiotic tolerance.

Significant biofilm removal was observed on glass, polystyrene, and stainless steel surfaces. Furthermore, we explored the probable mechanism about how surfactin affected S. aureus biofilm formation.

It also down-regulated the expression of icaA and icaD significantly, which are necessary for the important constituents to take shape of staphylococcal biofilm. In addition, it was found that the lipopeptide affected the quorum sensing (QS) system in S. aureus through regulating the auto inducer 2 (AI-2) activity, which has been reported to be negative for biofilm formation in S. aureus.

At this interface, C. crescentus initially forms a monolayer of cells bearing a surface adhesin known as the holdfast. When excised from the liquid surface, this monolayer strongly adheres to glass. The monolayer subsequently develops into a three-dimensional structure that is highly enriched in clusters of stalked cells known as rosettes. As this pellicle film matures, it becomes more cohesive and less adherent to a glass surface. A mutant strain lacking a flagellum does not efficiently reach the surface, and strains lacking type IV pili exhibit defects in organization of the three-dimensional pellicle. Strains unable to synthesize the holdfast fail to accumulate at the boundary between air and liquid and do not form a pellicle. Phase-contrast images support a model whereby the holdfast functions to trap C. crescentus cells at the air-liquid boundary. Unlike the holdfast, neither the flagellum nor type IV pili are required for C. crescentus to partition to the air-liquid interface.

However, a frail point of the CIP procedures is their variable efficiency in eliminating biofilm bacteria. In the present study, we evaluated the susceptibility of strong biofilm-forming dairy Bacillus isolates to industrial cleaning procedures using two differently designed model systems. According to our results, the dairy-associated Bacillus isolates demonstrate a higher resistance to CIP procedures, compared to the non-dairy strain of B. subtilis. Notably, the tested dairy isolates are highly persistent to different parameters of the CIP operations, including the turbulent flow of liquid (up to 1 log), as well as the cleaning and disinfecting effects of commercial detergents (up to 2.3 log). Moreover, our observations indicate an enhanced resistance of poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA)-overproducing B. subtilis, which produces high amounts of proteinaceous extracellular matrix, to the CIP procedures (about 0.7 log, compared to the wild-type non-dairy strain of B. subtilis). We therefore suggest that the enhanced resistance to the CIP procedures by the dairy Bacillus isolates can be attributed to robust biofilm formation. In addition, this study underlines the importance of evaluating the efficiency of commercial cleaning agents in relation to strong biofilm-forming bacteria, which are relevant to industrial conditions. Consequently, we believe that the findings of this study can facilitate the assessment and refining of the industrial CIP procedures.","authors":[{"name":"Ievgeniia Ostrov"},{"name":"Tali Paz"},{"name":"Moshe Shemesh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus species"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm derived spores"},{"word":"cleaning-in-place"},{"word":"dairy industry"},{"word":"disinfecting effect"}]},"article246":{"pmid":"30828441","title":"Anti-infective potential of hydroalcoholic extract of Punica  granatum peel against gram-negative bacterial pathogens.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Chinmayi Joshi"},{"name":"Pooja Patel"},{"name":"Vijay Kothari"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Microwave Assisted Extraction"},{"word":"Post Extract Effect"},{"word":"Prebiotic"},{"word":"Punica granatum peel"},{"word":"Quorum Sensing"}]},"article247":{"pmid":"31009806","title":"VraSR has an important role in immune evasion of Staphylococcus aureus with low level vancomycin resistance.","abs":"Vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous VISA (hVISA) are increasingly being reported as associated with treatment failure.

Here, we constructed a vraSR deletion mutant strain (ΔvraSR) and complementary strain (CΔvraSR) in Mu3 to investigate the effect of VraSR on S. aureus viability in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). The ΔvraSR strain was more susceptible to phagocytosis by PMNs and reduced the ability of S. aureus to survive within PMNs. ΔvraSR showed phenotypic changes, including a thinner cell wall, reduced adhesion, and decreased biofilm-forming ability. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the transcript levels of cell wall synthesis-related genes (cap5K, cap5N, nanA, tagA, murD) and adhesion-associated genes (fnbA, fnbB, clfA, ebps, sbi) were significantly decreased in the ΔvraSR strain compared with Mu3. In summary, VraSR promotes the survival of S. aureus in the host, which may be associated with an increase in the thickness of the cell wall, adhesion, and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Caihong Gao"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Dai"},{"name":"Wenjiao Chang"},{"name":"Chao Fang"},{"name":"Ziran Wang"},{"name":"Xiaoling Ma"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Immune evasion"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus with low level vancomycin resistance"},{"word":"VraSR"}]},"article248":{"pmid":"31009580","title":"The Role of Exopolysaccharides in Oral Biofilms.","abs":"The oral cavity contains a rich consortium of exopolysaccharide-producing microbes.

Currently, all alginate used commercially is extracted from brown seaweed. However, with environmental changes such as increasing ocean temperature and the increasing number of biotechnological uses of alginates with specific properties, there is an emerging need for more reliable and customizable sources of alginate. An alternative to seaweed for alginate production is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common Gram-negative bacterium that can form alginate-containing biofilms. However, P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, we sought to engineer a non-pathogenic P. aeruginosa strain that is safe for commercial production of alginate. Using a homologous recombination strategy, we sequentially deleted five key pathogenicity genes from the P. aeruginosa chromosome, resulting in the marker-free strain PGN5. Intraperitoneal injection of mice with PGN5 resulted in 0% mortality, while injection with wild-type P. aeruginosa resulted in 95% mortality, providing evidence that the systemic virulence of PGN5 is highly attenuated. Importantly, PGN5 produces large amounts of alginate in response to overexpression of MucE, an activator of alginate biosynthesis. The alginate produced by PGN5 is structurally identical to alginate produced by wild-type P. aeruginosa, indicating that the alginate biosynthetic pathway remains functional in this modified strain. The genetic versatility of P. aeruginosa will allow us to further engineer PGN5 to produce alginates with specific chemical compositions and physical properties to meet different industrial and biomedical needs.","authors":[{"name":"Meagan E Valentine"},{"name":"Brandon D Kirby"},{"name":"Thomas R Withers"},{"name":"Shannon L Johnson"},{"name":"Timothy E Long"},{"name":"Youai Hao"},{"name":"Joseph S Lam"},{"name":"Richard M Niles"},{"name":"Hongwei D Yu"}],"keywords":[]},"article256":{"pmid":"31006638","title":"Strain- and Species-Level Variation in the Microbiome of Diabetic Wounds Is Associated with Clinical Outcomes and Therapeutic Efficacy.","abs":"Chronic wounds are a major complication of diabetes associated with high morbidity and health care expenditures.

We recently reported the existence of electrical signalling in a much simpler organism, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In dense bacterial communities known as biofilms, nutrient-deprived B. subtilis cells in the interior of the colony use electrical communication to transmit stress signals to the periphery, which interfere with the growth of peripheral cells and reduce nutrient consumption, thereby relieving stress from the interior. Here, we explicitly address the interplay between metabolism and electrophysiology in bacterial biofilms, by introducing a spatially extended mathematical model that combines the metabolic and electrical components of the phenomenon in a discretized reaction-diffusion scheme. The model is experimentally validated by environmental and genetic perturbations, and confirms that metabolic stress is transmitted through the bacterial population via a potassium wave. Interestingly, this behaviour is reminiscent of cortical spreading depression in the brain, characterized by a wave of electrical activity mediated by potassium diffusion that has been linked to various neurological disorders, calling for future studies on the evolutionary link between the two phenomena.

Recently, we reported the novel roles of SOD in serum resistance and biofilm formation in S. Typhimurium. This study was designed to explore the effect of infection with sodA mutant of S.

Currently, antibiotics to treat biofilm infections are administered empirically, usually without considering the susceptibility of the biofilm objectively before beginning treatment. For effective therapy to resolve biofilm infections it is essential to assess the efficacy of commonly used antibiotics against biofilms. Here, we offer a robust and simple assay to assess the efficacy of antibiotics against biofilms. In the present work, we carefully optimized the incubation time, detection range, and fluorescence reading mode for resazurin-based viability staining of biofilms in 96-well-plates and determined minimal biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) for A. baumannii isolates from patients with chronic infection. By applying this assay, we demonstrated that antibiotic response patterns varied uniquely within the biofilm formation of various clinical samples. MBEC-50 and 75 have significant discriminatory power over minimum inhibitory concentrations for planktonic suspensions to differentiate the overall efficiency of an antibiotic to eradicate a biofilm.

The MgtC membrane protein has been proposed as an attractive target that is involved in the ability of several major bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to survive inside macrophages. In liquid culture, P. aeruginosa MgtC acts negatively on biofilm formation. However, a putative link between these two functions of MgtC in P. aeruginosa has not been experimentally addressed. In the present study, we first investigated the contribution of exopolysaccharides (EPS) in the intramacrophage survival defect and biofilm increase of mgtC mutant. Within infected macrophages, expression of EPS genes psl and alg was increased in a P. aeruginosa mgtC mutant strain comparatively to wild-type strain. However, the intramacrophage survival defect of mgtC mutant was not rescued upon introduction of psl or alg mutation, suggesting that MgtC intramacrophage role is unrelated to EPS production, whereas the increased biofilm formation of mgtC mutant was partially suppressed by introduction of psl mutation. We aimed to develop an antivirulence strategy targeting MgtC, by taking advantage of a natural antagonistic peptide, MgtR. Heterologous expression of mgtR in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was shown to reduce its ability to survive within macrophages. We investigated for the first time the biological effect of a synthetic MgtR peptide on P. aeruginosa. Exogenously added synthetic MgtR peptide lowered the intramacrophage survival of wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1, thus mimicking the phenotype of an mgtC mutant as well as the effect of endogenously produced MgtR peptide. In correlation with this finding, addition of MgtR peptide to bacterial culture strongly reduced MgtC protein level, without reducing bacterial growth or viability, thus differing from classical antimicrobial peptides. On the other hand, the addition of exogenous MgtR peptide did not affect significantly biofilm formation, indicating an action toward EPS-independent phenotype rather than EPS-related phenotype. Cumulatively, our results show an antivirulence action of synthetic MgtR peptide, which may be more potent against acute infection, and provide a proof of concept for further exploitation of anti-Pseudomonas strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Malika Moussouni"},{"name":"Pauline Nogaret"},{"name":"Preeti Garai"},{"name":"Bérengère Ize"},{"name":"Eric Vivès"},{"name":"Anne-Béatrice Blanc-Potard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"MgtC"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antivirulence strategy"},{"word":"macrophage"},{"word":"peptide"}]},"article285":{"pmid":"31001485","title":"Recent Advances in Anti-virulence Therapeutic Strategies With a Focus on Dismantling Bacterial Membrane Microdomains, Toxin Neutralization, Quorum-Sensing Interference and Biofilm Inhibition.","abs":"Antimicrobial resistance constitutes one of the major challenges facing humanity in the Twenty-First century.

Autograft donor sites are particularly vulnerable to biofilm formation; as such, timely healing of these sites is essential. Our aim was to apply scanning electron microscopy to compare the efficacy of two types of wound dressings in preventing the formation of bacterial biofilm on burn patient skin graft donor sites. One dressing contained bismuth tribromophenate at a concentration of 3% which confers it bacteriostatic properties (Xeroform™). The other was an absorptive alginate calcium sodium dressing (Kaltostat™). Samples of each wound dressing, which were in contact with the skin graft donor site, were prepared for analysis under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) using an original method developed by our research group that aims to maintain the integrity of the biofilm microstructure. Samples prepared by this method were then analyzed using SEM, which allowed the characterization of biofilm and the evaluation of bacterial density on the studied dressing samples.

This study demonstrates the high affinity of biobased compositions to bind target bacterial and fungal cells and inactivate 5 logs of model pathogenic bacteria and fungi in wash water without and with high organic load (chemical oxygen demand = 2000 mg/L) in 30 s and 5 min, respectively. For the sanitation of biofilms, this biobased sanitizer can inactivate 7 logs of pathogenic bacteria and 3 logs of fungi after 1 h treatment, whereas the 1 h treatment using conventional chlorine-based sanitizer can only achieve 2-3 log reduction for bacterial biofilms and 1-2 log reduction for fungal biofilms, respectively. The enhanced antimicrobial activity can be attributed to three factors: (a) localized high concentration of chlorine bound on the YCWPs; (b) high affinity of YCWPs to bind diverse microbes; and (c) improved stability in an organic-rich aqueous environment. In summary, these unique attributes of biobased carriers will significantly enhance the sanitation efficacy of biofilms, reduce the persistence and transmission of antimicrobial resistant microbes, limit the use of antimicrobial chemicals, and improve the cost-effectiveness of sanitizers.","authors":[{"name":"Kang Huang"},{"name":"Fang Dou"},{"name":"Nitin Nitin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"N-halamine"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"particle-based sanitizer"},{"word":"yeast cell wall particles"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"30997794","title":"Silica-Coated Gold-Silver Nanocages as Photothermal Antibacterial Agents for Combined Anti-Infective Therapy.","abs":"Because of the abuse of antibiotics and threats of antibiotic resistance, bacterial infection is still one of the most difficult issues to be resolved.

Here, the feasibility and performance of perchlorate reduction driven by methane in the presence and absence of oxygen were investigated and compared in a lab-scale methane-based membrane biofilm reactor. Long-term operational performance suggested that perchlorate was reduced to chloride, with 4 mg Cl/L/d of perchlorate removal rate under anoxic conditions. Differently, perchlorate removal rate increased to 16 mg Cl/L/d, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were produced from methane partial oxidation when a limited oxygen (10 mg/L/d) was externally supplied. Regardless of oxygen conditions, microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane might be mediated through synergistic interactions by a microbial consortium, but with different key microbial members under both oxygen regimes. Under anoxic conditions, aerobic methanotrophs (likely Methylocystaceae and Methylococcaceae) might micro-aerobically oxidize methane by utilizing internal oxygen from microbial perchlorate reduction, which might be mediated by Rhodocyclaceae. In contrast, under oxygen-limiting conditions, methanogens (e.g., Methanosarcina) and fermenters (e.g., Veillonellaceae) likely jointly converted methane into VFAs, then dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria (e.g., Rhodocyclaceae) utilized the produced VFAs to reduce perchlorate to chloride.

Most of the present-day surgical equipment, catheters, prostheses and indwelling devices comprised silicone, stainless steel, polyvinyl chloride and polycarbonate, on which NTMs have the tendency to form biofilms. Central nervous system infection caused by NTM carries a high mortality rate (ranging from 35% to 70%), especially in immune-compromised patients. Indwelling device removal along with prolonged treatment with a combination regimen is recommended in such cases.","authors":[{"name":"Ashit Bhusan Xess"},{"name":"Kiran Bala"},{"name":"Aashirwad Panigrahy"},{"name":"Urvashi Singh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"epilepsy and seizures"},{"word":"neurosurgery"},{"word":"tuberculosis"}]},"article319":{"pmid":"30992061","title":"Thioredoxin H (TrxH) contributes to adversity adaptation and pathogenicity of Edwardsiella piscicida.","abs":"Thioredoxins (Trxs) play an important role in defending against oxidative stress and keeping disulfide bonding correct to maintain protein function.

To explore the mechanisms of sludge acidification deeply and provide a theoretical basis for practical application, sewage sludge was repeatedly treated by acidification conditioning. The sludge pH was continuously adjusted from 7.0 to 3.0, then back to 7.0, and to 3.0 again in this study. When the sludge pH returned to a neutral condition, the sludge dewaterability was further deteriorated. However, after the second acidification conditioning, the sludge dewaterability was improved to the same level as that at the first conditioning. These experimental facts were due to two acidification effects. One was that acidification can efficiently destroy the structure of sludge flocs, thereby causing the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) and release of trapped water. Furthermore, some internal EPSs were released into the outer layer. The other was protonation effect, which can effectively compress the released EPSs, especially protein-like matters (PN) therein. These two combined effects caused a good sludge dewaterability. However, the former was irreversible, whereas the latter was reversible. When the pH of acidified sludge was readjusted to 7.0, the protonation effect weakened, thereby the original compressed EPS released into the outer layer of sludge and the PN content in soluble EPS fraction increased near five times, resulting in considerable deterioration of sludge dewaterability. The negative effects of released organic matters by acidification were often concealed and neglected due to protonation, thereby causing the reversal of dewatering performance in practice when the sludge pH was fluctuated.","authors":[{"name":"Hua Wei"},{"name":"Yunong Tang"},{"name":"Aimin Li"},{"name":"Hu Yang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acidification"},{"word":"Dewatering mechanism"},{"word":"Dewatering of sludge"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"Protonation effect"},{"word":"pH repeated adjustment"}]},"article323":{"pmid":"30991199","title":"Mechanism analysis to improve sludge dewaterability during anaerobic digestion based on moisture distribution.","abs":"Previous studies have demonstrated that anaerobic digestion (AD) enhances sludge dewaterability. However, the mechanism of AD influence on digested sludge dewaterability is still not well understood. In this study, moisture distribution and bond energy were used to evaluate the influence of AD on sludge dewaterability. The change from free moisture (FM) to mechanically bound moisture (MBM) was analysed, along with degradation of organic fractions in extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) of the sludge during AD. Results indicated that the AD process, with a 41.9% reduction in volatile solids (VS) and cumulative methane production of 283.2 mL/g VS, improved sludge dewaterability by disintegrating macro-molecular organic matter into micro-molecular matter. MBM reduction reached 7% in 40 days. Correlations between FM/MBM and extracellular protein (extra-PN) were significant (R = -0.861, p < 0.01; R = 0.869, p < 0.01). Therefore, it can be concluded that the degradation of protein in the extra-microcolony polymer (EMPS) layer results in the destruction of the bond between organic fractions and moisture. As a result, the release of mechanically bound moisture is accelerated. In addition, the moisture content, as well as the extra-PN, continued to vary when AD entered the stabilisation stage, that is, the destruction of protein in EMPS stimulated mechanically bound moisture release during AD. The results of this work provide a better understanding on the effect of AD on sludge reduction.","authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang"},{"name":"Bin Dong"},{"name":"Xiaohu Dai"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anaerobic digestion"},{"word":"Correlation"},{"word":"Dewaterability"},{"word":"Mechanism"},{"word":"Moisture distribution"}]},"article324":{"pmid":"30991089","title":"Liposomes containing biosurfactants isolated from Lactobacillus gasseri exert antibiofilm activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is the major causative agent of skin and soft tissue infections, whose prevention and treatment have become more difficult due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains.

Given that dispersion coincides with void formation and an overall erosion of the biofilm structure, we asked whether dispersion involves degradation of the biofilm matrix. Here, we focused on extracellular genomic DNA (eDNA) due to its almost universal presence in the matrix of biofilm-forming species. We identified two probable nucleases, endA and eddB, and eddA encoding a phosphatase that were significantly increased in transcript abundance in dispersed cells. However, only inactivation of endA but not eddA or eddB impaired dispersion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in response to glutamate and nitric oxide (NO). Heterologously produced EndA was found to be secreted and active in degrading genomic DNA. While endA inactivation had little effect on biofilm formation and the presence of eDNA in biofilms, eDNA degradation upon induction of dispersion was impaired. In contrast, induction of endA expression coincided with eDNA degradation and resulted in biofilm dispersion. Thus, released cells demonstrated a hyperattaching phenotype but remained as resistant to tobramycin as biofilm cells from which they egress, indicating EndA-dispersed cells adopted some but not all of the phenotypes associated with dispersed cells.

Slit-lamp biomicroscopy analysis, corneal histopathological studies and cellular infiltrate quantification through myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) detection were performed. LyeTxI-b was very effective in the treatment of keratitis, with no signs of ocular toxicity. Planktonic bacteria MIC was 3.6 µmol/L and LyeTxI-b treatment reduced biofilm viability in 90%. LyeTxI-b eliminated bacteria and reduced inflammatory cellular activity in the eyes. Healthy and treated animals showed similar NAG and MPO levels.

Overall, the activities of F-AuNPs towards P. aeruginosa were varied depending on their concentration. At minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (512 µg/mL) and at concentrations above MIC, F-AuNPs exerted antibacterial activity. In contrast, the sub-inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) levels of F-AuNPs inhibited biofilm formation without affecting bacterial growth, and eradicated matured biofilm.

However, insights and tools are currently lacking to characterize, understand and explain the effects of signal disruption on complex microbial communities. Here, we produced silica capsules containing an engineered lactonase that exhibits quorum quenching activity.

Effects of the quorum quenching lactonase on the suspension community also affected the microbial composition, suggesting that effects of signal disruption are not limited to biofilm populations.

It is of importance that catecholamine affects the growth and virulence of bacteria. The influence of stress on bacterial infections is attributed to the ability of catecholamines to suppress the immune system as the mode of action for increased bacterial growth. Catecholamines have increased the growth of bacteria, virulence-associated factors, adhesions, and biofilm formation and consequently influence the outcome of infections by these bacteria in many hosts. The siderophores and the ferric iron transport system plays a vital role in the mechanism by which catecholamines stimulates growth and exposure of genes to stress hormones enhances the expression of genes involved in bacterial virulence.

Interestingly, there appeared a critical AGS size (1∼1.2 mm) for membrane fouling. Above 1.2 mm, flux increased and fouling reduced with size, due to the loose cake layer and high permeability caused by larger AGS. Below 1 mm, for smaller AGS, higher flux and lower fouling appeared, because less extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) formed and adhered onto AGS foulants. In the critical size, membrane fouling was serious to the most extent, on account of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of EPS. Moreover, this critical AGS size also possessed the highest cake layer, pore blocking and irreversible fouling, which generally existed in various operational conditions. Besides, the results of SEM, AFM, hydrophilicity and ATR-FTIR also proved that the existence of the maximum membrane fouling at the critical AGS size.

Herein, we report the first NO releasing poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) fluorinated copolymer prepared by incorporating a fluorinated S-nitrosothiol as the NO donor.

A role of IncP-1β plasmids in Fe uptake processes has been revealed. Moreover, a screening of typical mycosphere-inhabiting Paraburkholderia spp. revealed carriage of integrated plasmids, next to prophages, that presumably confer fitness enhancements.

The majority of human infectious diseases are caused by biofilm-forming microorganisms which are responsible for pathologies such as cystic fibrosis, infective endocarditis, pneumonia, wound infections, dental caries, infections of indwelling devices, etc. AMPs are well suited to combat biofilms because of their potent bactericidal activity of broad spectrum (including resting cells and persisters) and their ability to first penetrate and then to disorganize these structures. In addition, AMPs frequently synergize with antimicrobial compounds and were recently reported to repress the molecular pathways leading to biofilm formation. Finally, there is a very active research to develop AMP-containing coatings that can prevent biofilm formation by killing microbial cells on contact or by locally releasing their active principle.

FTIR analysis revealed that the absorption peaks of C-O-S, sulfate, and S = O, which are closely associated with sulfur metabolism, have significant influences of EPS secretion. Taken together, the EPS-mediated contact mechanism contributed to almost half of the contact mechanism efficiency and a quarter of the total bioleaching efficiency. The proposed specific mechanism of EPS can deepen our understanding of similar bioleaching processes.","authors":[{"name":"Shoushuai Feng"},{"name":"Kaijun Li"},{"name":"Zhuangzhuang Huang"},{"name":"Yanjun Tong"},{"name":"Hailin Yang"}],"keywords":[]},"article382":{"pmid":"30977894","title":"Infection in orthopaedic oncology: crucial problem in modern reconstructive techniques.","abs":"Infection after orthopaedic oncology surgery is a relatively frequent complication.

This study investigated the effect of exposure of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates to sub lethal concentrations of BAC on their antibiotic resistance, growth process and biofilm formation. The collected 43 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were daily subjected to increasing sub lethal concentrations of BAC. The effect of adaptation on antibiotic resistance, growth process, cell surface hydrophobicity and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa isolates were examined.

We found that tonB1 and tonB2 were preferentially transcribed in iron-chelated conditions, where gene expression levels were approximately 8- and 68-fold higher compared with iron-rich conditions, respectively; tonB3 was consistently transcribed at a low level under iron-repleted and iron-depleted conditions.

In addition, all three tonB genes were involved in A. hydrophila virulence in zebrafish, and various phenotypes associated with environmental survival were changed with varying degrees in each tonB mutant. TonB2 plays a relatively major role in adhesion, motility, and biofilm formation, while TonB3 is more involved in the anti-phagocytosis of A. hydrophila.

Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using phenotypic and molecular methods. SCCmec type and the presence of biofilm-related ica locus was PCR-tested. Isolates suspected for MRCoNS IT cases were subjected to SmaI-PFGE analysis and individuals from positive households were followed-up for 1 year for carriage dynamics (every 3 months, T0-T4). Nineteen MRCoNS isolates from owners (27.9%) and 12 from pets (16.7%) were detected, coming from 20 households (46.5%). S. epidermidis was predominant (90 and 67% of human and animal strains, respectively), showing high phylogenetic diversity (16 STs among 24 strains). Methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) strains belonged to CC5 (75%), CC11 (12.5%), singleton S556 (8.3%), and S560 (4.17%). Significant host-associated differences were observed for resistance to aminoglycosides, co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol (higher in animal isolates) and tetracycline (higher among human strains). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was common (68.4%) and associated with human strains. Great diversity of ccr and mec complexes were detected, most strains being non-typeable, followed by SCCmecIV and V. Over one third of isolates (most from owners), carried the ica locus, all MRSE CC5. Two sporadic IT cases (T0) were identified in owners and dogs from two households (4.7%), with diverse interspecies-exchanged clones detected along the sampling year, especially in dogs. A comparative analysis of all MRCoNS, with all nasal coagulase positive staphylococci (CoPS) recovered from the same individuals at T0, revealed that CoPS alone was predominant in owners and pets, followed by co-carriage of CoPS and MRCoNS in owners but single MRCoNS in pets. Statistical analyses revealed that owners are more prone to co-carriage and that co-existence of IT cases and co-carriage are positively interrelated. MRCoNS from healthy owners and their pets are genetically heterogeneous MDR strains that are spread in the community. Therefore, pets also contribute to the dissemination of successful human clones.

While the HV isolate revealed cell aggregates formed upstream at all time-points, for the LV isolate this was only seen upon cortisol supplementation. Secondly, the transcriptional effect of genes (gldK, gldL, gldM, gldN, sprA, sprE, sprT, and porV) belonging to the Type IX secretion system involved in gliding motility was investigated in planktonic and biofilm cells of a HV and LV isolate to which no, a low (LD) or high (HD) dose of cortisol was added. Significantly lower expression of gliding genes gldK, gldL, gldM and gldN, and of protein secretion regulator porV was seen in the LV isolate planktonic cells supplemented with a HD-cortisol. The LV isolate biofilm cells treated with the HD-cortisol showed a significant upregulation of sprT, encoding mobile surface adhesion important in bacterial colonization. This is the first evidence for the co-regulatory effect of cortisol on biofilm formation and F. columnare gliding gene expression.","authors":[{"name":"Annelies Maria Declercq"},{"name":"Wenlong Cai"},{"name":"Eber Naranjo"},{"name":"Wilawan Thongda"},{"name":"Venessa Eeckhaut"},{"name":"Eva Bauwens"},{"name":"Covadonga Arias"},{"name":"Leonardo De La Fuente"},{"name":"Benjamin H Beck"},{"name":"Miles D Lange"},{"name":"Eric Peatman"},{"name":"Freddy Haesebrouck"},{"name":"Johan Aerts"},{"name":"Annemie Decostere"}],"keywords":[]},"article409":{"pmid":"30971140","title":"Enhancing mainstream nitrogen removal by employing nitrate/nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation processes.","abs":"Due to serious eutrophication in water bodies, nitrogen removal has become a critical stage for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) over past decades. Conventional biological nitrogen removal processes are based on nitrification and denitrification (N/DN), and are suffering from several major drawbacks, including substantial aeration consumption, high fugitive greenhouse gas emissions, a requirement for external carbon sources, excessive sludge production and low energy recovery efficiency, and thus unable to satisfy the escalating public needs. Recently, the discovery of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria has promoted an update of conventional N/DN-based processes to autotrophic nitrogen removal. However, the application of anammox to treat domestic wastewater has been hindered mainly by unsatisfactory effluent quality with nitrogen removal efficiency below 80%. The discovery of nitrate/nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-DAMO) during the last decade has provided new opportunities to remove this barrier and to achieve a robust system with high-level nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater, by utilizing methane as an alternative carbon source. In the present review, opportunities and challenges for nitrate/nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation are discussed. Particularly, the prospective technologies driven by the cooperation of anammox and n-DAMO microorganisms are put forward based on previous experimental and modeling studies.

The objective of this study was to investigate how two antimicrobials, ciprofloxacin and climbazole, impact detrital biofilm metabolism in urban and rural streams. To establish baseline conditions, the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of red maple (Acer rubrum) biofilms was measured in one urban and one rural stream. In mesocosm studies, the BOD of biofilms on single- and mixed-species leaf litter from the same sites was measured after exposure to 10 μg/L of the antimicrobials, both in combination and individually. The presence of ciprofloxacin and climbazole did not affect BOD compared to the controls at the urban site, although significant differences were identified for select treatments at the rural site. In addition, the BOD of mixed-leaf biofilms was not significantly different from that of single species litter after exposure. Overall, exposure to 10 μg/L of the antimicrobials did not significantly impact community-level carbon processing by the leaf biofilms, and leaf mixtures did not result in increased biofilm BOD compared to single species leaves.

The results indicated that both C. jejuni strains isolated from poultry attached better to Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on abiotic surfaces than to the surfaces alone under the different conditions tested.

By contrast the C. jejuni ATCC 33291 strain did not attach differentially to P. aeruginosa biofilms, suggesting that different C. jejuni strains may have alternative strategies for persistence in the environment.

During the initial phase, the successional turnover was high and α-diversity decreased as a result of the selection of taxa adapted to grow on acetate and form aggregates. Despite these dynamic changes, the microbial communities in the replicate reactors were similar. The second successional phase occurred when the settling time was rapidly decreased to selectively retain granules in the reactors. The influence of stochasticity on succession increased and new niches were created as granules emerged, resulting in temporarily increased α-diversity. The third successional phase occurred when the settling time was kept stable and granules dominated the biomass. Turnover was low, and selection resulted in the same abundant taxa in the reactors, but drift, which mostly affected low-abundant community members, caused the community in one reactor to diverge from the other two.

Conversely, much less attention has been given to the directly related problem of resistance toward antiseptics and biocides. While bacterial resistances toward triclosan or quaternary ammonium compounds have been considered in this context, the bis-biguanide chlorhexidine (CHX) has been put into focus only very recently when its use was associated with emergence of stable resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin. The antimicrobial effect of CHX is based on damaging the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and subsequent leakage of cytoplasmic material. Consequently, mechanisms conferring resistance toward CHX include multidrug efflux pumps and cell membrane changes. For instance, in staphylococci it has been shown that plasmid-borne qac (quaternary ammonium compound) genes encode Qac efflux proteins that recognize cationic antiseptics as substrates. In Pseudomonas stutzeri, changes in the outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles have been implicated in CHX resistance. However, little is known about the risk of resistance toward CHX in oral bacteria and potential mechanisms conferring this resistance or even cross-resistances toward antibiotics. Interestingly, there is also little awareness about the risk of CHX resistance in the dental community even though CHX has been widely used in dental practice as the gold-standard antiseptic for more than 40 years and is also included in a wide range of oral care consumer products. This review provides an overview of general resistance mechanisms toward CHX and the evidence for CHX resistance in oral bacteria. Furthermore, this work aims to raise awareness among the dental community about the risk of resistance toward CHX and accompanying cross-resistance to antibiotics.

Thus, we determined whether antibiotic resistant mutants display selfish or altruistic behaviors in mixed Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms exposed to antibiotics. ECFP-tagged P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 and its EYFP-tagged derivatives hyperproducing the β-lactamase AmpC or the efflux pump MexAB-OprM were used to develop single or mixed biofilms. Mature biofilms were challenged with different concentrations of β-lactams to monitor biofilm structural dynamics, using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and population dynamics, through enumeration of viable cells. While exposure of single wild-type PAO1 biofilms to β-lactams lead to a major reduction in bacterial load, it had little effect on biofilms formed by the resistant mutants. However, the most reveling finding was that bacterial load of wild-type PAO1 was significantly increased when growing in mixed biofilms compared to single biofilms. In agreement with CFU enumeration data, CLSM images revealed the amplification of the resistant mutants and their protection of susceptible populations. These findings show that mutants expressing diverse resistance mechanisms, including β-lactamases, but also, as evidenced for the first time, efflux pumps, protect the whole biofilm community, preserving susceptible populations from the effect of antibiotics. Thus, these results are a step forward to understanding antibiotic resistance dynamics in biofilms, as well as the population biology of bacterial pathogens in chronic infections, where the coexistence of susceptible and resistant variants is a hallmark.","authors":[{"name":"Estrella Rojo-Molinero"},{"name":"María D Macià"},{"name":"Antonio Oliver"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"bacterial communities"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"resistance mutants"},{"word":"β-lactam antibiotics"}]},"article421":{"pmid":"30967458","title":"Antibacterial Properties and Efficacy of a Novel SPLUNC1-Derived Antimicrobial Peptide, α4-Short, in a Murine Model of Respiratory Infection.","abs":"Multidrug resistance (MDR) by bacterial pathogens constitutes a global health crisis, and resistance to treatment displayed by biofilm-associated infections (e.g., cystic fibrosis, surgical sites, and medical implants) only exacerbates a problem that is already difficult to overcome.

For this purpose, we made use of several experimental techniques where humidity control was implemented: quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, atomic force microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. By means of this multimethodological approach, we report that surfactants embedded in latex coatings can undergo humidity-induced transitions towards more hydrated and softer phases, and that this results in a drastic decrease of the mechanical and water barrier properties of the whole coatings.

SCEO was mainly composed by fatty acids (89.79%) and sesquiterpenes (8.5%). The major components were octanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, decanoic acid and γ-eudesmol. SCEO showed bactericidal activity (minimal bactericidal concentration from 312 to 1250 μg/mL) against all tested S. aureus clinical isolates, which showed distinct biofilm-forming and multiple drug resistance phenotypes. SCEO weakly reduced biomass but remarkably decreased cell viability in pre-formed biofilms of S. aureus isolate UFPEDA-02 (ATCC-6538). Electron microscopy analysis showed that SCEO treatments decreased the number of bacterial cells (causing structural alterations) and lead to loss of the roughness in the multiple layers of the three-dimensional biofilm structure. In addition, overproduction of exopolymeric matrix was observed. SCEO at 31.2 mg/kg improved the survival of G. mellonela larvae inoculated with UFPEDA-02 isolate and reduced the bacterial load in hemolymph and melanization. In conclusion, SCEO is an antibacterial agent against S. aureus strains with different resistance phenotypes and able to disturb biofilm architecture. Our results show SCEO as a potential candidate to drug development.","authors":[{"name":"Bruno Souza Dos Santos"},{"name":"Clóvis Macedo Bezerra Filho"},{"name":"José Adelson Alves do Nascimento Junior"},{"name":"Flávia Roberta Brust"},{"name":"Patrícia Cristina Bezerra-Silva"},{"name":"Suyana Karoline Lino da Rocha"},{"name":"Karen Angeliki Krogfelt"},{"name":"Daniela Maria do Amaral Ferraz Navarro"},{"name":"Maria Tereza Dos Santos Correia"},{"name":"Thiago Henrique Napoleão"},{"name":"Luís Claudio Nascimento da Silva"},{"name":"Alexandre José Macedo"},{"name":"Márcia Vanusa da Silva"},{"name":"Patrícia Maria Guedes Paiva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial activity"},{"word":"Antibiofilm"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Volatile oil"}]},"article431":{"pmid":"30965008","title":"Effect of Relative Humidity on the Viscoelasticity of Thin Organic Films Studied by Contact Thermal Noise AFM.","abs":"Material scientists are in need of experimental techniques that facilitate a quantitative mechanical characterization of mesoscale materials and, therefore, their rational design. An example is that of thin organic films, as their performance often relates to their ability to withstand use without damage. The mechanical characterization of thin films has benefited from the emergence of the atomic force microscope (AFM). In this regard, it is of relevance that most soft materials are not elastic but viscoelastic instead. While most AFM operation modes and analysis procedures are suitable for elasticity studies, the use of AFM for quantitative viscoelastic characterizations is still a challenge. This is now an emerging topic due to recent developments in contact resonance AFM. The aim of this work was to further explore the potential of this technique by investigating its sensitivity to viscoelastic changes induced by environmental parameters, specifically humidity. Here, we show that by means of this experimental approach, it was possible to quantitatively monitor the influence of humidity on the viscoelasticity of two different thin and hydrophobic polyurethane coatings representative of those typically used to protect materials from processes like weathering and wear. The technique was sensitive even to the transition between the antiplasticizing and plasticizing effects of ambient humidity. Moreover, we showed that this was possible without the need of externally exciting the AFM cantilever or the sample, i.e., just by monitoring the Brownian motion of cantilevers, which significantly facilitates the implementation of this technique in any AFM setup.","authors":[{"name":"Juan F Gonzalez-Martinez"},{"name":"Erum Kakar"},{"name":"Stefan Erkselius"},{"name":"Nicola Rehnberg"},{"name":"Javier Sotres"}],"keywords":[]},"article432":{"pmid":"30964968","title":"The Effects of Use of a Powered and a Manual Home Oral Hygiene Regimen on Plaque and Gum Health in an Orthodontic Population.","abs":"The objective of this study was to compare the effect of two home use oral hygiene regimens on plaque, gingivitis, and gingival bleeding on subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances.","authors":[{"name":"Krishnakant Nammi"},{"name":"E Michelle Starke"},{"name":"San-San Ou"},{"name":"Marilyn Ward"},{"name":"Wendy Jenkins"},{"name":"Jeffery L Milleman"},{"name":"Kimberly R Milleman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adolescent oral hygiene"},{"word":"airfloss"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"floss"},{"word":"gingivitis"},{"word":"interdental cleaning"},{"word":"oral hygiene"},{"word":"orthodontics"},{"word":"plaque"},{"word":"power toothbrush"}]},"article433":{"pmid":"30964239","title":"Review of sterility of reused stored dermal filler.","abs":"This review is primarily focusing on the legitimate concern about bacterial contamination after reuse of stored filling syringes and its associated risk of infections.","authors":[{"name":"Mana Alharbi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"calcium hydroxylapatite"},{"word":"hyaluronic acid"},{"word":"reuse"},{"word":"safety"},{"word":"soft tissue fillers"},{"word":"sterility"}]},"article434":{"pmid":"30964013","title":"Ferulic acid encapsulated chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles attenuate quorum sensing regulated virulence and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogenic microorganism causing majority of acute hospital-acquired infections and poses a serious public health concern. The persistence of bacterial infection can be attributed to the highly synchronised cell-to-cell communication phenomenon, quorum sensing (QS) which regulates the expression of a number of virulence factors and biofilm formation which eventually imparts resistance to the conventional antimicrobial therapy. In this study, the anti-quorum sensing and anti-biofilm potential of ferulic acid encapsulated chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles (FANPs) was investigated against P. aeruginosa PAO1 and compared with native ferulic acid. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopic analysis confirmed the synthesis of FANPs with mean diameter of 215.55 nm. FANPs showed significant anti-quorum sensing activity by downregulating QS-regulated virulence factors. In addition, FANPs also significantly attenuate the swimming and swarming motility of P. aeruginosa PAO1. The anti-biofilm efficacy of FANPs as compared to native ferulic acid was established by light and confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis. The promising results of FANPs in attenuating QS highlighted the slow and sustained release of ferulic acid at the target sites with greater efficacy suggesting its application towards the development of anti-infective agents.","authors":[{"name":"Subhaswaraj Pattnaik"},{"name":"Subhashree Barik"},{"name":"Gangatharan Muralitharan"},{"name":"Siddhardha Busi"}],"keywords":[]},"article435":{"pmid":"30964006","title":"Nanomedicine for anticancer and antimicrobial treatment: an overview.","abs":"Nanoparticle-based treatment has become a potential therapeutic approach.
