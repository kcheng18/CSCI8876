Therefore, the inhibition of biofilm formation and attenuation of virulence determinants are considered as a promising solution to combat the spread of S. aureus infections. Modern trends in antibiofilm therapies have opted for the active agents that are biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic and cost-effective. Owning the aforementioned properties, chitosan, a natural N-acetylated carbohydrate biopolymer derived from chitin, has been favorably employed. Recently, the chitosan structure has been chemically modified into Chitooligosaccharides (COS) to overcome its limited solubility in water, thus widening chitosan applications in modern antibiofilm research. In the present study, we have investigated the antibacterial, antibiofilm and anti-virulence activities against S. aureus of COS of different molecular weights dissolved in neutral water.","authors":[{"name":"Fazlurrahman Khan"},{"name":"Jang-Won Lee"},{"name":"Dung T N Pham"},{"name":"Young-Mog Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial"},{"word":"S. aureus"},{"word":"anti-virulence"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"chitooligosaccharides"},{"word":"e-DNA."}]},"article1":{"pmid":"31475697","title":"Biopolymer-enriched B. subtilis NCIB 3610 biofilms exhibit increased erosion resistance.","abs":"The erosion resistance of bacterial biofilms can be a double-edged sword: it hampers the removal of undesired biofilms in biomedical settings, but it is necessary for beneficial biofilms to be used in aqueous environments for biotechnological applications. Whether or not a bacterial biofilm exhibits this material property depends on the bacterial species and the detailed composition of the biofilm matrix. Here, we demonstrate how the erosion resistance of B. subtilis NCIB 3610 biofilms can be enhanced by integrating foreign (bio)polymers into the matrix during biofilm growth. As a result of this artificial macromolecule addition, the engineered biofilm colonies show changes in their surface topography which, in turn, cause an alteration in the mode of surface superhydrophobicity. Surprisingly, the viscoelastic properties and permeability of the biofilms towards antibiotics remain unaffected. The method introduced here may present a promising strategy for engineering beneficial biofilms such, that they become more stable towards shear forces caused by flowing water but, at the same time, remain permeable to nutrients or other molecules.","authors":[{"name":"Elif N Hayta"},{"name":"Oliver Lieleg"}],"keywords":[]},"article2":{"pmid":"31475567","title":"The effects of refractory pollutants in swine wastewater on the growth of Scenedesmus sp. with biofilm attached culture.","abs":"Microalgae have been widely used for treatment of swine wastewater.

The emergence of resistant strains and its ability to form a biofilm seem to give a selective advantage to the bacterium and thus new therapeutic approaches are needed. To infect the lung, the bacterium uses several virulence factors, like LecA lectins. These proteins are involved in bacterial adhesion due to their specific interaction with carbohydrates of the host epithelial cells. The tetrameric LecA lectin specifically binds galactose residues. A new therapeutic approach is based on the development of highly affine synthetic glycoclusters able to selectively link with LecA to interfere with the natural carbohydrate-LecA interaction. In this study, we combined atomic force microscopy imaging and molecular dynamics simulations to visualize and understand the arrangements formed by LecA and five different glycoclusters. Our glycoclusters are small scaffolds characterized by a core and four branches, which terminate in a galactose residue. Depending on the nature of the core and the branches, the glycocluster-lectin interaction can be modulated and the affinity increased. We show that glycocluster-LecA arrangements highly depend on the glycocluster architecture: the core influences the rigidity of the geometry and the directionality of the branches, whereas the nature of the branch determines the compactness of the structure and the ease of binding.","authors":[{"name":"Francesca Zuttion"},{"name":"Delphine Sicard"},{"name":"Lucie Dupin"},{"name":"Gérard Vergoten"},{"name":"Camille Girard-Bock"},{"name":"Mimouna Madaoui"},{"name":"Yann Chevolot"},{"name":"Francois Morvan"},{"name":"Sébastien Vidal"},{"name":"Jean-Jacques Vasseur"},{"name":"Eliane Souteyrand"},{"name":"Magali Phaner-Goutorbe"}],"keywords":[]},"article4":{"pmid":"31474952","title":"Salt-Tolerant Halophyte Rhizosphere Bacteria Stimulate Growth of Alfalfa in Salty Soil.","abs":"Halophytes are plants that are adapted to grow in saline soils, and have been widely studied for their physiological and molecular characteristics, but little is known about their associated microbiomes. Bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere and as root endophytes of Salicornia rubra, Sarcocornia utahensis, and Allenrolfea occidentalis, three native Utah halophytes. A total of 41 independent isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. Isolates were tested for maximum salt tolerance, and some were able to grow in the presence of up to 4 M NaCl. Pigmentation, Gram stain characteristics, optimal temperature for growth, and biofilm formation of each isolate aided in species identification. Some variation in the bacterial population was observed in samples collected at different times of the year, while most of the genera were present regardless of the sampling time. Halomonas, Bacillus, and Kushneria species were consistently isolated both from the soil and as endophytes from roots of all three plant species at all collection times. Non-culturable bacterial species were analyzed by Illumina DNA sequencing. The most commonly identified bacteria were from several phyla commonly found in soil or extreme environments: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Gamma- and Delta-Proteobacteria. Isolates were tested for the ability to stimulate growth of alfalfa under saline conditions. This screening led to the identification of one Halomonas and one Bacillus isolate that, when used to inoculate young alfalfa seedlings, stimulate plant growth in the presence of 1% NaCl, a level that significantly inhibits growth of uninoculated plants. The same bacteria used in the inoculation were recovered from surface sterilized alfalfa roots, indicating the ability of the inoculum to become established as an endophyte.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, swarming is dependent upon a functional flagella and aided by the production of biosurfactants. AmrZ, a conserved transcription factor across pseudomonads, has been shown to be a global regulator of multiple genes important for virulence and ecological fitness. In this study, we expand this concept of global control to swarming motility by showing that deletion of amrZ results in a severe defect in swarming, while multicopy expression of this gene stimulates swarming of P. aeruginosa. Mechanistic studies showed that the swarming defect of an amrZ mutant does not involve changes of biosurfactant production but is associated with flagellar malfunction. The ∆amrZ mutant exhibits increased levels of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) compared to the wild-type strain, under swarming conditions. We found that the diguanylate cyclase GcbA was the main contributor to the increased accumulation of c-di-GMP observed in the ∆amrZ mutant and was a strong inhibitor of flagellar-dependent motility. Our results revealed that the GcbA-dependent inhibition of motility required the presence of two c-di-GMP receptors containing a PilZ domain: FlgZ and PA14_56180. Furthermore, the ∆amrZ mutant exhibits enhanced production of Pel polysaccharide. Epistasis analysis revealed that GcbA and the Pel polysaccharide act independently to limit swarming in ΔamrZ. Our results support a role for AmrZ in controlling swarming motility, yet another social behavior besides biofilm formation that is crucial for the ability of P. aeruginosa to colonize a variety of surfaces. The central role of AmrZ in controlling these behaviors makes it a good target for the development of treatments directed to combat P. aeruginosa infections.","authors":[{"name":"Lingli Hou"},{"name":"Alexander Debru"},{"name":"Qianqian Chen"},{"name":"Qiyu Bao"},{"name":"Kewei Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AmrZ"},{"word":"FlgZ"},{"word":"GcbA"},{"word":"PA14_56180"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"cyclic di-GMP"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"swarming motility"}]},"article6":{"pmid":"31474855","title":"Ruthenium Chloride-Induced Oxidative Cyclization of Trans-Resveratrol to (±)-ε-Viniferin and Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Activity Against Streptococcus pneumoniae.","abs":"Polyphenol ε-viniferin (","authors":[{"name":"Mukesh Kumar Yadav"},{"name":"Karabasappa Mailar"},{"name":"Jagadeesh Nagarajappa Masagalli"},{"name":"Sung-Won Chae"},{"name":"Jae-Jun Song"},{"name":"Won Jun Choi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus pneumoniae"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"antimicobacterial"},{"word":"cell membrane"},{"word":"ε-viniferin"}]},"article7":{"pmid":"31474198","title":"Possible mechanism of efficient mainstream partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) in hybrid bioreactors (IFAS).","abs":"An explanation of possible mechanism of efficient PN/A in hybrid bioreactors was presented.

In addition, cell envelope lipids are mycobacterial virulence factors. Cell envelope lipid biosynthesis is the target of a number of frontline tuberculosis treatments and has been the focus of much research. However, the transport mechanisms by which these lipids reach the mycomembrane remain poorly understood. Many envelope lipids are exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space via the mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) family of proteins. In other bacteria, lipoproteins can contribute to outer membrane biogenesis through direct binding of substrates and/or protein-protein associations with extracytoplasmic biosynthetic enzymes. In this report, we investigate whether the lipoprotein LpqN plays a similar role in mycobacteria. Using a genetic two-hybrid approach, we demonstrate that LpqN interacts with periplasmic loop domains of the MmpL3 and MmpL11 transporters that export mycolic acid-containing cell envelope lipids. We observe that LpqN also interacts with secreted cell envelope biosynthetic enzymes such as Ag85A via pulldown assays. The X-ray crystal structures of LpqN and LpqN bound to dodecyl-trehalose suggest that LpqN directly binds trehalose monomycolate, the MmpL3 and Ag85A substrate. Finally, we observe altered lipid profiles of the ΔlpqN mutant during biofilm maturation, pointing toward a possible physiological role for the protein. The results of this study suggest that LpqN may act as a membrane fusion protein, connecting MmpL transporters with periplasmic proteins, and provide general insight into the role of lipoproteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell envelope biogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Geoff C Melly"},{"name":"Haley Stokas"},{"name":"Jennifer L Dunaj"},{"name":"Fong Fu Hsu"},{"name":"Malligarjunan Rajavel"},{"name":"Chih-Chia Su"},{"name":"Edward W Yu"},{"name":"Georgiana E Purdy"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"word":"cell envelope"},{"word":"crystal structure"},{"word":"glycolipid"},{"word":"lipid transport"},{"word":"lipoprotein"},{"word":"membrane transport"},{"word":"periplasm"},{"word":"trehalose"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article17":{"pmid":"31471140","title":"Preparation, partial characterization and biological activity of exopolysaccharides produced from Lactobacillus fermentum S1.","abs":"A high slime-producing Lactobacillus fermentum strain (named as L. fermentum S1) was isolated from traditional fermented Fuyuan pickle, which was made of white turnip and collected from Fuyuan county, Yunnan province, China.

Thus, inulin, biopolymers such as agar and sodium alginate, and glycerol were used to develop a single use edible material for food packaging.

For inulin-based films, the results highlight improvements not only in physical properties (homogeneity, well-defined margins, light sweet taste, good optical properties, high solubility capacity or, as in the case of some samples, complete solubilization), but also superior mechanical properties (samples with high inulin content into composition had high tensile strength and extremely high elongation values). Even after three months of developing, the values of mechanical properties indicate a strong material. The optimization establishes the composition necessary to obtain a strong and completely water-soluble material.

It was important that the new peptides displayed low impact on bacterial resistance development. In addition, the antimicrobial activities were not significantly influenced by a physiological salt environment. They also presented high stability in the presence of protease or serum. Almost all of the new peptides had better selectivity towards anionic bacterial membranes over zwitterionic mammalian cell membranes. Moreover, the new peptides displayed synergistic or additive effects when used together with the antibiotics rifampicin and polymyxin B.

Furthermore, outer/inner membrane permeabilization and cytoplasmic membrane depolarization experiments revealed that the new peptides had strong membrane permeabilization and depolarization. Confocal laser scanning microscopy, flow cytometry analysis and scanning electron microscopy further demonstrated that the new peptides could damage the integrity of the bacterial membrane.

We found that mice infected with the stationary phase and biofilm bacteria, which were enriched with persisters, produced more pronounced skin lesions that took longer to heal, and had more severe skin pathology and higher bacterial load than mice infected with log phase bacteria.

Given that common plastics are derived from fossil fuels, one would expect that Plastispheres should be enriched with obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (OHCB). So far, though, different polymer types do not seem to exert a strong effect on determining the composition of the Plastisphere, and putative biodegrading bacteria are only found as rare taxa within these biofilms. Here, we show through 16S rRNA gene sequencing that the enrichment of a prominent OHCB member on weathered and non-weathered polyethylene only occurred at early stages of colonization (i.e., after 2 days of incubation in coastal marine water; 5.8% and 3.7% of relative abundance, respectively, vs. 0.6% on glass controls). As biofilms matured, these bacteria decreased in relative abundance on all materials (< 0.3% after 9 days). Apart from OHCB, weathered polyethylene strongly enriched for other distinct organisms during early stages of colonization, such as a specific member of the Roseobacter group and a member of the genus Aestuariibacter (median 26.9% and 1.8% of the community, respectively), possibly as a consequence of the availability of short-oxidized chains generated from weathering. Our results demonstrate that Plastispheres can vary in accordance with the weathering state of the material and that very early colonizing communities are enriched with taxa that can potentially degrade hydrocarbons. Given the lack of persistent enrichment and overall community convergence between materials over time, common non-hydrolysable polymers might not serve as an important source of carbon for mature Plastispheres once the labile substrates generated from weathering have been depleted.","authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Erni-Cassola"},{"name":"Robyn J Wright"},{"name":"Matthew I Gibson"},{"name":"Joseph A Christie-Oleza"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Early biofilm"},{"word":"Marine plastic pollution"},{"word":"Microbial colonization"},{"word":"Plastisphere"},{"word":"Weathered polyethylene"}]},"article53":{"pmid":"31463403","title":"Effectiveness and safety of low-concentrated ozonized water for the reduction of contamination in dental unit water lines.","abs":"Contamination of dental unit waterlines (DUWL) with heterotrophic bacteria can cause problems in immune compromised patients (aged, tumor and organ transplantation-patients).

Some of the most studied bacterial FAs are the curli protein CsgA, expressed in a wide range of bacteria, and FapC, produced mainly by members of the Pseudomonas genus. Though unrelated, both CsgA and FapC contain imperfect repeats believed to drive the formation of amyloid fibrils. While much is known about CsgA biogenesis and fibrillation, the mechanism of FapC fibrillation remains less explored. Here, we show that removing the three imperfect repeats of FapC (FapC ΔR1R2R3) slows down the fibrillation but does not prevent it. The increased lag phase seen for FapC ΔR1R2R3 allows for disulfide bond formation, which further delays fibrillation. Remarkably, these disulfide-bonded species of FapC ΔR1R2R3 also significantly delay the fibrillation of human α-synuclein, a key protein in Parkinson's disease pathology. This attenuation of α-synuclein fibrillation was not seen for the reduced form of FapC ΔR1R2R3.

The genes encoding for motility systems (flaA, flaB, and flgA) were downregulated by all phytochemicals (P < 0.05). The expression of stress response (cosR, ahpC) and cell surface modifying genes (waaF) was reduced by EG. LC-MS/MS based proteomic analysis revealed that TC, EG, and CR significantly downregulated the expression of NapA protein required for oxidative stress response. The expression of chaperone protein DnaK and bacterioferritin required for biofilm formation was reduced by TC and CR. Scanning electron microscopy revealed disruption of biofilm architecture and loss of extracellular polymeric substances after treatment. Results suggest that TC, EG, and CR could be used as a natural disinfectant for controlling C. jejuni biofilms in processing areas.","authors":[{"name":"Basanta R Wagle"},{"name":"Abhinav Upadhyay"},{"name":"Indu Upadhyaya"},{"name":"Sandip Shrestha"},{"name":"Komala Arsi"},{"name":"Rohana Liyanage"},{"name":"Kumar Venkitanarayanan"},{"name":"Dan J Donoghue"},{"name":"Annie M Donoghue"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. jejuni"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gene/protein expression"},{"word":"inactivation"},{"word":"inhibition"},{"word":"phytochemicals"}]},"article77":{"pmid":"31456768","title":"The Tol-Pal System of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli Is Responsible for Optimal Internalization Into and Aggregation Within Bladder Epithelial Cells, Colonization of the Urinary Tract of Mice, and Bacterial Motility.","abs":"Urinary tracts infection (UTI) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is a common infectious disease. With the shortage of new antimicrobial agents, the increase in UPEC resistance to commonly used drugs, such as fluoroquinolones and β-lactams including carbapenems is a critical issue. UPEC invades urinary tract cells, where it aggregates, and subsequently, forms biofilm-like multicellular colonies termed intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). This process allows the bacteria to establish infections and so may be a good potential target for new drugs to treat infections. Here, we show that deletion of the tolB gene, encoding a protein of the Tol-Pal system that was originally characterized as a protein complex for colicin uptake and maintenance of the outer membrane, decreases the level of bacterial internalization into and aggregation within cultured bladder epithelial cells and also inhibits the colonization of mice urinary tracts. The tolB mutant also exhibited defective motility because of impaired flagellum syntheses. The fliC and motA mutants, which are non-motile strains, also exhibited lower levels of bacterial internalization and aggregation than their wild-type parent. Additional deletion of tolB in the fliC mutant did not further decrease these, suggesting that the attenuated virulence of the tolB mutant is a result of defective motility. The tolA, tolQ, tolR, and pal mutants that lack other members of the Tol-Pal system also exhibited lower levels of motility and aggregation within bladder epithelial cells compared to their wild-type parent. These combined results suggest another role of the Tol-Pal system, i.e., that it is responsible for optimal internalization, aggregation followed by IBC formation within urinary tract cells, and bacterial motility.","authors":[{"name":"Hidetada Hirakawa"},{"name":"Kazutomo Suzue"},{"name":"Kumiko Kurabayashi"},{"name":"Haruyoshi Tomita"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"invasion"},{"word":"pyelonephritis"},{"word":"urinary tract infection (UTI)"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article78":{"pmid":"31456762","title":"Typical and Atypical Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli Are Both Virulent in the Galleria mellonella Model.","abs":"Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an emerging pathotype responsible for acute and persistent diarrhea.

In this study the following effects of Chenopodium ambrosioides extract (CAE) were investigated: action against biofilms of Candida albicans, its cytotoxic potential, and changes caused in acrylic resin. The CAE was characterized by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The susceptibility of C. albicans to CAE was investigated by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MIC and MFC) tests. Acrylic resin disks were fabricated, and C. albicans biofilms were developed on these for 48 h. Afterward the disks were immersed for 10 min in: PBS (Negative Control); 1% Sodium Hypochlorite (1% SH, Positive Control) or CAE at MIC or 5xMIC. The biofilms were investigated relative to counts and metabolic activity. The cytotoxic potential in keratinocytes and fibroblasts was verified by MTT test. Change in color and roughness of the acrylic resin was analyzed after 28 days of immersion in CAE. The data were analyzed by the ANOVA considering a 5% level of significance. The main compounds detected by HPLC were kaempferol and quercetin. Both MIC and MFC obtained the value of 0.25 mg/mL. The MIC was sufficient to significantly reduce the counts and activity of the biofilm cells (p < 0.0001), while 5xMIC resulted in almost complete eradication, similar to 1% SH. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts exposed to the MIC and 5xMIC presented cell viability similar to that of the Control Group (p > 0.05). No important changes in acrylic resin color and roughness were detected, even after 28 days.

In this context, intrinsic properties emerging from microbial interactions, such as efficient organization optimizing growth and activities in multispecies biofilms, may become the object of fitness selection. However, little is known on the nature of underlying interspecies interactions during establishment of a predictable spatial organization within multispecies biofilms. We present a comparative metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial strains residing in triple-species and four-species biofilms, aiming at deciphering molecular mechanisms underpinning bacterial interactions responsible of the remarkably enhanced biomass production and associated typical spatial organization they display. Metatranscriptomic profiles concurred with changes in micro-site occupation in response to the addition/removal of a single species, being driven by both cooperation, competition, and facilitation processes. We conclude that the enhanced biomass production of the four-species biofilm is an intrinsic community property emerging from finely tuned space optimization achieved through concerted antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, where each species occupies a defined micro-site favoring its own growth. Our results further illustrate how molecular mechanisms can be better interpreted when supported by visual imaging of actual microscopic spatial organization, and we propose phenotypic adaptation selected by social interactions as molecular mechanisms stabilizing microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Wenzheng Liu"},{"name":"Samuel Jacquiod"},{"name":"Asker Brejnrod"},{"name":"Jakob Russel"},{"name":"Mette Burmølle"},{"name":"Søren J Sørensen"}],"keywords":[]},"article82":{"pmid":"31455648","title":"Evolutionary Perspectives on the Moonlighting Functions of Bacterial Factors That Support Actin-Based Motility.","abs":"Various bacterial pathogens display an intracellular lifestyle and spread from cell to cell through actin-based motility (ABM).

Eighty-three adults of different caries status were recruited and assigned to treatment with Arg or F for 12 wk. Caries lesions were diagnosed using International Caries Detection and Assessment System II, and plaque samples were collected from caries-free and carious tooth surfaces. Taxonomic profiles were obtained by HOMINGS (Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing), and plaque metabolism was assessed by the levels of arginine catabolism via the arginine deiminase pathway (ADS), acidogenicity, and global metabolomics. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis, analysis of variance, and random forest tests were used to distinguish metabolic profiles. Of the 509 active lesions diagnosed at baseline, 70 (14%) were inactive after 12 wk. Generalized linear model showed that enamel lesions were significantly more likely to become inactive compared to dentin lesions (P < 0.0001), but no difference was found when treatment with Arg was compared to F (P = 0.46). Arg significantly increased plaque ADS activity (P = 0.031) and plaque pH values after incubation with glucose (P = 0.001). F reduced plaque lactate production from endogenous sources (P = 0.02).

Chemical cues could improve the finding of suitable habitats for settlement. Thus, the effects of leaves of P. oceanica and biofilms of the diatom Cocconeis scutellum parva, seasonally abundant in the leaf epiphytic stratum, were investigated along with the effect of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) extracted from the epiphytic diatom. The physical induction with P. oceanica accelerated larval settlement, stimulating an earlier and faster metamorphosis of larvae. C. scutellum parva produced a weaker effect on settlement; however, diatom's VOCs had evident influence and accelerated metamorphosis and settlement. We concluded that such chemical cues as the VOCs produced by epiphytic diatoms, reinforce the effect of physical cues for the identification of suitable settlement locations for this shrimp.","authors":[{"name":"Valerio Zupo"},{"name":"Mirko Mutalipassi"},{"name":"Francesca Glaviano"},{"name":"Anna Cecilia Buono"},{"name":"Antonio Cannavacciuolo"},{"name":"Patrick Fink"}],"keywords":[]},"article104":{"pmid":"31451623","title":"The Host Immune System Facilitates Disseminated Staphylococcus aureus Disease Due to Phagocytic Attraction to Candida albicans during Coinfection: a Case of Bait and Switch.","abs":"Invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections account for 15 to 50% of fatal bloodstream infections annually.

The resistance of E. faecalis to several classes of antibiotics and its capacity to form biofilms cause serious therapeutic problems. Here, we report the isolation of several bacteriophages that target E. faecalis strains isolated from the oral cavity of patients suffering root canal infections. All phages isolated were Siphoviridae with similar tail lengths (200 to 250 nm) and icosahedral heads. The genome sequences of three isolated phages were highly conserved with the exception of predicted tail protein genes that diverge in sequence, potentially reflecting the host range. The properties of the phage with the broadest host range (SHEF2) were further characterized. We show that this phage requires interaction with components of the major and variant region enterococcal polysaccharide antigen to engage in lytic infection. Finally, we explored the therapeutic potential of this phage and show that it can eradicate E. faecalis biofilms formed in vitro on a standard polystyrene surface but also on a cross-sectional tooth slice model of endodontic infection.

CM15 ATCUN variants, when combined with Meropenem, streptomycin, or chloramphenicol, showed synergistic effects against E. coli (KpC+ 1812446) biofilms. Motif addition also reduced the hemolytic activity of the wild-type AMP and improved the survival rate of mice in a systemic infection model. The dependence of these bioactivities on the particular amino acids of the ATCUN motif highlights the possible use of size, charge, and hydrophobicity to fine-tune AMP biological function. Our data indicate that incorporating metal-binding motifs into peptide sequences leads to synthetic variants with modified biological properties. These principles may be applied to augment the activities of other peptide sequences.","authors":[{"name":"Caleb M Agbale"},{"name":"Justice K Sarfo"},{"name":"Isaac K Galyuon"},{"name":"Samuel A Juliano"},{"name":"Gislaine G O Silva"},{"name":"Danieli F Buccini"},{"name":"Marlon H Cardoso"},{"name":"Marcelo D T Torres"},{"name":"Alfredo M Angeles-Boza"},{"name":"Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez"},{"name":"Octavio L Franco"}],"keywords":[]},"article122":{"pmid":"31448524","title":"Efficacy of oregano and rosemary essential oils to affect morphology and membrane functions of noncultivable sessile cells of Salmonella Enteritidis 86 in biofilms formed on stainless steel.","abs":"This study evaluated the efficacy of essential oil from Origanum vulgare L.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae duodenoscope related infections have been described by the Center for Disease Control and the US Food and Drug Administration consequently to outbreaks occurring in the United States. These evidences suggested that improved microbiological surveillance and endoscope design optimization could represent valid tools to improve infection control. At this aim, in this study an example of duodenoscope microbiological surveillance and reprocessing improvement analyzing strains component of bacterial biofilm by phylogenetic analysis has been proposed. From September 2016 to December 2017, duodenoscope instruments were subjected to microbial surveillance by post-reprocessing cultures of liquid collected by internal channels of instruments after injection and aspiration cycles and membrane filtration. During surveillance seventeen Klebsiella pneumoniae, of which 10/17 (58.8%) MDR and KPC strains were collected from duodenoscope instruments plus one MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae strain from the rectal swab performed before ERCP procedure in an inpatient. The surveillance allowed evidencing potential failure of reprocessing procedure and performing consequent reprocessing improvements including the contaminated instruments quarantine until their negativity. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequence of duodenoscope strains plus inpatients MDR strains, showed intermixing between duodenoscopes and inpatients, as evidenced by minimum spanning tree and time-scale Maximum Clade Credibility tree. In minimum spanning tree, three groups have been evidenced. Group I including Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated from inpatients before microbiological surveillance adoption; group II including intermixed Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from inpatients and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from duedonoscopes and group III including Klebsiella pneumoniae strains exclusively from duedonoscope instruments. In the Maximum Credibility Tree, a statistically supported cluster including two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from duedonoscope instruments and one strains isolated from an inpatient was showed. From the first microbiologic surveillance performed on September 2016 and after the reprocessing improvement adoption, none MDR or susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae strain was isolated in the following surveillance periods. In conclusion, these results should encourage hospital board to perform microbiological surveillance of duodenoscopes as well as of patients, by rectal swabs culture, and rapid molecular testing for antimicrobial resistance before any endoscopic invasive procedure.","authors":[{"name":"Massimo Ciccozzi"},{"name":"Eleonora Cella"},{"name":"Alessia Lai"},{"name":"Lucia De Florio"},{"name":"Francesca Antonelli"},{"name":"Marta Fogolari"},{"name":"Francesco Maria Di Matteo"},{"name":"Margherita Pizzicannella"},{"name":"Benedetta Colombo"},{"name":"Giordano Dicuonzo"},{"name":"Silvia Angeletti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"endoscope"},{"word":"infection control"},{"word":"microbiological surveillance"},{"word":"phylogeny"}]},"article126":{"pmid":"31448244","title":"Commensal and Pathogenic Biofilms Alter Toll-Like Receptor Signaling in Reconstructed Human Gingiva.","abs":"The balance between the host and microbe is pivotal for oral health. A dysbiotic oral microbiome and the subsequent host inflammatory response are causes for the most common dental problems, such as periodontitis and caries. Classically, toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known to play important roles in host-microbe interactions by recognizing pathogens and activating innate immunity. However, emerging evidence suggests that commensals may also exploit TLRs to induce tolerance to the benefit of the host, especially in oral mucosa which is heavily colonized by abundant microbes. How TLRs and downstream signaling events are affected by different oral microbial communities to regulate host responses is still unknown. To compare such human host-microbe interactions in vitro, we exposed a reconstructed human gingiva (RHG) to commensal or pathogenic (gingivitis, cariogenic) multi-species oral biofilms cultured from human saliva. These biofilms contain in vivo like phylogenic numbers and typical bacterial genera. After 24 h biofilm exposure, TLR protein and gene expression of 84 TLR pathway related genes were investigated. Commensal and pathogenic biofilms differentially regulated TLR protein expression. Commensal biofilm up-regulated the transcription of a large group of key genes, which are involved in TLR signaling, including TLR7, the MyD88-dependent pathway (CD14, MyD88, TIRAP, TRAF6, IRAKs), MyD88-independent pathway (TAB1, TBK1, IRF3), and their downstream signaling pathways (NF-κB and MAPK pathways). In comparison, gingivitis biofilm activated fewer genes (e.g., TLR4) and cariogenic biofilm suppressed CD14, IRAK4, and IRF3 transcription. Fluorescence in situ hybridization staining showed the rRNA of the topically applied and invaded bacteria, and histology showed that the biofilms had no obvious detrimental effect on RHG morphology. These results show an important role of TLR signaling pathways in regulating host-microbe interactions: when a sterile gingival tissue is exposed to commensals, a strong immune activation occurs which may prime the host against potential challenges in order to maintain oral host-microbe homeostasis. In contrast, pathogenic biofilms stimulate a weaker immune response which might facilitate immune evasion thus enabling pathogens to penetrate undetected into the tissues.","authors":[{"name":"Lin Shang"},{"name":"Dongmei Deng"},{"name":"Jeroen Kees Buskermolen"},{"name":"Sanne Roffel"},{"name":"Marleen Marga Janus"},{"name":"Bastiaan Philip Krom"},{"name":"Wim Crielaard"},{"name":"Susan Gibbs"}],"keywords":[{"word":"TLR"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gingiva"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"organotypic 3D culture"}]},"article127":{"pmid":"31448149","title":"Resistance mechanism and proteins in Aspergillus species against antifungal agents.","abs":"Aspergillus species contain pathogenic and opportunistic fungal pathogens which have the potential to cause mycosis (invasive aspergillosis) in humans.

Despite these relevant implications, no information is currently available on the architecture of P. ostreatus-based dual biofilms. In addition to this, there is a limited amount of information regarding the estimation of the temporal changes in the relative abundances of the partners in such binary systems. To address these issues, a dual biofilm model system with this fungus was prepared by using Pseudomonas alcaliphila 34 as the bacterial partner due to its very fast biofilm-forming ability. The application of the bacterial inoculum to already settled fungal biofilm on a polystyrene surface coated with hydroxyapatite was the most efficient approach to the production of the mixed system the ultrastructure of which was investigated by a multi-microscopy approach. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the adhesion of bacterial cells onto the mycelial cell wall appeared to be mediated by the presence of an abundant layer of extracellular matrix (ECM). Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that ECM filaments of bacterial origin formed initially a reticular structure that assumed a tabular semblance after 72 h, thus overshadowing the underlying mycelial network. Across the thickness of the mixed biofilms, the presence of an extensive network of channels with large aggregates of viable bacteria located on the edges of their lumina was found by confocal laser scanning microscopy; on the outermost biofilm layer, a significant fraction of dead bacterial cells was evident.

C. jejuni is a leading cause of foodborne gastroenteritis, and these infections are sometimes associated with the development of post-infection sequelae such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Flagella are considered a primary virulence factor in C. jejuni, as these organelles are required for pathogenicity-related phenotypes including motility, biofilm formation, host cell interactions, and host colonization. The post-transcriptional regulator CsrA regulates the expression of the major flagellin FlaA by binding to flaA mRNA and repressing its translation. Additionally, CsrA has previously been shown to regulate 120-150 proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. The amino acid sequence of C. jejuni CsrA is significantly different from that of Escherichia coli CsrA, and no previous research has defined the amino acids of C. jejuni CsrA that are critical for RNA binding. In this study, we used in vitro SELEX to identify the consensus RNA sequence mAwGGAs to which C. jejuni CsrA binds with high affinity. We performed saturating site-directed mutagenesis on C. jejuni CsrA and assessed the regulatory activity of these mutant proteins, using a reporter system encoding the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) upstream of flaA linked translationally to the C. jejuni astA gene. These assays allowed us to identify 19 amino acids that were involved in RNA binding by CsrA, with many but not all of these amino acids clustered in predicted beta strands that are involved in RNA binding by E. coli CsrA. Decreased flaA mRNA binding by mutant CsrA proteins L2A and A36V was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

Given the continuing debate on whether substrate-specific properties or environmental factors prevail in shaping biofilm assemblages on microplastics, we examined the influence of substrate vs. spatial factors in the development of bacterial assemblages on polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), wood, and seston and in the free-living fraction. Further, the selective colonization of microplastics by potential pathogens was investigated because among the bacterial species found in microplastic-associated biofilms are potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. Due to their persistence and great dispersal potential, microplastics could act as vectors for these potential pathogens and for biofilm assemblages in general. Incubation experiments with these substrates were conducted for 7 days during a summer cruise along the eastern Baltic Sea coastline in waters covering a salinity gradient of 4.5-9 PSU. Bacterial assemblages were analyzed using 16S rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing, distance-based redundancy analyses, and the linear discriminant analysis effect size method to identify taxa that were significantly more abundant on the plastics. The results showed that the sample type was the most important factor structuring bacterial assemblages overall. Surface properties were less significant in differentiating attached biofilms on PE, PS, and wood; instead, environmental factors, mainly salinity, prevailed. A potential role for inorganic-nutrient limitations in surface-specific attachment was identified as well. Alphaproteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae, Devosiaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae) and Gammaproteobacteria (Alteromonadaceae and Pseudomonas) were distinctive for the PE- and PS-associated biofilms. Vibrio was more abundant on the PE and PS biofilms than on seston, but its abundances were highest on wood and positively correlated with salinity. These results corroborate earlier findings that microplastics constitute a habitat for biofilm-forming microorganisms distinct from seston, but less from wood. In contrast to earlier reports of low Vibrio numbers on microplastics, these results also suggest that vibrios are early colonizers of surfaces in general. Spatial as well as temporal dynamics should therefore be considered when assessing the potential of microplastics to serve as vectors for bacterial assemblages and putative pathogens, as these parameters are major drivers of biofilm diversity.","authors":[{"name":"Katharina Kesy"},{"name":"Sonja Oberbeckmann"},{"name":"Bernd Kreikemeyer"},{"name":"Matthias Labrenz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Baltic Sea"},{"word":"Sphingomonadaceae"},{"word":"Vibrio"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"microplastics"},{"word":"salinity gradient"}]},"article134":{"pmid":"31447567","title":"A case of persistent bacteraemia by Ralstonia mannitolilytica and Ralstonia pickettii in an intensive care unit.","abs":"The Ralstonia spp. genus is a group of non-fermentative, Gram-negative bacteria often resistant to many antibiotics, which are emerging as opportunistic pathogens frequently associated with infections in hospital settings.

Metagenomic analyses further revealed microplastic biofilm with broad-spectrum and distinctive resistome. Specifically, according to taxonomic annotation of ARG microbial hosts, two opportunisitic human pathogens (Pseudomonas monteilii, Pseudomonas mendocina) and one plant pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae) were detected only in the microplastic biofilm, but not in biofilms formed on natural substrates. Our findings suggest that microplastic is a novel microbial niche and may serve as a vector for ARGs and pathogens to new environment in river water, generating freshwater environmental risk and exerting adverse impacts on human health.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaojian Wu"},{"name":"Jie Pan"},{"name":"Meng Li"},{"name":"Yao Li"},{"name":"Mark Bartlam"},{"name":"Yingying Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance gene"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Metagenomics"},{"word":"Microplastic"},{"word":"Pathogen"}]},"article141":{"pmid":"31444209","title":"Diguanylate Cyclases and Phosphodiesterases Required for Basal-Level c-di-GMP in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as Revealed by Systematic Phylogenetic and Transcriptomic Analyses.","abs":"Cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is an important second messenger involved in bacterial switching from motile to sessile lifestyles.

The control of biofilm formation and extracellular polymeric substance production by the synergistic combination was quantified in well plate assay. The effect of copper oxide nanoparticles on the viability of human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of amoxyclav were 70 μg/mL and 140 μg/mL, respectively, against Proteus mirabilis and 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL, respectively, against Staphylococcus aureus. The synergistic combination of amoxyclav with copper oxide nanoparticles reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of amoxyclav by 16-fold against P. mirabilis and 32-fold against S. aureus. Above 17.5 μg/mL, amoxyclav exhibited additive activity with copper oxide nanoparticles against P. mirabilis. The time-kill assay showed the efficacy of the synergistic combination on the complete inhibition of P. mirabilis and S. aureus within 20 h and 24 h, respectively, whereas amoxyclav and copper oxide nanoparticles did not inhibit P. mirabilis and S. aureus until 48 h. The synergistic combination of amoxyclav with copper oxide nanoparticles significantly reduced the biofilm formed by P. mirabilis and S. aureus by 85% and 93%, respectively.

Materials and Methods: A total of 268 water samples were collected from apartment buildings, hotels, and public buildings. Detection of Legionella spp. was performed in accordance with ISO 11731:2017 standard. Three different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols were used to identify FLA. Results: Occurrence of Legionella varied from an average of 12.5% in cold water samples with the most frequent occurrence observed in hot water, in areas receiving untreated groundwater, where 54.0% of the samples were Legionella positive. The occurrence of FLA was significantly higher. On average, 77.2% of samples contained at least one genus of FLA and, depending on the type of sample, the occurrence of FLA could reach 95%.

To investigate the toxicity of CBZ to aquatic key organisms in a more complex and environmentally relevant scenario, we conducted a 32-day multiple-stress experiment in artificial indoor streams. We exposed the non-biting midge Chironomus riparius, the blackworm Lumbriculus variegatus, and the New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum to 80 and 400 μg CBZ/L in six artificial indoor streams. In addition to hydraulic stress, species' interaction, and low organic content in the sediment, organisms were co-exposed to the herbicide terbutryn (TBY) as a second chemical stressor at a concentration of 6 μg/L. The exposure to CBZ under multiple stress conditions resulted in a 10- to more than 25-fold higher toxicity in C. riparius and P. antipodarum when compared to a previous, standardized laboratory experiment. The co-exposure to TBY enhanced the adverse effects of CBZ on snails (reduced production of embryos).

The emergence of C. riparius declined at a CBZ concentration of 400 μg/L (without the co-exposure to TBY) and at 80 μg/L in combination with TBY.

However, no one has studied whether these same trends hold at the initial stages of aggregation. We use experiments and numerical calculations to investigate the polymer-induced depletion aggregation of motile Escherichia coli in polyethylene glycol solutions on short experimental timescales (∼10 min). Our work reveals that in the semi-dilute polymer concentration regime and at short timescales, in contrast to what is found at steady state, bacterial motility actually enhances aggregate formation by increasing the collision rate in viscous environments.

These postulates have been shown not to be correct in some cases including the inability of some microbes to grow in the culture medium, viruses, or anaerobic bacteria. Today, due to some new scientific facts like the social behaviors of bacteria, such as quorum sensing, there are serious problems regarding the definition of whole microbial effects; these include microbiomes and viromes, as well as their interaction with the existing eukaryotics, the complicated relations between bacteria, L-forms, and cell wall-deficient bacteria, and the important role of microbes in the development of non-infectious diseases. So, the application of Koch's postulates to explain the causal relationships between host-microbes could be difficult. Therefore, nowadays, even the molecular Koch's postulates are not accountable.

To understand the pathogenic roles of the three tad loci during infection, we constructed single, double and triple tad loci deletion mutants. Interestingly, only the Δtad123 triple mutant cells exhibited significantly decreased lethality in mice. Ultrastructural observations revealed short, thin filamentous projections disappeared on the Δtad123 mutant cells. Since the pilin was paradoxically non-immunogenic, a V5 tag was fused to Flp to visualize the pilin protein by using immunogold EM and immunofluorescence microscopy. The Δtad123 mutant cells showed attenuated host cell adhesion, decreased biofilm formation, delayed RtxA1 exotoxin secretion and subsequently impaired translocation across the intestinal epithelium compared to wild type, which could be partially complemented with each wild type operon. The Δtad123 mutant was susceptible to complement-mediated bacteriolysis, predominantly via the alternative pathway, suggesting stealth hiding role of the Tad pili. Complement depletion by treating with anti-C5 antibody rescued the viable count of Δtad123 in infected mouse bloodstream to the level comparable to wild type strain.

What are the implications of such spatial organization for biodiversity? To address this question, we developed and analyzed a model of territorial resource competition. In the model, all species obey trade-offs inspired by biophysical constraints on metabolism; the species occupy nonoverlapping territories, while nutrients diffuse in space. We find that the nutrient diffusion time is an important control parameter for both biodiversity and the timescale of population dynamics. Interestingly, fast nutrient diffusion allows the populations of some species to fluctuate to zero, leading to extinctions. Moreover, territorial competition spontaneously gives rise to both multistability and the Allee effect (in which a minimum population is required for survival), so that small perturbations can have major ecological effects. While the assumption of trade-offs allows for the coexistence of more species than the number of nutrients-thus violating the principle of competitive exclusion-overall biodiversity is curbed by the domination of oligotroph species. Importantly, in contrast to well-mixed models, spatial structure renders diversity robust to inequalities in metabolic trade-offs.

Lab experiments showed that growth medium with excess of organic carbon (C) but with low nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accelerated the formation of bacterial biofilm. Balancing C to N and P ratios by adding N and P to growth medium increased the proliferation of free-living cells but reduced attached form of bacteria as biofilm. The cell excretion of excess C in the form of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) was considered as a strategy for nutrient storage for future use. Cell enzyme activity assays indicated some of the bacteria had enhanced enzyme activities to degrade polysaccharides in the absence of organic C in growth medium, possibly using EPS in the biofilm. A year-long field study indicated that accelerated biofouling of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes was associated with the elevated content of total organic carbon (TOC) in the intake seawater. Adding N and P to the intake seawater to balance the increase of TOC resulted in reduction of membrane biofouling. Microbial community analysis of the biofouling layer using 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated biofouling communities varied with seasonal changes. Dosing of N and P did not induce dramatic changes in the fouling microbial community growing on the membrane surface. The outcome of this work implies that membrane biofouling associated with the elevated concentration of TOC in intake seawater is caused by imbalance of C:N:P in the source seawater which occurs often during algal blooms.

The small size of the CDs endows them with the penetration ability into the interior of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial biofilms, which enables excellent fluorescence imaging of the biofilms. Due to the different surfaces of the two types of bacteria, the positively charged CDs selectively interact with the more negatively charged Gram-positive bacteria via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, which inactivates the Gram-positive bacteria and ultimately eradicates the Gram-positive bacterial biofilms. In addition, we synthesize a new type of quaternized CDs without long alkyl chains (termed TTPAC CDs), and validate that the long alkyl chains potentiate the hydrophobic adhesion between CDs and Gram-positive bacteria. Meanwhile, the crystal violet staining results reveal that the cationic CDs inhibit the formation of Gram-positive bacterial biofilms. Collectively, our work highlights the feasibility of using cationic and ultrasmall metal-free CDs to eliminate and inhibit Gram-positive bacterial biofilms, which represents a highly effective strategy to cope with refractory biofilm-associated infections.","authors":[{"name":"Huan-Huan Ran"},{"name":"Xiaotong Cheng"},{"name":"Yan-Wen Bao"},{"name":"Xian-Wu Hua"},{"name":"Ge Gao"},{"name":"Xiaodong Zhang"},{"name":"Yao-Wen Jiang"},{"name":"Ya-Xuan Zhu"},{"name":"Fu-Gen Wu"}],"keywords":[]},"article190":{"pmid":"31432478","title":"Structure and Fluorescence Intensity Measurements in Biofilms.","abs":"Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is one of the most relevant technologies for studying biofilms in situ.

One bacterium that undergoes extensive shape-shifting in response to changing growth conditions is the freshwater bacterium Caulobacter crescentus When incubated for an extended time in stationary phase, a subpopulation of C. crescentus forms viable filamentous cells with a helical shape. Here, we demonstrated that this stationary-phase-induced filamentation results from downregulation of most critical cell cycle regulators and a consequent block of DNA replication and cell division while cell growth and metabolism continue. Our data indicate that this response is triggered by a combination of three stresses caused by prolonged growth in complex medium, namely, the depletion of phosphate, alkaline pH, and an excess of ammonium. We found that these conditions are experienced in the summer months during algal blooms near the surface in freshwater lakes, a natural habitat of C. crescentus, suggesting that filamentous growth is a common response of C. crescentus to its environment. Finally, we demonstrate that when grown in a biofilm, the filamentous cells can reach beyond the surface of the biofilm and potentially access nutrients or release progeny.

In Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae), a Gram-negative pathogen responsible for the cholera disease, biofilm-like aggregates are important for the pathogenesis and disease transmission.

In V. cholerae, flagella are essential for the initial step of biofilm formation, allowing the bacteria to swim and to detect a surface. In this study, we explored the effect of polymyxin B (PmB), a cationic bacterial antimicrobial peptide, on biofilm formation in pathogenic V. cholerae strains belonging to the O1 and O139 serotypes. We found that sub-inhibitory concentration of PmB induces a reduction of the biofilm formation by V. cholerae O1 and O139. Experiment on preformed biofilm demonstrated that the biofilm formation inhibition occurs at the initial step of biofilm formation, where the flagella are essential. We further characterize the effect of PmB on V. cholerae flagellation. Our results demonstrate that the flagellin expression is not reduced in presence of sub-inhibitory concentration of PmB. However, a decrease of the abundance of flagellin associated with the bacterial cells together with an increase in the secretome was observed. Electron microscopy observations also suggest that the abundance of aflagellated bacteria increases upon PmB supplementation. Finally, in agreement with the effect on the flagellation, a reduction of the bacterial motility is observed.

In recent years, chemical communication between diatoms and associated bacteria has emerged as a key factor in diatom ecology, spurred by conceptual and technological advancements to study the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Here, we use a combination of physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic approaches to study the influence of naturally co-existing bacteria, Maribacter sp. and Roseovarius sp., on the sexual reproduction of the biofilm inhabiting marine pennate diatom Seminavis robusta. While Maribacter sp. severely reduces the reproductive success of S. robusta cultures, Roseovarius sp. slightly enhances it. Contrary to our expectation, we demonstrate that the effect of the bacterial exudates is not caused by altered cell-cycle regulation prior to the switch to meiosis.

Additionally, the X-ray powder diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy studies also approved its crystalline nature and the involvement of organic functional groups in their formation. The synthesized nanomaterials were tested for their antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against pathogenic microorganisms Bacillus subtilis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial property showed time, and dose-dependent response with a maximum of zone inhibition was observed at around 22 and 18 mm at a dose of 50 µg/well against B. subtilis and S. aureus and a minimum inhibitory concentration of 8 and 10 µg/ml, respectively.

We analyse quantitatively the influence of spatial disorder, the local heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of cells in the colony, and additional physical parameters such as the autoinducer signal range on the induction dynamics of the cell colony. Spatial inhomogeneity with higher local cell concentrations in clusters leads to earlier but more localised induction events, while homogeneous distributions lead to comparatively delayed but more concerted induction of the cell colony, and, thus, a behaviour close to the mean-field dynamics. We quantify the induction dynamics with quantifiers such as the time series of induction events and burst sizes, the grouping into induction families, and the mean autoinducer concentration levels.

This work is aimed at inhibiting the biofilm formation by S. aureus on solid substrates using a simple surface biofunctionalization strategy. We previously found that surface biofunctionalization with structural perturbed albumin inhibited the initial stage of S. aureus adhesion. The current work extends this strategy with other plasma protein, fibrinogen, which in addition can be bond specifically to the cell wall-anchored proteins of S. aureus. The study of fibrinogen adsorption indicates that the fraction of surface-perturbed molecules is enlarged at long adsorption times and low protein concentration. In these conditions, a significant diminution of ca.60% of alive adhered bacteria were observed after 40 min and the biofilm formation was completely prevented. Thus, it seems that the inhibition of bacterial adhesion on substrates with surface-perturbed proteins represents a general trend even when specific interactions are present. On this basis, we developed a simple strategy to inhibit the formation of S. aureus biofilm, using thermally treated albumin or fibrinogen molecules prior to the substrate biofunctionalization. This strategy shows an excellent performance since the alive adhered bacteria diminishes ca. 90% at short incubation time, followed by the fully inhibition of biofilm formation.

Given the possible contacts between FapC, Rhl and LPS, we here investigate how Rhl and LPS affect FapC fibrillation compared with SDS, known to promote fibrillation of proteins at sub-micellar concentrations. Micelles of all three surfactants help FapC bypass the nucleation lag phase, leading to rapid fibrillation, which persists even at high concentrations of micelles and incorporates almost all available FapC monomers. Fibrils formed at high micellar concentrations of Rhl and SDS seed fibrillation at low surfactant concentrations while retaining the original fibril structure. FapC interacts strongly with SDS to form a dense network of narrow fibrils. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses reveal that surfactants reduce the population of intermediates in the fibrillation process and detect a fast aggregation step over the first 2-4 h which precedes the main fibrillation monitored by Thioflavin T. An additional SAXS-detected rearrangement of early aggregates occurs after 4-10 h. At high Rhl concentrations, the micelles are decorated with protein fibrils. SDS induces FapC fibrillation so efficiently that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is unable to inhibit this process. However, EGCG stimulates FapC oligomer formation and inhibits fibrillation both on its own and in the presence of Rhl and LPS. This oligomer could be modelled as a compact core with a flexible shell. This suggests that EGCG can override the natural amyloid-stimulatory properties of these biosurfactants and thus target biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Najarzadeh"},{"name":"Jannik Nedergaard Pedersen"},{"name":"Gunna Christiansen"},{"name":"Seyed Abbas Shojaosadati"},{"name":"Jan Skov Pedersen"},{"name":"Daniel E Otzen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FapC protein"},{"word":"Functional amyloid"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Rhamnolipid"},{"word":"Surfactant"}]},"article253":{"pmid":"31421109","title":"Bronchoscope-Related Superbug Infections.","abs":"Several recent cases associating cleaned and high-level disinfected duodenoscopes with outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and related multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) may cause bronchoscopists, pulmonologists, and other stakeholders to inquire about the effectiveness of today's practices for reprocessing flexible bronchoscopes.

P2 phage production is induced by a prophage-encoded Rep protein and its excision is induced by the Cox protein. We also found that P2 genome excision leads to the disruption of wobble base pairing of SsrA due to site-specific recombination, thus disrupting the trans-translation function of SsrA. We further demonstrated that P2 excision greatly hinders growth in seawater medium and inhibits biofilm formation. Complementation with a functional SsrA in the P2-excised strain completely restores the growth defects in seawater medium and partially restores biofilm formation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of various Fusobacterium species on in vitro biofilm formation and structure in three different oral biofilm models namely a supragingival, a supragingival feeding, and a subgingival biofilm model. The standard six-species supragingival and feeding biofilm models employed contained Actinomyces oris, Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Veillonella dispar, and Fusobacterium sp.

A sophisticated example of an artificial olfaction device is the odor compass which uses chemical sensor data to identify odor source direction. Successful odor compass designs often rely on plume-based detection and mobile robots, where active, mechanical motion of the sensor platform is employed. Passive, diffusion-based odor compasses remain elusive as detection of low analyte concentrations and quantification of small concentration gradients from within the sensor platform are necessary. Further, simultaneously identifying multiple odor sources using an odor compass remains an ongoing challenge, especially for similar analytes. Here, we show that surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors overcome these challenges, and we present the first SERS odor compass. Using a grid array of SERS sensors, machine learning analysis enables reliable identification of multiple odor sources arising from diffusion of analytes from one or two localized sources. Specifically, convolutional neural network and support vector machine classifier models achieve over 90% accuracy for a multiple odor source problem. This system is then used to identify the location of an Escherichia coli biofilm via its complex signature of volatile organic compounds. Thus, the fabricated SERS chemical sensors have the needed limit of detection and quantification for diffusion-based odor compasses.

Biofilms, in the form of free-floating clumps or aggregates, are involved with the pathogenesis of infectious arthritis and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Infection of a joint containing an orthopedic implant can additionally complicate these infections due to the presence of adherent biofilms. Because of these biofilm phenotypes, bacteria within these infected joints show increased antimicrobial tolerance even at high antibiotic concentrations. To date, animal models of PJI or infectious arthritis have been limited to small animals such as rodents or rabbits. Small animal models, however, yield limited quantities of synovial fluid making them impractical for in vitro research. Herein, we describe the use of ex vivo equine and porcine models for the study of synovial fluid induced biofilm aggregate formation and antimicrobial tolerance. We observed Staphylococcus aureus and other bacterial pathogens adapt the same biofilm aggregate phenotype with significant antimicrobial tolerance in both equine and porcine synovial fluid, analogous to human synovial fluid. We also demonstrate that enzymatic dispersal of synovial fluid aggregates restores the activity of antimicrobials. Future studies investigating the interaction of bacterial cell surface proteins with host synovial fluid proteins can be readily carried out in equine or porcine ex vivo models to identify novel drug targets for treatment of prevention of these difficult to treat infectious diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Jessica M Gilbertie"},{"name":"Lauren V Schnabel"},{"name":"Noreen J Hickok"},{"name":"Megan E Jacob"},{"name":"Brian P Conlon"},{"name":"Irving M Shapiro"},{"name":"Javad Parvizi"},{"name":"Thomas P Schaer"}],"keywords":[]},"article280":{"pmid":"31414557","title":"Decreased metabolism and increased tolerance to extreme environments in Staphylococcus warneri during long-term spaceflight.","abs":"Many studies have shown that the space environment can affect bacteria by causing a range of mutations.

After a 64-day flight, combined phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses were performed to compare the influence of the two spaceflights on this bacterium. Compared with short-term spaceflight, long-term spaceflight increased the biofilm formation ability of S. warneri and the cell wall resistance to external environmental stress but reduced the sensitivity to chemical stimulation. Further analysis showed that these changes might be associated with the significantly upregulated gene expression of the phosphotransferase system, which regulates the metabolism of sugars, including glucose, mannose, fructose, and cellobiose. The mutation of S. warneri caused by the 15-day spaceflight was limited at the phenotype and gene level after cultivation on the ground. After 79 days of spaceflight, significant changes in S. warneri were observed. The phosphotransferase system of S. warneri was upregulated by long-term space stimulation, which resulted in a series of changes in the cell wall, biofilm, and chemical sensitivity, thus enhancing the resistance and adaptability of the bacterium to the external environment.","authors":[{"name":"Po Bai"},{"name":"Bin Zhang"},{"name":"Xian Zhao"},{"name":"Diangeng Li"},{"name":"Yi Yu"},{"name":"Xuelin Zhang"},{"name":"Bing Huang"},{"name":"Changting Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus warneri"},{"word":"differentially expressed genes"},{"word":"long-term spaceflight"},{"word":"phosphotransferase system"}]},"article281":{"pmid":"31414472","title":"Reduction in protein absorption on ophthalmic lenses by PEGDA bulk modification of silicone acrylate-based formulation.","abs":"The absorption of protein and formation of biofilms on the surface of ophthalmic lenses is one of the factors that destroy their useful performance by causing severe visual impairment, inflammation, dryness and ultimate eye discomfort. Therefore, eye lenses need to be resilient to protein absorption, which is one of the opacity factors in minimizing protein absorption on the lenses. The purpose of this study was to investigate and reduce sediment biotransformation on the surface of the semi-hardened lens based on acrylate by bulk-free radical polymerization method. In this respect, the effect of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) with two different molecular weights of 200 and 600 g/mol on the surface roughness, protein absorption, and hydrophilicity of the lenses were studied. The surface hardness of the lenses, on shore D scale, was measured using a durometer hardness test. The presence of higher molecular weight of PEGDA hydrophilic polymeric monomers reduced the hardness of the lenses. The effect of introducing PEGDA, with two molecular weights, into lens fabrication formulations was studied with respect to their water content parameters and hydrophilicity. The presence of a crosslinker such as poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylates, at two different molecular weights, increased the water content and hydrophilicity of the produced lenses. Surface roughness is associated with the formation of bio-film and accumulation of microorganisms on the surface. Due to the roughness of the lens surface developed in this research, the lenses containing PEGDA 600 exhibited less roughness compared to that of PEGDA 200, which could also affect the absorption of protein. Therefore, according to the results of protein absorption test, the PEGDA 600 lenses showed lower protein absorption, which could be due to their high degree of water absorption and hydrophilicity.","authors":[{"name":"Fahimeh Askari"},{"name":"Mojgan Zandi"},{"name":"Parvin Shokrolahi"},{"name":"Mitra Hashemi Tabatabaei"},{"name":"Elnaz Hajirasoliha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Ophtalmic lens"},{"word":"Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate"},{"word":"Protein absorption"},{"word":"Silicone acrylate"}]},"article282":{"pmid":"31414394","title":"The viscosity behaviors of bacterial suspensions or extracellular polymeric substances and their effects on aerobic granular sludge.","abs":"Although the viscosity behavior of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in flocculent activated sludge (FAS) and aerobic granular sludge (AGS) has been investigated, no studies have explored the role of viscosity in microbial attachment in pure culture.

Underlying the development of these multicellular structures is the capacity of mycobacterial cells to adhere to one another. Unlike most other bacteria, NTM spontaneously and constitutively aggregate in vitro, hindering our ability to understand the transition between planktonic and aggregated cells. While culturing a model NTM, Mycobacterium smegmatis, in rich medium, we fortuitously discovered that planktonic cells accumulate after ∼3 days of growth. By providing selective pressure for bacteria that disperse earlier, we isolated a strain with two mutations in the oligopeptide permease operon (opp). A mutant lacking the opp operon (Δopp) disperses earlier than wild type (WT) due to a defect in nutrient uptake. Experiments with WT M. smegmatis revealed that growth as aggregates is favored when carbon is replete, but under conditions of low available carbon relative to available nitrogen, M. smegmatis grows as planktonic cells. By adjusting carbon and nitrogen sources in defined medium, we tuned the cellular C/N ratio such that M. smegmatis grows either as aggregates or as planktonic cells. C/N-mediated aggregation regulation is widespread among NTM with the possible exception of rough-colony Mycobacterium abscessus isolates. Altogether, we show that NTM aggregation is a controlled process that is governed by the relative availability of carbon and nitrogen for metabolism.","authors":[{"name":"William H DePas"},{"name":"Megan Bergkessel"},{"name":"Dianne K Newman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"carbon metabolism"},{"word":"nitrogen metabolism"},{"word":"physiology"}]},"article298":{"pmid":"31409682","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa Interstrain Dynamics and Selection of Hyperbiofilm Mutants during a Chronic Infection.","abs":"Opportunistic pathogens establishing new infections experience strong selection to adapt, often favoring mutants that persist.

Wounds were infected with a mixed community of six P. aeruginosa strains, including the model PA14 strain (PA14-1), and biopsies taken at 3, 14, and 28 days postinfection. Hyperbiofilm-forming rugose small-colony variants (RSCVs) were the earliest and predominant phenotypic variant.

Whole-genome sequencing of PA14-1 RSCV isolates revealed driver mutations exclusively in the wsp pathway, conferring hyperbiofilm phenotypes. Several of the wsp mutant RSCVs also acquired CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity to prophages isolated from the P. aeruginosa wound isolate (B23-2) that was also present in the inoculum. These observations emphasize the importance of interstrain dynamics and the role of lysogenic phages in the survival of an invading pathogen. Rather than being a side effect of chronicity, the rapid rise of RSCVs in wounds is evidence of positive selection on the Wsp chemosensory system to produce mutants with elevated biofilm formation capacity.

We investigate spatial and temporal variability affecting division and/or death parameters. Assuming that mutant and wild-type fitness parameters are drawn from an identical distribution, we study mutant fixation probability and timing. We demonstrate that temporal and spatial types of variability possess fundamentally different properties. Under temporal randomness, in a completely mixed system, minority mutants experience (i) higher than neutral fixation probability and a higher mean conditional fixation time, if the division rates are affected by randomness and (ii) lower fixation probability and lower mean conditional fixation time if the death rates are affected. Once spatial restrictions are imposed, however, these effects completely disappear, and mutants in a circular graph experience neutral dynamics, but only for the DB update rule in case (i) and for the BD rule in case (ii) above. In contrast to this, in the case of spatially variable environment, both for BD/DB processes, both for complete/circular graph and both for division/death rates affected, minority mutants experience a higher than neutral probability of fixation. Fixation time, however, is increased by randomness on a circle, while it decreases for complete graphs under random division rates. A basic difference between temporal and spatial kinds of variability is the types of correlations that occur in the system. Under temporal randomness, mutants are spatially correlated with each other (they simply have equal fitness values at a given moment of time; the same holds for wild-types). Under spatial randomness, there are subtler, temporal correlations among mutant and wild-type cells, which manifest themselves by cells of each type 'claiming' better spots for themselves. Applications of this theory include cancer generation and biofilm dynamics.","authors":[{"name":"Suzan Farhang-Sardroodi"},{"name":"Amir H Darooneh"},{"name":"Mohammad Kohandel"},{"name":"Natalia L Komarova"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Moran process"},{"word":"fixation"},{"word":"mutations"},{"word":"neutrality"},{"word":"randomness"},{"word":"rare mutant"}]},"article300":{"pmid":"31408741","title":"Antifungal activity of volatile compounds produced by Staphylococcus sciuri strain MarR44 and its potential for the biocontrol of Colletotrichum nymphaeae, causal agent strawberry anthracnose.","abs":"A nonpathogenic endophytic bacterial isolate, recovered from Fragaria × ananassa stolon, and its antifungal activity against Colletotrichum nymphaeae was evaluated under in vitro, in vivo, and greenhouse conditions. Bacterial isolate was identified as Staphylococcus sciuri MarR44 (Strain ID: WDCM 891 = CCSM-B 00640) using phenotypic and biochemical properties and molecular phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA gene sequences. The living cells of strain MarR44 inhibited mycelial growth of C. nymphaeae (52.46%) using dual-culture method. The volatile compounds (VOCs) produced by MarR44 inhibited mycelial growth and conidial germination of C. nymphaeae by 34.52% and 82.81%, respectively. However, inhibition percentage of mycelial growth of pathogen by culture filtrates of the strain MarR44 was lower (23.07%) than that for the two dual culture and volatile compounds assay tests. Moreover, the cell-free-culture filtrates of this strain reduced the biomass and conidial germination of pathogen by 91.89% and 41.10%, respectively. Also, the strain MarR44 was capable of producing protease, chitinase, HCN, siderophore, IAA, gibberellin, and biofilm. The living cells and volatile compounds of the strain MarR44 reduced anthracnose disease at post-harvest on fruit by 52.45% and 72.17%, respectively. Furthermore, disease severity of strawberry anthracnose was reduced using drenching soil and inoculated plants methods by 77.77 and 72.22%, respectively, 60 days after inoculation. The VOCs released by strain MarR44 were analyzed by Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Out of 24 identified VOCs, Mesityl oxide (81.436%), Acetic acid, 2-methylpropyl ester (3.442%), 4-Methyldecane (1.837%), 4-Penten-2-one,4-methyl- (1.739%), Toluene (1.248%), and o-Xylene (1.24%) were the major components. The mode of action of S. sciuri MarR44 on the C. nymphaeae was through the production of antifungal volatile compounds (Antibiosis), which inhibited mycelial growth and conidial germination of pathogen in vitro and fruit decay development in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of S. sciuri having antifungal activity against causal agent strawberry anthracnose. These results indicated that the VOCs of S. sciuri strain MarR44 are promising biofumigant for management of strawberry anthracnose.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Alijani"},{"name":"Jahanshir Amini"},{"name":"Morahem Ashengroph"},{"name":"Bahman Bahramnejad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocontrol"},{"word":"GC-Mass"},{"word":"Staphylococcus sciuri"},{"word":"Strawberry"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"31408509","title":"Cyclic-di-GMP binds to histidine kinase RavS to control RavS-RavR phosphotransfer and regulates the bacterial lifestyle transition between virulence and swimming.","abs":"The two-component signalling system (TCS) comprising a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR) is the predominant bacterial sense-and-response machinery. Because bacterial cells usually encode a number of TCSs to adapt to various ecological niches, the specificity of a TCS is in the centre of regulation. Specificity of TCS is defined by the capability and velocity of phosphoryl transfer between a cognate HK and a RR. Here, we provide genetic, enzymology and structural data demonstrating that the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP physically and specifically binds to RavS, a HK of the phytopathogenic, gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. The [c-di-GMP]-RavS interaction substantially promotes specificity between RavS and RavR, a GGDEF-EAL domain-containing RR, by reinforcing the kinetic preference of RavS to phosphorylate RavR. [c-di-GMP]-RavS binding effectively decreases the phosphorylation level of RavS and negatively regulates bacterial swimming. Intriguingly, the EAL domain of RavR counteracts the above regulation by degrading c-di-GMP and then increasing the level of phosphorylated RavS. Therefore, RavR acts as a bifunctional phosphate sink that finely controls the level of phosphorylated RavS. These biochemical processes interactively modulate the phosphoryl flux between RavS-RavR and bacterial lifestyle transition.

Despite the high predictability and excellent long-term survival rates reported for implant therapy, complications may still occur and can jeopardize both short- and long-term success. The present paper provides an overview on the most important aspects related to the etiology, prevention, and management of complications associated with implant therapy. Data from the literature indicate that a number of factors, such as surgical trauma, implant diameter, type of implant-abutment connection, abutment disconnection and reconnection, presence of microgap, and implant malpositioning, can substantially influence the biologic processes of bone remodeling and biofilm formation, thus increasing the rate of short- and long-term hard- and soft-tissue complications. Other factors, such as excess cement at cement-retained prosthetic restorations, abutment mobility, and infections (e.g. peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis) caused by bacterial biofilm, are further causes for complications and failures. More recent evidence also indicates that besides the need for sufficient bone volume surrounding the implant, the presence of an adequate width and thickness of attached mucosa may improve biofilm control and limit crestal bone resorption. Furthermore, emerging evidence points also to the pivotal role of human factors as one of the most important causes of complications in implant dentistry. It can be concluded that clinicians need to consider all biologic and biomechanical factors affecting implant placement and survival, as well as undergo adequate training to improve their surgical skills to control and prevent implant complications. Careful patient selection and control of environmental and systemic factors, such as smoking, diabetes etc., coupled with an accurate surgical and prosthetic planning, enable a better prevention and control of infections.","authors":[{"name":"Georgios E Romanos"},{"name":"Rafael Delgado-Ruiz"},{"name":"Anton Sculean"}],"keywords":[{"word":"complications"},{"word":"dental implants"},{"word":"implant therapy"}]},"article306":{"pmid":"31406662","title":"Proanthocyanidin Interferes with Intrinsic Antibiotic Resistance Mechanisms of Gram-Negative Bacteria.","abs":"Antibiotic resistance is spreading at an alarming rate among pathogenic bacteria in both medicine and agriculture.

It is shown that cPAC has a potentiating effect, both in vitro and in vivo, on a broad range of antibiotic classes against pathogenic E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. Evidence that cPAC acts by repressing two antibiotic resistance mechanisms, selective membrane permeability and multidrug efflux pumps, is presented. Failure of cPAC to potentiate antibiotics against efflux pump-defective mutants demonstrates that efflux interference is essential for potentiation.

Despite the isolates being closely related, PA14 exhibits increased virulence compared to that of PAO1 in various models. To determine which players are responsible for the hypervirulence phenotype of the PA14 strain, we elected a transcriptomic approach through RNA sequencing. We found 2,029 genes that are differentially expressed between the two strains, including several genes that are involved with or regulated by quorum sensing (QS), known to control most of the virulence factors in P. aeruginosa Among them, we chose to focus our study on QslA, an antiactivator of QS whose expression was barely detectable in the PA14 strain according our data. We hypothesized that lack of expression of qslA in PA14 could be responsible for higher QS expression in the PA14 strain, possibly explaining its hypervirulence phenotype. After confirming that QslA protein was highly produced in PAO1 but not in the PA14 strain, we obtained evidence showing that a PAO1 deletion strain of qslA has faster QS gene expression kinetics than PA14. Moreover, known virulence factors activated by QS, such as (i) pyocyanin production, (ii) H2-T6SS (type VI secretion system) gene expression, and (iii) Xcp-T2SS (type II secretion system) machinery production and secretion, were all lower in PAO1 than in PA14, due to higher qslA expression. However, biofilm formation and cytotoxicity toward macrophages, although increased in PA14 compared to PAO1, were independent of QslA control.

Therefore, using an in vitro biofilm model system, we sought to determine whether various clinical lipid emulsions differentially impacted biofilm growth in C. albicans We observed that the lipid emulsions Intralipid and Omegaven both stimulated C. albicans biofilm formation during growth in minimal medium or a macronutrient PN solution. Conversely, Smoflipid inhibited C. albicans biofilm formation by approximately 50%. Follow-up studies revealed that while Smoflipid did not impair C. albicans growth, it did significantly inhibit hypha formation and hyphal elongation. Moreover, growth inhibition could be recapitulated in Intralipid when supplemented with capric acid-a fatty acid present in Smoflipid but absent in Intralipid. Capric acid was also found to dose dependently inhibit C. albicans biofilm formation in PN solutions.

In present study, we found that theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TF3) had an inhibitory effect on S. mutans UA159 in vitro. Visualized by field emission-scanning electron microscopy, the suppressed formation of S. mutans biofilms grown with TF3 at sub-inhibitory concentrations could be attributed to the reduced biofilm matrix, which was proven to contain glucans and extracellular DNA (eDNA). Glucan-reduced effect of TF3 was achieved by down-regulating expression levels of gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD encoding glucosyltransferases. Besides, TF3 reduced eDNA formation of S. mutans by negatively regulating lrgA, lrgB, and srtA, which govern cell autolysis and membrane vesicle components. Furthermore, TF3 also played vital roles in antagonizing preformed biofilms of S. mutans. Bactericidal effects of TF3 became significant when its concentrations increased more than twofold of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Moreover, the capacities of S. mutans biofilms to produce acid and tolerate acid were significantly weakened by TF3 at MIC. Based on real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, the mechanistic effects of TF3 were speculated to comprise the inhibition of enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, F-type ATPase and the agmatine deiminase system. Moreover, TF3 has been found to downregulate LytST, VicRK, and ComDE two component systems in S. mutans, which play critical roles in the regulatory network of virulence factors. Our present study found that TF3 could suppress the formation and cariogenic capacities of S. mutans biofilms, which will provide new strategies for anti-caries in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Sa Wang"},{"name":"Yuan Wang"},{"name":"Ying Wang"},{"name":"Zhuhui Duan"},{"name":"Zongxin Ling"},{"name":"Wenzhi Wu"},{"name":"Suman Tong"},{"name":"Huiming Wang"},{"name":"Shuli Deng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3′-digallate"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"extracellular DNA"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"glucans"},{"word":"theaflavin-3"}]},"article323":{"pmid":"31403663","title":"Impact of manganese on biofilm formation and cell morphology of Candida parapsilosis clinical isolates with different biofilm forming abilities.","abs":"The commensal species Candida parapsilosis is an emerging human pathogen that has the ability to form biofilms.

Some reasons for recurrence include the persistence of residual infection, resistance, and possibly reinfection from either male or female partners. Persistence may occur due to the formation of a biofilm that protects BV-causing bacteria from antimicrobial therapy. Poor adherence to treatment among patients with genitourinary infections may lead to resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of recurrent etiology of BV are not known. Recommended treatment for recurrent BV consists of an extended course of metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice daily for 10-14 days); if ineffective, metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% for 10 days, followed by two times per week for 3-6 months, is an alternate treatment regimen. Past studies of clindamycin and tinidazole in the treatment of recurrent BV have focused on patients with evidence of metronidazole resistance.

Furthermore, we show that this approach represses the rise of resistance, restores sensitivity to highly resistant clinical isolates, and is effective against other Gram-positive pathogens. Finally, while other membrane-acting agents can synergize with aminoglycosides, induction of PMF-independent uptake is uncommon, and distinct to RLs among several compounds tested.

The degradation of coral reefs will result in the collapse of ecosystem services that sustain over half a billion people globally [4, 5]. Here, we show that marine heatwave events on coral reefs are biologically distinct to how coral bleaching has been understood to date, in that heatwave conditions result in an immediate heat-induced mortality of the coral colony, rapid coral skeletal dissolution, and the loss of the three-dimensional reef structure. During heatwave-induced mortality, the coral skeletons exposed by tissue loss are, within days, encased by a complex biofilm of phototrophic microbes, whose metabolic activity accelerates calcium carbonate dissolution to rates exceeding accretion by healthy corals and far greater than has been documented on reefs under normal seawater conditions. This dissolution reduces the skeletal density and hardness and increases porosity. These results demonstrate that severe-heatwave-induced mortality events should be considered as a distinct biological phenomenon from bleaching events on coral reefs. We also suggest that such heatwave mortality events, and rapid reef decay, will become more frequent as the intensity of marine heatwaves increases and provides further compelling evidence for the need to mitigate climate change and instigate actions to reduce marine heatwaves.","authors":[{"name":"William P Leggat"},{"name":"Emma F Camp"},{"name":"David J Suggett"},{"name":"Scott F Heron"},{"name":"Alexander J Fordyce"},{"name":"Stephanie Gardner"},{"name":"Lachlan Deakin"},{"name":"Michael Turner"},{"name":"Levi J Beeching"},{"name":"Unnikrishnan Kuzhiumparambil"},{"name":"C Mark Eakin"},{"name":"Tracy D Ainsworth"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioerosion"},{"word":"climate change"},{"word":"coral"},{"word":"coral reefs"},{"word":"decalcification"},{"word":"marine heatwave"}]},"article332":{"pmid":"31401887","title":"Dehydration affects drug transport over nasal mucosa.","abs":"Formulations for nasal drug delivery often rely on water sorption to adhere to the mucosa, which also causes a higher water gradient over the tissue and subsequent dehydration.

Also, it has a remarkable antifungal effect at supraphysiological concentrations. However, the background of the antifungal effect remains unknown, especially in the case of non-albicans Candida species such as Candida parapsilosis We examined the effect of tyrosol on growth, adhesion, redox homeostasis, virulence, as well as fluconazole susceptibility. To gain further insights into the physiological consequences of tyrosol treatment, we also determined genome-wide gene expression changes using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). A concentration of 15 mM tyrosol caused significant growth inhibition within 2 h of the addition of tyrosol, while the adhesion of yeast cells was not affected. Tyrosol increased the production of reactive oxygen species remarkably, as revealed by a dichlorofluorescein test, and it was associated with elevated superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activities. The interaction between fluconazole and tyrosol was antagonistic. Tyrosol exposure resulted in 261 and 181 differentially expressed genes with at least a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in expression, respectively, which were selected for further study. Genes involved in ribosome biogenesis showed downregulation, while genes related to the oxidative stress response and ethanol fermentation were upregulated. In addition, tyrosol treatment upregulated the expression of efflux pump genes, including MDR1 and CDR1, and downregulated the expression of the FAD2 and FAD3 virulence genes involved in desaturated fatty acid formation. Our data demonstrate that exogenous tyrosol significantly affects the physiology and gene expression of C. parapsilosis, which could contribute to the development of treatments targeting quorum sensing in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Ágnes Jakab"},{"name":"Zoltán Tóth"},{"name":"Fruzsina Nagy"},{"name":"Dániel Nemes"},{"name":"Ildikó Bácskay"},{"name":"Gábor Kardos"},{"name":"Tamás Emri"},{"name":"István Pócsi"},{"name":"László Majoros"},{"name":"Renátó Kovács"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida parapsilosis"},{"word":"RNA-Seq"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"tyrosol"}]},"article343":{"pmid":"31399349","title":"Insights on the anticandidal activity of non-antifungal drugs.","abs":"The search for new antifungal strategies to overcome Candida infections is essential and a matter of public health, due to the high mortality associated to candidiasis, the increasing incidence of resistance to antifungals and the limited number of drugs available for treatment. Several approaches have been exploited in order to develop new antifungal strategies, e.g. the use of natural products, vaccines, and the combination of an antifungal drug to a non-antifungal substance. Nonetheless, issues related to pharmacokinetic parameters, toxicity and costs have been jeopardizing the discovery of new antifungal drugs. An alternative that could overcome these problems would be treating candidiasis with drugs that have been originally developed to treat other diseases. This strategy, known as drug repositioning or drug repurposing, could diminish the incidence of adverse effects and lower the cost of production, since several steps involved in drug discovery and development have already been accomplished. This review presents a set of known drugs that have been exploited as anticandidal agents, such as antidepressant agents, antiepileptic drugs, statins, among others. These substances affect the growth of Candida spp. in vitro, as well as virulence factors such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation. Moreover, some drugs are able to potentiate the anticandidal activity of known antifungal drugs.

Here, we report the identification of a variant histone H3, which we have designated H3VCTG because of its exclusive presence in the CTG clade of ascomycetes, including Candida albicans, a human pathogen. C. albicans grows both as single yeast cells and hyphal filaments in the planktonic mode of growth. It also forms a three-dimensional biofilm structure in the host as well as on human catheter materials under suitable conditions. H3VCTG null (hht1/hht1) cells of C. albicans are viable but produce more robust biofilms than wild-type cells in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Indeed, a comparative transcriptome analysis of planktonic and biofilm cells reveals that the biofilm circuitry is significantly altered in H3VCTG null cells. H3VCTG binds more efficiently to the promoters of many biofilm-related genes in the planktonic cells than during biofilm growth, whereas the binding of the core canonical histone H3 on the corresponding promoters largely remains unchanged. Furthermore, biofilm defects associated with master regulators, namely, biofilm and cell wall regulator 1 (Bcr1), transposon enhancement control 1 (Tec1), and non-dityrosine 80 (Ndt80), are significantly rescued in cells lacking H3VCTG. The occupancy of the transcription factor Bcr1 at its cognate promoter binding sites was found to be enhanced in the absence of H3VCTG in the planktonic form of growth resulting in enhanced transcription of biofilm-specific genes. Further, we demonstrate that co-occurrence of valine and serine at the 31st and 32nd positions in H3VCTG, respectively, is essential for its function. Taken together, we show that even in a unicellular organism, differential gene expression patterns are modulated by the relative occupancy of the specific histone H3 type at the chromatin level.","authors":[{"name":"Laxmi Shanker Rai"},{"name":"Rima Singha"},{"name":"Hiram Sanchez"},{"name":"Tanmoy Chakraborty"},{"name":"Bipin Chand"},{"name":"Sophie Bachellier-Bassi"},{"name":"Shantanu Chowdhury"},{"name":"Christophe d'Enfert"},{"name":"David R Andes"},{"name":"Kaustuv Sanyal"}],"keywords":[]},"article351":{"pmid":"31397993","title":"Nonfreezable Water and Polymer Swelling Control the Marine Antifouling Performance of Polymers with Limited Hydrophilic Content.","abs":"Zwitterionic chemical groups have well-documented resistance to marine fouling species when presented as homogeneous polymer brushes. These model formulations are not, however, suitable for practical fouling-control applications. It is presently unknown if a uniform film of zwitterions is required to elicit nonfouling character via the binding of interfacial water or if the incorporation of zwitterionic functionality into a more practical bulk polymer system will suffice. Here, copolymers of n-butyl methacrylate were synthesized with low incorporation levels (up to 20 mol %) of hydrophilic functionality, including zwitterionic moieties. Their antifouling (AF) properties were evaluated using barnacle cyprids (Balanus improvisus), diatom cells (Navicula incerta), and a multispecies biofilm. The laboratory assays revealed higher resistance of ionic copolymers toward cyprid settlement, which was attributed to their swelling and the presence of nonfreezable water molecules bound tightly to the polymer chains. Additionally, cells of N. incerta and the multispecies biofilm were removed more effectively on polymers containing sulfobetaine methacrylate and sulfopropyl methacrylate moieties. The results indicate that the presence of tightly bound interfacial water is not limited to model systems of pure hydrophilic homopolymers, but that this mechanism can also reduce the settlement and adhesion of fouling species via bulk copolymer systems with limited hydrophilic content. The swelling of polymers with hydrophilic content may also contribute to their AF efficacy, and such materials may therefore represent a route to translation of the well-documented nonfouling character of zwitterions into practical, industrially relevant coating formulations.","authors":[{"name":"Jan H Kardela"},{"name":"Ian S Millichamp"},{"name":"James Ferguson"},{"name":"Alison L Parry"},{"name":"Kevin J Reynolds"},{"name":"Nick Aldred"},{"name":"Anthony S Clare"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"antifouling"},{"word":"barnacle cyprid"},{"word":"hydrophilic surface"},{"word":"zwitterionic"}]},"article352":{"pmid":"31397925","title":"Phospholipid Content of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Is Modulated by the Growth Phase Rather Than the Immobilization State.","abs":"Biofilms have significance in medical, industrial, and environmental settings, and can cause important damage.

As antibiotic resistance increases in general and because most antibiotics have poor effectiveness against biofilm-embedded bacteria in particular, there is a need for alternative and innovative treatment approaches. Recently, the immune system has moved into focus as the key player in infection defense and bone homeostasis, and the targeted modulation of the host response is becoming an emerging field of interest. The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge of impaired endogenous defense mechanisms that are unable to prevent chronicity of bone infections associated with a prosthetic or osteosynthetic device. The presence of foreign material adversely affects the immune system by generating a local immune-compromised environment where spontaneous clearance of planktonic bacteria does not take place. Furthermore, the surface structure of the implant facilitates the transition of bacteria from the planktonic to the biofilm stage. Biofilm formation on the implant surface is closely linked to the development of a chronic infection, and a misled adaption of the immune system makes it impossible to effectively eliminate biofilm infections. The interaction between the immune system and bone cells, especially osteoclasts, is extensively studied in the field of osteoimmunology and this crosstalk further aggravates the course of bone infection by shifting bone homeostasis in favor of bone resorption.

Biofilms play an important role in P. aeruginosa drug resistance. Three factors are most important to induce biofilm: quorum sensing (QS), bis-(3'-5')-cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), and small RNAs (sRNAs). P. aeruginosa has its own specific QS system (PQS) besides two common QS systems, LasI-LasR and RhlI-RhlR, in bacteria. PQS is interesting not only because there is a negative regulation from RhlR to pqsR but also because the null mutation in PQS leads to a reduced biofilm formation. Furthermore, P. aeruginosa dispersed cells have physiological features that are distinct between the planktonic cells and biofilm cells. In response to a low concentration of c-di-GMP, P. aeruginosa cells can disperse from the biofilms to become planktonic cells. These raise an interesting hypothesis of whether biofilm can be reversed through the QS mechanism in P. aeruginosa. Although a single factor is certainly not sufficient to prevent the biofilm formation, it necessarily explores such possibility. In this hypothesis, the literature is analyzed to determine the negative regulation pathways, and then the transcriptomic data are analyzed to determine whether this hypothesis is workable or not. Unexpectedly, the transcriptomic data reveal a negative regulation between lasI and psqR. Also, the individual cases from transcriptomic data demonstrate the negative regulations of PQS with laslI, laslR, rhlI, and rhlR under different experiments. Based on our analyses, possible strategies to reverse biofilm formation are proposed and their clinic implications are addressed.","authors":[{"name":"Shaomin Yan"},{"name":"Guang Wu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"negative feedback"},{"word":"positive feedback"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"transcriptome"}]},"article364":{"pmid":"31395864","title":"Computer simulations of food oral processing to engineer teeth cleaning.","abs":"Oral biofilm accumulation in pets is a growing concern.

We show that Finite Element (FE) models can efficiently account for all these parameters, through the simulation of food deformation and fracture during the first bite. This reduces the need for time consuming and costly in-vivo or in-vitro trials. Our in-silico model is validated through in-vitro tests, demonstrating that the initial oral processing stage can be engineered through computers with high fidelity.","authors":[{"name":"C G Skamniotis"},{"name":"M Elliott"},{"name":"M N Charalambides"}],"keywords":[]},"article365":{"pmid":"31395834","title":"Bioactive Brominated Oxindole Alkaloids from the Red Sea Sponge Callyspongia siphonella.","abs":"In the present study, LC-HRESIMS-assisted dereplication along with bioactivity-guided isolation led to targeting two brominated oxindole alkaloids (compounds ","authors":[{"name":"Seham S El-Hawary"},{"name":"Ahmed M Sayed"},{"name":"Rabab Mohammed"},{"name":"Hossam M Hassan"},{"name":"Mostafa E Rateb"},{"name":"Elham Amin"},{"name":"Tarek A Mohammed"},{"name":"Mohamed El-Mesery"},{"name":"Abdullatif Bin Muhsinah"},{"name":"Abdulrhman Alsayari"},{"name":"Harald Wajant"},{"name":"Mohamed A Anany"},{"name":"Usama Ramadan Abdelmohsen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Callyspongia siphonella"},{"word":"LC-HRESIMS"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"anticancer"},{"word":"antitrypanosomal"},{"word":"metabolomic profiling"},{"word":"oxindole alkaloids"},{"word":"tisindoline"}]},"article366":{"pmid":"31394448","title":"Eliminating partial-transformation products and mitigating residual toxicity of amoxicillin through intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation.","abs":"Intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation (ICPB) is a promising technology for treating wastewater containing antibiotics.

These biofilms/deposits have different cave distribution, pH, macro- and microelement and mineralogical composition, carbon and nitrogen content. In particular, water filaments and vermiculations had circumneutral and slightly acidic pH, respectively, both had abundant organic carbon and high microbial diversity. They were rich in macro- and microelements, deriving from mineral dissolution, and, in the case of water filaments, from seawater composition. Vermiculations had different color, partly associated with their mineralogy, and unusual minerals probably due to trapping capacities. Moonmilk was composed of gypsum, poor in organic matter, had an extremely low pH (0-1) and low microbial diversity. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, the microbial composition of the biofilms/deposits included autotrophic taxa associated with sulfur and nitrogen cycles and biomineralization processes. In particular, water filaments communities were characterized by bacterial taxa involved in sulfur oxidation and reduction in aquatic, aphotic, microaerophilic/anoxic environments (Campylobacterales, Thiotrichales, Arenicellales, Desulfobacterales, Desulforomonadales) and in chemolithotrophy in marine habitats (Oceanospirillales, Chromatiales). Their biodiversity was linked to the morphology of the water filaments and their collection site. Microbial communities within vermiculations were partly related to their color and showed high abundance of unclassified Betaproteobacteria and sulfur-oxidizing Hydrogenophilales (including Sulfuriferula), and Acidiferrobacterales (including Sulfurifustis), sulfur-reducing Desulfurellales, and ammonia-oxidizing Planctomycetes and Nitrospirae.

In this study, three shallow wells (FW301, FW303, FW305) in a non-contaminated shallow aquifer in the ENIGMA-Oak Ridge Field Research Center (Oak Ridge, TN) were sampled approximately 3 times a week over a period of three months to measure changes in groundwater geochemistry and microbial diversity. It was expected that the sampled microbial diversity from two historic field wells (FW301, FW303) would be relatively stable, while diversity from a newer well (FW305) would be less stable over time. The wells displayed some degree of hydrochemical variability over time unique to each well, with FW303 being overall the most stable well and FW301 being the most dynamic based upon dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and nitrate. Community analysis via ss-rRNA paired-end sequencing and distribution-based clustering revealed higher OTU richness, diversity, and variability in groundwater communities of FW301 than the other two wells for diversity binned over all time points. Microbial community composition of a given well was on average > 50% dissimilar to any other well at a given time (days), yet, functional gene diversity as measured with GeoChip remained relatively constant. Similarities in community structure across wells were observed with respect to the presence of 20 shared bacterial groups in all samples in all wells, although at varying levels over the tested time period. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis revealed that variability in FW301 was largely attributed to low abundance, highly-transient populations, while variability in the most hydrochemically stable well (FW303) was due to fluctuations in more highly abundant and frequently present taxa. Additionally, the youngest well FW305 showed a dramatic shift in community composition towards the end of the sampling period that was not observed in the other wells, suggesting possible succession events over time. Time-series analysis using vector auto-regressive models and Granger causality showed unique relationships between richness and geochemistry over time in each well. These results indicate temporally dynamic microbial communities over short time scales, with day-to-day population shifts in local community structure influenced by available source community diversity and local groundwater hydrochemistry.","authors":[{"name":"Anna J Zelaya"},{"name":"Albert E Parker"},{"name":"Kathryn L Bailey"},{"name":"Ping Zhang"},{"name":"Joy Van Nostrand"},{"name":"Daliang Ning"},{"name":"Dwayne A Elias"},{"name":"Jizhong Zhou"},{"name":"Terry C Hazen"},{"name":"Adam P Arkin"},{"name":"Matthew W Fields"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Functional gene array"},{"word":"Groundwater"},{"word":"Microbial community dynamics"},{"word":"Shallow subsurface"},{"word":"Spatiotemporal"},{"word":"Time series"},{"word":"Well construction"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"31386957","title":"Comparison of coagulative colloidal microbubbles with monomeric and polymeric inorganic coagulants for tertiary treatment of distillery wastewater.","abs":"The flotation using coagulative colloidal gas aphrons (CCGAs) is of great potential in effectively removing the recalcitrant dissolved organic matter (DOM) and colorants from the bio-chemically treated cassava distillery wastewater.

Growth was measured through colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, while cellular and colonial phenotypic stress responses were observed through visible light, fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy. Our data show the following: (1) The tolerance to high salt concentrations can be increased through a stepwise inoculation toward higher concentrations. (2) Ion-specific factors are more relevant for the growth limitation of P. halocryophilus in saline solutions than single physicochemical parameters like ionic strength or water activity. (3) P. halocryophilus shows the highest microbial sodium perchlorate tolerance described so far. However, (4) MSCg values are higher for all chlorides compared to perchlorates.

Antifungal combinations with synergistic interaction can be a good choice for antifungal lock therapy; therefore, interactions were examined between two echinocandins (caspofungin and micafungin) and the chitin synthesis inhibitor nikkomycin Z against Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis biofilms. Susceptibility was evaluated using the XTT-based checkerboard microdilution method, while the nature of interactions was assessed by calculating fractional inhibitory concentration indices and using the Bliss independence model. Mathematic-based evaluations were supplemented with fluorescent LIVE/DEAD viability assay. The results obtained by statistical interaction analyses correlated well with the viability assay.

Over the past few decades, Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) process has been widely used as an efficient, well-designed and practical approach for treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater due to its cost-effectiveness and simplicity. SBR Performance can enhance by providing simultaneous suspended and attached growth of microorganisms which act as a hybrid growth. In this study, a lab-scale Hybrid Sequencing Batch Reactor (HSBR) with 6.4 l working volume was used to examine the effect of salinity (NaCl), increased from 0 to 6.7% (g NaCl/ L wastewater), on the biological treatment. Therefore, COD, MLSS, MLVSS and SVI parameters have been measured over a period of 7 months of operation. The operational parameters namely pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature were 7.5-8.5, 1.5-6.8 mg /L and 20-25 °C respectively during whole experiment. Influent COD of synthetic wastewater was maintained at 650 ± 25 mg/L. The HSBR Cycle time including, influent feeding, React, Settling and effluent discharge were 1/20/1/1 h respectively.

RNA sequencing and iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation)-based quantitative proteomics revealed that C. albicans genes and proteins associated with carbohydrate metabolism were significantly enhanced, including sugar transport, aerobic respiration, pyruvate breakdown, and the glyoxylate cycle. Other C. albicans genes and proteins directly and indirectly related to cell morphogenesis and cell wall components such as mannan and glucan were also upregulated, indicating enhanced fungal activity in mixed-species biofilm. Further analyses revealed that S. mutans-derived exoenzyme glucosyltransferase B (GtfB), which binds to the fungal cell surface to promote coadhesion, can break down sucrose into glucose and fructose that can be readily metabolized by C. albicans, enhancing growth and acid production. Altogether, we identified key pathways used by C. albicans in the mixed biofilm, indicating an active fungal role in the sugar metabolism and environmental acidification (key virulence traits associated with caries onset) when interacting with S. mutans, and a new cross-feeding mechanism mediated by GtfB that enhances C. albicans carbohydrate utilization.

Although carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which are resistant to carbapenem antimicrobials, first appeared in 1993, treatment options remain limited. Mechanisms behind antimicrobial resistance involve changes to microbial outer membranes, drug efflux pump abnormalities, β-lactamase production and the creation of biofilms around cell bodies. Genetic information related to these forms of antimicrobial resistance exists on chromosomes and plasmids, and when located on the latter can easily be transmitted to other strains, no matter the species, which creates a risk of antimicrobial resistance spreading exceptionally rapidly. To prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance, the World Health Organization in 2015 published an action plan on antimicrobial resistance, based on which World Health Organization member countries have laid out specific policies and targets. Urinary tract infections are a type of healthcare-associated infection, and the sexually transmitted disease pathogen, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, has been included in a list of microbes that pose a risk to human health published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Urologists face numerous problems when attempting to use antimicrobials properly, which is one method of dealing with antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, this article describes the current state of resistant microbes associated with urinary tract infections and countermeasures for antimicrobial resistance, including new antimicrobials.","authors":[{"name":"Hiroyuki Kitano"},{"name":"Jun Teishima"},{"name":"Katsumi Shigemura"},{"name":"Hiroki Ohge"},{"name":"Masato Fujisawa"},{"name":"Akio Matsubara"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial-resistant bacteria"},{"word":"countermeasures for infectious diseases"},{"word":"new antibiotics"},{"word":"sexually transmitted disease"},{"word":"urinary tract infection"}]},"article410":{"pmid":"31382172","title":"Response of microbes to biochar strengthen nitrogen removal in subsurface flow constructed wetlands: Microbial community structure and metabolite characteristics.","abs":"Four subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SFCWs) were constructed on the basis of the volume ratio of biochar in common gravel (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) for the evaluation of microbe and metabolite characteristics response to biochar addition.

Illumina MiSeq sequencing results revealed that the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Biochar addition can improve the removal of nitrogen by altering microbial community and increasing the relative abundance of Thauera, Candidatus Competibacter, Dechloromonas, Desulfobulbus, Chlorobium, and Thiobacillus. Protein and humic substances were the primary components of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in SFCWs. The amount of total EPS considerably decreased with biochar addition, which caused a shift in the EPS functional groups including carbonyl of protein, amide, and hydroxyl groups. Moreover, biochar could enhance the high molecular weight compounds metabolized into low molecular compounds. The results can provide new insights into the use of biochar in the enhancement of nitrogen removal by microbial community and metabolic product characteristics.","authors":[{"name":"Chaoren Deng"},{"name":"Lei Huang"},{"name":"Yinkun Liang"},{"name":"Hongyu Xiang"},{"name":"Jie Jiang"},{"name":"Qinghua Wang"},{"name":"Jie Hou"},{"name":"Yucheng Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biochar"},{"word":"Constructed wetland"},{"word":"EPS characterization"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Nitrogen removal"}]},"article411":{"pmid":"31382161","title":"Effects of nano-hydroxyapatite on the formation of biofilms by Streptococcus mutans in two different media.","abs":"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) on biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans, which is actively involved in the initiation of dental caries.","authors":[{"name":"Miseon Park"},{"name":"John B Sutherland"},{"name":"Fatemeh Rafii"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Glucosyltransferase"},{"word":"Nano-hydroxyapatite"},{"word":"Polysaccharide"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"}]},"article412":{"pmid":"31382160","title":"Cytotoxic and antibacterial effect of a red propolis mouthwash, with or without fluoride, on the growth of a cariogenic biofilm.","abs":"To evaluatein vitro the antibacterial activity, the antibiofilm effect and the cytotoxic potential of mouthwashes containing Brazilian red propolis with or without fluoride.","authors":[{"name":"Mariana Leonel Martins"},{"name":"Amanda Souza Nunes Monteiro"},{"name":"Juli Emily Costa Guimarães"},{"name":"Maria Bárbara de Carvalho Torres Guimarães"},{"name":"Raphael Ferreira da Silva"},{"name":"Lúcio Mendes Cabral"},{"name":"Adriana Farah"},{"name":"Juliana dePaula"},{"name":"Maria Teresa Villela Romanos"},{"name":"Lucianne Cople Maia"},{"name":"Yuri Wanderley Cavalcanti"},{"name":"Andréa Fonseca-Gonçalves"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-bacterial agents"},{"word":"Biolfims"},{"word":"Mouthwashes"},{"word":"Propolis"}]},"article413":{"pmid":"31382155","title":"Response of syntrophic aggregates to the magnetite loss in continuous anaerobic bioreactor.","abs":"Increasing studies indicate that magnetite addition could accelerate the methanogenesis via enhancing direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET)-based anaerobic syntrophy.

In this study, two EGSB reactors (RM with magnetite-enhanced sludge, and RB as a control) were operated to investigate the magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the corresponding response of syntrophic aggregates. Results showed that magnetite in RM was washed out gradually in form of iron ions, and a slightly acidic niche was supposed to be the major cause. Nevertheless, candidate DIET partners like Geobacter and Methanothrix along with syntrophic volatile fatty acids (VFAs)-degrading microbes were enriched in RM. In addition, the improved redox activity of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), higher sludge conductivity and electron transport activity suggested that the DIET ability of sludge in RM was still enhanced, which favors the syntrophic metabolism of VFAs. Interestingly, syntrophic partners were loosely combined under the condition of high organic loading rate (OLR) in the presence of magnetite, but with gradual loss of magnetite, dense and active anaerobic granular sludge (AGS) was formed in RM. This study provided a comprehensive understanding of magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the response of syntrophic aggregates. The robust DIET-based syntrophy after magnetite adding could favor the high-efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the future, and further investigations on magnetite resupply and the mechanism of magnetite enriching candidate DIET partners are recommended.","authors":[{"name":"Caiqin Wang"},{"name":"Chen Wang"},{"name":"Luonan Jin"},{"name":"Donghui Lu"},{"name":"Hui Chen"},{"name":"Weitang Zhu"},{"name":"Xiangyang Xu"},{"name":"Liang Zhu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anaerobic bioreactor"},{"word":"Anaerobic granular sludge (AGS)"},{"word":"Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET)"},{"word":"Magnetite behavior"},{"word":"Syntrophic metabolism"}]},"article414":{"pmid":"31382154","title":"Molecular change of dissolved organic matter and patterns of bacterial activity in a stream along a land-use gradient.","abs":"Fluvial networks are globally relevant for the processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM). To investigate the change in molecular DOM diversity along the river course, high-field FTICR mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy of riverine DOM as well as bacterial abundance and activity were measured in a third order stream along a land-use gradient from pristine, agricultural to urban landscapes. DOM composition showed a clear evolution along the river course with an initial decrease of average oxidation and unsaturation followed by an increased relative abundance of CHNO and CHOS compounds introduced by agriculture and waste water, respectively. DOM composition was dominated by rather unsaturated CHO compounds (H/C ≤ 1) in headwaters and by more aliphatic molecules at downstream sites. Oxygenated functional groups shifted from aromatic ethers and hydroxyl groups to aliphatic carboxylic acids and aliphatic hydroxyl groups. This massive dislocation of oxygen significantly increased the diversity of atomic environments in branched aliphatic groups from headwater to downstream DOM. Mass spectra of DOM enabled the detection of compositional relationships to bacterial abundance and activity which was positively related to more aliphatic components (H/C > 1) and negatively related to unsaturated components. FTICR mass and NMR spectra corroborated the initial decline in DOM molecular diversity predicted by the River Continuum Concept (RCC) but demonstrated an anthropogenic increase in the molecular diversity of DOM further downstream. While the high DOM molecular diversity in first order headwater streams was the result of small scale ecosystem plurality, agriculture and waste water treatment introduced many components in the lower reaches. These anthropogenic influences together with massive bacterial oxidation of DOM contributed to a growth of molecular diversity of downstream DOM whose composition and structure differed entirely from those found in pristine headwaters.","authors":[{"name":"Norbert Kamjunke"},{"name":"Norbert Hertkorn"},{"name":"Mourad Harir"},{"name":"Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin"},{"name":"Christian Griebler"},{"name":"Mario Brauns"},{"name":"Wolf von Tümpling"},{"name":"Markus Weitere"},{"name":"Peter Herzsprung"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial production"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"DOM"},{"word":"FTICR MS"},{"word":"NMR"},{"word":"Stream"},{"word":"WWTP"}]},"article415":{"pmid":"31381597","title":"The NDV-3A vaccine protects mice from multidrug resistant Candida auris infection.","abs":"Candida auris is an emerging, multi-drug resistant, health care-associated fungal pathogen. Its predominant prevalence in hospitals and nursing homes indicates its ability to adhere to and colonize the skin, or persist in an environment outside the host-a trait unique from other Candida species. Besides being associated globally with life-threatening disseminated infections, C. auris also poses significant clinical challenges due to its ability to adhere to polymeric surfaces and form highly drug-resistant biofilms. Here, we performed bioinformatic studies to identify the presence of adhesin proteins in C. auris, with sequence as well as 3-D structural homologies to the major adhesin/invasin of C. albicans, Als3. Anti-Als3p antibodies generated by vaccinating mice with NDV-3A (a vaccine based on the N-terminus of Als3 protein formulated with alum) recognized C. auris in vitro, blocked its ability to form biofilms and enhanced macrophage-mediated killing of the fungus. Furthermore, NDV-3A vaccination induced significant levels of C. auris cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immunosuppressed mice from lethal C. auris disseminated infection, compared to the control alum-vaccinated mice. The mechanism of protection is attributed to anti-Als3p antibodies and CD4+ T helper cells activating tissue macrophages. Finally, NDV-3A potentiated the protective efficacy of the antifungal drug micafungin, against C. auris candidemia. Identification of Als3-like adhesins in C. auris makes it a target for immunotherapeutic strategies using NDV-3A, a vaccine with known efficacy against other Candida species and safety as well as efficacy in clinical trials.

However, prosthesis loosening can happen and is related to two major mechanisms: (1) aseptic loosening due to prosthesis micromotion and/or corrosion and release of wear particles from the different components of the implanted material and (2) septic loosening due to chronic prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The aseptic character of prosthesis loosening has been challenged over the years, especially considering that bacteria can persist in biofilms and be overlooked during diagnosis. Histological studies on periprosthetic tissue samples reported that macrophages are the principle cells associated with aseptic loosening due to wear debris. They produce cytokines and favor an inflammatory environment that induces formation and activation of osteoclasts, leading to bone resorption and periprosthetic osteolysis. In PJIs, the presence of infiltrates of polymorphonuclear neutrophils is a major criterion for histological diagnosis. Neutrophils are colocalized with osteoclasts and zones of osteolysis. A similar inflammatory environment also develops, leading to bone resorption through osteoclasts. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis are the main staphylococci observed in PJIs. They share the common feature to form biofilm. For S. aureus and S. epidermidis, the interaction between biofilm and immunes cells (macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils) differs regarding the species. Indeed, the composition of extracellular matrix of biofilm seems to impact the interaction with immune cells. Recent papers also reported the major role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in biofilm-associated PJIs with S. aureus. These cells prevent lymphocyte infiltration and facilitate biofilm persistence. Moreover, the role of T lymphocytes is still unclear and potentially underestimates. In this review, after introducing the cellular mechanism of aseptic and septic loosening, we will focus on the interrelationships between staphylococcal biofilm, immune cells, and bone cells.","authors":[{"name":"Jérôme Josse"},{"name":"Florent Valour"},{"name":"Yousef Maali"},{"name":"Alan Diot"},{"name":"Cécile Batailler"},{"name":"Tristan Ferry"},{"name":"Frédéric Laurent"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"osteoblast"},{"word":"osteoclast"},{"word":"polymorphonuclear neutrophil"},{"word":"prosthesis loosening"},{"word":"prosthetic joint infection"}]},"article422":{"pmid":"31378975","title":"Supportive periodontal therapy in moderate-to-severe periodontitis patients: A two-year randomized clinical trial.","abs":"Evaluate supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) consisting of oral prophylaxis with oral hygiene instructions as sole intervention (test) or combined with subgingival instrumentation removing/disrupting the subgingival biofilm (control).","authors":[{"name":"Patrícia Daniela Melchiors Angst"},{"name":"Amanda Finger Stadler"},{"name":"Marina Mendez"},{"name":"Rui Vicente Oppermann"},{"name":"Ubele van der Velden"},{"name":"Sabrina Carvalho Gomes"}],"keywords":[{"word":"dental scaling"},{"word":"long-term care"},{"word":"maintenance"},{"word":"oral prophylaxis"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article423":{"pmid":"31378837","title":"Improvement of menaquinone-7 production by Bacillus subtilis natto in a novel residue-free medium by increasing the redox potential.","abs":"Bacillus subtilis natto is a GRAS bacterium.

Therefore, the most reported methods for biofilm quantification in the MBBR literature were compared using three different carriers. The results revealed that the performance of each method was biased depending on the carrier type and shape. Moreover, differences in total attached solids (TAS) concentrations varied from 13% up to more than 90%, depending on the employed method for a given carrier. Overall, direct weighing of the carrier containing the biofilm, accounting for the clean carrier weight, and manual extraction of the biofilm, preceded or not by sonication for at least 15 min, were the most suitable techniques for assessing TAS and the volatile/total solids ratio in non-porous medias, respectively. The results here presented may be used as a frame of reference for standardization of the methods for assessing the biofilm mass in MBBR carriers.","authors":[{"name":"Diego Luiz Fonseca"},{"name":"João Paulo Bassin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Attached solids per surface"},{"word":"Attached solids quantification"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Moving-bed biofilm reactor"}]},"article435":{"pmid":"31375298","title":"Multicenter Outbreak of Gram-Negative Bloodstream Infections in Hemodialysis Patients.","abs":"Contaminated water and other fluids are increasingly recognized to be associated with health care-associated infections.

Many of these infections are associated with bacterial resistance to antibiotics and hence, alternative treatments are critically needed. The objective of this study was to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of a gallium (Ga)-based particle coated with N-Acetyl Cysteine (Ga-NAC) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Our studies showed the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of PAO1 treated with Ga-NAC was 1 µg/mL. Cytotoxicity of Ga-NAC against multiple cell lines was determined with no cytotoxicity observed up to concentrations of 2000 µg/mL (metal concentration), indicating a high therapeutic window. To elucidate potential antibacterial modes of action, Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), infrared spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used.

At a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, tyrosol decreased QS-regulated violacein production in Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 by 53.5% and decreased QS-regulated pyocyanin production, elastase activity and proteolytic activity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 by 63.3%, 57.8% and 9.9%, respectively.

The rapid urbanization in China and other countries is boosting the construction of the deep tunnel sewer systems. However, the formation of sulfide, which induces serious odor nuisance and sewer corrosion, has not been investigated in such sewer systems. Taking a real Sewage Conveyance System (SCS) with 23.3 km-long and 70-160 m-deep interconnected tunnels in Hong Kong as a representative example, this study conducted experimental and modelling investigations to evaluate the sulfide formation in the mega-sized deep tunnel sewer systems. The field investigation revealed that the daily sulfide production rate in the SCS was up to 1410 kg S/d, suggesting the substantial sulfide production during the long-distance and long-time sewage conveyance. Using a validated Biofilm-Initiated Sewer Process Model (BISM), the sulfide formation in the SCS under the influences of various factors, which are relevant to the situations in China and other countries, were simulated. The simulation results showed that 89% of the total sulfide production in the SCS was generated in the two tunnels with long hydraulic retention times (HRT) and large flowrates. The specific sulfide formation rates exhibited a linear relationship with HRT (R","authors":[{"name":"Zhen-Sheng Liang"},{"name":"Jianliang Sun"},{"name":"Henry Kwok-Ming Chau"},{"name":"Echo I-Man Leong"},{"name":"Di Wu"},{"name":"Guang-Hao Chen"},{"name":"Feng Jiang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Deep tunnel sewer systems"},{"word":"Hydrogen sulfide"},{"word":"Sewer management"},{"word":"Sewer modelling"}]},"article439":{"pmid":"31374264","title":"Anti-cancer, anti-biofilm, and anti-inflammatory properties of hen's albumen: A photodynamic approach.","abs":"The albumen plays a major role in the protection of eggs against microorganisms.
