Increasing resistance to antibiotics, is one of the most urgent challenge to medicine worldwide and requires searching for new, innovative and more efficient medical strategies. One of the opportunities for the cure of leg ulcers is photodynamic inactivation (PDI), which has been widely used in the treatment of various bacterial, fungal and viral infections. PDI encompasses three independently non-toxic elements: a photosensitizer (PS), light of an appropriate wavelength, and molecular oxygen that lead to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for inactivation of microorganisms, including those present in the form of biofilm in chronic wounds. PDI, due to its multiple mechanism of action, low invasiveness and lack of significant side effects, offers an interesting potential alternative for combating the microbial resistance in the infected leg ulcers. It also significantly decreases the area of leg ulcers, or may even heal them completely and thus remarkably improves a patient's health.","authors":[{"name":"Aleksandra Kawczyk-Krupka"},{"name":"Barbara Pucelik"},{"name":"Anna Międzybrodzka"},{"name":"Aleksander R Sieroń"},{"name":"Janusz M Dąbrowski"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Leg ulcers"},{"word":"Localized infections"},{"word":"Multi-drug resistance"},{"word":"Photodynamic inactivation (PDI)"},{"word":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT)"},{"word":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"29730068","title":"Biofilm testing of microbiota: An essential step during corneal scrap examination in Egyptian acanthamoebic keratitis cases.","abs":"To detect co-infections in the culture-proven acanthamoebic keratitis (AK) cases, and to test the capability of biofilm formation in the isolated microbiota.

With high activity against both planktonic cells and biofilms, Lst has the potential to be used in industrial products, such as commercial cleansers, for decontamination. However, Lst is inhibited in the presence of monoethanolamine (MEA), a chemical widely used in cleaning solutions and pharmaceuticals, and the underlying mechanism of inhibition remains unknown. In this study, we examined the cell binding and killing capabilities of Lst against S. aureus ATCC 6538 in buffered salt solution with MEA at different pH values (7.5 to 10.5) and discovered that only the unprotonated form of MEA inhibited Lst binding to the cell surface, leading to low Lst activity, despite retention of its secondary structure. This reduced enzyme activity could be largely recovered via a reduction in wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis through tunicamycin treatment, indicating that the suppression of Lst activity was dependent on the presence and amount of WTA. We propose that the decreased cell binding and killing capabilities of Lst are associated with the influence of uncharged MEA on the conformation of WTA.

Mechanical performance was evaluated over a range of filler loading, and theoretical models derived from Einstein, Guth, Thomas and Quemade were chosen to predict the modulus of the nanoformulations. All the models gave better fitting at lower filler content, which could be due to restricted mobility of the polymer chains by the constrained zone/interfacial rigid amorphous zone and also due to stress absorption by the highly energized NPs.

A previous study identified the transcriptional regulator of pheromone response in both the white and opaque states as Cph1 because deletion of this gene abolished both pheromone-induced cell adhesion in white cells and sexual mating in opaque cells. To further explore how these cell types exhibit distinct biological outputs upon pheromone stimulation, we selected five Cph1-regulated genes with significant expression during the pheromone response in the white state but not the opaque state. These phase-specific pheromone-induced genes are ORF19.1539, ORF19.1725, ORF19.2430, ORF19.2691 and ORF19.5557. Deletion of each gene revealed that orf19.1539Δ, orf19.1725Δ, orf19.2430Δ and orf19.5557Δ showed significant decreases in pheromone-stimulated cell adhesion in the white state but retained normal mating competency in the opaque state, indicating that a particular role in white cell pheromone response is mediated by these four genes. Interestingly, the defects of orf19.1725Δ in pheromone-stimulated cell adhesion also abolished conventional biofilms and hyphal growth. Zebrafish egg infection assays further demonstrated that ORF19.1725 is involved in cell adhesion, penetration and virulence.

NE dilutions ranging from 125 to 225 reduced adhesion by from 61.8 to 99.9% in NE-treated groups (p<.05) as determined by MBC. Four-day-old A. baumannii biofilms were treated with NE; LIVE/DEAD staining showed dead cell intensity of 56.2-92.0% in NE-treated groups. After NE treatment and observation by SEM, cell surfaces appeared to be remarkably disintegrated. Irregular boundaries were observed and margins of cell walls were unclear. The anti-adherence, anti-biofilm and morphological disruption effects of NE suggest that this material could be useful for the development of promising antimicrobial agents.","authors":[{"name":"Karthikeyan Ramalingam"},{"name":"Valerie A Lee"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"EDTA"},{"word":"antimicrobial agents"},{"word":"nanoemulsion"}]},"article49":{"pmid":"29719973","title":"Efficacy of sodium dodecyl sulphate and natural extracts against E. coli biofilm.","abs":"The aim of this study was to determine and compare the efficacy of a standard cleaning agent, sodium dodecyl sulphate, and natural extracts from pomegranate peel grape skin and bay laurel leaf against E. coli biofilm.

Antimicrobial polymers, whose designs are inspired from antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), are described with an emphasis on structure-activity analysis. Additionally, antibiofilm activity and in vivo efficacy are delineated to elucidate the real potential of these antimicrobial polymers as possible therapeutics. Antimicrobial hydrogels, prepared from either inherently antimicrobial polymers or biocide-loaded into polymer-derived hydrogel matrix, are elaborated followed by various strategies to engineer polymer-coated antimicrobial surfaces.

We purified and mapped 503 transcripts directly bound by RsmN in P. aeruginosa. About 200 of the mRNAs identified encode proteins of demonstrated function including some determining acute and chronic virulence traits. For example, RsmN reduces biofilm development both directly and indirectly via multiple pathways, involving control of Pel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and c-di-GMP levels. The RsmN targets identified are also shared with RsmA, although deletion of rsmN generally results in less pronounced phenotypes than those observed for ΔrsmA or ΔrsmArsmNind mutants, probably as a consequence of different binding affinities. Targets newly identified for the Rsm system include the small non-coding RNA CrcZ involved in carbon catabolite repression, for which differential binding of RsmN and RsmA to specific CrcZ regions is demonstrated.

In some cases, the biofilms skew T-cell response toward a balance that allows a stalemate between the host and the pathogen, in which the infection can become persistent.

However, the individual molecular mechanism of HrpR or HrpS has not been fully understood. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput DNA sequencing, we found that HrpR, HrpS, and HrpL had four, 47, and 31 targets on the genome, respectively. HrpS directly bound to the promoter regions of a group of T3SS genes and non-T3SS genes. HrpS independently regulated these genes in a hrpL deletion strain.

In this study, a dynamic sessile-droplet habitat is introduced, a simple method which cultivates biofilms on micropatterns with diameters of tens to hundreds of micrometers in a microfluidic channel. Nanoliter plugs are utilized, spaced by immiscible carrier oil to initiate and support the growth of an array of biofilms, anchored on and spatially confined to the micropatterns arranged on the bottom surface of the microchannel, while planktonic or dispersal cells are flushed away by shear force of aqueous plugs. The performance of the aforementioned method of cultivating biofilms is demonstrated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and its derived mutants, and quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing of PAO1 biofilms. This method could significantly eliminate corner effects, avoid microchannel clogging, and constrain the growth of biofilms for long-term observations.

CodY DNA-binding activity is high when GTP and ILV are abundant. When GTP and ILV are limited, CodY's affinity for DNA drops, altering expression of CodY-regulated targets. In this work, we investigated the impact of guanine nucleotides (GNs) on S. aureus physiology and CodY activity by constructing a guaA null mutant (ΔguaA strain). De novo biosynthesis of guanine monophosphate is abolished due to the guaA mutation; thus, the mutant cells require exogenous guanosine for growth. We also found that CodY activity was reduced when we knocked out guaA, activating the Agr two-component system and increasing secreted protease activity. Notably, in a rich, complex medium, we detected an increase in alternative sigma factor B activity in the ΔguaA mutant, which results in a 5-fold increase in production of the antioxidant pigment staphyloxanthin. Under biologically relevant flow conditions, ΔguaA cells failed to form robust biofilms when limited for guanine or guanosine. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of the S. aureus transcriptome during growth in guanosine-limited chemostats revealed substantial CodY-dependent and -independent alterations of gene expression profiles. Importantly, these changes increase production of proteases and δ-toxin, suggesting that S. aureus exhibits a more invasive lifestyle when limited for guanosine.

Briefly, mature S. aureus biofilms were incubated with ALA and then exposed to light. Subsequently, the antibacterial effect of ALA-PDT on S. aureus biofilm was quantified by calculating the colony forming units (CFUs) and visualized by viability fluorescent staining via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Representative results demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect of ALA-PDT on S. aureus biofilms. This protocol is simple and can be used to develop an in vitro model to study the treatment of S. aureus biofilms with ALA-PDT.

Colonization begins with initial surface contact, which is often mediated by bacterial surface appendages called pili. Type IV Tad pili are widely distributed in the Vibrionaceae, but evidence for a physiological role for these structures is scant. The V. vulnificus genome codes for three distinct tad loci. Recently, a positive correlation was demonstrated between the expression of tad-3 and the phenotypes of a V. vulnificus descendent (NT) that exhibited increased biofilm formation, auto-aggregation, and oyster colonization relative to its parent. However, the mechanism by which tad pilus expression promoted these phenotypes was not determined. Here, we show that deletion of the tad pilin gene (flp) altered the near-surface motility profile of NT cells from high curvature, orbital retracing patterns characteristic of cells actively probing the surface to low curvature traces indicative of wandering and diminished bacteria-surface interactions. The NT flp pilin mutant also exhibited decreased initial surface attachment, attenuated auto-aggregation and formed fragile biofilms that disintegrated under hydrodynamic flow. Thus, the tad-3 locus, designated iam, promoted initial surface attachment, auto-aggregation and resistance to mechanical clearance of V. vulnificus biofilms.

Bacterial cells embedded in biofilms are inherently recalcitrant to antimicrobials, compared to cells existing in a planktonic state, and are notoriously difficult to eradicate once formed. Avenues to tackle biofilms thus far have largely focussed on attempting to disrupt the initial stages of biofilm formation, including adhesion and maturation of the biofilm. Such an approach is advantageous as the concentrations required to inhibit formation of biofilms are generally much lower than removing a fully established biofilm. The crisis of antibiotic resistance in clinical settings worldwide has been further exacerbated by the ability of certain pathogenic bacteria to form biofilms. Perhaps the most notorious biofilm formers described from a clinical viewpoint have been methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Gardnerella vaginalis and Streptococcus mutans, the latter of which is found in oral biofilms. Due to the dearth of novel antibiotics in recent decades, compounded by the increasing rate of emergence of resistance amongst pathogens with a propensity for biofilm formation, solutions are urgently required to mitigate these crises. Bacteriocins are a class of antimicrobial peptides, which are ribosomally synthesised and often are more potent than their antibiotic counterparts.

The fungal burden in the kidney of mice increased in the PF alone and PF + FCZ treated groups compared with the Infected alone or FCZ treated group. Furthermore, it was found that the PF and PF + FCZ treated groups showed significantly decreased levels of serum interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-22, and an increased level of serum IL-4; PF had no effect on the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).

The present study examined the effects of arsenic trioxide (30 mg/kg)- and copper sulfate (300 mg/kg)-mixed foods, administered alone or in combination for 12 weeks, on various biochemical indices of oxidative stress and immunity in the small intestines of Hy-line chickens. The results showed that for the first four weeks of exposure, both the redox and immune systems were unaffected. Subsequently, exposure to arsenic or copper significantly increased the level of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde and ability of anti-hydroxy radical) concomitant with a collapse of the antioxidant system (catalase and glutathione peroxidase), in a time-dependent manner. An increase in the mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory indicators (nuclear factor kappa B, cyclooxygenases-2, tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E2 synthases) with a definite tendency toward Th1 (Th, helper T cell) cytokines was observed in both arsenic and copper treated chickens. Histologically, the destruction of the biofilm structure and inflammatory infiltrates was observed. Thus, in the intestine, heat shock proteins play protective roles against tissue damage. In some cases, we observed that the tissues of the small intestine were more sensitive to arsenic than to copper. Moreover, co-exposure induced more serious intestinal toxicity than single treatment group, and this mechanism needs further exploration.","authors":[{"name":"Yu Wang"},{"name":"Hongjing Zhao"},{"name":"Juanjuan Liu"},{"name":"Yizhi Shao"},{"name":"Jinglun Li"},{"name":"Liyang Luo"},{"name":"Mingwei Xing"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Arsenic"},{"word":"Copper"},{"word":"Heat shock response"},{"word":"Immunotoxicity"},{"word":"Inflammatory"},{"word":"Oxidative stress"}]},"article97":{"pmid":"29705201","title":"Fungal communities associated with Evernia prunastri, Ramalina fastigiata and Pleurosticta acetabulum: Three epiphytic lichens potentially active against Candida biofilms.","abs":"Fungal communities associated to three epiphytic lichens active against Candida, were investigated using culture-based methods We hypothetized that associated fungi would contribute to lichens activities. The ability of specific fungi to grow inside or outside lichens was investigated. To detect biogenesis pathways involved in the production of secondary metabolites, genes coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase I (PKS I) were screened by PCR from fungal DNA extracts. Both endo and epilichenic communities were isolated from two fructicose (Evernia prunastri and Ramalina fastigiata) and one foliose (Pleurosticta acetabulum) lichens. A total of 86 endolichenic and 114 epilichenic isolates were obtained, corresponding to 18 and 24 phylogenetic groups respectively suggesting a wide diversity of fungi. The communities and the species richness were distinct between the three lichens which hosted potentially new fungal species. Additionally, the endo- and epilichenic communities differed in their composition: Sordariomycetes were particularly abundant among endolichenic fungi and Dothideomycetes among epilichenic fungi. Only a few fungi colonized both habitats, such as S. fimicola, Cladosporium sp1 and Botrytis cinerea. Interestingly, Nemania serpens (with several genotypes) was the most abundant endolichenic fungus (53% of isolates) and was shared by the three lichens. Finally, 12 out of 36 phylogenetic groups revealed the presence of genes coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPs) and polyketide synthase I (PKS I). This study shows that common lichens are reservoirs of diverse fungal communities, which could potentially contribute to global activity of the lichen and, therefore, deserve to be isolated for further chemical studies.","authors":[{"name":"Aurélie Lagarde"},{"name":"Patricia Jargeat"},{"name":"Mélanie Roy"},{"name":"Marion Girardot"},{"name":"Christine Imbert"},{"name":"Marion Millot"},{"name":"Lengo Mambu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Barcoding"},{"word":"Endolichenic"},{"word":"Epilichenic fungi"},{"word":"NRPs and PKS I genes"},{"word":"Sordariomycetes"},{"word":"Xylariaceae"}]},"article98":{"pmid":"29704883","title":"EPS production by Propionibacterium freudenreichii facilitates its immobilization for propionic acid production.","abs":"Immobilization of microbial cells is a useful strategy for developing high cell density bioreactors with improved stability and productivity for production of different chemicals.

A critical question for understanding and managing such risks is what levels of antibiotics are needed to select for resistance in complex bacterial communities. Here, we address this question by examining the phenotypic and genotypic profiles of aquatic communities exposed to ciprofloxacin, also evaluating the within-species selection of resistant E. coli in complex communities. The taxonomic composition was significantly altered at ciprofloxacin exposure concentrations down to 1 μg/L. Shotgun metagenomic analysis indicated that mobile quinolone resistance determinants (qnrD, qnrS and qnrB) were enriched as a direct consequence of ciprofloxacin exposure from 1 μg/L or higher. Only at 5-10 μg/L resistant E.coli increased relative to their sensitive counterparts. These resistant E. coli predominantly harbored non-transferrable, chromosomal triple mutations (gyrA S83 L, D87N and parC S80I), which confer high-level resistance. In a controlled experimental setup such as this, we interpret effects on taxonomic composition and enrichment of mobile quinolone resistance genes as relevant indicators of risk. Hence, the lowest observed effect concentration for resistance selection in complex communities by ciprofloxacin was 1 μg/L and the corresponding no observed effect concentration 0.1 μg/L. These findings can be used to define and implement discharge or surface water limits to reduce risks for selection of antibiotic resistance in the environment.","authors":[{"name":"Nadine Kraupner"},{"name":"Stefan Ebmeyer"},{"name":"Johan Bengtsson-Palme"},{"name":"Jerker Fick"},{"name":"Erik Kristiansson"},{"name":"Carl-Fredrik Flach"},{"name":"D G Joakim Larsson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Environmental emission limits"},{"word":"LOEC"},{"word":"NOEC"}]},"article100":{"pmid":"29704774","title":"Efficacy of HLE-a multidrug efflux-pump inhibitor-as a disinfectant against surface bacteria.","abs":"We evaluated the efficacy of a new disinfectant product, HLE, to inhibit multiple species of planktonic and biofilm bacterial cultures.

Campylobacter, Salmonella, as well as Yersinia enterocolitica and Listeria monocytogenes may dwell in livestock (poultry, cattle, and swine) but are also found in wild animals, pets, fish, and rodents. Animals, often being asymptomatic carriers of pathogens, excrete them with faeces, thus delivering them to the environment. Therefore, pathogens may invade new individuals, as well as reside on vegetables and fruits. Pathogenic bacteria also penetrate food production areas and may remain there in the form of a biofilm covering the surfaces of machines and equipment. A common occurrence of microbes in food products, as well as their improper or careless processing, leads to common poisonings. Symptoms of foodborne infections may be mild, sometimes flu-like, but they also may be accompanied by severe complications, some even fatal.

This should be taken into account, because often odontogenic maxillary sinusitis is misdiagnosed with common sinusitis, and only in 77 % such patients are examined by both dental specialist and otorhynolaryngologist. Study of causes of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis revealed that now iatrogenic impact prevails over other causes, which had been previously considered as main causes of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis. Especially endodontic treatment and implantation surgery are major causes of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis in present time, due to increasing incidence of perforation and damage of sinus by filling materials, bone or tooth particles, and implants. Anatomical structure of dental-sinus border area, and volume of endodontic treatment and implanting procedures, determines last ones as causative triggers due to development of complications and inflammatory processes. Microbial flora is mostly presented by anaerobic microorganisms; at the same time aerobic and fungal organisms are found in the microscopy of histology of patients with odontogenic maxillary sinusitis. At the same time, polymicrobial associations show high resistance to wide spectrum of antimicrobial medications.

While most research has been focused on identifying one or more specific determinants of these diseases, the results have provided limited predictive value and have not been able to explain the variation in the distribution of these diseases observed in epidemiological or clinical studies. Drawing on existing knowledge about the nature of the oral microbiota, we suggest that a stochastic model based on the Weiner process provides simple and parsimonious explanations for the pathogenesis of both caries and periodontitis, making few assumptions, and providing explanations for phenomena that have hitherto proved difficult, or have required complex arguments, to explain. These diseases occur as the result of the dental hard tissues and periodontal tissues integrating the random noise caused by normal metabolic activities of commensal microorganisms in the dental biofilm. The processes that result in the progression and regression of caries and periodontitis may be considered as natural, rather than pathological, even if, when left unchecked over long periods of time, they can result in the development of pathologies. The likelihood of progression or regression can be influenced by other determinants, but these processes will nevertheless occur in the absence of such influences. The distributional characteristics of the model approximate the findings of epidemiological studies indicating that, for both caries and periodontitis, there will be few sites affected in the early period after the eruption of the permanent dentition, but in those older there is an almost linear relationship with increasing age; furthermore, the longer a site survives without being affected, the less likely that it will be affected.

Thus far, studies have reported conflicting results on the impact of the electrode surface roughness on the growth and current production of biofilms.

All microbial electrodes showed similar startup time, maximum current density, charge transport ability across the biofilm and biomass production. Interestingly, an increase in the average surface cavity depth was observed for the biofilm top layer as a function of the electrode surface roughness (from 7 μm to 16 μm for a surface roughness of 5 nm to 682 nm, respectively). These results indicated that the surface roughness at a sub-microscale does not significantly impact the attachment or current production of mixed culture anodic biofilms on glassy carbon.

An amorphous P-rich phase is formed at the initial stages of Ba bioaccumulation, which evolves into barite crystals. This supports that in high productivity regions where large amounts of organic matter are subjected to bacterial degradation, the abundant EPS would serve to bind the necessary Ba and form nucleation sites leading to barite precipitation. This also provides new insights into barite precipitation and opens an exciting field to explore the role of EPS in mineral precipitation in the ocean.","authors":[{"name":"Francisca Martinez-Ruiz"},{"name":"Fadwa Jroundi"},{"name":"Adina Paytan"},{"name":"Isabel Guerra-Tschuschke"},{"name":"María Del Mar Abad"},{"name":"María Teresa González-Muñoz"}],"keywords":[]},"article142":{"pmid":"29691368","title":"A novel SigB(Q225P) mutation in Staphylococcus aureus retains virulence but promotes biofilm formation.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen that produces abundant virulence factors, which cause various diseases that burden human health worldwide. The stress response regulon called sigma factor B (SigB) is a well-characterized global regulator that is involved in the regulation of S. aureus virulence, pigmentation, and biofilm formation. However, the regulatory network upon SigB in S. aureus is incompletely described. Here, we identified a novel substitution mutation, SigB(Q225P), which contributed the nonpigmented phenotype of S. aureus. The S. aureus mutant carrying SigB(Q225P) substitution lacks staphyloxanthin, a key virulence factor in protecting bacteria from host-oxidant killing, but retains bacterial pathogenicity with pleiotropic alterations in virulence factors, resulting in similar lethality and abscess formation ability in animal models. We also reported the SigB(Q225P) promotion of biofilm formation in S. aureus. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that the expression of nuc gene, which encodes thermonuclease, was significantly downregulated, resulting in accumulation of eDNA in the biofilm of SigB(Q225P) mutant strain. LacZ reporter assay showed that SigB(Q225P) influenced the activity of nuc promoter. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay revealed that both SigB and SigB(Q225P) proteins could directly bind to nuc gene promoter; however, the binding activity decreased for SigB(Q225P). Our data renewed the understanding of the relationship between S. aureus golden pigment and its virulence and suggested that a single substitution mutation in SigB might enhance the biofilm formation of S. aureus by directly downregulating nuc expression.","authors":[{"name":"Hui Liu"},{"name":"Weilong Shang"},{"name":"Zhen Hu"},{"name":"Ying Zheng"},{"name":"Jizhen Yuan"},{"name":"Qiwen Hu"},{"name":"Huagang Peng"},{"name":"Xinyu Cai"},{"name":"Li Tan"},{"name":"Shu Li"},{"name":"Junmin Zhu"},{"name":"Ming Li"},{"name":"Xiaomei Hu"},{"name":"Renjie Zhou"},{"name":"Xiancai Rao"},{"name":"Yi Yang"}],"keywords":[]},"article143":{"pmid":"29691334","title":"Forward Genetic Dissection of Biofilm Development by Fusobacterium nucleatum: Novel Functions of Cell Division Proteins FtsX and EnvC.","abs":"Fusobacterium nucleatum is a key member of the human oral biofilm.

To facilitate basic studies of fusobacterial virulence, we describe here a versatile transposon mutagenesis procedure and a pilot screen for mutants defective in biofilm formation. Out of 10 independent biofilm-defective mutants isolated, the affected genes included the homologs of the Escherichia coli cell division proteins FtsX and EnvC, the electron transport protein RnfA, and four proteins with unknown functions. Next, a facile new gene deletion method demonstrated that nonpolar, in-frame deletion of ftsX or envC produces viable bacteria that are highly filamentous due to defective cell division. Transmission electron and cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the ΔftsX and ΔenvC mutant cells remain joined with apparent constriction, and scanning electron microscopy (EM) uncovered a smooth cell surface without the microfolds present in wild-type cells. FtsX and EnvC proteins interact with each other as well as a common set of interacting partners, many with unknown function. Last, biofilm development is altered when cell division is blocked by MinC overproduction; however, unlike the phenotypes of ΔftsX and ΔenvC mutants, a weakly adherent biofilm is formed, and the wild-type rugged cell surface is maintained. Therefore, FtsX and EnvC may perform novel functions in Fusobacterium cell biology. This is the first report of an unbiased approach to uncover genetic determinants of fusobacterial biofilm development. It points to an intriguing link among cytokinesis, cell surface dynamics, and biofilm formation, whose molecular underpinnings remain to be elucidated.","authors":[{"name":"Chenggang Wu"},{"name":"Abu Amar Mohamed Al Mamun"},{"name":"Truc Thanh Luong"},{"name":"Bo Hu"},{"name":"Jianhua Gu"},{"name":"Ju Huck Lee"},{"name":"Melissa D'Amore"},{"name":"Asis Das"},{"name":"Hung Ton-That"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EnvC"},{"word":"FtsX"},{"word":"Fusobacterium nucleatum"},{"word":"allelic exchange"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cell division"},{"word":"coaggregation"},{"word":"electron microscopy"},{"word":"filamentation"},{"word":"outer membrane"}]},"article144":{"pmid":"29691333","title":"Community Development between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Candida albicans Mediated by InlJ and Als3.","abs":"The pleiomorphic yeast Candida albicans is a significant pathogen in immunocompromised individuals.

We hypothesize that this was sufficient to ameliorate the associated fitness costs of plasmid carriage, as pKpQIL plasmids were maintained without selection pressure. The dogma that removal of selection pressure (e.g., antimicrobial exposure) results in plasmid loss due to bacterial fitness costs is not true for all plasmid/host combinations.

Here, we present such a method, combining 3D printing with genetic engineering. We prototyped a low-cost 3D printer that prints bioink, a suspension of bacteria in a solution of alginate that solidifies on a calcium-containing substrate. We 3D-printed Escherichia coli in different shapes and in discrete layers, after which the cells survived in the printing matrix for at least 1 week. When printed bacteria were induced to form curli fibers, the major proteinaceous extracellular component of E. coli biofilms, they remained adherent to the printing substrate and stably spatially patterned even after treatment with a matrix-dissolving agent, indicating that a biofilm-mimicking structure had formed. This work is the first demonstration of patterned, biofilm-inspired living materials that are produced by genetic control over curli formation in combination with spatial control by 3D printing.

Recent observations have shown that plant pathogenic bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas, exist in a range of natural environments away from their natural plant host e.g., water courses, soil, non-host plants. This exposes them to a variety of eukaryotic predators such as nematodes, insects and amoebae present in the environment. Nematodes and amoeba in particular are bacterial predators while insect herbivores may act as indirect predators, ingesting bacteria on plant tissue. We therefore postulated that bacteria are probably under selective pressure to avoid or survive predation and have therefore developed appropriate coping mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that plant pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae are able to cope with predation pressure and found that three pathovars show weak, but significant resistance or toxicity. To identify the gene systems that contribute to resistance or toxicity we applied a heterologous screening technique, called Rapid Virulence Annotation (RVA), for anti-predation and toxicity mechanisms. Three cosmid libraries for P. syringae pv. aesculi, pv. tomato and pv. phaseolicola, of approximately 2000 cosmids each, were screened in the susceptible/non-toxic bacterium Escherichia coli against nematode, amoebae and an insect. A number of potential conserved and unique genes were identified which included genes encoding haemolysins, biofilm formation, motility and adhesion. These data provide the first multi-pathovar comparative insight to how plant pathogens cope with different predation pressures and infection of an insect gut and provide a foundation for further study into the function of selected genes and their role in ecological success.","authors":[{"name":"Federico Dorati"},{"name":"Glyn A Barrett"},{"name":"Maria Sanchez-Contreras"},{"name":"Tanya Arseneault"},{"name":"Mateo San José"},{"name":"David J Studholme"},{"name":"Jesús Murillo"},{"name":"Primitivo Caballero"},{"name":"Nicholas R Waterfield"},{"name":"Dawn L Arnold"},{"name":"Liz J Shaw"},{"name":"Robert W Jackson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acanthamoeba polyphaga"},{"word":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"word":"Galleria mellonella"},{"word":"Pseudomonas syringae"},{"word":"RVA"},{"word":"anti-predation"},{"word":"pathogen"},{"word":"rapid virulence annotation"}]},"article149":{"pmid":"29689455","title":"Impact of modified diamond-like carbon coatings on the spatial organization and disinfection of mixed-biofilms composed of Escherichia coli and Pantoea agglomerans industrial isolates.","abs":"This work investigated the effects of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on the architecture and biocide reactivity of dual-species biofilms mimicking food processing contaminants.

Subgingival biofilm samples were collected from 40 cattle with periodontitis and 38 periodontally healthy animals. In total, 1923 OTUs were identified and classified into 395 genera or higher taxa. Microbial profiles in health differed significantly from periodontitis in their composition (p < 0.0001, F = 5.30; PERMANOVA) but no statistically significant differences were observed in the diversity of healthy and periodontitis microbiomes. The most prevalent taxa in health were Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and Actinobacteria, whereas in disease these were Prevotella, Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas. The most discriminative taxa in health were Gastranaerophilales, Planifilum and Burkholderia, and in disease these were Elusimicrobia, Synergistes and Propionivibrio. In conclusion, statistically significant difference exists between the microbiome in bovine oral health and periodontitis, with populations showing 72.6% dissimilarity. The diversity of the bacteria found in health and periodontitis were similar and bacteria recognised as periodontal pathogens showed increased abundance in disease. In this context, the main components of bacterial homeostasis in the biofilm of healthy sites and of dysbiosis in periodontal lesions provide unprecedented indicators for the evolution of knowledge about bovine periodontitis.","authors":[{"name":"Ana C Borsanelli"},{"name":"David F Lappin"},{"name":"Lorenzo Viora"},{"name":"David Bennett"},{"name":"Iveraldo S Dutra"},{"name":"Bernd W Brandt"},{"name":"Marcello P Riggio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Cattle"},{"word":"High-throughput sequencing"},{"word":"Microbiome"},{"word":"Periodontal disease"}]},"article163":{"pmid":"29685049","title":"Influence of subinhibitory antibiotic concentration on Streptococcus pyogenes adherence and biofilm production.","abs":"In this study, the focus was on the effects of sub-MICs of the antibiotics on adherence, hydrophobicity, and biofilm formation by two groups of Streptococcus pyogenes strains, which were responsible for different clinical cases.

Evaluation of their antimicrobial properties and anti-biofilm activities.","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides, also called Host Defence Peptides (HDPs), are effectors of innate immune response found in all living organisms. In a previous report, we have identified by chemical fragmentation, and characterized the first cryptic antimicrobial peptide in PD-L4, a type 1 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) from leaves of Phytolacca dioica L. We applied a recently developed bioinformatic approach to a further member of the differently expressed pool of type 1 RIPs from P. dioica (PD-L1/2), and identified two novel putative cryptic HDPs in its N-terminal domain. These two peptides, here named IKY31 and IKY23, exhibit antibacterial activities against planktonic bacterial cells and, interestingly, significant anti-biofilm properties against two Gram-negative strains. Here, we describe that PD-L1/2 derived peptides are able to induce a strong dose-dependent reduction in biofilm biomass, affect biofilm thickness and, in the case of IKY31, interfere with cell-to-cell adhesion, likely by affecting biofilm structural components. In addition to these findings, we found that both PD-L1/2 derived peptides are able to assume stable helical conformations in the presence of membrane mimicking agents (SDS and TFE) and intriguingly beta structures when incubated with extracellular bacterial wall components (LPS and alginate). Overall, the data collected in this work provide further evidence of the importance of cryptic peptides derived from type 1 RIPs in host/pathogen interactions, especially under pathophysiological conditions induced by biofilm forming bacteria. This suggests a new possible role of RIPs as precursors of antimicrobial and anti-biofilm agents, likely released upon defensive proteolytic processes, which may be involved in plant homeostasis.","authors":[{"name":"Elio Pizzo"},{"name":"Katia Pane"},{"name":"Andrea Bosso"},{"name":"Nicola Landi"},{"name":"Sara Ragucci"},{"name":"Rosita Russo"},{"name":"Rosa Gaglione"},{"name":"Marcelo D T Torres"},{"name":"Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez"},{"name":"Angela Arciello"},{"name":"Alberto Di Donato"},{"name":"Eugenio Notomista"},{"name":"Antimo Di Maro"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Circular dichroism"},{"word":"Phytolacca dioica"},{"word":"Ribosome inactivating proteins"}]},"article168":{"pmid":"29684195","title":"A confocal microscopy based method to monitor extracellular pH in fungal biofilms.","abs":"pH in fungal biofilms is important for a variety of fungal infections and industrial applications involving fungal biofilms, but to date, it has never been measured directly inside the biofilm matrix.

The production, modification, and export of PNAG in Escherichia coli and Bordetella species require the protein products encoded by the pgaABCD operon. PgaB is a two-domain periplasmic protein that contains an N-terminal deacetylase domain and a C-terminal PNAG binding domain that is critical for export. However, the exact function of the PgaB C-terminal domain remains unclear. Herein, we show that the C-terminal domains of Bordetella bronchiseptica PgaB (PgaBBb) and E. coli PgaB (PgaBEc) function as glycoside hydrolases. These enzymes hydrolyze purified deacetylated PNAG (dPNAG) from Staphylococcus aureus, disrupt PNAG-dependent biofilms formed by Bordetella pertussis, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and E. coli, and potentiate bacterial killing by gentamicin. Furthermore, we found that PgaBBb was only able to hydrolyze PNAG produced in situ by the E. coli PgaCD synthase complex when an active deacetylase domain was present. Mass spectrometry analysis of the PgaB-hydrolyzed dPNAG substrate showed a GlcN-GlcNAc-GlcNAc motif at the new reducing end of detected fragments. Our 1.76 Å structure of the C-terminal domain of PgaBBb reveals a central cavity within an elongated surface groove that appears ideally suited to recognize the GlcN-GlcNAc-GlcNAc motif. The structure, in conjunction with molecular modeling and site directed mutagenesis led to the identification of the dPNAG binding subsites and D474 as the probable catalytic acid.

Finally, fluorescent confocal microscopy was used to observe the eDNA pattern of selected isolates under conditions that mimicked the food processing environment and the human body. Susceptibility tests found isolates intermediate resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin as well as isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin. For all suspected isolates, PCR confirmed the presence of the gene lde encoding efflux pump in both types of DNA. When the biofilm was observed using confocal laser scanning microscope, the eDNA distribution patterns varied considerably according to the culture conditions.

In streams, phototrophic biofilms dominate benthic microbial life and harbour an immense prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial biodiversity with biotic interactions across domains and trophic levels. Here, we examine how community structure and function of these biofilms respond to varying light availability, as the crucial energy source for phototrophic biofilms. Using metatranscriptomics, we found that under light limitation-dominant phototrophs, including diatoms and cyanobacteria, displayed a remarkable plasticity in their photosynthetic machinery manifested as higher abundance of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involved in photosynthesis and chloroplast ribosomal RNA. Under higher light availability, bacterial mRNAs involved in phosphorus metabolism, mainly from Betaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, increased, likely compensating for nutrient depletion in thick biofilms with high biomass. Consumers, including diverse ciliates, displayed community shifts indicating preferential grazing on algae instead of bacteria under higher light. For the first time, we show that the functional integrity of stream biofilms under variable light availability is maintained by structure-function adaptations on several trophic levels. Our findings shed new light on complex biofilms, or microbial jungles, where in analogy to forests, diverse and multitrophic level communities lend stability to ecosystem functioning.

However, the hydrophilic character and large molecular size of these drugs significantly limit their ability to permeate across cellular membranes and thus impede the drugs in reaching their target sites in the body. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) have gained attention as promising drug excipients, since they can facilitate drug permeation across cell membranes constituting a major biological barrier. Fluorophores are frequently covalently conjugated to CPPs to improve detection, however, the ensuing change in physico-chemical properties of the CPPs may alter their biological properties. With complementary biophysical techniques, we show that the mode of biomembrane interaction may change considerably upon labeling of the CPP penetratin (PEN) with a fluorophore. Fluorophore-PEN conjugates display altered modes of membrane interaction with increased insertion into the core of model cell membranes thereby exerting membrane-thinning effects. This is in contrast to PEN, which localizes along the head groups of the lipid bilayer, without affecting the thickness of the lipid tails. Particularly high membrane disturbance is observed for the two most hydrophobic PEN conjugates; rhodamine B or 1-pyrene butyric acid, as compared to the four other tested fluorophore-PEN conjugates.","authors":[{"name":"Sofie Fogh Hedegaard"},{"name":"Mohammed Sobhi Derbas"},{"name":"Tania Kjellerup Lind"},{"name":"Marina Robertnova Kasimova"},{"name":"Malene Vinther Christensen"},{"name":"Maria Høtoft Michaelsen"},{"name":"Richard A Campbell"},{"name":"Lene Jorgensen"},{"name":"Henrik Franzyk"},{"name":"Marité Cárdenas"},{"name":"Hanne Mørck Nielsen"}],"keywords":[]},"article196":{"pmid":"29678918","title":"Impact of Currently Marketed Tampons and Menstrual Cups on Staphylococcus aureus Growth and Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin 1 Production In Vitro.","abs":"Fifteen currently marketed intravaginal protection products (11 types of tampon and 4 types of menstrual cup) were tested by the modified tampon sac method to determine their effect on Staphylococcus aureus growth and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) production.

Results suggested that the model with EPS kinetics fits better for the relative abundance of anammox bacteria and nitrifying bacteria compared to the model without EPS. The model with EPS and SMP confirms that the growth and existence of heterotrophs in anammox biofilm systems slightly increased due to including the kinetics of SMP production in the model.

Several cyanobacteria provide nitrogen fertilization through biological nitrogen fixation and through enzymatic activities related to interconversions and mobilization of different forms of nitrogen. Both green algae and cyanobacteria are involved in the production of metabolites such as growth hormones, polysaccharides, antimicrobial compounds, etc., which play an important role in the colonization of plants and proliferation of microbial and eukaryotic communities in soil. Currently, the development of consortia of cyanobacteria with bacteria or fungi or microalgae or their biofilms has widened their scope of utilization. Development of integrated wastewater treatment and biomass production systems is an emerging technology, which exploits the nutrient sequestering potential of microalgae and its valorisation.

Current modalities are ineffective and primarily based on antimicrobial monotherapies despite the polymicrobial nature of the infection. Here, we show that the combination of clinically used topical antifungal fluconazole with povidone iodine (PI) can completely suppress C. albicans carriage and mixed-biofilm formation without increasing bacterial killing activity in vivo. We unexpectedly found that the inclusion of PI enhanced fluconazole efficacy by potently disrupting the assembly of a protective bacterial exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix through inhibition of α-glucan synthesis by S. mutans exoenzyme (GtfB) bound on the fungal surface. Further analyses revealed that the EPS produced in situ directly bind and sequester fluconazole, reducing uptake and intracellular transportation of the drug. Conversely, inhibition of GtfB activity by PI, enzymatic degradation of the α-glucan matrix or co-culturing with gtfB-defective S. mutans re-established antifungal susceptibility. Hence, topical antifungal has limitations in mixed oral biofilms due to enhanced C. albicans tolerance to fluconazole afforded by the shielding effect of bacterial-derived EPS.

We found, that as the biofilms developed, species pairs exhibited distinct intermixing patterns unique to the four-member biofilms. Higher biomass and more intermixing were found in four-species biofilms compared to biofilms with fewer species.

Here we report on the temporospatial growth of Staphylococcus aureus on the surface of the human stratum corneum (SC); the outermost layer of skin. This bacterial species dominates bacterial populations on skin with atopic dermatitis (AD). We first establish that the distribution of ceramides naturally present in the SC is heterogeneous, and correlates with the tissue's structural topography. This distribution subsequently impacts the growth of bacterial biofilms. In the SC retaining healthy ceramide concentrations, biofilms exhibit no spatial preference for growth. By contrast, a depletion of ceramides consistent with reductions known to occur with AD enables S. aureus to use the patterned network of topographical canyons as a conduit for growth. The ability of ceramides to govern bacterial growth is confirmed using a topographical skin canyon analogue coated with the ceramide subcomponent d-sphingosine. Our work appears to explain the causal link between ceramide depletion and increased S. aureus populations that is observed in AD.

Genome mining, metabolic profiling of infected mushrooms, and heterologous expression of orphan gene clusters allowed the discovery of these unprecedented metabolites in the mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli (haereogladin, burriogladin) and the plant pathogen Burkholderia glumae (haereoglumin and burrioglumin). Through targeted gene deletions, the molecular basis of lipopeptide biosynthesis by nonribosomal peptide synthetases was revealed. Surprisingly, both types of lipopeptides feature unusual threonine tags, which yield longer peptide backbones than one would expect based on the canonical colinearity of the NRPS assembly lines. Both peptides play an indirect role in host infection as biosurfactants that enable host colonization by mediating swarming and biofilm formation abilities. Moreover, MALDI imaging mass spectrometry was applied to investigate the biological role of the lipopeptides.

Quantitative estimations of the bacterial adhesion to fungal cells demonstrated the importance of PPAD activity in this process, since the level of binding of P. gingivalis mutant strain deprived of PPAD was significantly lower than that observed for the wild-type strain. These results were consistent with mass spectrometric detection of the citrullination of selected surface-exposed C. albicans proteins.

S. baltica are incapable of producing acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing signals, but can respond to environmental AHLs. In this paper, Acinetobacter was found to produce three AHLs, i.e. N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (O-C6-HSL) and N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (O-C8-HSL), according to thin-layer chromatography using the bioreporter Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136. The agar diffusion and β-galactosidase assays revealed that S. baltica could eavesdrop on these three AHLs from Acinetobacter. Eavesdropping on Acinetobacter AHLs especially C4-HSL was found to boost the growth of S. baltica particularly under nutrient limiting conditions (up to 40-fold increase) in the co-culture experiments. The azocasein assay revealed that S. baltica produced fourfold more extracellular proteases in response to Acinetobacter AHLs. As demonstrated by the biofilm crystal violet staining assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy, eavesdropping also decreased the biofilm-forming capacity of Acinetobacter. By inoculation of S. baltica and Acinetobacter onto surface-sterilized shrimp, eavesdropping was found to endow a growth advantage to S. baltica in vivo, resulting in a 0.5 day shortened shelf life of shrimp according to total volatile basic nitrogen levels and sensory analysis. Overall, the AHL-dependent eavesdropping increased the spoilage potential of S. baltica, providing a fresh perspective on the spoilage process of refrigerated L. vannamei, and this may inspire the development of novel preservation techniques in the future to further reduce post-harvest loss of shrimp.","authors":[{"name":"Suqin Zhu"},{"name":"Haohao Wu"},{"name":"Caili Zhang"},{"name":"Jinxin Jie"},{"name":"Zunying Liu"},{"name":"Mingyong Zeng"},{"name":"Changyun Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Eavesdropping"},{"word":"Extracellular proteases"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"Shrimp"},{"word":"Spoilage"}]},"article235":{"pmid":"29666284","title":"Biofilms Comprise a Component of the Annual Cycle of Vibrio cholerae in the Bay of Bengal Estuary.","abs":"Vibrio cholerae, an estuarine bacterium, is the causative agent of cholera, a severe diarrheal disease that demonstrates seasonal incidence in Bangladesh.

Current treatment of PJI is inadequate resulting in incredibly high failure rates. This is believed to be largely mediated by the presence of bacterial biofilms. These polymicrobial bacterial colonies form within secreted extracellular matrices, adhering to the implant surface and local tissue. The biofilm architecture is believed to play a complex and critical role in a variety of bacterial processes including nutrient supplementation, metabolism, waste management, and antibiotic and immune resistance. The establishment of these biofilms relies heavily on the quorum sensing communication systems utilized by bacteria.

A total of 273 draft genomes including ST121 and ST14 newly sequenced and publicly available draft genomes were analyzed. Whole-genome Single Nucleotide Polymorfism (wgSNP) analysis was performed separately on the assemblies of ST121 and ST14 draft genomes. SNPs alignments were used to infer phylogeny. A dataset of L. monocytogenes ecophysiology genes was built based on a comprehensive literature review. The 94 selected genes were screened on the assemblies of all ST121 and ST14 draft genomes. Significant gene enrichments were evaluated by statistical analyses. A persistent ST14 clone, including 23 out of 27 newly sequenced genomes, was circulating in the rabbit-meat plant along with two not persistent clones. A significant enrichment was observed in ST121 genomes concerning stress survival islet 2 (SSI-2) (alkaline and oxidative stress), qacH gene (resistance to benzalkonium chloride), cadA1C gene cassette (resistance to 70 mg/l of cadmium chloride) and a truncated version of actA gene (biofilm formation). Conversely, ST14 draft genomes were enriched with a full-length version of actA gene along with the Listeria Genomic Island 2 (LGI 2) including the ars operon (arsenic resistance) and the cadA4C gene cassette (resistance to 35 mg/l of cadmium chloride). Phenotypic tests confirmed ST121 as a weak biofilm producer in comparison to ST14. In conclusion, ST121 carried the qacH gene and was phenotypically resistant to quaternary ammonium compounds. This property might contribute to the high prevalence of ST121 in food processing plants. ST14 showed greater ability to form biofilms, which might contribute to the occasional colonization and persistence on harborage sites where sanitizing procedures are difficult to display.","authors":[{"name":"Frédérique Pasquali"},{"name":"Federica Palma"},{"name":"Laurent Guillier"},{"name":"Alex Lucchi"},{"name":"Alessandra De Cesare"},{"name":"Gerardo Manfreda"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"adaptation"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"stress"},{"word":"the food processing environment"}]},"article247":{"pmid":"29662232","title":"Characterization of AiiK, an AHL lactonase, from Kurthia huakui LAM0618","abs":"N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) act as the key quorum sensing (QS) signal molecules in gram-negative bacteria, which coordinates gene expression and then activates various processes, including biofilm formation and production of virulence factors in some pathogens.

A combination of pull-downs and proteomics analyses led to the discovery of a mycobacterial protein, HadD, displaying highly specific interactions with the dehydratase HadAB of FAS-II. In vitro activity assays and homology modeling showed that HadD is, like HadAB, a hot dog folded (R)-specific hydratase/dehydratase. A hadD knockout mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis produced only the medium-size alpha'-MAs. Data strongly suggest that HadD is involved in building the third meromycolic segment during the late FAS-II elongation cycles, leading to the synthesis of the full-size alpha- and epoxy-MAs. The change in the envelope composition induced by hadD inactivation strongly altered the bacterial fitness and capacities to aggregate, assemble into colonies or biofilms and spread by sliding motility, and conferred a hypersensitivity to the firstline antimycobacterial drug rifampicin.

Our understanding of mechanotransduction, and its contribution to vital cellular responses, is a rapidly expanding field of research involving complex processes that are still not clearly understood. The use of mechanical vibration as a stimulus of mechanotransduction, including variation of frequency and amplitude, allows an alternative method to control specific cell behaviour without chemical stimulation (e.g. growth factors). Chemical-independent control of cell behaviour could be highly advantageous for fields including drug discovery and clinical tissue engineering. In this review, a novel technique is described based on nanoscale sinusoidal vibration. Using finite-element analysis in conjunction with laser interferometry, techniques that are used within the field of gravitational wave detection, optimization of apparatus design and calibration of vibration application have been performed. We further discuss the application of nanovibrational stimulation, or 'nanokicking', to eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells including the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells towards an osteoblast cell lineage. Mechanotransductive mechanisms are discussed including mediation through the Rho-A kinase signalling pathway. Optimization of this technique was first performed in two-dimensional culture using a simple vibration platform with an optimal frequency and amplitude of 1 kHz and 22 nm. A novel bioreactor was developed to scale up cell production, with recent research demonstrating that mesenchymal stem cell differentiation can be efficiently triggered in soft gel constructs. This important step provides first evidence that clinically relevant (three-dimensional) volumes of osteoblasts can be produced for the purpose of bone grafting, without complex scaffolds and/or chemical induction. Initial findings have shown that nanovibrational stimulation can also reduce biofilm formation in a number of clinically relevant bacteria.

This review addresses the current literature and identifies research gaps related to the following topics: 1) the complex interactions between algae and prokaryotes in wastewater treatment; 2) advances in bioreactor technologies that can achieve high nitrogen removal efficiencies in small reactor volumes, such as algal-prokaryotic biofilm reactors and enhanced algal-prokaryotic treatment systems (EAPS); 3) molecular tools that have expanded our understanding of the activities of algal and prokaryotic communities in wastewater treatment processes.","authors":[{"name":"Meng Wang"},{"name":"Ryan Keeley"},{"name":"Nadezhda Zalivina"},{"name":"Trina Halfhide"},{"name":"Kathleen Scott"},{"name":"Qiong Zhang"},{"name":"Peter van der Steen"},{"name":"Sarina J Ergas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algal-prokaryotic consortia"},{"word":"Biological nitrogen removal"},{"word":"Full-scale applications"},{"word":"N metabolic pathways"},{"word":"Reactor configurations"}]},"article255":{"pmid":"29660619","title":"Highly efficient removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in an electrolysis-integrated horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetland amended with biochar.","abs":"Electrolysis combined with biochar (BC) was used in a constructed wetland to intensify nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal from wastewater simultaneously.

They play several ecological roles and are considered important indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Studying epibiotic diatoms living on turtle shells suggestively has great potential in the study of turtle behavior because diatoms are always there. However, diatom identification at the species level is time consuming, requires well-trained specialists, and there is a high probability of finding new taxa growing on turtle shells, which makes identification tricky. An alternative approach based on DNA barcoding and high throughput sequencing (HTS), metabarcoding, has been developed in recent years to identify species at the community level by using a DNA reference library. The suitabilities of morphological and molecular approaches were compared. Diatom assemblages were sampled from seven juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Mayotte Island, France. The structures of the epibiotic diatom assemblages differed between both approaches. This resulted in different clustering of the turtles based on their diatom communities. Metabarcoding allowed better discrimination between turtles based on their epibiotic diatom assemblages and put into evidence the presence of a cryptic diatom diversity. Microscopy, for its part, provided more ecological information of sea turtles based on historical bibliographical data and the abundances of ecological guilds of the diatom species present in the samples. This study shows the complementary nature of these two methods for studying turtle behavior.","authors":[{"name":"Sinziana F Rivera"},{"name":"Valentin Vasselon"},{"name":"Katia Ballorain"},{"name":"Alice Carpentier"},{"name":"Carlos E Wetzel"},{"name":"Luc Ector"},{"name":"Agnès Bouchez"},{"name":"Frédéric Rimet"}],"keywords":[]},"article258":{"pmid":"29659578","title":"Cell adhesion and fluid flow jointly initiate genotype spatial distribution in biofilms.","abs":"Biofilms are microbial collectives that occupy a diverse array of surfaces.

Here, we study the origins of biofilm genetic structure by combining model development, numerical simulations, and microfluidic experiments using the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Using spatial correlation functions to quantify the differences between emergent cell lineage segregation patterns, we find that strong adhesion often, but not always, maximizes the size of clonal cell clusters on flat surfaces. Counterintuitively, our model predicts that, under some conditions, investing in adhesion can reduce rather than increase clonal group size. Our results emphasize that a complex interaction between fluid flow and cell adhesiveness can underlie emergent patterns of biofilm genetic structure.

We synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with an average size of 10 nm using the novel biomolecule apigenin as a reducing and stabilizing agent, and evaluated the efficacy of the AgNPs on the MDR pathogenic bacteria Prevotella melaninogenica and Arcanobacterium pyogenes isolated from uterine secretion samples. AgNPs inhibited cell viability and biofilm formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, the metabolic toxicity of the AgNPs was assessed through various cellular assays. The major toxic effect of cell death was caused by an increase in oxidative stress, as evidenced by the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl content, and nitric oxide. The formation of ROS is considered to be the primary mechanism of bacterial death. Therefore, the biomolecule-mediated synthesis of AgNPs shows potential as an alternative antimicrobial therapy for bovine metritis and endometritis.","authors":[{"name":"Sangiliyandi Gurunathan"},{"name":"Yun-Jung Choi"},{"name":"Jin-Hoi Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial therapy"},{"word":"endometritis"},{"word":"multiple drug-resistant bacteria"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"}]},"article260":{"pmid":"29659477","title":"Alpha-Toxin Contributes to Biofilm Formation among Staphylococcus aureus Wound Isolates.","abs":"Biofilms complicate treatment of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) wound infections.

But, its growth and production are significantly hampered by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) which causes leaf blight disease. Earlier studies have reported the antibacterial ability of FDA-approved niclosamide drug against Xoo. However, the underlying mechanism by which niclosamide blocks the growth of Xoo remained elusive. In the present study, by employing the microbiological, microscopical, molecular, bioinformatics and analytical tools we found that niclosamide can directly inhibit the growth of the Xoo by hampering the biofilm formation and the production of xanthomonadin and exopolysaccharide substances (EPS) required for relentless growth and virulence of Xoo. Interestingly, niclosamide was found to specifically suppress the growth of Xoo without affecting other bacteria like Escherichia coli. Our electron microscopic observations disclosed that niclosamide disrupts the membrane permeability of Xoo and causes the release of intracellular components. Similarly, the molecular docking analysis disclosed the molecular interaction of niclosamide with the biofilm, virulence and quorum sensing related proteins, which was further substantiated by relative gene expression analysis where niclosamide was found to significantly downregulate the expression of these key regulatory genes. In addition, considerable changes in chemical structures were detected by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in response to niclosamide treatment.

This work is aimed at optimizing a surface biofunctionalization strategy to inhibit the adhesion of S. aureus on solid substrates. The first part of the work deals with the albumin adsorption-desorption process, studied by a factorial design of experiments to explore a wide range of experimental factors (protein concentration, pH, flow rate and adsorption time) and responses (initial adsorption rate, adsorbed amount, desorbed extent) for hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates, with a reduced number of experiments. This approach allows the simultaneous evaluation of the factors affecting the albumin adsorption-desorption process to find a qualitative correlation with the amount of alive S. aureus adhered on albumin biofunctionalized substrates. The results of this work point to a relationship between bacterial adhesion and the degree of albumin relaxation on the solid substrate. In fact, the inhibition of bacterial adhesion on albumin biofunctionalized substrates is due to the surface perturbation on the native structure of the protein. On this base, a biofunctionalization strategy was designed using a solution of thermally treated albumin molecules (higher β-sheet or unordered secondary structure elements) to biofunctionalize solid substrates by dipping.

S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are the most frequent pathogens isolated from chronic wounds and increasing resistance to topical antibiotics has become a major issue. Therefore, new treatment options are urgently needed. In recent years, research focused on the development of synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with lower toxicity and improved activity compared to their endogenous counterparts. AMPs appear to be promising therapeutic options for the treatment of SSTIs and wounds as they show a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, low resistance rates and display pivotal immunomodulatory as well as wound healing promoting activities such as induction of cell migration and proliferation and angiogenesis. In this review, we evaluate the potential of AMPs for the treatment of bacterial SSTIs and wounds and provide an overview of the mechanisms of actions of AMPs that contribute to combat skin infections and to improve wound healing.

Biofilm formation is an important feature, closely associated with antifungal resistance, involving alterations of gene expression or mutations, which can result in the failure of antifungal treatments. Hence, the main goal of this work was to evaluate the role of a set of genes, associated with matrix production, in the resistance of C. glabrata biofilms to antifungal drugs. (2) Methods: the determination of the expression of BGL2, XOG1, FKS1, FKS2, GAS2, KNH1, UGP1, and MNN2 genes in 48-h biofilm's cells of three C. glabrata strains was performed through quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), after contact with Fluconazole (Flu), Amphotericin B (AmB), Caspofungin (Csf), or Micafungin (Mcf). (3) Results: Mcf induced a general overexpression of the selected genes. It was verified that the genes related to the production of β-1,3-glucans (BGL2, XOG1, GAS2) had the highest expressions. (4) Conclusion: though β-1,6-glucans and mannans are an essential part of the cell and biofilm matrix, C. glabrata biofilm cells seem to contribute more to the replacement of β-1,3-glucans. Thus, these biopolymers seem to have a greater impact on the biofilm matrix composition and, consequently, a role in the biofilm resistance to antifungal drugs.","authors":[{"name":"Célia F Rodrigues"},{"name":"Mariana Henriques"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"Candida glabrata"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"drug resistance"},{"word":"gene expression"},{"word":"matrix"}]},"article306":{"pmid":"29642449","title":"Characterization of a New Staphylococcus aureus Kayvirus Harboring a Lysin Active against Biofilms.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most relevant opportunistic pathogens involved in many biofilm-associated diseases, and is a major cause of nosocomial infections, mainly due to the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains. Consequently, alternative methods to eradicate the pathogen are urgent. It has been previously shown that polyvalent staphylococcal kayviruses and their derived endolysins are excellent candidates for therapy. Here we present the characterization of a new bacteriophage: vB_SauM-LM12 (LM12). LM12 has a broad host range (>90%; 56 strains tested), and is active against several MRSA strains. The genome of LM12 is composed of a dsDNA molecule with 143,625 bp, with average GC content of 30.25% and codes for 227 Coding Sequences (CDSs). Bioinformatics analysis did not identify any gene encoding virulence factors, toxins, or antibiotic resistance determinants. Antibiofilm assays have shown that this phage significantly reduced the number of viable cells (less than one order of magnitude). Moreover, the encoded endolysin also showed activity against biofilms, with a consistent biomass reduction during prolonged periods of treatment (of about one order of magnitude). Interestingly, the endolysin was shown to be much more active against stationary-phase cells and suspended biofilm cells than against intact and scraped biofilms, suggesting that cellular aggregates protected by the biofilm matrix reduced protein activity. Both phage LM12 and its endolysin seem to have a strong antimicrobial effect and broad host range against S. aureus, suggesting their potential to treat S. aureus biofilm infections.","authors":[{"name":"Luís D R Melo"},{"name":"Ana Brandão"},{"name":"Ergun Akturk"},{"name":"Silvio B Santos"},{"name":"Joana Azeredo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Kayvirus"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"endolysin"}]},"article307":{"pmid":"29642369","title":"Bis-Indolyl Benzenoids, Hydroxypyrrolidine Derivatives and Other Constituents from Cultures of the Marine Sponge-Associated Fungus Aspergillus candidus KUFA0062.","abs":"A previously unreported bis-indolyl benzenoid, candidusin D (","authors":[{"name":"Suradet Buttachon"},{"name":"Alice A Ramos"},{"name":"Ângela Inácio"},{"name":"Tida Dethoup"},{"name":"Luís Gales"},{"name":"Michael Lee"},{"name":"Paulo M Costa"},{"name":"Artur M S Silva"},{"name":"Nazim Sekeroglu"},{"name":"Eduardo Rocha"},{"name":"Madalena M M Pinto"},{"name":"José A Pereira"},{"name":"Anake Kijjoa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aspergillaceae"},{"word":"Aspergillus candidus"},{"word":"antibacterial activity"},{"word":"bis-indolyl benzenoids"},{"word":"cytotoxicity"},{"word":"hydroxypyrrolidine"},{"word":"sponge-associated fungus"}]},"article308":{"pmid":"29642032","title":"Conformation of Single and Interacting Lipopolysaccharide Surfaces Bearing O-Side Chains.","abs":"The outer surfaces of Gram-negative bacteria are composed of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules exposing oligo- and polysaccharides to the aqueous environment.

Structural studies on LPS surfaces, however, have so far dealt almost exclusively with rough mutant LPS of reduced molecular complexity and limited biological relevance. Here, by using neutron reflectometry, we structurally characterize planar monolayers of wild-type LPS from Escherichia coli O55:B5 featuring strain-specific O-side chains in the presence and absence of divalent cations and under controlled interaction conditions. The model used for the reflectivity analysis is self-consistent and based on the volume fraction profiles of all chemical components.

Here we describe the preparation of a novel zwitterionic block copolymer with the potential to prevent or delay the formation of microbial biofilms. The block copolymer comprised a zwitterionic (hydrophilic) section of alternating glutamic acid (negatively charged) and lysine (positively charged) units and a hydrophobic polystyrene section. Cryo-TEM and dynamic-light-scattering (DLS) results showed that, on average, the block copolymer self-assembled into 7-nm-diameter micelles in aqueous solutions (0 to 100 mM NaCl, pH 6). Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and contact angle measurements demonstrated that the block copolymer self-assembled into a brush-like monolayer on polystyrene surfaces. The brush-like monolayer produced from a 100 mg/L block copolymer solution exhibited an average distance, d, of approximately 4-8 nm between each block copolymer molecule (center to center). Once the brush-like monolayer self-assembled, it reduced EPS adsorption onto the polystyrene surface by ∼70% (mass), reduced the rate of bacterial attachment by >80%, and inhibited the development of thick biofilms. QCM-D results revealed that the EPS molecules penetrate between the chains of the brush and adsorb onto the polystyrene surface. Additionally, AFM analyses showed that the brush-like monolayer prevents the adhesion of large (> d) hydrophilic colloids onto the surface via hydration repulsion; however, molecules or colloids small enough to fit between the brush polymers (< d) were able to be adsorbed onto the surface via van der Waals interactions. Overall, we found that the penetration of extracellular organelles, as well as biopolymers through the brush, is critical for the failure of the antifouling coating, and likely could be prevented through tuning of the brush density. Stability and biofilm development testing on multiple surfaces (polypropylene, glass, and stainless steel) support practical applications of this novel block copolymer.","authors":[{"name":"Christopher Ziemba"},{"name":"Maria Khavkin"},{"name":"Dimitris Priftis"},{"name":"Handan Acar"},{"name":"Jun Mao"},{"name":"Maya Benami"},{"name":"Moshe Gottlieb"},{"name":"Matthew Tirrell"},{"name":"Yair Kaufman"},{"name":"Moshe Herzberg"}],"keywords":[]},"article310":{"pmid":"29638210","title":"Stenotrophomonas lactitubi sp. nov. and Stenotrophomonas indicatrix sp. nov., isolated from surfaces with food contact.","abs":"Five Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, none-spore-forming isolates were obtained from biofilms on different sites of a milking machine in Germany.

Biofilm-related genes have been detected by comparing mutants using the classical submerged biofilm formation assay, in which cells adhere to the bottom of a well containing culture medium. We recently developed an alternative biofilm formation model for S. aureus, based on macrocolony formation on agar plates, comparable to an assay used to study biofilm formation in a few other bacterial species. As organism features are the result of environmental conditions as well as of genes, we used a genome-wide collection of transposon-mapped mutants in this macrocolony assay to seek S. aureus developmental genes and pathways not identified by the classical biofilm formation assay. We identified routes related to glucose and purine metabolism and clarified their regulatory link to macrocolony formation. Our study demonstrates that formation of microbial communities must be correlated to specific growth conditions, and the role of metabolism must be considered in S. aureus biofilm formation and thus, in the development of chronic infections.","authors":[{"name":"Charlotte Wermser"},{"name":"Daniel Lopez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"genome-wide assay"},{"word":"macrocolony"},{"word":"multicellular aggregate"}]},"article312":{"pmid":"29638177","title":"Phenotypic changes associated with Colistin resistance due to Lipopolysaccharide loss in Acinetobacter baumannii.","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii can acquire resistance to colistin via complete loss of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis due to mutations in the lpxA, lpxC and lpxD genes.

Micro-/nanoscale substratum surface features have been shown to disrupt firm adhesion of planktonic microbes to surfaces, thereby interfering with the earliest stage of biofilm formation. However, the role of geometry and size of surface features in microbial retention is not completely understood. In this study, we developed a biophysical model that describes the changes in the total free energy (adhesion energy and stretching energy) of an adherent Candida albicans cell on nanofiber-coated surfaces as a function of the geometry (i.e., diameter) and configuration (i.e., interfiber spacing) of the surface features (i.e., nanofibers). We then introduced a new nondimensional parameter, Π, to represent the ratio of cell rigidity to cell-substratum interfacial energy. We show that the total free energy is a strong function of topographical feature size at higher Π and lower spacing values. To confirm our biophysical model predictions, we performed 24 h dynamic retention assays and quantified cell attachment number density on surfaces coated with highly ordered polystyrene nanofibers. We show that the total free energy of a single adherent cell on a patterned surface is a key determinant of microbial retention on that surface. The cell attachment density trend closely correlates with the predictions based on the adherent single-cell total energy. The nanofiber coating design (1.2 μm diameter, 2 μm spacing) that maximized the total energy of the adherent cell resulted in the lowest microbial retention. We further demonstrate the utility of our biophysical model by showing close correlation between the computed single-cell total free energy and biofilm nucleation on fiber-coated urinary and central venous catheters of different materials. This biophysical model could offer a powerful new paradigm in ab initio design of patterned surfaces for controlled biofilm growth for medical applications and beyond.","authors":[{"name":"Zhou Ye"},{"name":"AhRam Kim"},{"name":"Carolyn Y Mottley"},{"name":"Michael W Ellis"},{"name":"Candace Wall"},{"name":"Alan R Esker"},{"name":"Amrinder S Nain"},{"name":"Bahareh Behkam"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adhesion model"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"microbial adhesion"},{"word":"microbial retention"},{"word":"patterned surfaces"},{"word":"stretching energy"},{"word":"surface topography"}]},"article316":{"pmid":"29637309","title":"Advances in Ureteral Stent Design and Materials.","abs":"There are three technological parameters that play a key role on the performance of an ideal stent.
