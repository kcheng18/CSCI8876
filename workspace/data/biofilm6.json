Therefore, this in vitro study was conducted to evaluate the impact of different implant production processes on microbial adhesion of periodontal pathogens. Titanium discs produced using two different processes-conventional and AM-were divided into three groups: conventional titanium discs with machined surface (G1), AM titanium discs with chemical treatment (G2) and AM titanium discs without chemical treatment (G3). Subgingival biofilm composed of 32 species was formed on the titanium discs, and positioned vertically in 96-well plates, for 7 days. The proportions of microbial complexes and the microbial profiles were analyzed using a DNA-DNA hybridization technique, and data were evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunnett tests (p < 0.05). Lower proportions of the red complex species were observed in the biofilm formed in G2 compared with that in G1 (p < 0.05). Moreover, the proportions of the microbial complexes were similar between G2 and G3 (p > 0.05).

Bacteria embedded within a biofilm benefit from increased resistance to antibiotics, host immune responses, and harsh environmental factors.

In many cases, NO-induced biofilm dispersal is accomplished through signal transduction pathways that ultimately lead to a decrease in intracellular cyclic-di-GMP levels. H-NOX (heme nitric oxide/oxygen binding domain) proteins are the best characterized bacterial NO sensors and have been implicated in NO-mediated cyclic-di-GMP signaling, but we have recently discovered a second family of NO-sensitive proteins in bacteria named NosP (NO sensing protein); to date, a clear link between NosP signaling and cyclic-di-GMP metabolism has not been established. Here we present evidence that NosP (Lpg0279) binds to NO and directly affects cyclic-di-GMP production from two-component signaling proteins Lpg0278 and Lpg0277 encoded within the NosP operon. Lpg0278 and Lpg0277 are a histidine kinase and cyclic-di-GMP synthase/phosphodiesterase, respectively, that have already been established as being important in regulating Legionella pneumophila cyclic-di-GMP levels; NosP is thus implicated in regulating cyclic-di-GMP in L. pneumophila.","authors":[{"name":"Jonathan T Fischer"},{"name":"Sajjad Hossain"},{"name":"Elizabeth M Boon"}],"keywords":[]},"article6":{"pmid":"31576247","title":"Ecological networks reveal contrasting patterns of bacterial and fungal communities in glacier-fed streams in Central Asia.","abs":"Bacterial and fungal communities in biofilms are important components in driving biogeochemical processes in stream ecosystems. Previous studies have well documented the patterns of bacterial alpha diversity in stream biofilms in glacier-fed streams, where, however, beta diversity of the microbial communities has received much less attention especially considering both bacterial and fungal communities. A focus on beta diversity can provide insights into the mechanisms driving community changes associated to large environmental fluctuations and disturbances, such as in glacier-fed streams. Moreover, modularity of co-occurrence networks can reveal more ecological and evolutionary properties of microbial communities beyond taxonomic groups. Here, integrating beta diversity and co-occurrence approach, we explored the network topology and modularity of the bacterial and fungal communities with consideration of environmental variation in glacier-fed streams in Central Asia. Combining results from hydrological modeling and normalized difference of vegetation index, this study highlighted that hydrological variables and vegetation status are major variables determining the environmental heterogeneity of glacier-fed streams. Bacterial communities formed a more complex and connected network, while the fungal communities formed a more clustered network. Moreover, the strong interrelations among the taxonomic dissimilarities of bacterial community (BC) and modules suggest they had common processes in driving diversity and taxonomic compositions across the heterogeneous environment. In contrast, fungal community (FC) and modules generally showed distinct driving processes to each other. Moreover, bacterial and fungal communities also had different driving processes. Furthermore, the variation of BC and modules were strongly correlated with hydrological properties and vegetation status but not with nutrients, while FC and modules (except one module) were not associated with environmental variation. Our results suggest that bacterial and fungal communities had distinct mechanisms in structuring microbial networks, and environmental variation had strong influences on bacterial communities but not on fungal communities. The fungal communities have unique assembly mechanisms and physiological properties which might lead to their insensitive responses to environmental variations compared to bacterial communities. Overall, beyond alpha diversity in previous studies, these results add our knowledge that bacterial and fungal communities have contrasting assembly mechanisms and respond differently to environmental variation in glacier-fed streams.","authors":[{"name":"Ze Ren"},{"name":"Hongkai Gao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Co-occurrence"},{"word":"Dissimilarity"},{"word":"Hydrology"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Modules"}]},"article7":{"pmid":"31575775","title":"Establishment of Chronic Typhoid Infection in a Mouse Carriage Model Involves a Type 2 Immune Shift and T and B Cell Recruitment to the Gallbladder.","abs":"Typhoid fever, caused primarily by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S Typhi), is a life-threatening systemic disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Three to 5% of individuals infected with S Typhi become chronic carriers due to bacterial persistence in the gallbladder. We have demonstrated that Salmonella forms biofilms on gallstones to establish gallbladder carriage. However, an in-depth molecular understanding of chronic carriage in the gallbladder, from the perspective of both the pathogen and host, is poorly defined. To examine the dynamics of the gallbladder in response to Salmonella infection, we performed transcriptional profiling in the mouse gallbladder at early (7 days) and chronic (21 days) time points. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed a shift from a Th1 proinflammatory response at 7 days postinfection (dpi) toward an anti-inflammatory Th2 response by 21 dpi, characterized by increased levels of immunoglobulins and the Th2 master transcriptional regulator, GATA3. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis predicted the upstream regulation of characteristic Th2 markers, including interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Stat6. Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis confirmed a significant increase in lymphocytes, including T and B cells, at 21 dpi in mice with gallstones. Interestingly, the levels of Salmonella-specific CD4 T cells were 10-fold higher in the gallbladder of mice with gallstones at 21 dpi. We speculate that the biofilm state allows Salmonella to resist the initial onslaught of the Th1 inflammatory response, while yet undefined events influence a switch in the host immunity toward a more permissive type 2 response, enabling the establishment of chronic infection.","authors":[{"name":"Juan F González"},{"name":"Jonathan Kurtz"},{"name":"David L Bauer"},{"name":"Regan Hitt"},{"name":"James Fitch"},{"name":"Amy Wetzel"},{"name":"Krista La Perle"},{"name":"Peter White"},{"name":"James McLachlan"},{"name":"John S Gunn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronic carriage"}]},"article8":{"pmid":"31575767","title":"Chemoperception of Specific Amino Acids Controls Phytopathogenicity in Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato.","abs":"Chemotaxis has been associated with the pathogenicity of bacteria in plants and was found to facilitate bacterial entry through stomata and wounds.

We show that the chemoreceptor P. syringae pv. tomato PscA (PsPto-PscA) recognizes specifically and with high affinity l-Asp, l-Glu, and d-Asp. The mutation of the chemoreceptor gene largely reduced chemotaxis to these ligands but also altered cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) levels, biofilm formation, and motility, pointing to cross talk between different chemosensory pathways. Furthermore, the PsPto-PscA mutant strain showed reduced virulence in tomato. Asp and Glu are the most abundant amino acids in plants and in particular in tomato apoplasts, and we hypothesize that this receptor may have evolved to specifically recognize these compounds to facilitate bacterial entry into the plant.

The aim of the present critical review is to summarize the available evidence on photosensitizers (PSs) which has been confirmed in numerous studies from diverse areas combined with several antimicrobial strategies, as well as emerging options in order to optimize their properties and effects that might be translational and useful in the near future in basic endodontic research. Published data notably support the need for continuing the search for an ideal endodontic photosensitizer, that is, one which acts as an excellent antimicrobial agent without causing toxicity to the human host cells or presenting the risk of tooth discoloration. The current literature on experimental studies mainly relies on assessment of mixed disinfection protocols, combining approaches which are already available with aPDT as an adjunct therapy. In this review, several approaches concerning aPDT efficiency are appraised, such as the use of bacteriophages, biopolymers, drug and light delivery systems, efflux pump inhibitors, negative pressure systems, and peptides. The authors also analyzed their combination with other approaches for aPDT improvement, such as sonodynamic therapy. All of the aforementioned techniques have already been tested, and we highlight the biological challenges of each formulation, predicting that the collected information may encourage the development of other effective photoactive materials, in addition to being useful in endodontic basic research. Moreover, special attention is dedicated to studies on detailed conditions, aPDT features with a focus on PS enhancer strategies, and the respective final antimicrobial outcomes.

It causes life-threatening complications in diseases characterized by the up-regulation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling, such as cancer or viral infections. Since type I IFNs regulate multiple functions of neutrophils, which constitute the first line of anti-bacterial host defense, in this work we aimed to study how interferon-activated neutrophils influence the course of P. aeruginosa infection of the lung. In lungs of infected IFN-sufficient WT mice, significantly elevated bacteria load was observed, accompanied by the prominent lung tissue damage. At the same time IFN-deficient animals seem to be partly resistant to the infection. Lung neutrophils from such IFN-deficient animals release significantly lower amounts of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), as compared to WT neutrophils. Of note, such IFN-deficient neutrophils show significantly decreased capacity to stimulate biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa. Reduced biofilm production impairs in turn the survival of bacteria in a lung tissue. In line with that, treatment of neutrophils with recombinant IFN-β enhances their NETosis and stimulates biofilm formation by Pseudomonas after co-incubation with such neutrophils. Possibly, bacteria utilizes neutrophil-derived NETs as a scaffold for released biofilms. In agreement with this, in vivo treatment with ROS-scavengers, NETs disruption or usage of the bacterial strains unable to bind DNA, suppress neutrophil-mediated biofilm formation in the lungs. Together, our findings indicate that the excessive activation of neutrophils by type I IFNs leads to their boosted NETosis that in turn triggers biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa and supports its persistence in the infected lung. Targeting these mechanisms could offer a new therapeutic approach to prevent persistent bacterial infections in patients with diseases associated with the up-regulation of type I IFNs.","authors":[{"name":"Ekaterina Pylaeva"},{"name":"Sharareh Bordbari"},{"name":"Ilona Spyra"},{"name":"Anna Sophie Decker"},{"name":"Susanne Häussler"},{"name":"Vadim Vybornov"},{"name":"Stephan Lang"},{"name":"Jadwiga Jablonska"}],"keywords":[{"word":"IFN-β"},{"word":"IFNAR"},{"word":"NETs"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacterial infection"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"neutrophils"}]},"article22":{"pmid":"31572366","title":"Quorum Sensing by Monocyte-Derived Populations.","abs":"Quorum sensing is a type of cellular communication that was first described in bacteria, consisting of gene expression regulation in response to changes in cell-population density. Bacteria synthesize and secrete diffusive molecules called autoinducers, which concentration varies accordingly with cell density and can be detected by the producing cells themselves. Once autoinducer concentration reaches a critical threshold, all bacteria within the autoinducer-rich environment react by modifying their genetic expression and adopt a coordinated behavior (e.g., biofilm formation, virulence factor expression, or swarming motility). Recent advances highlight the possibility that such type of communication is not restricted to bacteria, but can exist among other cell types, including immune cells and more specifically monocyte-derived cells (1). For such cells, quorum sensing mechanisms may not only regulate their population size and synchronize their behavior at homeostasis but also alter their activity and function in unexpected ways during immune reactions. Although the nature of immune autoinducers and cellular mechanisms remains to be fully characterized, quorum sensing mechanisms in the immune system challenge our traditional conception of immune cell interactions and likely represent an important mode of communication at homeostasis or during an immune response. In this mini-review, we briefly present the prototypic features of quorum sensing in bacteria and discuss the existing evidence for quorum sensing within the immune system.

Surprisingly however, addition of AHLs to isolates harvested following co-culture did not measurably affect either growth or biofilm of these strains. Addition of supernatants from QS active strains did however impact significantly on biofilm formation of the marine Bacillus sp. CH8a sporeforming strain suggesting a role for QS systems in moderating the microbe-microbe interaction in marine sponges. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a QS positive Psychrobacter isolate identified several QS associated systems, although no classical QS synthase gene was identified. The stark contrast between the biodiverse sponge microbiome and the relatively limited diversity that was observed on standard culture media, even in the presence of QS active compounds, serves to underscore the extent of diversity that remains to be brought into culture.","authors":[{"name":"F Jerry Reen"},{"name":"José A Gutiérrez-Barranquero"},{"name":"Ronan R McCarthy"},{"name":"David F Woods"},{"name":"Sara Scarciglia"},{"name":"Claire Adams"},{"name":"Kristian Fog Nielsen"},{"name":"Lone Gram"},{"name":"Fergal O'Gara"}],"keywords":[{"word":"acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)"},{"word":"cell–cell communication"},{"word":"marine sponge-associated bacteria"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"quorum sensing (QS)"}]},"article24":{"pmid":"31572315","title":"Functional Characterization of a Global Virulence Regulator Hfq and Identification of Hfq-Dependent sRNAs in the Plant Pathogen Pantoea ananatis.","abs":"To successfully infect plant hosts, the collective regulation of virulence factors in a bacterial pathogen is crucial.

In this study, we show that colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae are more susceptible to killing by a newly isolated lytic phage than the colistin sensitive parent strain. We observe this behavior for colistin-resistance conferred by a horizontally transferred mcr-1 containing plasmid and also from the inactivation of the chromosomal gene mgrB By measuring zeta potentials, we found that the phage particles were negatively charged at neutral pH and that colistin-resistant bacteria had less negative zeta potentials than did wildtype. These results suggest that the decreased negative surface charge of colistin-resistant cells lowers the electrostatic repulsion between the phage and bacteria, thereby promoting phage adherence and subsequent infection. To further explore this, we tested the effect of phage treatment on K. pneumoniae growing in several different environments. We found that colistin-resistant cells were more susceptible to phage than were the wildtype cells when growing in biofilms or infected moth larvae and when colonizing the mammalian gut.

The only known LTs in S. aureus are immunodominant staphylococcal antigen A (IsaA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis D protein (SceD). Our study demonstrates that, in a strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), IsaA and SceD contribute differently to biofilm formation and β-lactam resistance.

Plasmid-based expression of mecA, a major determinant of β-lactam resistance in MRSA, in an isaA-deleted strain did not restore β-lactam resistance, demonstrating that the β-lactam susceptibility phenotype is exhibited by isaA mutant regardless of the production level of PBP2a.

To ensure the beneficial effects, the probiotic cells must survive processing and storage of food, its passage through the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and subsequent chemical ingestion processes until they reach their target organ. However, there is considerable loss of viability of the probiotic bacteria during the drying process, in the acidic conditions of the stomach, and in the high bile concentration in the small intestine. Bacillus subtilis, a spore-forming probiotic bacterium, can effectively maintain a favorable balance of microflora in the GIT. B. subtilis produces a protective extracellular matrix (ECM), which is shared with other probiotic bacteria; thus, it was suggested that this ECM could potentially protect an entire community of probiotic cells against unfavorable environmental conditions. Consequently, a biofilm-based bio-coating system was developed that would enable a mutual growth of B. subtilis with different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) through increasing the ECM production. Results of the study demonstrate a significant increase in the survivability of the bio-coated LAB cells during the desiccation process and passage through the acidic environment. Thus, it provides evidence about the ability of B. subtilis in rescuing the desiccation-sensitive LAB, for instance, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, from complete eradication.

In this research, we show that 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to visualize biofilm distribution and determine its volume on irregular-shaped single AC granules in a non-destructive way, while being combined with electrochemical and biomass analyses. Ten AC granules with electroactive biofilm (i.e. granular bioanodes) were collected at different growth stages (3 to 21 days after microbial inoculation) from a multi-anode MFC and T","authors":[{"name":"Leire Caizán-Juanarena"},{"name":"Julia R Krug"},{"name":"Frank J Vergeldt"},{"name":"J Mieke Kleijn"},{"name":"Aldrik H Velders"},{"name":"Henk Van As"},{"name":"Annemiek Ter Heijne"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Activated carbon granules"},{"word":"Biofilm distribution"},{"word":"Biofilm volume"},{"word":"Magnetic resonance imaging"},{"word":"Microbial fuel cells"},{"word":"Porous electrodes"}]},"article46":{"pmid":"31561688","title":"Speciation, Biofilm Formation and Antifungal Susceptibility of Candida Isolates from Clinically Diagnosed Patient of UTI in a Tertiary Care Hospital.","abs":"The incidence of the urinary tract infections caused by Candida species, are becoming more common.

Nowadays, many strategies are being carried out to address this problem. Among them, the use of natural compounds like cinnamic and p-coumaric acids stands out. Nevertheless, their utilization is limited because of their unfavorable physicochemical properties. Due to the lack of new therapeutic alternatives for bacterial infections, novel strategies have emerged, such as the use of ionic liquids; given that they can show a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, this is why we herein report the antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of a series of N-alkylimidazolium salts functionalized with p-coumaric and cinnamic acids. The results from this study showed better antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, with a predominance of the salts derived from coumaric acid and a correlation with the chain length. Additionally, a lower efficacy was observed in the inhibition of biofilm formation, highlighting the antibiofilm activity against Staphylococcus aureus, which decreased the production of the biofilm by 52% over the control. In conclusion, we suggest that the salts derived from p-coumaric acid are good alternatives as antibacterial compounds. Meanwhile, the salt derived from cinnamic acid could be a good alternative as an antibiofilm compound.","authors":[{"name":"Oscar Forero-Doria"},{"name":"Ramiro Araya-Maturana"},{"name":"Anggela Barrientos-Retamal"},{"name":"Luis Morales-Quintana"},{"name":"Luis Guzmán"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiofilm effects"},{"word":"antimicrobial agents"},{"word":"cinnamoylimidazole salts"},{"word":"ionic liquids"}]},"article48":{"pmid":"31561306","title":"Real-time monitoring of the membrane biofouling based on spectroscopic analysis in a marine MBBR-MBR (moving bed biofilm reactor-membrane bioreactor) for saline wastewater treatment.","abs":"A MBBR-MBR system has been developed with marine microorganisms enriched for saline wastewater treatment in this work, showing high COD and NH","authors":[{"name":"Zhengyu Yu"},{"name":"Weiguo Li"},{"name":"Songwen Tan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Membrane bioreactor"},{"word":"Saline wastewater treatment"},{"word":"Spectroscopic analysis"},{"word":"Sudden salinity shock"}]},"article49":{"pmid":"31561151","title":"Bacterial community changes and antibiotic resistance gene quantification in microbial electrolysis cells during long-term sulfamethoxazole treatment.","abs":"In this study, sulfamethoxazole served as the electron donor for microbial electrolysis cells.

While many strategies have been proposed to mitigate Bd outbreaks, few have been successful. In recent years, the use of probiotic formulations that protect an amphibian host by killing or inhibiting Bd have shown promise as an effective chytridiomycosis control strategy. The North American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is a common carrier of Bd and harbours a diverse skin microbiota that includes lactic acid bacteria (LAB), a microbial group containing species classified as safe and conferring host benefits. We investigated beneficial/probiotic properties: anti-Bd activity, and adhesion and colonisation characteristics (hydrophobicity, biofilm formation and exopolysaccharide-EPS production) in two confirmed LAB (cLAB-Enterococcus gallinarum CRL 1826, Lactococcus garvieae CRL 1828) and 60 presumptive LAB (pLAB) [together named as LABs] isolated from bullfrog skin.We challenged LABs against eight genetically diverse Bd isolates and found that 32% of the LABs inhibited at least one Bd isolate with varying rates of inhibition. Thus, we established a score of sensitivity from highest (BdGPL AVS7) to lowest (BdGPL C2A) for the studied Bd isolates. We further reveal key factors underlying host adhesion and colonisation of LABs. Specifically, 90.3% of LABs exhibited hydrophilic properties that may promote adhesion to the cutaneous mucus, with the remaining isolates (9.7%) being hydrophobic in nature with a surface polarity compatible with colonisation of acidic, basic or both substrate types. We also found that 59.7% of LABs showed EPS synthesis and 66.1% produced biofilm at different levels: 21% weak, 29% moderate, and 16.1% strong. Together all these properties enhance colonisation of the host surface (mucus or epithelial cells) and may confer protective benefits against Bd through competitive exclusion. Correspondence analysis indicated that biofilm synthesis was LABs specific with high aggregating bacteria correlating with strong biofilm producers, and EPS producers being correlated to negative biofilm producing LABs. We performed Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis and demonstrated a higher degree of genetic diversity among rod-shaped pLAB than cocci. Based on the LAB genetic analysis and specific probiotic selection criteria that involve beneficial properties, we sequenced 16 pLAB which were identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus thailandicus, Lactobacillus pentosus/L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. curvatus. Compatibility assays performed with cLAB and the 16 species described above indicate that all tested LAB can be included in a mixed probiotic formula.

A combination of Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman microscopy is used to determine the chemical elements and crystallizations at the ceramic surface. Moreover, Kelvin probe force microscopy demonstrates that the presence of glass-free edges in feldspar needle crystals (semiconductor phase) on a glass matrix (insulator phase) promotes the formation of semiconductor-insulator interface barriers. These barriers act as reservoirs of electric charges of ∼1.5 V, producing a discharge exceeding the microorganism membrane breakdown value (up to 0.5 V). Furthermore, the surface crystallizations account for the formation of a microroughness that limits biofilm formation.

The formation of biofilms and the accumulation of trehalose and sporulation are well-known strategies used by bacteria to survive desiccation. Other mechanisms, including intrinsically disordered proteins and the anti-glycation defence, have been mainly studied in eukaryotic cells, and their role in bacteria remains unclear. We have recently shown that the impairment of trehalose synthesis results in higher glucose availability, leading to the accumulation of acetyl phosphate and enhanced protein acetylation, which in turn stimulates protein aggregation. In the absence of trehalose synthesis, excess glucose may stimulate non-enzymatic glycosylation and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) bound to proteins. Therefore, we propose that trehalose may prevent protein damage, not only as a chemical chaperone but also as a metabolite that indirectly counteracts detrimental protein acetylation and glycation.","authors":[{"name":"Ewa Laskowska"},{"name":"Dorota Kuczyńska-Wiśnik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Advanced glycation end products"},{"word":"Desiccation"},{"word":"Protein acetylation"},{"word":"Protein aggregation"}]},"article56":{"pmid":"31559255","title":"Successful Treatment of Dermatophytomas in 19 Patients Using Efinaconazole 10% Solution.","abs":"Dermatophytomas represent a historically difficult-to-treat complication of onychomycosis and are characterized by adherent fungal masses encased in biofilm in the subungual space.

Terrestrial isopods have evolved a lifestyle including feeding on a lignocellulose diet. Whether isopods utilize both external and internal cellulases for digestion of a diet is still not understood. We experimentally manipulated the content of cellulose (30%, 60%, or 90%) and the amount of biofilm (small or large) in the offered food source and quantified growth and cellulolytic activity in the gut of the isopod Porcellio scaber. The presence of a visible biofilm significantly promoted isopod growth, regardless of the cellulose content in the diet. The activity of gut cellulases was not significantly affected by the amount of biofilm or the cellulose content. Our results do not support a significant contribution of either ingested or host enzymes to cellulose utilization in P. scaber.

P. aeruginosa has been shown to undergo extensive genomic adaptation facilitating its persistence within the CF lung allowing it to evade the host immune response and outcompete co-colonizing residents of the lung microbiota. However, whilst several studies have described the various mutations that frequently arise in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, the environmental factors governing the emergence of these genetic variants is less well characterized. Gastro-oesophageal reflux has recently emerged as a major co-morbidity in CF and is often associated with the presence of bile acids in the lungs most likely by (micro) aspiration. In order to investigate whether bile may select for genetic variants, P. aeruginosa was experimentally evolved in artificial sputum medium, a synthetic media resembling environmental conditions found within the CF lung. Pigmented derivatives of P. aeruginosa emerged exclusively in the presence of bile. Genome sequencing analysis identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in quorum sensing (lasR) and both the pyocyanin (phzS) and pyomelanin (hmgA) biosynthetic pathways. Phenotypic analysis revealed an altered bile response when compared to the ancestral P. aeruginosa progenitor strain. While the recovered pigmented derivatives retained the bile mediated suppression of swarming motility and enhanced antibiotic tolerance, the biofilm, and redox responses to bile were abolished in the adapted mutants. Though loss of pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) production in the pigmented isolates was not linked to the altered biofilm response, the loss of redox repression could be explained by defective alkyl-quinolone (AQ) production in the presence of bile.

We identified both pathogens in polymicrobial urethral catheter biofilms (CBs) with a combination of 16S rDNA sequencing, proteomic analyses, and microbial cultures. Longitudinal sampling of biofilms from serially replaced catheters revealed that each species persisted in the urinary tract of a patient in cohabitation with 1 or more gram-negative uropathogens. The Gs and Au proteomes revealed active glycolytic, heterolactic fermentation, and peptide catabolic energy metabolism pathways in an anaerobic milieu. A few phosphotransferase system (PTS)-based sugar uptake and oligopeptide ABC transport systems were highly expressed, indicating adaptations to the supply of nutrients in urine and from exfoliating squamous epithelial and urothelial cells. Differences in the Au vs Gs metabolisms pertained to citrate lyase and utilization and storage of glycogen (evident only in Gs proteomes) and to the enzyme Xfp that degrades d-xylulose-5'-phosphate and the biosynthetic pathways for 2 protein cofactors, pyridoxal 6'-phosphate and 4'-phosphopantothenate (expressed only in Au proteomes). A predicted ZnuA-like transition metal ion uptake system was identified for Gs while Au expressed 2 LPXTG-anchored surface proteins, one of which had a predicted pilin D adhesion motif.

To assess the potential impact of the plasmids on virulence, 43 IncI1-positive Salmonella isolates from human and animal sources were subjected to whole genome sequence (WGS) analyses and evaluated for their abilities to invade and persist for 48 h in Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells, form biofilms and encode bacteriocins. Draft WGS data were submitted to predict the presence of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, plasmid replicon types present, conduct plasmid multilocus sequence typing (pMLST), and core genome MLST (cgMLST) in the isolates. Caco-2 cells were infected with Salmonella strains and incubated for both one and 48 h for the invasion and persistence assays, respectively. Additionally, Salmonella isolates and IncI1 plasmid carrying transconjugants (n = 12) generated in Escherichia coli were assessed for their ability to produce biofilms and bacteriocin inhibition of growth of other bacteria. All Salmonella isolates infected Caco-2 cells and persisted in the cells at 48 hrs.

Traits associated with improved broiler growth and feed efficiency have been subjected to intense genetic selection, but measures such as feed conversion ratio (FCR) remain variable, even between full siblings (sibs). Non-genetic factors such as the composition and function of microbial populations within different enteric compartments have been recognized to influence FCR, although the extent of interplay between hosts and their microbiomes is unclear. To examine host-microbiome interactions we investigated variation in the composition and functions of host intestinal-hepatic transcriptomes and the intestinal microbiota of full-sib broilers with divergent FCR. Progeny from 300 broiler families were assessed for divergent FCR set against shared genetic backgrounds and exposure to the same environmental factors. The seven most divergent full-sib pairs were chosen for analysis, exhibiting marked variation in transcription of genes as well as gut microbial diversity. Examination of enteric microbiota in low FCR sibs revealed variation in microbial community structure and function with no difference in feed intake compared to high FCR sibs.

Highly intertwined interactions between host transcriptomes and enteric microbiota are likely to modulate complex traits like FCR and may be amenable to selective modification with relevance to improving intestinal homeostasis and health.","authors":[{"name":"Tejas M Shah"},{"name":"Jignasha G Patel"},{"name":"Tejas P Gohil"},{"name":"Damer P Blake"},{"name":"Chaitanya G Joshi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Metagenomics"},{"word":"Microbiome"}]},"article88":{"pmid":"31552139","title":"Exploiting biofilm phenotypes for functional characterization of hypothetical genes in Enterococcus faecalis.","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal organism as well as an important nosocomial pathogen, and its infections are typically linked to biofilm formation.

Phylogenetic reconstruction grouped the 169 isolates into six clades with a distinct distribution of clinical and commensal isolates in the different clades. Phenotypically, multi-drug antibiotic resistance was detected in 108/123 (88%) of the clinical isolates and 5/46 (11%) of the commensal isolates (p < 0.05). In the clinical isolates, we commonly identified a homolog of the serine-rich repeat glycoproteins sraP.

Clinical S. haemolyticus isolates showed specific signatures associated with successful hospital adaption. Biofilm forming S. haemolyticus isolates that are resistant to oxacillin (mecA) and aminoglycosides (aacA-aphD) are most likely invasive isolates whereas absence of these traits strongly indicates a commensal isolate. We conclude that our data show a clear segregation of isolates of commensal origin, and specific genetic signatures distinguishing the clinical isolates from the commensal isolates.

We confirmed that curli enhanced UPEC colonization in the urinary tract, resulting in damage to both the bladder and kidney. Intranasal immunization with recombinant CsgA protein protected against colonization by curli-producing UPEC in the urinary tract. Quantification of cytokines from urinary tract organs showed increases in interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release in the kidneys 48 h postinfection with curli-producing UPEC. By contrast, mice infected with non-curli-producing UPEC showed the highest release of interleukin-6, -10, and -17A and TNF.

QS regulates the expression of many genes associated with virulence factor production and biofilm formation. This latter is known to be involved in antibiotic and phage resistance mechanisms. Therefore, disrupting QS, a strategy known as quorum quenching (QQ), appears to be an interesting way to reduce bacterial virulence and increase antibiotic and phage treatment efficiency. In this study, the ability of the QQ enzyme SsoPox-W263I, a lactonase able to degrade acyl-homoserine lactones, was investigated for quenching both virulence and biofilm formation in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from diabetic foot ulcers, as well as in the PA14 model strain. These strains were further evolved to resist to bacteriophage cocktails. Overall, 10 antibiotics or bacteriophage resistant strains were evaluated and SsoPox-W263I was shown to decrease pyocyanin, protease and elastase production in all strains. Furthermore, a reduction of more than 70% of biofilm formation was achieved in six out of ten strains. This anti-virulence potential was confirmed in vivo using an amoeba infection model, showing enhanced susceptibility toward amoeba of nine out of ten P. aeruginosa isolates upon QQ.

To fill this gap, we performed comparative analysis of the whole proteomic profiles of two methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains growing in planktonic and in sessile form to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying biofilm stability. After 72-h culture of biofilm-forming S. epidermidis, overexpression of proteins involved in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphate and polysaccharides was observed, whereas planktonic bacteria expressed proteins linked to stress and anaerobic growth. Cytological analysis was performed to determine why planktonic bacteria unexpectedly expressed proteins typical of sessile culture. Images evidenced that prolonged culture under vigorous agitation can create a stressful growing environment that triggers microorganism aggregation in a biofilm-like matrix as a mechanism to survive harsh conditions. The choice of a unique late time point provided an important clue for future investigations into the biofilm-like behavior of planktonic cells.

Several measures are recognized as being useful to prevent VAP, and these are usually grouped in a VAP bundle (ie, avoiding intubation or re-intubation whenever possible; head of bed elevation; hand hygiene; shortening ventilation through sedation interruptions, spontaneous breathing trials, or thromboembolic prophylaxis). However, other interventions have been proposed to reduce VAP rate; some of these interventions have been reported in large clinical trials to be effective, some have been evaluated in small observational studies, and still others at a pre-clinical stage. Some strategies aim to improve the ETT design via a subglottic drainage system, with treatment of the ETT surface to reduce pathogen activity, or by modification of the cuff shape or cuff material to provide a better seal. Another proposed strategy is improving airway care through control of cuff pressure, cleaning the ETT, or use of closed suction systems. Other interventions target a patient's position in the bed to reduce aspiration of digestive content in the airways, or the use of probiotics to modulate gastric flora.

Resource distribution strongly affected snail movement. Trajectories were tortuous (i.e. Brownian-like) within resource patches but straighter (i.e. Lévy) in resource-free (bare) patches. The average snail speed was slower in resource patches, where snails spent most of their time. Different patterns of movement between resource and bare patches explained movement at larger spatial scales; movement was ballistic-like Lévy in resource-free landscapes, Lévy in landscapes with intermediate resource coverage and approximated Brownian in landscapes covered in resources. Our temporal analysis revealed that movement patterns changed predictably for snails that satiated their hunger and then performed other behaviours.

Here, we present a charge-switchable antibacterial and antibiofilm coating based on water-insoluble cationic hydrophobic polymers that are soluble in organic solvents and can be noncovalently coated onto different surfaces. Toward this, a library of quaternary polyethylenimine (QPEI) polymers with an amide or ester group in their pendant alkyl chain was developed. These QPEIs are shown to hydrolyze from active cationic to nontoxic zwitterionic polymers under acidic or enzymatic conditions. Notably, polymers with both zwitterionic and cationic groups, obtained upon partial hydrolysis of QPEIs, are shown to retain their antibacterial activity with much lower toxicity toward mammalian cells. Furthermore, the zwitterionic polymer, a fully hydrolyzed product of the QPEIs, is shown to be nontoxic to mammalian cells in vitro as well as in vivo. The QPEIs, when coated onto surfaces, kill bacteria and prevent formation of biofilms. In an in vivo mice model, the QPEI-coated medical grade catheter is shown to reduce methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus contamination both on the catheter surface and in the adjacent tissues (99.99% reduction compared to a noncoated catheter). Additionally, biofilm formation is inhibited on the catheter surface with negligible inflammation in the adjacent tissue.

As sporulation is imperative to the successful transmission of C. difficile this study was undertaken to investigate phenotypic characteristics of this asporogenous phenotype with regards to growth rate, antibiotic susceptibility, toxin production and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"M C Connor"},{"name":"J W McGrath"},{"name":"G McMullan"},{"name":"N Marks"},{"name":"M Guelbenzu"},{"name":"D J Fairley"}],"keywords":[]},"article115":{"pmid":"31548510","title":"The Prevalence, Antibiotic Resistance and Biofilm Formation of Staphylococcus aureus in Bulk Ready-To-Eat Foods.","abs":"The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in 2160 bulk ready-to-eat foods from the Sichuan province of China during 2013-2016 was investigated.

Geobacter sulfurreducens is a commonly enriched electricity-producing organism, forming thick conductive biofilms that magnify total activity by supporting respiration of cells not in direct contact with electrodes. Hypotheses explaining why these biofilms fail to produce higher current densities suggest inhibition by formation of pH, nutrient, or redox potential gradients; but these explanations are often contradictory, and a lack of direct measurements of cellular growth within biofilms prevents discrimination between these models. To address this fundamental question, we measured the anabolic activity of G. sulfurreducens biofilms using stable isotope probing coupled to nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS). Our results demonstrate that the most active cells are at the anode surface, and that this activity decreases with distance, reaching a minimum 10 µm from the electrode. Cells nearest the electrode continue to grow at their maximum rate in weeks-old biofilms 80-µm-thick, indicating nutrient or buffer diffusion into the biofilm is not rate-limiting. This pattern, where highest activity occurs at the electrode and declines with each cell layer, is present in thin biofilms (<5 µm) and fully grown biofilms (>20 µm), and at different anode redox potentials. These results suggest a growth penalty is associated with respiring insoluble electron acceptors at micron distances, which has important implications for improving microbial electrochemical devices as well as our understanding of syntrophic associations harnessing the phenomenon of microbial conductivity.","authors":[{"name":"Grayson L Chadwick"},{"name":"Fernanda Jiménez Otero"},{"name":"Jeffrey A Gralnick"},{"name":"Daniel R Bond"},{"name":"Victoria J Orphan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Geobacter sulfurreducens"},{"word":"electrode reduction"},{"word":"extracellular electron transfer"},{"word":"nanoSIMS"},{"word":"stable isotope tracers"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"31548326","title":"Expression of the Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae Type IV Pilus Is Stimulated by Coculture with Host Respiratory Tract Epithelial Cells.","abs":"The type IV pilus (Tfp) of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) mediates adherence, colonization, motility, and biofilm formation, and the major protein subunit, PilA, is a promising vaccine candidate. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Tfp expression is regulated within the microenvironments of the human nasopharynx, which NTHI colonizes asymptomatically, and the more distal regions of the respiratory tract where NTHI-induced diseases occur. Here, we examined the effects of coculture of NTHI with human airway epithelial cells and heme availability on Tfp expression at temperatures typical of the human nasopharynx (34°C) or warmer anatomical sites during infection (37°C). Tfp expression was estimated by pilA promoter activity, pilA gene expression, and relative abundances of PilA and pilin protein. The results revealed that at both temperatures, NTHI cocultured with airway epithelial cells demonstrated significantly greater expression of pilA, PilA/pilin protein, and likely, fully assembled Tfp than NTHI cultured on an abiotic surface. Because NTHI is a heme auxotroph, we hypothesized that availability of heme from host cells might be a signal for Tfp expression. Thereby, we cultured NTHI in iron-limited medium, and we observed that supplementation with heme significantly increased pilA promoter activity. Collectively, our data suggested that NTHI Tfp expression was stimulated by soluble factor(s) released by epithelial cells, which are present in all microenvironments of the respiratory tract.

Importantly, these infections are often difficult to treat effectively in part due to the recalcitrance of biofilms to antimicrobial therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that polymicrobial interactions can lead to dramatic and unexpected changes in the ability of antibiotics to eradicate biofilms and often result in decreased antimicrobial efficacy in vitro In this review, we discuss the influence of polymicrobial interactions on the antibiotic susceptibility of biofilms, and we highlight the studies that first documented the shifted antimicrobial susceptibilities of mixed-species cultures. Recent studies have identified several mechanisms underlying the recalcitrance of polymicrobial biofilm communities, including interspecies exchange of antibiotic resistance genes, β-lactamase-mediated inactivation of antibiotics, changes in gene expression induced by metabolites and quorum sensing signals, inhibition of the electron transport chain, and changes in properties of the cell membrane. In addition to elucidating multiple mechanisms that contribute to the altered drug susceptibility of polymicrobial biofilms, these studies have uncovered novel ways in which polymicrobial interactions can impact microbial physiology. The diversity of findings discussed highlights the importance of continuing to investigate the efficacy of antibiotics against biofilm communities composed of different combinations of microbial species. Together, the data presented here illustrate the importance of studying microbes as part of mixed-species communities rather than in isolation. In light of our greater understanding of how interspecies interactions alter the efficacy of antimicrobial agents, we propose that the methods for measuring the drug susceptibility of polymicrobial infections should be revisited.","authors":[{"name":"Giulia Orazi"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"polymicrobial"},{"word":"recalcitrance"},{"word":"resistance"},{"word":"tolerance"}]},"article120":{"pmid":"31548061","title":"Antimicrobial resistance and genetic characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococci from bovine mastitis milk samples in Korea.","abs":"Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are one of the most common bovine mastitis pathogens found worldwide.

Further evaluation of the CNS isolates revealed 14 CNS species among the samples and 3 predominant species-namely, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus simulans, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Resistance was higher in S. epidermidis than in other CNS species except for resistance against oxacillin in Staphylococcus sciuri. Resistance to β-lactams was the most common in all CNS species (8.4% in ampicillin, 21.2% in oxacillin, and 13.5% in penicillin). Conversely, only minimal resistance to cephalothin, ceftiofur, and pirlimycin/novobiocin was found. Twenty-one isolates from 4 species were mecA-carrying MRCNS strains, including 18 S. epidermidis and 1 each of S. sciuri, Staphylococcus equorum, and Staphylococcus hominis. The majority of the mecA-carrying MRCNS isolates were produced in the biofilm. Furthermore, multidrug-resistant sequence type 179 isolate produced the strongest biofilm. Seven genotypes were detected in the 18 MR S. epidermidis strains, the most predominant of which persisted on a farm for 2 yr. Our findings for the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and genotypic characterization of the MRCNS isolates could provide valuable information for controlling the spread of resistance and the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapies for mastitis in the future.

Recent observations have provided additional evidence that sRNAs are key regulators of bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. These sRNAs have been divided into 5 functional groups: cis-encoded RNAs, trans-encoded RNAs, RNA regulators of protein activity, bacterial CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) RNAs, and a novel category of miRNA-size small RNAs (msRNAs). In this review, we discuss a critical group of key commensal and opportunistic oral pathogens. In general, supragingival bacterial sRNAs function synergistically to fine-tune the regulation of cellular processes and stress responses in adaptation to environmental changes. Particularly in the cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans, both the antisense vicR RNA and msRNA1657 can impede the metabolism of bacterial exopolysaccharides, prevent biofilm formation, and suppress its cariogenicity. In Enterococcus faecalis, selected sRNAs control the expression of proteins involved in diverse cellular processes and stress responses. In subgingival plaques, sRNAs from periodontal pathogens can function as novel bacterial signaling molecules that mediate bacterial-human interactions in periodontal homeostasis. In Porphyromonas gingivalis, the expression profiles of putative sRNA101 and sRNA42 were found to respond to hemin availability after hemin starvation. Regarding Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), a major periodontal pathogen associated with aggressive periodontitis, the predicted sRNAs interact with several virulence genes, including those encoding leukotoxin and cytolethal distending toxin. Furthermore, in clinical isolates, these associated RNAs could be explored not only as potential biomarkers for oral disease monitoring but also as alternative types of regulators for drug design. Thus, this emerging subspecialty of bacterial regulatory RNAs could reshape our understanding of bacterial gene regulation from their key roles of endogenous regulatory RNAs to their activities in pathologic processes.","authors":[{"name":"L Lei"},{"name":"Y Yang"},{"name":"Y Yang"},{"name":"S Wu"},{"name":"X Ma"},{"name":"M Mao"},{"name":"T Hu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"noncoding RNA"},{"word":"pathogenicity"},{"word":"polysaccharides"},{"word":"regulation"}]},"article123":{"pmid":"31547513","title":"The Core Proteome of Biofilm-Grown Clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates.","abs":"Comparative genomics has greatly facilitated the identification of shared as well as unique features among individual cells or tissues, and thus offers the potential to find disease markers.

Furthermore, we found that protein-to-mRNA ratios between different P. aeruginosa strains are well correlated, indicating conserved patterns of post-transcriptional regulation.

In this review, the in vitro and in vivo studies provided us with the insight into the role of Candida virulence factors that mediate their success as pathogens, such as: membrane and cell wall (CW) barriers, dimorphism, biofilm formation, signal transduction pathway, proteins related to stress tolerance, hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., proteases, lipases, haemolysins), and toxin production. The review characterized the virulence of clinically important C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei. Due to the white-opaque transition in the mating type locus MTL-homozygous cells, C. albicans demonstrates advantage over the other less related species of Candida as a human commensal and pathogen. It was reviewed that Candida ergosterol biosynthesis genes play a role in cellular stress and are essential for Candida pathogenesis both in invasive and superficial infections. Hydrolases associated with CW are involved in the host-pathogen interactions. Adhesins are crucial in colonization and biofilm formation, an important virulence factor for candidiasis. Calcineurin is involved in membrane and CW stress as well as virulence. The hyphae- specific toxin, named candidalysin, invades mucosal cells facilitating fungal invasion into deeper tissues. Expression of this protein promotes resistance to neutrophil killing in candidiasis. The virulence factors provide immunostimulatory factors, activating dendric cells and promoting T cell infiltration and activation. Targeting virulence factors can reduce risk of resistance development in Candida infections.","authors":[{"name":"Staniszewska Monika"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"morphogenesis"},{"word":"pathogenicity"},{"word":"stress regulator"},{"word":"surface barriers"},{"word":"toxin"},{"word":"virulence targets"}]},"article138":{"pmid":"31544364","title":"Risk assessments in orthodontic patients developing white spot lesions.","abs":"To determine whether caries risk factors, including cariogenic bacterial levels and salivary function, can be used to identify orthodontic patients who develop white spot lesions (WSL).","authors":[{"name":"Danielle K Leeper"},{"name":"Amal Noureldin"},{"name":"Katie Julien"},{"name":"Phillip M Campbell"},{"name":"Peter H Buschang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"decalcification"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"orthodontics"},{"word":"risk"},{"word":"saliva"}]},"article139":{"pmid":"31544055","title":"Gas Sensor Array System Properties for Detecting Bacterial Biofilms.","abs":"Gas sensor array system is a device that mimics the work of how the nose smells using the gas sensors that could give response toward specific odors.

Novel, innovative strategies are needed to eradicate bacteria, particularly within biofilms, and diminish the likelihood of recurrence. In this study, we investigated whether glutathione (GSH) can act as a biofilm disruptor, and enhance antibiotic effectiveness against various bacterial pathogens. Biological levels (10 mM) of GSH did not have a significant effect in inhibiting growth or disrupting the biofilm in four out of six species tested. However, exposure to 30 mM GSH showed >50% decrease in growth for all bacterial species, with almost 100% inhibition of Streptococcus pyogenes and an average of 94-52% inhibition for Escherichia coli, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) isolates, respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter sp. isolates were however, highly resistant to 30 mM GSH. With respect to biofilm viability, all species exhibited a >50% decrease in viability with 30 mM GSH, with confocal imaging showing considerable change in the biofilm architecture of MRAB isolates. The mechanism of GSH-mediated biofilm disruption is possibly due to a concentration-dependent increase in GSH acidity that triggers cleaving of the matrix components. Enzymatic treatment of MRAB revealed that eDNA and polysaccharides are essential for biofilm stability and eDNA removal enhanced amikacin efficiency. Combination of GSH, amikacin and DNase-I showed the greatest reduction in MRAB biofilm viability.

One essential strategy of Gram-negative bacteria is the secretion of virulence factors through both inner and outer membranes to reach a potential target. Most secretion systems are harbored in mobile elements including transposons, plasmids, pathogenicity islands, and phages, and Escherichia coli is one of the more versatile bacteria adopting this genetic information by horizontal gene transfer. Additionally, E. coli is a bacterial species with members of the commensal intestinal microbiota and pathogens associated with numerous types of infections such as intestinal, urinary, and systemic in humans and other animals. T6SS cluster plasticity suggests evolutionarily divergent systems were acquired horizontally. T6SS is a secretion nanomachine that is extended through the bacterial double membrane; from this apparatus, substrates are conveyed straight from the cytoplasm of the bacterium into a target cell or to the extracellular space. This nanomachine consists of three main complexes: proteins in the inner membrane that are T4SS component-like, the baseplate complex, and the tail complex, which are formed by components evolutionarily related to contractile bacteriophage tails. Advances in the T6SS understanding include the functional and structural characterization of at least 13 subunits (so-called core components), which are thought to comprise the minimal apparatus. So far, the main role of T6SS is on bacterial competition by using it to kill neighboring non-immune bacteria for which antibacterial proteins are secreted directly into the periplasm of the bacterial target after cell-cell contact. Interestingly, a few T6SSs have been associated directly to pathogenesis, e.g., roles in biofilm formation and macrophage survival. Here, we focus on the advances on T6SS from the perspective of E. coli pathotypes with emphasis in the secretion apparatus architecture, the mechanisms of pathogenicity of effector proteins, and the events of lateral gene transfer that led to its spread.","authors":[{"name":"Fernando Navarro-Garcia"},{"name":"Fernando Ruiz-Perez"},{"name":"Ángel Cataldi"},{"name":"Mariano Larzábal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial competition"},{"word":"diarrheagenic E. coli"},{"word":"effector proteins"},{"word":"genome plasticity"},{"word":"inner and outer membranes"},{"word":"protein translocation"},{"word":"type 6 secretion system"}]},"article144":{"pmid":"31543653","title":"Biofilm Formation of Methicillin-resistant Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci Isolated from Clinical Samples in Northern Thailand.","abs":"Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) are multidrug-resistant bacteria that are difficult to treat because of their ability to form biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Thawatchai Kitti"},{"name":"Rathanin Seng"},{"name":"Rapee Thummeepak"},{"name":"Chalermchai Boonlao"},{"name":"Thanyasiri Jindayok"},{"name":"Sutthirat Sitthisak"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm-associated protein"},{"word":"intracellular adhesion AD"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus"}]},"article145":{"pmid":"31543613","title":"Detection of Enterococcus faecalis in subgingival biofilms of healthy, gingivitis, and chronic periodontitis subjects.","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic coccus that can survive under harsh conditions.

To improve its performance in MSL system, the relationship between biophysiological characteristics of denitrifying species and operating conditions was studied. Microbial species diversity of activated sludge and soil samples were analyzed. The significant effects of independent factors and their interactions on microbial species diversity and denitrifying species abundance were revealed on the basis of factorial analysis. The results indicated activated sludge in SMBs played a key role in increasing the richness of denitrifying species in MSL system. Slow-release poly (butylene succinate) (PBS) had the most dominant positive effect on increasing denitrifying species abundance. Submersion had significantly positive effect on species richness in SMBs. These three factors, including activated sludge, PBS in SMBs, and submersion condition had different significant effects on microbial responses.

RA is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, the production of anti-citrullinated proteins antibodies (ACPA) leading to synovial joint inflammation and destruction. PD is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with a dysbiotic microbial biofilm affecting the supporting tissues around the teeth leading to the destruction of mineralized and non-mineralized connective tissues. Chronic inflammation associated with both RA and PD is similar in the predominant adaptive immune phenotype, in the imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and in the role of smoking and genetic background as risk factors. Structural damage that occurs in consequence of chronic inflammation is the ultimate cause of loss of function and disability observed with the progression of RA and PD. Interestingly, the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated in the generation of ACPA in RA patients, suggesting a direct biological intersection between PD and RA. However, more studies are warranted to confirm this link, elucidate potential mechanisms involved, and ascertain temporal associations between RA and PD. This review is mainly focused on recent clinical and translational research intends to discuss and provide an overview of the relationship between RA and PD, exploring the similarities in the immune-pathological aspects and the possible mechanisms linking the development and progression of both diseases.

In order to unravel the architecture of microalgae biofilms, four species of commercial interest were cultivated in microplates and characterized using a combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. In all the species, the biofilm biovolume and thickness increased over time and reached a plateau after seven days; however, the final biomass reached was very different. The roughness decreased during maturation, reflecting cell division and voids filling. The extracellular polymeric substances content of the matrix remained constant in some species, and increased over time in some others. Vertical profiles showed that young biofilms presented a maximum cell density at 20 μm above the substratum co-localized with matrix components. In mature biofilms, the maximum density of cells moved at a greater distance from the substratum (30-40 μm), whereas the maximum coverage of matrix components remained in a deeper layer.

Thus, a growing need exists to develop alternative treatments to reduce both the occurrence of bacterial infection and biofilm development, as well as pathological progression post-infection. Silk derived from Bombyx mori silkworms serves as a unique biomaterial that is biocompatible with low immunogenicity and high versatility, and thereby ideal for stabilizing therapeutics. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxicity of P. aeruginosa on human corneal stromal stem cells and two mucosal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT29-MTX). To determine whether antibiotic-immobilized scaffolds can serve as alternative therapeutics to free, diffuse forms, we developed novel gentamicin-conjugated silk films as functional scaffolds and compared antimicrobial effects and free gentamicin. The advantages of generating a surface coating with a covalently-bound antibiotic may reduce potential side-effects associated with free gentamicin, as well as limit the diffusion of the drug. Our results suggest that gentamicin conjugated to native silk and carboxyl-enriched silk inhibits P. aeruginosa growth. Development of stabilized antibiotic treatments with surface toxicity selective against bacteria may serve as an alternative approach to treat active infections, as well as potential prophylactic use as coatings in high-risk cases, such as post-surgical complications or prolonged hospitalization.","authors":[{"name":"Tina B McKay"},{"name":"Rachael N Parker"},{"name":"Morgan J Hawker"},{"name":"Meghan McGill"},{"name":"David L Kaplan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic"},{"word":"scaffold"},{"word":"silk"}]},"article167":{"pmid":"31540203","title":"Effects of Ultrasound on Zinc Oxide/Vermiculite/Chlorhexidine Nanocomposite Preparation and Their Antibacterial Activity.","abs":"Microbial infection and biofilm formation are both problems associated with medical implants and devices. In recent years, hybrid organic-inorganic nanocomposites based on clay minerals have attracted significant attention due to their application potential in the field of antimicrobial materials. Organic drug/metal oxide hybrids exhibit improved antimicrobial activity, and intercalating the above materials into the interlayer of clay endows a long-term and controlled-release behavior. Since antimicrobial activity is strongly related to the structure of the material, ultrasonic treatment appears to be a suitable method for the synthesis of these materials as it can well control particle size distribution and morphology. This study aims to prepare novel, structurally stable, and highly antimicrobial nanocomposites based on zinc oxide/vermiculite/chlorhexidine. The influence of ultrasonic treatment at different time intervals and under different intercalation conditions (ultrasonic action in a breaker or in a Roset's vessel) on the structure, morphology, and particle size of prepared hybrid nanocomposite materials was evaluated by the following methods: scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, carbon phase analysis, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, specific surface area measurement, particle size analysis, and Zeta potential analysis. Particle size analyses confirmed that the ultrasonic method contributes to the reduction of particle size, and to their homogenization/arrangement. Further, X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that ultrasound intercalation in a beaker helps to more efficiently intercalate chlorhexidine dihydrochloride (CH) into the vermiculite interlayer space, while a Roset's vessel contributed to the attachment of the CH molecules to the vermiculite surface. The antibacterial activity of hybrid nanocomposite materials was investigated on Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) bacterial strains by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration. All hybrid nanocomposite materials prepared by ultrasound methods showed high antimicrobial activity after 30 min, with a long-lasting effect and without being affected by the concentration of the antibacterial components zinc oxide (ZnO) and CH. The benefits of the samples prepared by ultrasonic methods are the rapid onset of an antimicrobial effect and its long-term duration.","authors":[{"name":"Karla Čech Barabaszová"},{"name":"Sylva Holešová"},{"name":"Kateřina Šulcová"},{"name":"Marianna Hundáková"},{"name":"Barbora Thomasová"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial activity"},{"word":"chlorhexidine"},{"word":"mechanical stirring"},{"word":"ultrasonic intercalation"},{"word":"vermiculite"},{"word":"zinc oxide nanoparticles"}]},"article168":{"pmid":"31540175","title":"The Pathogenic Factors from Oral Streptococci for Systemic Diseases.","abs":"The oral cavity is suggested as the reservoir of bacterial infection, and the oral and pharyngeal biofilms formed by oral bacterial flora, which is comprised of over 700 microbial species, have been found to be associated with systemic conditions.

In this study, a biofilm model originally developed for wastewater treatment was modified to simulate the microbial kinetics and substance conversions in aqueous surface sediments. The model was validated by the experimental data and could predict chemical profiles and microbial distributions in sediments. The model revealed complicated interactions between different microbial communities and environmental factors, including competition between aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The results of model simulations showed that the effects of environmental factors, especially dissolved oxygen and ammonia in overlying water, on methane fluxes are very complicated. Rapid environmental changes (which can be caused by tide, day-night alternation, or zoobenthic and human activity) and intensive competition between microbes greatly affected methane fluxes and resulted in alternation between atmospheric methane source and sink in unstable sediments.

Sandblasted and acid-etched commercially pure titanium discs were used as substrates for bacteria (n = 107). The discs were immersed in an S mutans solution and incubated for 21 hours to form an S mutans biofilm. Twenty colonized discs were subjected to air abrasion with Bioglass 45S5 (45S5 BAG), experimental zinc oxide containing BAG (Zn4 BAG), and inert glass. After the abrasion, the discs were incubated for 5 hours in an anaerobic chamber followed by an assessment of viable S mutans cells. Surface morphology was evaluation using scanning electron microscopy (n = 12). The thrombogenicity of the glass particle-abraded discs (n = 75) was evaluated spectrophotometrically using whole-blood clotting measurement at predetermined time points. Air abrasion with 45S5 and Zn4 BAG eradicated S mutans biofilm. Significantly fewer viable S mutans cells were found on discs abraded with the 45S5 or Zn4 BAGs compared with the inert glass (P < .001). No significant differences were found in thrombogenicity since blood clotting was achieved for all substrates at 40 minutes. Air abrasion with BAG particles is effective in the eradication of S mutans biofilm from sandblasted and acid-etched titanium surfaces. Zn4 and 45S5 BAGs had similar biofilm-eradicating effects, but Zn4 BAG could be more tissue friendly. In addition, the steady release of zinc ions from Zn4 may enhance bone regeneration around the titanium implant and may thus have the potential to be used in the treatment of peri-implantitis.

This happens through several fermentative phases that are characterized by cooperation and competition among the microbes within the kombucha solution. Yeast produce invertase as a public good that enables both yeast and bacteria to metabolize sugars. Bacteria produce a surface biofilm which may act as a public good providing protection from invaders, storage for resources, and greater access to oxygen for microbes embedded within it.

Adhesion was evaluated with the Biofilm Ring Test®, and biofilm formation was identified by crystal violet staining (Solid-Liquid, SLI-biofilm) or visual examination (Air-Liquid, ALI-biofilm). This study linked for the first time the formation of robust ALI-biofilm plugs by K. pneumoniae to the capsular serotype K1, a group of hypervirulent strains which are generally highly susceptible to the antimicrobial agents. Among all the studied isolates, the capsular serotype K1 presented lower initial adhesion despite having the adhesins mrkD and fimH but higher ALI-biofilm formation than isolates with other capsular serotypes (K2 or non-K1/K2). This structure might confer increased resistance to a group of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae serotype K1.","authors":[{"name":"Meritxell Cubero"},{"name":"Sara Marti"},{"name":"Mª Ángeles Domínguez"},{"name":"Aida González-Díaz"},{"name":"Dàmaris Berbel"},{"name":"Carmen Ardanuy"}],"keywords":[]},"article206":{"pmid":"31532581","title":"Effects of exogenous glucose on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is commonly found in nosocomial and life-threatening infections in patients. Biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa exhibit much greater resistance to antibiotics than the planktonic form of the bacteria. Few groups have studied the effects of glucose, a major carbon source, and metabolite, on P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and on its metabolic pathways. In this study, we investigated the effect of glucose on the biofilm formation ability of P. aeruginosa and carried out a metabolomic analysis to identify whether glucose alters the metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa in biofilms. We found that glucose efficiently promoted P. aeruginosa biofilm formation by upregulating the expression of the extracellular polysaccharide-related gene pslA. Treatment with glucose caused an increase in 7 metabolites (including 3-hydroxypropionic acid, glucose-6-phosphate, and 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid) and a decrease in 18 metabolites (including myo-inositol, glutamine, and methoxamedrine) in the biofilm. In addition, there was a synergistic effect between glucose and horse serum on biofilm formation when the two were added in combination, which also increased the resistance of biofilm to levofloxacin therapy. Thus, our work sheds light on the underlying mechanisms by which glucose may enhance biofilm formation and identifies novel targets for developing strategies to counteract biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Pengfei She"},{"name":"Yanle Wang"},{"name":"Yiqing Liu"},{"name":"Fang Tan"},{"name":"Lihua Chen"},{"name":"Zhen Luo"},{"name":"Yong Wu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"extracellular polysaccharide"},{"word":"glucose"},{"word":"metabolomics"}]},"article207":{"pmid":"31532261","title":"On-Farm Surfaces in Contact with Milk: The Role of Staphylococcus aureus-Containing Biofilms for Udder Health and Milk Quality.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes intramammary infections and bulk tank milk (BTM) contamination in dairy operations around the world in spite of on-farm application of preventive measures.

Samples for bacterial culture (n = 16) were collected from macroscopic adherence on previously washed, sanitized, and dry milking equipment surfaces in direct contact with milk during milking or cooling. A total of 48 S. aureus isolates from BTM, milking equipment, and cows' quarters with intramammary infections were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Selected milking equipment pieces were removed for biofilm visualization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). S. aureus was isolated from all three BTM samples; the average SCC for the three BTM samples was 1,429,333 cells/mL. Fourteen of the 16 samples of milking equipment (87.5%) were culture positive for S. aureus. Biofilms were visualized by SEM in all four removed milking equipment pieces. Microorganisms observed by SEM in those biofilms were mainly coccus-shaped bacteria, and microbiological culture of these biofilms yielded viable S. aureus isolates in all samples. All pulsotypes observed among S. aureus isolates from BTM were indistinguishable from those in milking equipment surfaces. All PFGE pulsotypes observed among S. aureus isolates from biofilms on rubber liners were indistinguishable from isolates from intramammary infections in cows.

However, robots designed to damage deleterious biostructures could also have important impact. In particular, there is an urgent need for new strategies to eradicate bacterial biofilms as we approach a post-antibiotic era. Biofilms are intractable and firmly attached structures ubiquitously associated with drug-resistant infections and destruction of surfaces. Existing treatments are inadequate to both kill and remove bacteria leading to reinfection. Here we design catalytic antimicrobial robots (CARs) that precisely and controllably kill, degrade and remove biofilms with remarkable efficiency. CARs exploit iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with dual catalytic-magnetic functionality that (i) generate bactericidal free radicals, (ii) breakdown the biofilm exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix, and (iii) remove the fragmented biofilm debris via magnetic field driven robotic assemblies. We develop two distinct CAR platforms. The first platform, the biohybrid CAR, is formed from NPs and biofilm degradation products. After catalytic bacterial killing and EPS disruption, magnetic field gradients assemble NPs and the biodegraded products into a plow-like superstructure. When driven with an external magnetic field, the biohybrid CAR completely removes biomass in a controlled manner, preventing biofilm regrowth. Biohybrid CARs can be swept over broad swathes of surface or can be moved over well-defined paths for localized removal with microscale precision. The second platform, the 3D molded CAR, is a polymeric soft robot with embedded catalytic-magnetic NPs, formed in a customized 3D printed mold to perform specific tasks in enclosed domains. Vane-shaped CARs remove biofilms from curved walls of cylindrical tubes, and helicoid-shaped CARs drill through biofilm clogs, while simultaneously killing bacteria. In addition, we demonstrate applications of CARs to target highly confined anatomical surfaces in the interior of human teeth. These 'kill-degrade-and-remove' CARs systems could have significant impact in fighting persistent biofilm-infections and in mitigating biofouling of medical devices and diverse surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Geelsu Hwang"},{"name":"Amauri J Paula"},{"name":"Elizabeth E Hunter"},{"name":"Yuan Liu"},{"name":"Alaa Babeer"},{"name":"Bekir Karabucak"},{"name":"Kathleen Stebe"},{"name":"Vijay Kumar"},{"name":"Edward Steager"},{"name":"Hyun Koo"}],"keywords":[]},"article214":{"pmid":"31531109","title":"Evaluation of Alternative Methods to Assess the Biological Properties of Propolis on Metabolic Activity and Biofilm Formation in Streptococcus mutans.","abs":"Several biological activities have been reported for the Chilean propolis, among their antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties, due to its high polyphenol content.

Whole genome sequence analysis revealed a complete replacement of the initial predominant variant by another isogenic variant. We report for the first time within-host evolution towards a sigma factor SigB-deficient pathotype in S. aureus bovine mastitis, associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism in rsbU (G368A → G122D), a contributor to SigB-functionality. The emerged SigB-deficient pathotype exhibits a substantial shift to new phenotypic traits comprising strong proteolytic activity and poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG)-based biofilm production. This possibly unlocks new nutritional resources and promotes immune evasion, presumably facilitating extracellular persistence within the host. Moreover, we observed an adaptation towards attenuated virulence using a mouse infection model.

Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay, we detected thermonuclease activity of S. aureus biofilms grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) earlier than that of widely studied biofilms grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB). The thermonuclease found was Nuc1, confirmed by mass spectrometry and competitive Luminex assay. These results indicate that biofilm development in IMDM may not rely on eDNA for structural stability. A bacterial viability assay in combination with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining confirmed the accumulation of dead cells and eDNA in biofilms grown in TSB. However, in biofilms grown in IMDM, minimal amounts of eDNA were found; instead, polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) was detected. To investigate if this early production of thermonuclease plays a role in immune modulation by biofilm, we studied the effect of thermonuclease on human neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation using a nuc knockout and complemented strain. We confirmed that thermonuclease produced by early-stage biofilms grown in IMDM degraded biofilm-induced NETs. Additionally, neither the presence of biofilms nor thermonuclease stimulated an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by neutrophils. Our findings indicated that S. aureus, during the early stages of biofilm formation, actively evades the host immune responses by producing thermonuclease.","authors":[{"name":"Andi R Sultan"},{"name":"Tamara Hoppenbrouwers"},{"name":"Nicole A Lemmens-den Toom"},{"name":"Susan V Snijders"},{"name":"Johan W van Neck"},{"name":"Annelies Verbon"},{"name":"Moniek P M de Maat"},{"name":"Willem J B van Wamel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"NETosis"},{"word":"NETs"},{"word":"ROS"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"early biofilm"},{"word":"thermonuclease"}]},"article230":{"pmid":"31527029","title":"Bacteriophages as Adjuvant to Antibiotics for the Treatment of Periprosthetic Joint Infection Caused by Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"We documented the adjunctive bacteriophage therapy to treat a chronic relapsing periprosthetic joint infection of the knee and chronic osteomyelitis of the femur caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa The combined antibiotic-phage treatment eradicated the infection, and no side effects to phages were observed.","authors":[{"name":"Tamta Tkhilaishvili"},{"name":"Tobias Winkler"},{"name":"Michael Müller"},{"name":"Carsten Perka"},{"name":"Andrej Trampuz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacteriophage therapy"},{"word":"biofilm infections"},{"word":"periprosthetic joint infection"}]},"article231":{"pmid":"31526987","title":"Mutual effect between electrochemically active bacteria (EAB) and azo dye in bio-electrochemical system (BES).","abs":"Herein, the mutual effect between azo dye and the performance of electrochemically active bacteria (EAB) is investigated in detail, which is crucial to understand and control the bio-electrochemical systems (BESs) operation for azo dye containing wastewater treatment.

Consistent positive correlations between bacterial genera were observed among those that exhibited either high relative abundance or high NGR.

We develop a synergistic photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) strategy aiming for biofilms eradication on titanium (Ti) implant, which is integrated with MPDA loading with photosensitizer Indocyanine Green (ICG) by π-π stacking. Specifically, MPDA is functionalized with RGD peptide to endow the modified Ti sample (Ti-M/I/RGD) with good cytocompatibility. More importantly, Ti-M/I/RGD implant remarkably kills Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm with an efficiency of 95.4% in vivo upon near infrared (NIR). After biofilm eradication, implant still displays great performance regarding osteogenesis and osseointegration.

Abietic acid was found to inhibit key bacterial growth hallmarks such as colony forming ability, adenosine triphosphate activity (both planktonic and biofilm), acid production, and biofilm formation. Abietic acid was identified as bacteriostatic, and this compound caused minimal damage to the bacterial membrane. This action was different from that of povidone-iodine or cetylpyridinium chloride. Additionally, abietic acid was significantly less cytotoxic compared to povidone-iodine, and it exerted lower toxicity towards epithelial cells and fibroblasts compared to that against monocytic cells.

The incidence of C glabrata infection has increased significantly in the last two decades, mainly due to this species' abilities to resist various antifungal drugs and to form biofilms. We focused on the relationship between biofilm formation and the product of QDR2, a C glabrata member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) gene family, given that fungal biofilm formation limits drug penetration and is associated with persistent infection. The fungal cells in biofilms were compared between a C glabrata ∆qdr2 mutant and its wild-type strain. Cells were analysed for metabolism activity and drug susceptibility (using tetrazolium assay), adhesion activity, growth assay and intracellular pH (using flow cytometry). Compared to the wild type, the C glabrata ∆qdr2 showed lower adhesion activity and higher fluconazole susceptibility when assessed as a biofilm. The mutant also showed decreased metabolic activity during biofilm formation. Furthermore, the mutant grew more slowly under neutral-basic pH conditions. The qdr2 deletion in C glabrata resulted in an impaired ability to maintain pH homeostasis, which led in turn to a reduction of cell growth and of adherence to an artificial matrix. These results suggested that the Qdr2p function is needed for proper biofilm formation and biofilm maintenance in C glabrata as well as biofilm drug resistance towards fluconazole.

Here, we expressed and purified recombinant P. gingivalis sialidase SiaPG (PG_0352) and characterized its activity on a number of substrates, including host sialoglycoproteins and highlighting the inability to cleave diacetylated sialic acids - a phenomenon overcome by the NanS sialate-esterase from T. forsythia. Indeed SiaPG required NanS to maximize sialic acid harvesting from heavily O-acetylated substrates such as bovine salivary mucin, hinting at the possibility of interspecies cooperation in sialic acid release from host sources by these members of the oral microbiota. Activity of SiaPG and P. gingivalis was inhibited using the commercially available chemotherapeutic zanamivir, indicating its potential as a virulence inhibitor, which also inhibited sialic acid release from mucin, and was capable of inhibiting biofilm formation of P. gingivalis on oral glycoprotein sources. Zanamivir also inhibited attachment and invasion of oral epithelial cells by P. gingivalis and other periodontal pathogens, both in monospecies but also in multispecies infection experiments, indicating potential to suppress host-pathogen interactions of a mixed microbial community.

Direct bioautography (DB) combined with thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a screening method for the detection of antimicrobial compounds in plant extracts, for example, in EOs. Due to their lipophilic character, the common microbiological assays (etc. disk diffusion) could not provide reliable results. The aim of this study was the evaluation of antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties of the EO of cinnamon bark, clove, peppermint, thyme, and their main components against Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae. Oil in water (O/W) type Pickering nano-emulsions stabilized with silica nanoparticles from each oil were prepared to increase their water-solubility. Samples with Tween80 surfactant and absolute ethanol were also used. Results showed that H. influenzae was more sensitive to the EOs than H. parainfluenzae (except for cinnamon bark oil). In thin layer chromatography-direct bioautography (TLC-DB) the ethanolic solutions of thyme oil presented the best activity against H. influenzae, while cinnamon oil was the most active against H. parainfluenzae. Pickering nano-emulsion of cinnamon oil inhibited the biofilm formation of H. parainfluenzae (76.35%) more efficiently than samples with Tween80 surfactant or absolute ethanol.

Biofilms of mastitic teat canal have serious clinical implications because of colonized pathogens having the ability to construct an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) with increased tolerance to antimicrobials leads to difficulty in eradicating the infection. In this study, we investigated the synergistic biofilm disruptive effect of a combination of carbohydrate hydrolases targeting extracellular polysaccharides of biofilm matrix and we termed it as 'Biofilm Clippers (BC)'. Our findings demonstrate that the BC formulation exhibits intense biofilm-disrupting activity against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. The results of the study showed that BC enables activity equivalent to physiologically achievable concentrations in disrupting biofilms of S. aureus in vitro. The synergistic anti-biofilm activities of BC on S. aureus biofilms demonstrated that the biofilm matrix is predominant of complex polysaccharides. Further, the confocal microscopic analysis demonstrates that the BC formulation is highly effective compared to the single treatment of either of the enzymes in disrupting the biofilm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the synergistic anti-biofilm activity of a class of enzyme formulation against mastitic biofilm mass.

Recently, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was successfully accomplished in the presence of Eucalyptus citriodora leaf extract as a reducing agent. In this study, the antimicrobial mechanisms of AgNPs against important hospital-acquired pathogens, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi were further assessed. The results indicated that AgNPs could enhance a broad antimicrobial spectrum against drug-resistant organisms, with a range of minimum inhibitory concentration from 0.02 to 0.36 μg/mL. Time-kill assay showed that AgNPs produced bactericidal effects on the microorganisms. AgNPs could significantly reduce biofilm production in pathogens without affecting growth of the pathogens (p < 0.05). AgNPs inhibited cell viability and biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Cell membrane damage in microorganisms resulting from effects of AgNPs was observed. A significant increase in per cent uptake of crystal violet was observed in all isolates treated with AgNPs when compared with the control (p < 0.05). Upon treatment with AgNPs, the surface charge of the reference strains and clinical isolates of pathogens moved towards neutral. The alteration of surface potential after exposure to AgNPs could contribute to membrane disruption and cell viability. Scanning electron microscopy further confirmed morphological cell changes and disrupted the cell membrane. Increasing resistance to AgNPs was not induced by stepwise isolation of the bacteria after 45 passages on Luria-Bertani agar supplemented with AgNPs. Furthermore, AgNPs was not toxic to red blood cells.","authors":[{"name":"Supakit Paosen"},{"name":"Sarunporn Jindapol"},{"name":"Rosesathorn Soontarach"},{"name":"Supayang Piyawan Voravuthikunchai"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ESKAPE"},{"word":"Eucalyptus citriodora"},{"word":"antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"hospital-acquired pathogens"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"}]},"article290":{"pmid":"31512521","title":"Biosurfactants of Lactobacillus helveticus for biodiversity inhibit the biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus and cell invasion.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Xinpeng Jiang"},{"name":"Xin Yan"},{"name":"Shanshan Gu"},{"name":"Yan Yang"},{"name":"Lili Zhao"},{"name":"Xinmiao He"},{"name":"Hongyan Chen"},{"name":"Junwei Ge"},{"name":"Di Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Lactobacillus helveticus"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"biosurfactants"},{"word":"host cell"}]},"article291":{"pmid":"31512096","title":"Biological functions of nirS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 under aerobic conditions.","abs":"Through our previous study, we found an up-regulation in the expression of nitrite reductase (nirS) in the isothiazolone-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the definitive molecular role of nirS in ascribing the resistance remained elusive. In the present study, the nirS gene was deleted from the chromosome of P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and the resulting phenotypic changes of ΔnirS were studied alongside the wild-type (WT) strain under aerobic conditions. The results demonstrated a decline in the formations of biofilms but not planktonic growth by ΔnirS as compared to WT, especially in the presence of benzisothiazolinone (BIT). Meanwhile, the deletion of nirS impaired swimming motility of P. aeruginosa under the stress of BIT. To assess the influence of nirS on the transcriptome of P. aeruginosa, RNA-seq experiments comparing the ΔnirS with WT were also performed. A total of 694 genes were found to be differentially expressed in ΔnirS, of which 192 were up-regulated, while 502 were down-regulated. In addition, these differently expressed genes were noted to significantly enrich the carbon metabolism along with glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolisms. Meanwhile, results from RT-PCR suggested the contribution of mexEF-oprN to the development of BIT resistance by ΔnirS. Further, c-di-GMP was less in ΔnirS than in WT, as revealed by HPLC.

Solid boundaries can strongly influence a cell's propulsion mechanism, thus leading many flagellated bacteria to describe long circular trajectories stably entrapped by the surface. Experimental studies on near-surface bacterial motility have, however, neglected the fact that real environments have typical microstructures varying on the scale of the cells' motion. Here, we show that micro-obstacles influence the propagation of peritrichously flagellated bacteria on a flat surface in a non-monotonic way. Instead of hindering it, an optimal, relatively low obstacle density can significantly enhance cells' propagation on surfaces due to individual forward-scattering events. This finding provides insight on the emerging dynamics of chiral active matter in complex environments and inspires possible routes to control microbial ecology in natural habitats.","authors":[{"name":"Stanislaw Makarchuk"},{"name":"Vasco C Braz"},{"name":"Nuno A M Araújo"},{"name":"Lena Ciric"},{"name":"Giorgio Volpe"}],"keywords":[]},"article294":{"pmid":"31511371","title":"Global Transcriptomic Analysis of the Candida albicans Response to Treatment with a Novel Inhibitor of Filamentation.","abs":"The opportunistic pathogenic fungus Candida albicans can cause devastating infections in immunocompromised patients. Its ability to undergo a morphogenetic transition from yeast to filamentous forms allows it to penetrate tissues and damage tissues, and the expression of genes associated with a number of pathogenetic mechanisms is also coordinately regulated with the yeast-to-hypha conversion. Therefore, it is widely considered that filamentation represents one of the main virulence factors of C. albicans We have previously identified N-[3-(allyloxy)-phenyl]-4-methoxybenzamide (compound 9029936) as the lead compound in a series of small-molecule inhibitors of C. albicans filamentation and characterized its activity both in vitro and in vivo This compound appears to be a promising candidate for the development of alternative antivirulence strategies for the treatment of C. albicans infections. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of samples obtained from C. albicans cells grown under filament-inducing conditions in the presence or absence of this compound. Overall, treatment with compound 9029936 resulted in 618 upregulated and 702 downregulated genes. Not surprisingly, some of the most downregulated genes included well-characterized genes associated with filamentation and virulence such as SAP5, ECE1 (candidalysin), and ALS3, as well as genes that impact metal chelation and utilization. Gene ontology analysis revealed an overrepresentation of cell adhesion, iron transport, filamentation, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis processes among the genes downregulated during treatment with this leading compound. Interestingly, the top upregulated genes suggested an enhancement of vesicular transport pathways, particularly those involving SNARE interactions.","authors":[{"name":"Jesus A Romo"},{"name":"Hao Zhang"},{"name":"Hong Cai"},{"name":"David Kadosh"},{"name":"Julia R Koehler"},{"name":"Stephen P Saville"},{"name":"Yufeng Wang"},{"name":"Jose L Lopez-Ribot"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"antivirulence"},{"word":"candidiasis"},{"word":"filamentation"}]},"article296":{"pmid":"31510005","title":"Application of a Phage Cocktail for Control of Salmonella in Foods and Reducing Biofilms.","abs":"Salmonella contamination in foods and their formation of biofilms in food processing facility are the primary bacterial cause of a significant number of foodborne outbreaks and infections.

In this work, swab samples of milking machine biofilms of two dairy farms were investigated by a combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods. Spots in the milking system with enhanced microbial colonization were identified by quantification on selective and non-selective media. In addition, stainless steel coupons were placed into the piping system of a milking machine, removed after several milking intervals, and investigated for colonization by cultivation and culture-independently. Isolates were differentiated and identified by a combination of chemotaxonomical methods and 16S rRNA sequencing. The culture-independent approach involved treatment of the samples with the viability dye propidium monoazide prior to direct DNA-extraction by enzymatic cell lysis and cloning to exclude bias from dead biomass. The milking equipment retainers and the outlet of the milk bulk tank were identified as highly colonized spots on both farms. A high bacterial diversity was detected covering the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Presence of biofilms was demonstrated on several materials including stainless steel and plastic, which are frequently used in milking machines, but also in dairy processing plants. Growth of mainly Gram-positive bacteria with high percentages of the phylum Actinobacteria was detected on the stainless steel coupons after exposition in the milking system for two to three days. Knowledge about the heterogenic microbial load on different parts of the milking machines and the stainless steel coupons will help to identify primary colonizers of the milking system, to assess the risk potential of biofilms for raw milk, to improve sanitation processes and to identify parts of the milking machine, which should be improved by hygienic design.","authors":[{"name":"Mareike Weber"},{"name":"Janine Liedtke"},{"name":"Susanne Plattes"},{"name":"André Lipski"}],"keywords":[]},"article299":{"pmid":"31509195","title":"Study of the activity of Punica granatum-mediated silver nanoparticles against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, alone or in combination with azoles or polyenes.","abs":"The continuous emergence of Candida strains resistant to currently used antifungals demands the development of new alternatives that could reduce the burden of candidiasis.

Antibacterial Activity: Three specimens of each material were prepared and placed on bacterial suspensions of Streptococcus mutans for 1, 5 and 10 days. After these periods the counting of the colonies (log10) was performed. Assays was performed in triplicate. Physical Properties: Three-body Abrasion (TBA): Ten specimens of each material were prepared and stored at 37°C/24 h. The surface roughness (Ra) and hardness (KHN) were analyzed. Next, the specimens were submitted to abrasive wear (30,000 cycles) and re-evaluated for Ra and KHN; Sorption/solubility (SS): cylindrical specimens (n=10) were prepared and weighted. The specimens were immersed in deionized water for 7 days at 37°C and then their weight was verified again. SS were calculated using accepted formulas; Diametral tensile strength (DTS): specimens (n=10) underwent test performed in an Instron universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min.

Cathelicidins are AMPs that preferentially kill Gram-negative bacteria in vitro, purportedly by assembling into higher-order structures that perforate the membrane. We utilized high-resolution, single-cell fluorescence microscopy to examine their mechanism of action in real time. Engineered cathelicidins rapidly bound to Gram-negative and Gram-positive cells and penetrated the cytoplasmic membrane. Rapid failure of the peptidoglycan superstructure in regions of active turnover caused leakage of cytoplasmic contents and the formation of membrane-bound blebs. A mutation anticipated to destabilize interactions between cathelicidin subunits had no effect on bactericidal activity, suggesting that cathelicidins have activities beyond perforating the membrane. Nanomolar concentrations of cathelicidins, although not bactericidal, reduced the growth rate of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The cells exhibited expression changes in multiple essential processes, including protein synthesis, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, respiration, and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Time-lapse imaging revealed that ROS accumulation preceded bleb formation, and treatments that reduced cellular ROS levels overcame these bactericidal effects. We propose that that the primary effect of cathelicidins is to induce the production of ROS that damage bacterial molecules, leading to slowed growth or cell death. Given their low circulating levels in vivo, AMPs may serve to slow bacterial population expansion so that cellular immunity systems can respond to and battle the infection.","authors":[{"name":"Dean A Rowe-Magnus"},{"name":"Adenine Y Kao"},{"name":"Antonio Cembellin Prieto"},{"name":"Meng Pu"},{"name":"Cheng Kao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Gram-negative bacteria"},{"word":"ROS"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cathelicidins"},{"word":"single-cell"}]},"article318":{"pmid":"31506311","title":"Emergent Properties in Streptococcus mutans Biofilms Are Controlled through Adhesion Force Sensing by Initial Colonizers.","abs":"Bacterial adhesion is accompanied by altered gene expression, leading to emergent properties of biofilm bacteria that are alien to planktonic ones. With the aim of revealing the role of environmental adhesion forces in emergent biofilm properties, genes in Streptococcus mutans UA159 and a quorum-sensing-deficient mutant were identified that become expressed after adhesion to substratum surfaces. Using atomic force microscopy, adhesion forces of initial S. mutans colonizers on four different substrata were determined and related to gene expression. Adhesion forces upon initial contact were similarly low across different substrata, ranging between 0.2 and 1.2 nN regardless of the strain considered. Bond maturation required up to 21 s, depending on the strain and substratum surface involved, but stationary adhesion forces also were similar in the parent and in the mutant strain. However, stationary adhesion forces were largest on hydrophobic silicone rubber (19 to 20 nN), while being smallest on hydrophilic glass (3 to 4 nN). brpA gene expression in thin (34 to 48 μm) 5-h S. mutans UA159 biofilms was most sensitive to adhesion forces, while expression of gbpB and comDE expressions was weakly sensitive. ftf, gtfB, vicR, and relA expression was insensitive to adhesion forces. In thicker (98 to 151 μm) 24-h biofilms, adhesion-force-induced gene expression and emergent extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production were limited to the first 20 to 30 μm above a substratum surface. In the quorum-sensing-deficient S. mutans, adhesion-force-controlled gene expression was absent in both 5- and 24-h biofilms.

Micafungin used alone was not able to totally eradicate fungi. Micafungin combined with EB487 displayed synergistic activity (both anti-growth- and anti-preformed biofilm-activities). Optimal combination concentrations were EB487 (≤9.12 mM -strain ATCC 28367™ or ≤8.12 mM -strain CAI4-p), micafungin (≤0.05 μM for both) and caused a total eradication of fungi.

The underlying basis for increased persisters in M. tuberculosis biofilms is unknown. Using a transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) approach, we show here that multiple genes that are necessary for fitness of M. tuberculosis cells within biofilms, but not in planktonic cultures, are also implicated in tolerance of bacilli to a diverse set of stressors and antibiotics. Thus, development of M. tuberculosis biofilms appears to be associated with an enrichment of population, in which challenging growth conditions within biofilm architecture select for cells that maintain intrinsic tolerance to exogenous stresses, including antibiotic exposure. We further observed that the intrinsic drug tolerance of constituent cells of a biofilm determines the frequency of persisters. These findings together allow us to propose that the selection of elite cells during biofilm development promotes the frequency of persisters. Furthermore, probing the possibility that the population enrichment is an outcome of unique environment within biofilms, we demonstrate biofilm-specific induction in the synthesis of isonitrile lipopeptide (INLP). Mutation analysis indicates that INLP is necessary for the architecture development of M. tuberculosis biofilms. In summary, this study offers an insight into persistence of M. tuberculosis biofilms under antibiotic exposure, while identifying INLP as a potential biomarker for further investigation of this phenomenon.","authors":[{"name":"Jacob P Richards"},{"name":"Wenlong Cai"},{"name":"Nicholas A Zill"},{"name":"Wenjun Zhang"},{"name":"Anil K Ojha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"tuberculosis"}]},"article333":{"pmid":"31500904","title":"Has zirconia made a material difference in implant prosthodontics?

Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that mycoplasmas employ some mechanisms to deal with coercion of host defense system. In this review, we will highlight and provide a comprehensive overview of immune evasion strategies that have emerged in mycoplasma infection, which can be divided into four aspects: (i) Molecular mimicry and antigenic variation on the surface of the bacteria to evade the immune surveillance; (ii) Overcoming the immune effector molecules assaults: Induction of detoxified enzymes to degradation of reactive oxygen species; Expression of nucleases to degrade the neutrophil extracellular traps to avoid killing by Neutrophil; Capture and cleavage of immunoglobulins to evade humoral immune response; (iii) Persistent survival: Invading into the host cell to escape the immune damage; Formation of a biofilm to establish a persistent infection; (iv) Modulation of the immune system to down-regulate the intensity of immune response. All of these features increase the probability of mycoplasma survival in the host and lead to a persistent, chronic infections.

To enhance power output, functional group modification on anode surfaces has been primarily developed to improve the bioelectrochemical performances of BESs in terms of startup, power density, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and coulombic efficiency (CE). This modification could change the anode surface characteristics: roughness, hydrophobicity, biocompatibility, chemical bonding and electrochemically active surface area. This will facilitate bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation and extracellular electron transfer (EET). Additionally, some antibacterial functional groups are applied on air cathodes in order to suppress aerobic biofilms and enhance cathodic oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). Various modification strategies such as: soaking, heat treatment and plasma modification have been reported to introduce functional groups typically as O-, N- and S-containing groups. In this review, the effects of anode functional groups on electroactive bacteria through the whole biofilm formation process are summarized. In addition, the application of those modification technologies to improve bioelectricity generation, resource recovery, bioelectrochemical analysis and the production of value-added chemicals and biofuels is also discussed. Accordingly, this review aims to help scientists select the most appropriate functional groups and up-to-date methods to improve biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Chaochao Li"},{"name":"Shaoan Cheng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Functional group"},{"word":"bioelectrochemical systems"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"biofuels"},{"word":"electricity generation"},{"word":"electron transfer"},{"word":"energy"},{"word":"surface modification"}]},"article353":{"pmid":"31495663","title":"Nucleases of bacterial pathogens as virulence factors, therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers.","abs":"New frontiers of therapy are being explored against the upcoming bacterial diseases rendered untreatable due to multiple, extreme and pan- antibiotic resistance. Nucleases are ubiquitous in bacterial pathogens performing various functions like acquiring nucleotide nutrients, allowing or preventing uptake of foreign DNA, controlling biofilm formation/dispersal/architecture, invading host by tissue damage, evading immune defence by degrading DNA matrix of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and immunomodulating the host immune response. Secretory nucleases also provide means of survival to other bacteria like iron-reducing Shewanella and such functions help them adapt and survive proficiently. Other than their pro-pathogen roles in survival, nucleases can be used directly as therapeutics. One of the powerful armours of pathogens is the formation of biofilms, thus helping them resist and persist in the harshest of environments. As eDNA forms the structural and binding component of biofilm, nucleases can be used against the adhering component, thus increasing the permeability of antimicrobial agents. Nucleases have recently become a model system of intense study for their biological functions and medical applications in diagnosis, immunoprophylaxis and therapy. Rational implications of these enzymes can impact human medicine positively in future by opening new ways for therapeutics which have otherwise reached saturation due to multi drug resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Prince Sharma"},{"name":"Nisha Garg"},{"name":"Anshul Sharma"},{"name":"Neena Capalash"},{"name":"Ravinder Singh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial nucleases"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Diagnosis"},{"word":"Drug target"},{"word":"Vaccine"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article354":{"pmid":"31495312","title":"Identification of proteins in the adhesive trails of the diatom Amphora coffeaeformis.","abs":"Throughout all kingdoms of life, a large number of adhesive biomolecules have evolved to allow organisms to adhere to surfaces underwater.

In this direction, bacteriophages, commonly called phages, are recently being considered as potential alternatives for treatment of UPECs.

This review discusses the possible ways of using natural phages, genetically engineered phages, and phage lytic enzymes (PLEs) as an alternative antimicrobial treatment for urinary tract infections. The review also sheds light on the synergistic use of conventional antibiotics with phages or PLEs for treatment of uropathogens. These methods of using phages and their derivatives, alone or in combination with antibiotics, have proved fruitful so far in in vitro studies.

Liposomal encapsulation could help overcome these limitations and would make hypericin available for daily clinical practice. The use of liposomes as carriers for hypericin in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is quite new. The aim of this work was to improve the photodynamic efficiency of the previously mentioned carriers by entrapping hypericin in the aqueous compartment of the liposomes. Therefore, a water-soluble inclusion complex of hypericin and (2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (Hyp-HPβCD) was prepared. After encapsulation of the inclusion complex into DSPC and DSPC/DPPC/DSPE-PEG liposomes with the dehydration-rehydration vesicle (DRV) method, the formulations were physicochemical characterised. The photodynamic efficiency towards the gram-positive model strain Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. bovis. was tested on planktonic cells as well as on biofilms. DSPC liposomes achieved a 4.1log reduction and the DSPC/DPPC/DSPE-PEG liposomes a 2.6log reduction in growth of planktonic bacteria, while Hyp-HPβCD showed total eradication.

In this study, we further explored the effect and mechanism of QS on conjugation transfer.

We selected several quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) to study their effects on AHL-producing bacteria, including the formation of biofilm and the regulating effect on conjugation transfer. In addition, the possible molecular mechanisms for AHLs that promote conjugative transfer were attributable to enhancing the mRNA expression, which involved altered expressions of conjugation-related genes. We also found that QSIs could inhibit conjugative transfer by downregulating the conjugation-relevant genes. We believe that this is the first insightful exploration of the mechanism by which AHLs will facilitate and QSIs will inhibit the conjugative transfer of ARGs.

The phenotypic transition from a planktonic to biofilm state is regulated by the activity of the transcriptional repressor, SinR, and its inactivation by its primary antagonist, SinI. In this work, we present the first full-length structural model of tetrameric SinR using a hybrid approach combining high-resolution solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and molecular docking. We also present the solution NMR structure of the antagonist SinI dimer and probe the mechanism behind the SinR-SinI interaction using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques. As a result of these findings, we propose that SinI utilizes a residue replacement mechanism to block SinR multimerization, resulting in diminished DNA binding and concomitant decreased repressor activity.

Microbial communication signals are involved both in interactions among microbial cells within microbial social systems, including the human body-inhabiting microconsortium, and the dialog between the microbiota and the host organism. The microbiota inhabits various niches of the host organism, especially the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Microorganisms release diverse signal molecules and, in addition, specifically respond to host signals. This enables them to constantly interact with the nervous system including the brain and the immune system of the host organism. Evolutionarily conserved signals that are involved in the communication between microbiota and the host include neuroactive substances (neurochemicals) such as peptides, amino acids, biogenic amines, short-chain fatty acids, and gaseous substances. This ongoing dialog may either stabilize the host's physical and mental health state or, alternatively, cause serious health problems. Attempts are made to correct imbalances in the brain-gut-microbiota axis with probiotics including their subgroup called psychobiotics that release neuroactive substances directly influencing the human brain, psyche, and behavior. A number of recent review works address the microbiota-host system and its communication signals. Some of the publications focus on the involvement of neurochemicals in the bidirectional communication within the host-microbiota system. However, this work concentrates on the impact of bacterial cell components, metabolites, and signal molecules as promising alternatives to the currently widespread probiotics that have both advantages and disadvantages.

In support of the reproducibility assessment, a six-laboratory study was performed using three antimicrobials: a sodium hypochlorite, a phenolic and a quaternary/alcohol blend, each tested at low and high efficacy levels. The mean log reduction in viable bacteria in this study ranged from 2.32 to 4.58 and the associated reproducibility standard deviations ranged from 0.89 to 1.67. Independent follow-up testing showed that the method was rugged with respect to deviations in sonication duration and sonication power but slightly sensitive to sonicator reservoir degassing and tube location within the sonicator bath. It was also demonstrated that when a coupon was dropped into a test tube, bacteria can splash out of reach of the applied antimicrobials, resulting in substantial bias when estimating log reductions for the products tested. Bias can also result when testing products that hinder the harvesting of microbes from test surfaces. The culmination of this work provided recommended changes to the early version of the standard method E2871-13 (ASTM, 2013b) including use of splashguards and microscopy checks. These changes have been incorporated into a revised ASTM method E2871-19 (ASTM 2019) that is the basis for the first regulatory method (ATMP-MB-20) to substantiate kills biofilm claims for antimicrobials registered and sold in the US.","authors":[{"name":"Darla M Goeres"},{"name":"Diane K Walker"},{"name":"Kelli Buckingham-Meyer"},{"name":"Lindsey Lorenz"},{"name":"Jennifer Summers"},{"name":"Blaine Fritz"},{"name":"Danielle Goveia"},{"name":"Grace Dickerman"},{"name":"Johanna Schultz"},{"name":"Albert E Parker"}],"keywords":[]},"article376":{"pmid":"31490973","title":"Methyl gallate and tylosin synergistically reduce the membrane integrity and intracellular survival of Salmonella Typhimurium.","abs":"Nymphaea tetragona Georgi (Nymphaceae) is traditionally used in Asia for the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery and fever.

This study aimed to evaluate the alterations on viability, membrane potential and integrity of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium exposed to MG in combination with Tylosin (Ty), which is relatively inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, but it is commonly used as a feed additive in livestock. Besides, the effects of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the combination (MT) on the interaction between S. Typhimurium and the host cell, as well as on the indirect host responses, were characterized. Flow cytometry, confocal and electron microscopic examinations were undertaken to determine the effects of MT on S. Typhimurium. The impacts of sub-inhibitory concentrations of MT on biofilm formation, as well as on the adhesion, invasion and intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium were assessed. The result demonstrated significant damage to the bacterial membrane, leakage of cell contents and a reduction in the membrane potential when treated with MT. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of MT significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the biofilm-forming, adhesive and invasive abilities of S. Typhimurium. Exposure to MT drastically reduced the bacterial count in macrophages. Up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10 cytokine genes were detected in intestinal epithelial cells pre-treated with MT. This report is the first to describe the effects of MT against S. Typhimurium. The result indicates a synergistic interaction between MG and Ty against S. Typhimurium. Therefore, the combination may be a promising option to combat S.

Herein, pH-switchable antimicrobial hydrogel with nanofiber networks for biofilm eradication and rescuing stalled healing in chronic wounds is reported on the basis of the self-assembly of a designed octapeptide (IKFQFHFD) at neutral pH. This hydrogel is biocompatible and exhibits an acidic pH (pathological environment of infected chronic wounds)-switchable broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect via a mechanism involving cell wall and membrane disruption. The antimicrobial activity of hydrogel is derived from its acidic pH-dependent nanofiber network destabilization and activated release of IKFQFHFD, which is antimicrobial only at acidic pH due to the antimicrobial peptide-like molecular structure. In addition, supramolecular nanofiber networks loaded with drugs of cypate (photothermal agent) and proline (procollagen component) are further developed. In vitro experiments show that loaded drugs exhibit acidic pH (pH ∼ 5.5)-responsive release profiles, and synergistic biofilm eradication and subsequent healing cascade activation of cells proliferation are achieved on the basis of the supramolecular nanofiber networks. Remarkably, the nanofiber networks of hydrogel enable in vivo complete healing of MRSA biofilm infected wound in diabetic mice within 20 days, showing great potential as promising chronic wound dressings. The proposed synergistic strategy for eradicating biofilm and activating subsequent healing cascades may offer a powerful modality for the management of clinical chronic wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Jianhao Wang"},{"name":"Xiao-Yi Chen"},{"name":"Yuan Zhao"},{"name":"Yanmei Yang"},{"name":"Weijie Wang"},{"name":"Chun Wu"},{"name":"Baozhu Yang"},{"name":"Zhaotian Zhang"},{"name":"Leshuai Zhang"},{"name":"Yun Liu"},{"name":"Xuancheng Du"},{"name":"Weifeng Li"},{"name":"Lin Qiu"},{"name":"Pengju Jiang"},{"name":"Xiao-Zhou Mou"},{"name":"Yong-Qiang Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial hydrogel"},{"word":"biofilm eradication"},{"word":"chronic wound healing"},{"word":"nanofiber network"},{"word":"pH-switchable drug release"}]},"article379":{"pmid":"31490060","title":"Controlling Heterogeneity and Increasing Titer from Riboswitch-Regulated Bacillus subtilis Spores for Time-Delayed Protein Expression Applications.","abs":"Sporulated cells have potential as time-delayed expression chassis of proteins for applications such as on-demand biologics production, whole cell biosensors, or oral vaccines.

Many aquifers contain naturally high levels of iron and some are shallow with surface water intrusion in the wet season. Therefore, environmental bacteria such as iron-cycling bacteria promoting biofilm formation in pipes or opportunistic pathogens can occur in these waters. An opportunistic pathogen endemic to northern Australia and Southeast Asia and emerging worldwide is Burkholderia pseudomallei. It causes the frequently fatal disease melioidosis in humans and animals. As we know very little about the microbial composition of drinking water in remote communities, this study aimed to provide a first snapshot of the microbiota and occurrence of opportunistic pathogens in bulk water and biofilms from the source and through the distribution system of three remote water supplies with varying iron levels. Using 16s-rRNA gene sequencing, we found that the geochemistry of the groundwater had a substantial impact on the untreated microbiota. Different iron-cycling bacteria reflected differences in redox status and nutrients. We cultured and sequenced B. pseudomallei from bores with elevated iron and from a multi-species biofilm which also contained iron-oxidizing Gallionella, nitrifying Nitrospira and amoebae. Gallionella are increasingly used in iron-removal filters in water supplies and more research is needed to examine these interactions. Similar to other opportunistic pathogens, B. pseudomallei occurred in water with low organic carbon levels and with low heterotrophic microbial growth. No B. pseudomallei were detected in treated water; however, abundant DNA of another opportunistic pathogen group, non-tuberculous mycobacteria was recovered from treated parts of one supply.

Under neutral physiological conditions, the bactericidal activity of rAgNAs is self-quenched because the toxic silver ions' release is largely inhibited; however, upon entry into the acidic biofilm microenvironment, the rAgNAs not only exhibit charge reversal to facilitate local accumulation and retention but also disassemble into small silver nanoclusters, thus enabling deep penetration and accelerated silver ions release for dramatically amplified bactericidal activity. The superior antibiofilm activity of rAgNAs is demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, and the mortality rate of mice with multi-drug-resistant biofilm-induced severe pyomyositis can be significantly reduced by rAgNAs treatment, indicating the immense potential of rAgNAs as highly efficient nanoscale antibacterial agents to combat resistant bacterial biofilm-associated infections.","authors":[{"name":"Jiahe Wu"},{"name":"Fangyuan Li"},{"name":"Xi Hu"},{"name":"Jingxiong Lu"},{"name":"Xiaolian Sun"},{"name":"Jianqing Gao"},{"name":"Daishun Ling"}],"keywords":[]},"article411":{"pmid":"31482007","title":"Biofilm formation inhibition and dispersal of multi-species communities containing ammonia-oxidising bacteria.","abs":"Despite considerable research, the biofilm-forming capabilities of Nitrosomonas europaea are poorly understood for both mono and mixed-species communities. This study combined biofilm assays and molecular techniques to demonstrate that N. europaea makes very little biofilm on its own, and relies on the activity of associated heterotrophic bacteria to establish a biofilm. However, N. europaea has a vital role in the proliferation of mixed-species communities under carbon-limited conditions, such as in drinking water distribution systems, through the provision of organic carbon via ammonia oxidation. Results show that the addition of nitrification inhibitors to mixed-species nitrifying cultures under carbon-limited conditions disrupted biofilm formation and caused the dispersal of pre-formed biofilms. This dispersal effect was not observed when an organic carbon source, glucose, was included in the medium. Interestingly, inhibition of nitrification activity of these mixed-species biofilms in the presence of added glucose resulted in increased total biofilm formation compared to controls without the addition of nitrification inhibitors, or with only glucose added. This suggests that active AOB partially suppress or limit the overall growth of the heterotrophic bacteria. The experimental model developed here provides evidence that ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) are involved in both the formation and maintenance of multi-species biofilm communities.

Dysbiosis of the oral biofilm and a dysfunctional immune response drive chronic inflammation, causing destruction of soft tissue and alveolar bone supporting the teeth. Treponema denticola, a spirochete abundant in the plaque biofilm of patients with severe periodontal disease, perturbs neutrophil function by modulating appropriate phosphoinositide (PIP) signaling. Through a series of immunoblotting and quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments, we show that Msp does not alter the gene transcription or protein content of key enzymes responsible for PIP3 signaling: 3' phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), or 5' Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP1). Instead, using immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we found that Msp activates PTEN through dephosphorylation specifically at the S380 site. Msp in intact organisms or outer membrane vesicles also restricts PIP signaling. SHIP1 phosphatase release was assessed using chemical inhibition and immunoprecipitation to show that Msp moderately decreases SHIP1 activity. Msp also prevents secondary activation of the PTEN/PI3K response. We speculate that this result is due to the redirection of the PIP3 substrate away from SHIP1 to PTEN. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a redistribution of PTEN from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane following exposure to Msp, which may contribute to PTEN activation. Mechanisms of how T. denticola modulates and evades the host immune response are still poorly described, and here we provide further mechanistic evidence of how spirochetes modify PIP signaling to dampen neutrophil function.

Eluates from the mannitol pastes with and without antibiotics decreased viability of established S. aureus biofilm by up to 95.5% compared to blends without mannitol, which only decreased biofilm when loaded with antibiotics. Cytocompatibility tests indicated no adverse effects on viability of fibroblasts. In vivo evaluation of inflammatory response revealed mannitol blends scored within the 2-4 range at Week 1 (2.6 ± 1.1) and at Week 4 (3.0 ± 0.8), indicative of moderate inflammation and comparable to non-mannitol pastes (p = 0.065). Clinically, this paste could be loaded with clinician-selected antibiotics and used as an adjunctive therapy for musculoskeletal infection prevention and treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Leslie R Pace"},{"name":"Zoe L Harrison"},{"name":"Madison N Brown"},{"name":"Warren O Haggard"},{"name":"J Amber Jennings"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biomaterial"},{"word":"chitosan"},{"word":"implant"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"local drug delivery"},{"word":"mannitol"},{"word":"persister"}]},"article421":{"pmid":"31480654","title":"Antimicrobial Activity of Protamine-Loaded Calcium Phosphates against Oral Bacteria.","abs":"Protamine is an antimicrobial peptide extracted from fish. In this study, we loaded protamine onto dicalcium phosphate anhydride (DCPA), a dental material. Protamine was loaded by stirring DCPA into a protamine solution. To explore the antimicrobial activity of the materials, we cultivated Streptococcus mutans on fabricated discs for 24 h. When S. mutans was cultivated on the discs under no sucrose conditions, the loaded protamine was not released, and the ratio of dead bacteria increased on the surface of P (125) DCPA (half of the saturated level of protamine (125 ppm protamine) was loaded). Aside from P (500) DCPA (saturated level of protamine was loaded), some protamine was released, and the number of planktonic bacteria in the supernatant decreased. Using medium containing 1% sucrose, the release of protamine was promoted from P (125) DCPA due to lowered pH. However, lowering of the pH decreased the antimicrobial activity of protamine. On the other hand, P (500) DCPA released protamine before the pH was lowered, and biofilm formation was inhibited. The loaded protamine expressed antimicrobial activity, both on the surface of the materials and in the surrounding environment. The interaction of loaded protamine with calcium phosphates could promote the application of protamine in the dental field.","authors":[{"name":"Masashi Fujiki"},{"name":"Kodai Abe"},{"name":"Tohru Hayakawa"},{"name":"Takatsugu Yamamoto"},{"name":"Mana Torii"},{"name":"Keishi Iohara"},{"name":"Daisuke Koizumi"},{"name":"Rie Togawa"},{"name":"Mamoru Aizawa"},{"name":"Michiyo Honda"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"dental material"},{"word":"dicalcium phosphate anhydride"},{"word":"protamine"}]},"article422":{"pmid":"31480507","title":"Antibiotic Resistant Pseudomonas Spp. Spoilers in Fresh Dairy Products: An Underestimated Risk and the Control Strategies.","abs":"Microbial multidrug resistance (MDR) is a growing threat to public health mostly because it makes the fight against microorganisms that cause lethal infections ever less effective. Thus, the surveillance on MDR microorganisms has recently been strengthened, taking into account the control of antibiotic abuse as well as the mechanisms underlying the transfer of antibiotic genes (ARGs) among microbiota naturally occurring in the environment. Indeed, ARGs are not only confined to pathogenic bacteria, whose diffusion in the clinical field has aroused serious concerns, but are widespread in saprophytic bacterial communities such as those dominating the food industry. In particular, fresh dairy products can be considered a reservoir of Pseudomonas spp. resistome, potentially transmittable to consumers. Milk and fresh dairy cheeses products represent one of a few hubs where commensal or opportunistic pseudomonads frequently cohabit together with food microbiota and hazard pathogens even across their manufacturing processes. Pseudomonas spp., widely studied for food spoilage effects, are instead underestimated for their possible impact on human health. Recent evidences have highlighted that non-pathogenic pseudomonads strains (P. fluorescens, P. putida) are associated with some human diseases, but are still poorly considered in comparison to the pathogen P. aeruginosa. In addition, the presence of ARGs, that can be acquired and transmitted by horizontal genetic transfer, further increases their risk and the need to be deeper investigated. Therefore, this review, starting from the general aspects related to the physiological traits of these spoilage microorganisms from fresh dairy products, aims to shed light on the resistome of cheese-related pseudomonads and their genomic background, current methods and advances in the prediction tools for MDR detection based on genomic sequences, possible implications for human health, and the affordable strategies to counteract MDR spread.","authors":[{"name":"Laura Quintieri"},{"name":"Francesca Fanelli"},{"name":"Leonardo Caputo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"control strategies"},{"word":"dairy products"},{"word":"genomics"},{"word":"pseudomonads"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"spoilage"}]},"article423":{"pmid":"31480443","title":"Suppressive Effects of Octyl Gallate on Streptococcus mutans Biofilm Formation, Acidogenicity, and Gene Expression.","abs":"The accumulation of biofilm by Streptococcus mutans bacteria on hard tooth tissues leads to dental caries, which remains one of the most prevalent oral diseases.

Our results showed that extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production was significantly enhanced and micro-meter sized cell aggregates formed with high glucose amendment. Biofilm development exhibited significant effects on the soil microbial processes. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated the soils with biofilms and free-living cells shared similar microbial communities. But the Shannon diversity and evenness indices of communities with soil biofilms were significantly enhanced by 18.2% and 17.1%. The soil with biofilms also revealed a rapid response to nutrient provision and robust microbial activity, which consumed 65.4% more oxygen in the topsoil (0-1.5 mm). Kinetic respiration analysis showed that the enhanced metabolic activity was attributed to 23-times more active microbes in soil biofilms.

Particularly, they may attract or repulse the settling down of opportunistic algae. However, this phenomenon and the interaction mechanism are not fully understood. This study investigated reefs from the Changdao coastal zone to determine the structures and functions of bacterial biofilms symbiosing with various algae using high-throughput sequencing analysis. The Shannon diversity index of microbiota with algal symbiosis reached 5.34, which was higher than that of microbiota wherein algae were absent (4.80). The beta diversity results for 11 samples revealed that there existed a separation between bacterial communities on reefs with and without attached algae, while communities with similar algae clustered together. The taxa mostly associated with algae-symbiotic microbiota are the Actinobacteria phylum, and the Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria classes. The Cyanobacteria phylum was not associated with algae-symbiotic microbiota. As revealed by functional analysis, the bacteria mostly involved in the metabolism of sulfur were represented by brown and red algae in the biofilm symbiosis. Bacteria related to the metabolism of certain trace elements were observed only in specific groups. Moreover, phototrophy-related bacteria were less abundant in samples coexisting with algae. This study established the link between bacterial biofilms and algal settlements on costal reefs, and revealed the possible holobiont relationship between them. This may provide new technical directions toward realizing algal cultivation and management during the construction of artificial reef ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Jialin Li"},{"name":"Ting Wang"},{"name":"Shuxian Yu"},{"name":"Jie Bai"},{"name":"Song Qin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algal-bacterial symbiosis"},{"word":"Biochemical cycling"},{"word":"Coastal reef community"},{"word":"Metagenomic analysis"},{"word":"Reciprocal interaction"}]},"article426":{"pmid":"31479812","title":"Surface coatings select their micro and macrofouling communities differently on steel.","abs":"Previous studies have shown the effect of surface coatings on biofouling; however, they did not take into account the interaction of the micro and macrofouling communities, the effect of substrate orientation and the zooplankton-zoobenthic coupling together.

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and single-particle tracking of nanobeads and bacteriophages indicated notable subdiffusive dynamics dependent on probe size and stewartan concentration, in contrast to free diffusion of small molecules. Stewartan enzymatic depolymerization by bacteriophage tailspike proteins rapidly restored unhindered diffusion. We, thus, hypothesize that the glycan polymer stewartan determines the major physicochemical properties of the biofilm, which acts as a selective diffusion barrier for nanometer-sized objects and can be controlled by enzymes.","authors":[{"name":"Valentin Dunsing"},{"name":"Tobias Irmscher"},{"name":"Stefanie Barbirz"},{"name":"Salvatore Chiantia"}],"keywords":[]},"article429":{"pmid":"31478395","title":"Does antimicrobial coating and impregnation of urinary catheters prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection?
