Infections by Trichosporon spp. are generally associated with biofilm formation in invasive medical devices. These communities are resistant to therapeutic antifungals, and therefore the search for anti-biofilm molecules is necessary. This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of farnesol against planktonic and sessile cells of clinical Trichosporon asahii (n = 3) andTrichosporon inkin (n = 7) strains. Biofilms were evaluated during adhesion, development stages and after maturation for metabolic activity, biomass and protease activity, as well as regarding morphology and ultrastructure by optical microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Farnesol inhibited Trichosporon planktonic growth by 80% at concentrations ranging from 600 to 1200 μM for T. asahii and from 75 to 600 μM for T. inkin. Farnesol was able to reduce cell adhesion by 80% at 300 μM for T. asahii and T. inkin at 600 μM, while biofilm development of both species was inhibited by 80% at concentration of 150 μM, altering their structure. After biofilm maturation, farnesol decreased T. asahii biofilm formation by 50% at 600 μM concentration and T. inkin formation at 300 μM. Farnesol inhibited gradual filamentation in a concentration range between 600 and 1200 μM. Farnesol caused reduction of filament structures of Trichosporon spp. at every stage of biofilm development analyzed. These data show the potential of farnesol as an anti-biofilm molecule.","authors":[{"name":"Rossana de Aguiar Cordeiro"},{"name":"Lívia Maria Galdino Pereira"},{"name":"José Kleybson de Sousa"},{"name":"Rosana Serpa"},{"name":"Ana Raquel Colares Andrade"},{"name":"Fernando Victor Monteiro Portela"},{"name":"Antônio José de Jesus Evangelista"},{"name":"Jamille Alencar Sales"},{"name":"Ana Luiza Ribeiro Aguiar"},{"name":"Patrícia Bruna Leite Mendes"},{"name":"Raimunda Sâmia Nogueira Brilhante"},{"name":"José Júlio da Costa Sidrim"},{"name":"Débora de Souza Collares Maia Castelo-Branco"},{"name":"Marcos Fabio Gadelha Rocha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Trichosporon        "},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"farnesol"},{"word":"filamentation"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"30649293","title":"The small GTPase Rhb1 is involved in the cell response to fluconazole in Candida albicans.","abs":"Candida albicans is an important fungal pathogen in humans. Rhb1 is a small GTPase of the Ras superfamily and is conserved from yeasts to humans. In C. albicans, Rhb1 regulates the expression of secreted protease 2, low nitrogen-mediated morphogenesis, and biofilm formation. Moreover, our previous studies have indicated that Rhb1 is associated with the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway. In this study, we further explored the relationship between Rhb1 and drug susceptibility. The RHB1 deletion mutant exhibited reduced fluconazole susceptibility, and this phenotype occurred mainly through the increased gene expression and activity of efflux pumps. In addition, Mrr1 and Tac1 are transcription factors that can activate efflux pump gene expression. However, the RHB1 deletion, RHB1/MRR1 and RHB1/TAC1 double deletion mutants had no significant differences in efflux pump gene expression and fluconazole susceptibility, suggesting that Rhb1-regulated efflux pump genes do not act through Mrr1 and Tac1. We also showed that membrane localization is crucial for Rhb1 activity in response to fluconazole. Finally, Rhb1 was linked not only to the TOR but also to the Mkc1 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in response to fluconazole. In sum, this study unveiled a new role of Rhb1 in the regulation of C. albicans drug susceptibility.","authors":[{"name":"Yu-Wen Chen"},{"name":"Ying-Chieh Yeh"},{"name":"Hsueh-Fen Chen"},{"name":"Ruei-Ching Chen"},{"name":"Guan-Yu Lin"},{"name":"Yu-Ting Chen"},{"name":"Chung-Yu Lan"}],"keywords":[]},"article2":{"pmid":"30649289","title":"Innate immune components affect growth and virulence traits of bacterial-vaginosis-associated and non-bacterial-vaginosis-associated Gardnerella vaginalis strains similarly.","abs":"Mucosal surfaces of the female reproductive tract contain a variety of antimicrobial components that provide the first line of defense against bacteria involved in the development of bacterial vaginosis (BV).

SLIPS consist of a porous substrate which is infused with a lubricant immiscible with the aqueous medium in which the bacteria are suspended. Because of the lubricant, bacteria cannot attach to the substrate surface and thus formation of the biofilm is prevented. For this purpose, we manufactured substrates with different porosity and surface roughness values via UV-initiated free-radical polymerization in Fluoropor. Fluoropor is a class of highly fluorinated bulk-porous polymers with tunable porosity, which we recently introduced. We investigated the growth of the biofilm on the substrates, showing that a reduced surface roughness is beneficial for the reduction of biofilm growth. Samples of low roughness effectively reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm growth for 7 days in a flow chamber experiment.

Associated pathways from the citric acid cycle like aromatic amino acid and siderophore biosynthesis were also negatively influenced. The nucleoside salvage pathways were featured by an accumulation of nucleosides and nucleobases, and a downregulation of nucleotides.

MICs, minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs), and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined before and after long-term exposure to triclosan, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and silver nitrate. Biofilm formation was quantified using a crystal violet assay, and relative pathogenicity was assessed via a Galleria mellonella waxworm model. Cytotoxicity and the resulting biocompatibility index values were determined by use of an L929 murine fibroblast cell line. Biocide exposure resulted in multiple decreases in biocide susceptibility in planktonic and biofilm-associated UPEC. Triclosan exposure induced the largest frequency and magnitude of susceptibility decreases at the MIC, MBC, and MBEC, which correlated with an increase in biofilm biomass in all isolates. Induction of antibiotic cross-resistance occurred in 6/84 possible combinations of bacteria, biocide, and antibiotic. Relative pathogenicity significantly decreased after triclosan exposure (5/8 isolates), increased after silver nitrate exposure (2/8 isolates), and varied between isolates for PHMB and BAC. The biocompatibility index ranked the antiseptic potential as PHMB > triclosan > BAC > silver nitrate. Biocide exposure in UPEC may lead to reductions in biocide and antibiotic susceptibility, changes in biofilm formation, and alterations in relative pathogenicity.

Colonization of the oral cavity by the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key event in the initiation and development of periodontal disease. Adhesive surface structures termed fimbriae (pili) mediate interactions of P. gingivalis with other bacteria and with host cells throughout the course of disease. The P. gingivalis fimbriae are assembled via a novel mechanism that involves proteolytic processing of lipidated precursor subunits and their subsequent polymerization on the bacterial surface. Given their extracellular assembly mechanism and central roles in pathogenesis, the P. gingivalis fimbriae are attractive targets for anti-infective therapeutics to prevent or treat periodontal disease. Here we confirm that conserved sequences in the N and C termini of the Mfa1 fimbrial subunit protein perform critical roles in subunit polymerization. We show that treatment of P. gingivalis with peptides corresponding to the conserved C-terminal region inhibits the extracellular assembly of Mfa fimbriae on the bacterial surface. We also show that peptide treatment interferes with the function of Mfa fimbriae by reducing P. gingivalis adhesion to Streptococcus gordonii in a dual-species biofilm model. Finally, we show that treatment of bacteria with similar peptides inhibits extracellular polymerization of the Fim fimbriae, which are also expressed by P. gingivalis These results support a donor strand-based assembly mechanism for the P. gingivalis fimbriae and demonstrate the feasibility of using extracellular peptides to disrupt the biogenesis and function of these critical periodontal disease virulence factors.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah R Alaei"},{"name":"Jin Ho Park"},{"name":"Stephen G Walker"},{"name":"David G Thanassi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Porphyromonas gingivalis"},{"word":"assembly inhibitor"},{"word":"fimbriae"},{"word":"pili"}]},"article23":{"pmid":"30642467","title":"Application of rice (Oryza sativa L.) root endophytic diazotrophic Azotobacter sp. strain Avi2 (MCC 3432) can increase rice yield under green house and field condition.","abs":"Use of plant-associated beneficial microbes, especially endophytes are getting popular day by day as they occupy a relatively privileged niche inside different plant tissues with lesser competition for food and shelter than rhizosphere.

The results of anti-S. mutans as well as biofilm inhibitory activity tests indicated that two derivatives, IG-13-1 and IG-13-2, were the most potent one toward both planktonic and biofilm S. mutans cells with the minimal inhibitory concentration of 5.0 μM and minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations of 5.91 ± 0.91 μM and 7.58 ± 0.23 μM, respectively.

Although this cluster is commonly present in the genome of S. sanguinis, most of the strains do not express Tfp-mediated twitching motility. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the biological functions encoded by the cluster in the twitching-negative strain S. sanguinis SK36. We found that the cluster was transcribed as an operon, with three promoters located 5' to the cluster and one in the intergenic region between SSA_2307 and SSA_2305. Studies using promoter-cat fusion strains revealed that the transcription of the cluster was mainly driven by the distal 5' promoter, which is located more than 800 bases 5' to the first gene of the cluster, SSA_2318. Optimal expression of the cluster occurred at the early stationary growth phase in a CcpA-dependent manner, although a CcpA-binding consensus is absent in the promoter region. Expression of the cluster resulted in a short hairlike surface structure under transmission electron microscopy. Deletion of the putative pilin genes (SSA_2313 to SSA_2315) abolished the biosynthesis of this structure and significantly reduced the adherence of SK36 to HeLa and SCC-4 cells. Mutations in the pil genes downregulated biofilm formation by S. sanguinis SK36. Taken together, the results demonstrate that Tfp of SK36 are important for host cell adherence, but not for motility, and that expression of the pil cluster is subject to complex regulation.","authors":[{"name":"Yi-Ywan M Chen"},{"name":"Yi-Chien Chiang"},{"name":"Tzu-Ying Tseng"},{"name":"Hui-Yu Wu"},{"name":"Yueh-Ying Chen"},{"name":"Chia-Hua Wu"},{"name":"Cheng-Hsun Chiu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CcpA"},{"word":"Streptococcus sanguinis"},{"word":"adherence"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"type IV pilus"}]},"article50":{"pmid":"30635224","title":"Suppressing methanogens and enriching electrogens in bioelectrochemical systems.","abs":"Suppression of methanogens is considered as one of the main challenges in achieving the practical application of several types of bioelectrochemical system (BES).

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the chitosan-streptomycin conjugate (CS-Strep) remains unclear and the poor water-solubility of the conjugate might restrict its applications for anti-infection therapy. In this study, we conjugated streptomycin with water-soluble chitosan oligosaccharides (COS). Unlike CS-Strep, the COS-streptomycin conjugate (COS-Strep) barely affected biofilms of tested Gram-positive bacteria. However, COS-Strep efficiently eradicated established biofilms of the Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This activity of COS-Strep was influenced by the degree of polymerization of chitosan oligosaccharide. The increased susceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotics after conjugating might be related to the following: Suppression of the activation of MexX-MexY drug efflux pump system induced by streptomycin treatment; and down-regulation of the biosynthesis of biofilm exopolysaccharides.

The repurposed antifungal drug, ciclopirox, equally blocks antibiotic-susceptible or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates, indicating that it is not affected by existing resistance mechanisms. Toward understanding how ciclopirox blocks growth, we screened E. coli mutant strains and found that disruption of genes encoding products involved in galactose salvage, enterobacterial common antigen synthesis, and transport of the iron binding siderophore, enterobactin, lowered the minimum inhibitory concentration of ciclopirox needed to block growth of the mutant compared to the isogenic parent strain. We found that ciclopirox induced enterobactin production and that this effect is strongly affected by the deletion of the galactose salvage genes encoding UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, galE, or galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, galT. As disruption of ECA synthesis activates the regulation of capsular synthesis (Rcs) phosphorelay, which inhibits bacterial swarming and promotes biofilm development, we test whether ciclopirox prevents activation of the Rcs pathway. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciclopirox increased swarming of the E. coli laboratory K12 strain BW25113 but had widely varying effects on swarming or surface motility of clinical isolate E. coli, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae. There was no effect of ciclopirox on biofilm production, suggesting it does not target Rcs.

Extracellular proteins and polysaccharides are primary components of biofilms and play a key role in cell survival, microbial persistence, cellular interaction, and maturation of E. faecalis biofilms. Degradation of biofilm components by mammalian proteases is an effective antibiofilm strategy because proteases are known to degrade bacterial proteins leading to bacterial cell lysis and growth inhibition. Here, we show that human matrix metalloprotease-1 inhibits and disrupts E. faecalis biofilms. MMPs are cell-secreted zinc- and calcium-dependent proteases that degrade and regulate various structural components of the extracellular matrix. Human MMP1 is known to degrade type-1 collagen and can also cleave a wide range of substrates. We found that recombinant human MMP1 significantly inhibited and disrupted biofilms of vancomycin sensitive and vancomycin resistant E. faecalis strains. The mechanism of antibiofilm activity is speculated to be linked with bacterial growth inhibition and degradation of biofilm matrix proteins by MMP1.

Furthermore, isolates A70 and A176 produce siderophores under in vitro conditions.

Pathogenic bacterial biofilms on medical implant surfaces cause a significant number of human deaths every year. The proposed mechanism of bactericidal activity is through mechanical cell rupture; however, this is not yet well understood and has not been well characterized.

IRES are characterized by periods of flow cessation, during which channel substrates accumulate and undergo physico-chemical changes (preconditioning), and periods of flow resumption, when these substrates are rewetted and release pulses of dissolved nutrients and organic matter (OM). However, there are no estimates of the amounts and quality of leached substances, nor is there information on the underlying environmental constraints operating at the global scale. We experimentally simulated, under standard laboratory conditions, rewetting of leaves, riverbed sediments, and epilithic biofilms collected during the dry phase across 205 IRES from five major climate zones. We determined the amounts and qualitative characteristics of the leached nutrients and OM, and estimated their areal fluxes from riverbeds. In addition, we evaluated the variance in leachate characteristics in relation to selected environmental variables and substrate characteristics. We found that sediments, due to their large quantities within riverbeds, contribute most to the overall flux of dissolved substances during rewetting events (56%-98%), and that flux rates distinctly differ among climate zones. Dissolved organic carbon, phenolics, and nitrate contributed most to the areal fluxes. The largest amounts of leached substances were found in the continental climate zone, coinciding with the lowest potential bioavailability of the leached OM. The opposite pattern was found in the arid zone. Environmental variables expected to be modified under climate change (i.e. potential evapotranspiration, aridity, dry period duration, land use) were correlated with the amount of leached substances, with the strongest relationship found for sediments. These results show that the role of IRES should be accounted for in global biogeochemical cycles, especially because prevalence of IRES will increase due to increasing severity of drying events.","authors":[{"name":"Oleksandra Shumilova"},{"name":"Dominik Zak"},{"name":"Thibault Datry"},{"name":"Daniel von Schiller"},{"name":"Roland Corti"},{"name":"Arnaud Foulquier"},{"name":"Biel Obrador"},{"name":"Klement Tockner"},{"name":"Daniel C Allan"},{"name":"Florian Altermatt"},{"name":"María Isabel Arce"},{"name":"Shai Arnon"},{"name":"Damien Banas"},{"name":"Andy Banegas-Medina"},{"name":"Erin Beller"},{"name":"Melanie L Blanchette"},{"name":"Juan F Blanco-Libreros"},{"name":"Joanna Blessing"},{"name":"Iola Gonçalves Boëchat"},{"name":"Kate Boersma"},{"name":"Michael T Bogan"},{"name":"Núria Bonada"},{"name":"Nick R Bond"},{"name":"Kate Brintrup"},{"name":"Andreas Bruder"},{"name":"Ryan Burrows"},{"name":"Tommaso Cancellario"},{"name":"Stephanie M Carlson"},{"name":"Sophie Cauvy-Fraunié"},{"name":"Núria Cid"},{"name":"Michael Danger"},{"name":"Bianca de Freitas Terra"},{"name":"Anna Maria De Girolamo"},{"name":"Ruben Del Campo"},{"name":"Fiona Dyer"},{"name":"Arturo Elosegi"},{"name":"Emile Faye"},{"name":"Catherine Febria"},{"name":"Ricardo Figueroa"},{"name":"Brian Four"},{"name":"Mark O Gessner"},{"name":"Pierre Gnohossou"},{"name":"Rosa Gómez Cerezo"},{"name":"Lluís Gomez-Gener"},{"name":"Manuel A S Graça"},{"name":"Simone Guareschi"},{"name":"Björn Gücker"},{"name":"Jason L Hwan"},{"name":"Skhumbuzo Kubheka"},{"name":"Simone Daniela Langhans"},{"name":"Catherine Leigh"},{"name":"Chelsea J Little"},{"name":"Stefan Lorenz"},{"name":"Jonathan Marshall"},{"name":"Angus McIntosh"},{"name":"Clara Mendoza-Lera"},{"name":"Elisabeth Irmgard Meyer"},{"name":"Marko Miliša"},{"name":"Musa C Mlambo"},{"name":"Marcos Moleón"},{"name":"Peter Negus"},{"name":"Dev Niyogi"},{"name":"Athina Papatheodoulou"},{"name":"Isabel Pardo"},{"name":"Petr Paril"},{"name":"Vladimir Pešić"},{"name":"Pablo Rodriguez-Lozano"},{"name":"Robert J Rolls"},{"name":"Maria Mar Sanchez-Montoya"},{"name":"Ana Savić"},{"name":"Alisha Steward"},{"name":"Rachel Stubbington"},{"name":"Amina Taleb"},{"name":"Ross Vander Vorste"},{"name":"Nathan Waltham"},{"name":"Annamaria Zoppini"},{"name":"Christiane Zarfl"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"leaching"},{"word":"leaf litter"},{"word":"rewetting"},{"word":"sediments"},{"word":"temporary rivers"}]},"article79":{"pmid":"30627971","title":"Characterization of the bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus italicus ONU547 isolated from Thai fermented cabbage.","abs":"Seventy-eight isolates of lactic acid bacteria from Ukraine and Thailand were screened for bacteriocinogenic activity against indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei JCM 1157.

Four microbial variables (biomass, dehydrogenase and hydrolytic activities, bacterial community structures) were measured on clay beads incubated in three urban water types (stormwater surface runoffs, SIS-impacted and non-impacted groundwaters) for six SIS. Analyses based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) of partial rrs (16S rRNA) PCR products (V5-V6) were used to compare bacterial community structures of biofilms on clay beads after 10 days of incubation with those of waters collected from the same sampling points at three occasions. Biofilm biomass and activities on clay beads were indicative of nutrient transfers from surface to SIS-impacted groundwaters. Biofilms allowed impacts of SIS on groundwater bacterial community structures to be determined. Although bacterial communities on clay beads did not perfectly match those of waters, clay beads captured the most abundant bacterial taxa. They also captured bacterial taxa that were not detected in waters collected at three occasions during the incubation, demonstrating the integrative character of this approach. Monitoring biofilms on clay beads also allowed the tracking of bacterial genera containing species representing health concerns.","authors":[{"name":"Florian Mermillod-Blondin"},{"name":"J Voisin"},{"name":"L Marjolet"},{"name":"P Marmonier"},{"name":"B Cournoyer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA"},{"word":"Environmental monitoring"},{"word":"Infiltration basins"},{"word":"Metabarcoding"},{"word":"Microbial biomass and activity"},{"word":"Next generation sequencing (NGS)"}]},"article81":{"pmid":"30627668","title":"A Comparison between Two Pathophysiologically Different yet Microbiologically Similar Lung Diseases: Cystic Fibrosis and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.","abs":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic pulmonary diseases that affect ~70,000 and 251 million individuals worldwide, respectively.

In both CF and COPD, the respiratory microbiome plays a major contributing role in disease progression and morbidity. Pulmonary pathogens can differ dramatically during various stages of each disease and frequently cause acute worsening of lung function due to disease exacerbation. Despite some similarities, outcome and timing/type of exacerbation can also be quite different between CF and COPD. Given these clinical distinctions, both patients and physicians should be aware of emerging therapeutic options currently being offered or in development for the treatment of lung infections in individuals with CF and COPD. Although interventions are available that prolong life and mitigate morbidity, neither disorder is curable. Both acute and chronic pulmonary infections contribute to an inexorable downward course and may trigger exacerbations, culminating in loss of lung function or respiratory failure. Knowledge of the pulmonary pathogens causing these infections, their clinical presentation, consequences, and management are, therefore, critical.

In the present study, we characterized by 16S rRNA metabarcoding the bacterial diversity in a field-pilot bioreactor treating extremely As-rich AMD in situ, over a 6 months monitoring period. Inside the bioreactor, the bacterial communities responsible for iron and arsenic removal formed a biofilm (biogenic precipitate) whose composition varied in time and space. These communities evolved from a structure at first similar to the one of the feed water used as an inoculum to a structure quite similar to the natural biofilm developing in situ in the AMD. Over the monitoring period, iron-oxidizing bacteria always largely dominated the biogenic precipitate, with distinct populations (Gallionella, Ferrovum, Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus, Ferritrophicum), whose relative proportions extensively varied among time and space. A spatial structuring was observed inside the trays (arranged in series) composing the bioreactor. This spatial dynamic could be linked to the variation of the physico-chemistry of the AMD water between the raw water entering and the treated water exiting the pilot. According to redundancy analysis (RDA), the following parameters exerted a control on the bacterial communities potentially involved in the water treatment process: dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, dissolved sulfates, arsenic and Fe(II) concentrations and redox potential. Appreciable arsenite oxidation occurring in the bioreactor could be linked to the stable presence of two distinct monophylogenetic groups of Thiomonas related bacteria.

Here, we show that the regulator termed LvbR is an LqsS-regulated transcription factor that binds to the promoter of lpg1056/hnox1 (encoding an inhibitor of the diguanylate cyclase Lpg1057), and thus, regulates proteins involved in c-di-GMP metabolism. LvbR determines biofilm architecture, since L. pneumophila lacking lvbR accumulates less sessile biomass and forms homogeneous mat-like structures, while the parental strain develops more compact bacterial aggregates. Comparative transcriptomics of sessile and planktonic ΔlvbR or ΔlqsR mutant strains revealed concerted (virulence, fitness island, metabolism) and reciprocally (motility) regulated genes in biofilm and broth respectively. Moreover, ΔlvbR is hyper-competent for DNA uptake, defective for phagocyte infection, outcompeted by the parental strain in amoebae co-infections and impaired for cell migration inhibition.

One of the major structural components of these bacterial biofilms are amyloid fibrils, yet the mechanism of fibril assembly and its importance for biofilm formation are currently not fully understood. By studying fibril formation in vitro, in a model system of two common but unrelated biofilm-forming proteins, FapC from Pseudomonas fluorescens and CsgA from Escherichia coli, we found that the two proteins have a common aggregation mechanism. In both systems, fibril formation proceeds via nucleated growth of linear fibrils exhibiting similar measured rates of elongation, with negligible fibril self-replication. These similarities between two unrelated systems suggest that convergent evolution plays a key role in tuning the assembly kinetics of functional amyloid fibrils and indicates that only a narrow window of mechanisms and assembly rates allows for successful biofilm formation.

However, this approach to prevention is impractical for many individuals, so dental caries and periodontal disease are highly prevalent globally. Experts recently agreed that a toothpaste with fluoride and a plaque control agent can augment mechanical procedures to simultaneously prevent caries and periodontal disease. Notwithstanding this, it is timely to rethink prevention and oral health promotion. A new definition of oral health raises awareness of its different dimensions and empowers dentistry to move from treating disease to supporting prevention. In addition, a deeper understanding of the relationship between oral biofilms and the host facilitates new opportunities for disease prevention. The knowledge that health-associated biofilms help prevent establishment of pathogenic species, regulate the potentially damaging host response, and provide essential benefits to health and well-being is paramount to changing the paradigm of prevention of dental disease. Ecological approaches to biofilm control can reduce plaque sufficiently to reduce disease risk, while creating and supporting the beneficial functions of biofilms consistent with health. The knowledge that the oral soft tissues are the primary reservoir of bacteria for tooth recolonization and that reducing bacteria on soft tissues results in improved plaque control and consequently better oral health is also salient. Indeed, a toothpaste that delivers 12-hour protection to the hard and soft tissues (whole mouth protection) and multiple oral health benefits (whole mouth health) could become the future cornerstone of prevention. An innovative fluoride toothpaste with a Dual Zinc plus Arginine multi-functional therapeutic agent offers whole mouth protection against daily oral challenges and whole mouth health for the patient. Within a patient-centered preventive program, next to messaging that motivates towards improved self-care, this toothpaste empowers patients to achieve effective prevention of common oral diseases and better oral health compared to just brushing with an ordinary toothpaste.","authors":[{"name":"Diane Cummins"},{"name":"Philip D Marsh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"12-hour protection"},{"word":"L-arginine"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"control"},{"word":"ecology"},{"word":"fluoride"},{"word":"gingivitis"},{"word":"plaque"},{"word":"prevention"},{"word":"toothpaste"},{"word":"zinc citrate"},{"word":"zinc oxide"}]},"article118":{"pmid":"30620734","title":"Deletion of genes involved in the ketogluconate metabolism, Entner-Doudoroff pathway, and glucose dehydrogenase increase local and invasive virulence phenotypes in Streptococcus pneumoniae.","abs":"Streptococcus pneumoniae displays increased resistance to antibiotic therapy following biofilm formation.

One of these phosphorelays putatively includes four histidine sensor kinase homologues, DivJ, PleC, PdhS1 and PdhS2, and two response regulators, DivK and PleD. In several different alphaproteobacteria, this pathway influences a conserved downstream phosphorelay that ultimately controls the phosphorylation state of the CtrA master response regulator. The PdhS2 sensor kinase reciprocally regulates biofilm formation and swimming motility. In the current study, the mechanisms by which the A. tumefaciens sensor kinase PdhS2 directs this regulation are delineated. PdhS2 lacking a key residue implicated in phosphatase activity is markedly deficient in proper control of attachment and motility phenotypes, whereas a kinase-deficient PdhS2 mutant is only modestly affected. A genetic interaction between DivK and PdhS2 is revealed, unmasking one of several connections between PdhS2-dependent phenotypes and transcriptional control by CtrA. Epistasis experiments suggest that PdhS2 may function independently of the CckA sensor kinase, the cognate sensor kinase for CtrA, which is inhibited by DivK. Global expression analysis of the pdhS2 mutant reveals a restricted regulon, most likely functioning through CtrA to separately control motility and regulate the levels of the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (cdGMP), thereby affecting the production of adhesive polysaccharides and attachment. We hypothesize that in A. tumefaciens the CtrA regulatory circuit has expanded to include additional inputs through the addition of PdhS-type sensor kinases, likely fine-tuning the response of this organism to the soil microenvironment.","authors":[{"name":"Jason E Heindl"},{"name":"Daniel Crosby"},{"name":"Sukhdev Brar"},{"name":"John F Pinto"},{"name":"Tiyan Singletary"},{"name":"Daniel Merenich"},{"name":"Justin L Eagan"},{"name":"Aaron M Buechlein"},{"name":"Eric L Bruger"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"Clay Fuqua"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Agrobacterium tumefaciens"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"development"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"phosphorelay"},{"word":"sensor kinase"}]},"article121":{"pmid":"30619958","title":"Bacterial biofilm formation on implantable devices and approaches to its treatment and prevention.","abs":"In living organisms, biofilms are defined as complex communities of bacteria residing within an exopolysaccharide matrix that adheres to a surface.

The CF airways become chronically colonized with bacteria in childhood, and over time commensal lung microbes are displaced by bacterial pathogens, leading to a decrease in microbial diversity that correlates with declining patient health. Infection with the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major predictor of morbidity and mortality in CF, with CF individuals often becoming chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa in early adulthood and thereafter having an increased risk of hospitalization. Progression of CF respiratory disease is also influenced by infection with respiratory viruses. Children and adults with CF experience frequent respiratory viral infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus, with RSV and influenza infection linked to the greatest decreases in lung function. Along with directly causing severe respiratory symptoms in CF populations, the impact of respiratory virus infections may be more far-reaching, indirectly promoting bacterial persistence and pathogenesis in the CF respiratory tract. Acquisition of P. aeruginosa in CF patients correlates with seasonal respiratory virus infections, and CF patients colonized with P. aeruginosa experience increased severe exacerbations and declines in lung function during respiratory viral co-infection. In light of such observations, efforts to better understand the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections in the CF airways have been a focus of clinical and basic research in recent years.

Its worldwide use results in widespread presence as a contaminant in surface streams and ground-waters. In this study, we isolated, for the first time, the Plectosphaerella cucumerina AR1 nicosulfuron-degrading fungal strain, a new record from Alnus leaf litter submerged in freshwater. The degradation of nicosulfuron by P. cucumerina AR1 was achieved by a co-metabolism process and followed a first-order model dissipation. Biodegradation kinetics analysis indicated that, in planktonic lifestyle, nicosulfuron degradation by this strain was glucose concentration dependent, with a maximum specific degradation rate of 1 g/L in glucose. When grown on natural substrata (leaf or wood) as the sole carbon sources, the Plectosphaerella cucumerina AR1 developed as a well-established biofilm in 10 days. After addition of nicosulfuron in the medium, the biofilms became thicker, with rising mycelium, after 10 days for leaves and 21 days for wood. Similar biofilm development was observed in the absence of herbicide. These fungal biofilms still conserve the nicosulfuron degradation capacity, using the same pathway as that observed with planktonic lifestyle as evidenced by LC-MS analyses. This pathway involved first the hydrolysis of the nicosulfuron sulfonylurea bridge, leading to the production of two major metabolites: 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine (ADMP) and 2-(aminosulfonyl)-N,N-dimethyl-3-pyridinecarboxamide (ASDM). One minor metabolite, identified as 2-(1-(4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)-ureido)-N,N-dimethyl-nicotinamide (N3), derived from the cleavage of the C-S bond of the sulfonylurea bridge and contraction by elimination of sulfur dioxide. A last metabolite (N4), detected in trace amount, was assigned to 2-(4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-nicotinamide (N4), resulting from the hydrolysis of the N3 urea function. Although fungal growth was unaffected by nicosulfuron, its laccase activity was significantly impaired regardless of lifestyle. Leaf and wood surfaces being good substrata for biofilm development in rivers, P. cucumerina AR1 strain could thus have potential as an efficient candidate for the development of methods aiming to reduce contamination by nicosulfuron in aquatic environments.","authors":[{"name":"Louis Carles"},{"name":"Florent Rossi"},{"name":"Pascale Besse-Hoggan"},{"name":"Christelle Blavignac"},{"name":"Martin Leremboure"},{"name":"Joan Artigas"},{"name":"Isabelle Batisson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Plectosphaerella cucumerina"},{"word":"ascomycete fungus"},{"word":"co-metabolism"},{"word":"degradation"},{"word":"herbicide"},{"word":"natural substrata"},{"word":"sulfonylurea"}]},"article125":{"pmid":"30619221","title":"Heavy Metal Ion Stress on Halobacterium salinarum R1 Planktonic Cells and Biofilms.","abs":"Halobacterium salinarum R1 is an extremely halophilic archaeon, able to attach to the surface and to form characteristic biofilm structures under physiological conditions.

We also studied the effects on gene expression in planktonic cells. Investigation of planktonic growth and cell adhesion in the presence of sub-lethal metal concentrations yielded an up to 60% reduced adhesion in case of copper and a significantly enhanced adhesion in case of zinc, whereas nickel treatment had no effect on adhesion. A PMA-qPCR assay was developed to quantify live/dead cells in planktonic cultures and mature biofilms, enabling the investigation of cell vitality after metal exposure. An increased resistance was observed in biofilms with up to 80% in case of copper- and up to 50% in case of zinc exposure compared to planktonic cells. However, nickel-treated biofilms showed no significant increase of cell survival. Microscopic investigation of the architecture of mature biofilms exposed to lethal metal concentrations demonstrated an increased detachment and the formation of large microcolonies after copper treatment, whereas the number of adherent cells increased strongly in nickel-exposed biofilms. In contrast, zinc exposed-biofilms showed no differences compared to the control.

We investigated the effects of indole on toxigenic V. cholerae O1 El Tor during growth under virulence inducing conditions. The indole transcriptome was defined by RNA sequencing and showed widespread changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolism, biofilm production, and virulence factor production. In contrast, genes involved in type VI secretion were not affected by indole. We subsequently found that indole repressed genes involved in V. cholerae pathogenesis, including the ToxR virulence regulon. Consistent with this, indole inhibited cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus production in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of indole on virulence factor production and biofilm were linked to ToxR and the ToxR-dependent regulator LeuO. The expression of leuO was increased by exogenous indole and linked to repression of the ToxR virulence regulon. This process was dependent on the ToxR periplasmic domain, suggesting that indole was a ToxR agonist. This conclusion was further supported by results showing that the ToxR periplasmic domain contributed to indole-mediated increased biofilm production.

We examined the effects of pgl gene deletion on the C. jejuni proteome using label-based liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and validation using data independent acquisition (DIA-SWATH-MS). We quantified 1359 proteins corresponding to ∼84% of the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 genome, and 1080 of these were validated by DIA-SWATH-MS. Deletion of the pglB oligosaccharyltransferase (ΔpglB) resulted in a significant change in abundance of 185 proteins, 137 of which were restored to their wild-type levels by reintroduction of pglB (Δaaz.batpglB::ΔpglB). Deletion of pglB was associated with significantly reduced abundances of pgl targets and increased stress-related proteins, including ClpB, GroEL, GroES, GrpE and DnaK. pglB mutants demonstrated reduced survival following temperature (4 °C and 46 °C) and osmotic (150 mm NaCl) shock and altered biofilm phenotypes compared with wild-type C. jejuni Targeted metabolomics established that pgl negative C. jejuni switched from aspartate (Asp) to proline (Pro) uptake and accumulated intracellular succinate related to proteome changes including elevated PutP/PutA (proline transport and utilization), and reduced DctA/DcuB (aspartate import and succinate export, respectively).

Notably, Staphylococcus capitis accounted for the majority of these daptomycin-resistant (DAP-R) CoNS. To further investigate the mechanisms of daptomycin resistance in CoNS, daptomycin-susceptible clinical strains of S. capitis and Staphylococcus epidermidis underwent in vitro daptomycin exposure to generate DAP-R CoNS mutants.

Whole-genome sequencing analysis of the DAP-R CoNS strains identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in walKR, the essential two-component regulatory system controlling cell wall biogenesis. PCR and sequencing of walK and walR from 17 DAP-R CoNS clinical isolates identified seven nonsynonymous mutations. The results were confirmed by the recreation of the walK SNP in S. epidermidis, which resulted in reduced susceptibility to daptomycin and vancomycin. This study highlights the significance of CoNS in evolving daptomycin resistance and showed that walKR is shared among the staphylococcal species and is involved in antibiotic resistance development.

The integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process is a cost-effective means of upgrading CAS-WWTPs by adding free-floating carrier media, which promotes biofilm formation in the well-mixed suspended growth reactors, providing a potential niche for slow-growing microorganisms. Although IFAS upgrades are typically aimed at enhancing nutrient removal, limited bench- and pilot-scale data indicate that TrOC removal may also be improved. However, only limited reports which focus on a small number of compounds in individual full-scale IFAS-WWTPs have been published to date, and no data is available regarding the removal of estrogenic activity in full-scale IFAS-WWTPs. In this study, six full-scale IFAS-WWTPs were surveyed to quantify TrOC and estrogenic activity removal. Twenty-four hour composite samples of secondary influent and effluent (pre-disinfection) were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), estrogenic activity, and 98 TrOCs. The biomass distribution between the suspended growth phase (i.e. mixed liquor) and IFAS media was also assessed. All IFAS-WWTPs performed well in terms of TSS, COD, and ammonia removal. TN removal varied in accordance with nitrate removal. Total solids per liter of wetted reactor volume ranged from 2.5 to 7.6 g, with 40-60% attached to media. TrOCs with no detection (17) and those with high median removal (23, ≥90% average removal) were observed. Other TrOCs had lower and more variable removal efficiencies. Qualitative comparison with CAS literature shows potentially higher IFAS removal efficiencies for a number of compounds including several which have been previously indicated in bench- or pilot-scale studies (atenolol, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, DEET, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenol), as well as the chlorinated flame retardants TCIPP and TDCIPP.

Here we describe a mobile genetic element (MGE) that carries the bcpAIOB genes in B. thailandensis E264. It is a ~210 kb composite transposon with insertion sequence (IS) elements at each end. Although the ISs are most similar to IS2 of Escherichia coli, the transposase-dependent intermediate molecule displays characteristics more similar to those of the IS26 translocatable unit (TU). A reaction requiring only the left IS-encoded transposase results in formation of an extrachromosomal circular dsDNA intermediate (the megacircle) composed of the left IS and the sequences intervening between the ISs. Insertion of the megacircle into the chromosome occurs next to a pre-existing copy of an IS2-like element, recreating a functional composite transposon. We found that BcpA activity is required for megacircle formation, and in turn, megacircle formation is required for CDS phenotypes. Our data support a model in which the bcpAIOB genes function as both helping and harming greenbeard genes, simultaneously enhancing the fitness of self bacteria that possess the same allele plus tightly linked genes that mediate cooperative behaviors, and killing non-self bacteria that do not possess the same bcpAIOB allele. Mobility of the megacircle between cells could allow bacteria invading a community to be converted to self, and would facilitate propagation of the bcpAIOB genes in the event that the invading strain is capable of overtaking the resident community.","authors":[{"name":"Angelica B Ocasio"},{"name":"Peggy A Cotter"}],"keywords":[]},"article150":{"pmid":"30614873","title":"Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Infection Compromises Wound Healing by Causing Deficiencies in Granulation Tissue Collagen.","abs":"The objective of this work was to causatively link biofilm properties of bacterial infection to specific pathogenic mechanisms in wound healing.","authors":[{"name":"Sashwati Roy"},{"name":"Suman Santra"},{"name":"Amitava Das"},{"name":"Sriteja Dixith"},{"name":"Mithun Sinha"},{"name":"Subhadip Ghatak"},{"name":"Nandini Ghosh"},{"name":"Pradipta Banerjee"},{"name":"Savita Khanna"},{"name":"Shomita Mathew-Steiner"},{"name":"Piya Das Ghatak"},{"name":"Britani N Blackstone"},{"name":"Heather M Powell"},{"name":"Valerie K Bergdall"},{"name":"Daniel J Wozniak"},{"name":"Chandan K Sen"}],"keywords":[]},"article151":{"pmid":"30614760","title":"Disinfectant Resistance Profiles and Biofilm Formation Capacity of Escherichia coli Isolated from Retail Chicken.","abs":"Disinfectant resistance and biofilm formation capacity are two important characteristics that contribute to the persistence of microorganisms in food processing environments and contamination of food products.

In addition, the zwitterionic pillar[5]arene can efficiently disrupt pre-existing Escherichia coli (DH5α) biofilms and kill the biofilm-enclosed bacteria without rapid generation of resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Lingyan Gao"},{"name":"Mingjun Li"},{"name":"Svenja Ehrmann"},{"name":"Zhaoxu Tu"},{"name":"Rainer Haag"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial activity"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"pillar[5]arene"},{"word":"self-assembly"},{"word":"zwitterion"}]},"article154":{"pmid":"30614537","title":"Maltoporin (LamB protein) contributes to the virulence and adhesion of Aeromonas veronii TH0426.","abs":"Aeromonas veronii is one of the main pathogens causing freshwater fish sepsis and ulcer syndrome.

Saturated alpha-diversity curves suggested the existence of more than 14,000 operational taxonomic units in one biofilm sample, which is much higher than previous estimates. Remarkably, the biofilms contained abundant and diverse transposase genes, which were localized along microbial chromosomal segments and co-existed with genes related to metal ion transport and resistance. Genomic analyses of two cyanobacterial strains that were abundant in the biofilms revealed a variety of metal ion transporters and transposases.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of DPO binding, we used structural analyses and biochemical assays to study the V. cholerae VqmA-DPO-DNA complex. These analyses revealed that VqmA contains an N-terminal homodimer domain (PAS) and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD). We observed that VqmA directly binds to a DPO molecule via a compact hydrophobic pocket, consisting of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and several α-helices. We also found that the VqmA dimer interacts with the quasi-palindromic sequence of the vqmR promoter through its DBD. The results of the biochemical studies indicated that a water atom and VqmA residues Phe-67 and Lys-101 play a key role in effector recognition, which is also assisted by Tyr-36 and Phe-99. This is the first molecular level view of the VqmA dimer bound to DPO and DNA.

Exposure to hordenine at 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL significantly inhibited the production of acyl-homoserine lactones and the formation of biofilms. Hordenine treatment notably enhanced the susceptibility of the preformed biofilms to ciprofloxacin by reducing the production of extracellular polysaccharides, destroying the architecture of biofilms, and changing the permeability of membranes, as evidenced by the scattered appearance and dominant red fluorescence in the combination-treated biofilms.

This review focuses on recent progress on three types of such responsive and synergistic antibacterial coatings, including i) self-defensive antibacterial coatings, which can turn on biocidal activity in response to a bacteria-containing microenvironment; ii) synergistic antibacterial coatings, which possess two or more killing mechanisms that interact synergistically to reinforce each other; and iii) smart kill-and-release antibacterial coatings, which can switch functionality between bacteria killing and bacteria releasing under a proper stimulus.

In the current study, we designed poly(aspartamide)-derived micelles self-assembled from cationic copolymers with azithromycin-conjugated and pH-sensitive copolymers, followed by loading cis-aconityl-d-tyrosine (CA-Tyr) via electrostatic interactions. In response to the acidic microenvironment of the biofilm matrix, the hydrophilic transition of the pH-sensitive copolymers and the removal of CA-Tyr led to a sharp decrease in micelle size from 107 nm to 54 nm and a rapid shift in their zeta potential from -11.7 mV to +26.4 mV, which facilitated the penetration of the micelles into biofilms. The acid-labile release of d-tyrosine disintegrated the biofilm matrix, and the lipase-triggered release of azithromycin eradicated the bacteria in the biofilms.

Beta-helical structures merge features of the two motifs, containing two or three beta-sheet faces connected by loops or turns in a single protein. Beta-helical structures form the basis of proteins with diverse mechanical functions such as bacterial adhesins, phage cell-puncture devices, antifreeze proteins, and extracellular matrices. Alpha-helices are commonly found in cellular and extracellular matrix components, whereas beta-helices such as curli fibrils are more common as bacterial and biofilm matrix components. It is currently not known whether it may be advantageous to use one helical motif over the other for different structural and mechanical functions. To better understand the mechanical implications of using different helix motifs in networks, here we use Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations to mechanically unfold multiple alpha- and beta-helical proteins at constant velocity at the single molecule scale. We focus on the energy dissipated during unfolding as a means of comparison between proteins and work normalized by protein characteristics (initial and final length, # H-bonds, # residues, etc.). We find that although alpha-helices such as keratin and beta-helices CsgA and CsgB can require similar amounts of work to unfold, the normalized work per hydrogen bond, initial end to end length, and number of residues is greater for beta-helices at the same pulling rate. To explain this, we analyze the orientation of the backbone alpha carbons and backbone hydrogen bonds during unfolding. We find that the larger width and shorter height of beta-helices results in smaller angles between the protein backbone and the pulling direction during unfolding. As subsequent strands are separated from the beta-helix core, the angle between the backbone and the pulling direction diminishes. This marks a transition where beta-sheet hydrogen bonds become loaded predominantly in a collective shearing mode, which requires a larger rupture force. This finding underlines the importance of geometry in optimizing resistance to mechanical unfolding in proteins. The helix radius is identified here as an important parameter that governs how much sacrificial energy dissipation capacity can be stored in protein networks, where beta-helices offer unique properties.","authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth P DeBenedictis"},{"name":"Sinan Keten"}],"keywords":[]},"article194":{"pmid":"30604487","title":"In vivo detection of endotracheal tube biofilms in intubated critical care patients using catheter-based optical coherence tomography.","abs":"The formation of biofilms in the endotracheal tubes (ETTs) of intubated patients on mechanical ventilation is associated with a greater risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and death.

A major staphylococcal biofilm accumulation molecule is polysaccharide intracellular adhesin (PIA), which is synthesized by enzymes encoded by the icaADBC operon. Expression of PIA is highly variable among clinical isolates, suggesting that PIA expression levels are selected in certain niches of the host. However, the mechanisms that govern enhanced icaADBC transcription and PIA synthesis in these isolates are not known. We hypothesized that enhanced PIA synthesis in these isolates was due to function of IcaR and/or TcaR. Thus, two S. epidermidis isolates (1457 and CSF41498) with different icaADBC transcription and PIA expression levels were studied. Constitutive expression of both icaR and tcaR demonstrated that both repressors are functional and can completely repress icaADBC transcription in both 1457 and CSF41498. However, it was found that IcaR was the primary repressor for CSF41498 and TcaR was the primary repressor for 1457. Further analysis demonstrated that icaR transcription was repressed in 1457 in comparison to CSF41498, suggesting that TcaR functions as a repressor only in the absence of IcaR. Indeed, DNase I footprinting suggests IcaR and TcaR may bind to the same site within the icaR-icaA intergenic region. Lastly, we found mutants expressing variable amounts of PIA could rapidly be selected from both 1457 and CSF41498. Collectively, we propose that strains producing enhanced PIA synthesis are selected within certain niches of the host through several genetic mechanisms that function to repress icaR transcription, thus increasing PIA synthesis.","authors":[{"name":"Tra-My Hoang"},{"name":"C Zhou"},{"name":"J K Lindgren"},{"name":"M R Galac"},{"name":"B Corey"},{"name":"J E Endres"},{"name":"M E Olson"},{"name":"P D Fey"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"transcriptional regulation"}]},"article202":{"pmid":"30602371","title":"Pathobiont release from dysbiotic gut microbiota biofilms in intestinal inflammatory diseases: a role for iron?","abs":"Gut microbiota interacting with an intact mucosal surface are key to the maintenance of homeostasis and health. This review discusses the current state of knowledge of the biofilm mode of growth of these microbiota communities, and how in turn their disruptions may cause disease. Beyond alterations of relative microbial abundance and diversity, the aim of the review is to focus on the disruptions of the microbiota biofilm structure and function, the dispersion of commensal bacteria, and the mechanisms whereby these dispersed commensals may become pathobionts. Recent findings have linked iron acquisition to the expression of virulence factors in gut commensals that have become pathobionts. Causal studies are emerging, and mechanisms common to enteropathogen-induced disruptions, as well as those reported for Inflammatory Bowel Disease and colo-rectal cancer are used as examples to illustrate the great translational potential of such research.

Despite the crucial relevance of biofilms to diverse industrial, medical, and environmental applications, the mechanical properties of biofilms are understudied. Moreover, most of the available techniques for the characterization of biofilm mechanical properties are destructive. Here, we detail a model-based approach developed to characterize the viscoelastic properties of soft materials and bacterial biofilms based on experimental data obtained using the nondestructive dynamic optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique. The model predicted the frequency- and geometry-dependent propagation velocities of elastic waves in a soft viscoelastic plate supported by a rigid substratum. Our numerical calculations suggest that the dispersion curves of guided waves recorded in thin soft plates by the dynamic OCE technique are dominated by guided waves, whose phase velocities depend on the viscoelastic properties and plate thickness. The numerical model was validated against experimental measurements in agarose phantom samples with different thicknesses and concentrations. The model was then used to interpret guided wave dispersion curves obtained by the OCE technique in bacterial biofilms developed in a rotating annular reactor, which allowed the quantitative characterization of biofilm shear modulus and viscosity. This study is the first to employ measurements of elastic wave propagation to characterize biofilms, and it provides a novel framework combining a theoretical model and an experimental approach for studying the relationship between the biofilm internal physical structure and mechanical properties.","authors":[{"name":"Hong-Cin Liou"},{"name":"Fabrizio Sabba"},{"name":"Aaron I Packman"},{"name":"George Wells"},{"name":"Oluwaseyi Balogun"}],"keywords":[]},"article207":{"pmid":"30601523","title":"Synthesis and antimicrobial photodynamic effect of methylene blue conjugated carbon nanotubes on E. coli and S. aureus.","abs":"Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are one of the leading causes of high morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The proper management, prevention and treatment of CRBSIs rely on the understanding of these highly resistant bacterial infections. The emergence of such a challenge to public health has resulted in the development of an alternative antimicrobial strategy called antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). In the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), light of the appropriate wavelength, and molecular oxygen, aPDT generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which lead to microbial cell death and cell damage. We investigated the enhanced antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of methylene blue conjugated carbon nanotubes (MBCNTs) on biofilms of E. coli and S. aureus using a laser light source at 670 nm with radiant exposure of 58.49 J cm-2. Photodynamic inactivation in test cultures showed 4.86 and 5.55 log10 reductions in E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Biofilm inhibition assays, cell viability assays and EPS reduction assays showed higher inhibition in S. aureus than in E. coli, suggesting that pronounced ROS generation occurred due to photodynamic therapy in S. aureus. Results from a study into the mechanism of action proved that the cell membrane is the main target for photodynamic inactivation. Comparatively higher photodynamic inactivation was observed in Gram positive bacteria due to the increased production of free radicals inside these cells. From this study, we conclude that MBCNT can be used as a promising nanocomposite for the eradication of dangerous pathogens on medical devices.","authors":[{"name":"Paramanantham Parasuraman"},{"name":"V T Anju"},{"name":"S B Sruthil Lal"},{"name":"Alok Sharan"},{"name":"Siddhardha Busi"},{"name":"K Kaviyarasu"},{"name":"Mohammed Arshad"},{"name":"Turki M S Dawoud"},{"name":"Asad Syed"}],"keywords":[]},"article208":{"pmid":"30601473","title":"Nanotechnology-based antimicrobials and delivery systems for biofilm-infection control.","abs":"Bacterial-infections are mostly due to bacteria in an adhering, biofilm-mode of growth and not due to planktonically growing, suspended-bacteria.

Some of these substances (toxic contaminants) stress biological activity at all concentrations, while others (e.g., nutrients) subsidize it at low concentrations and stress it above a threshold, causing subsidy-stress responses. Thus, the overall effects of WWTP effluents depend mostly on their composition and the dilution capacity of the receiving water bodies. We assessed the immediate and legacy effects of WWTP effluents in artificial streams, where we measured the uptake of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) by the biofilm, biomass accrual, benthic metabolism and organic matter decomposition (OMD). In a first phase (32 d), the channels were subjected to a gradient of effluent contribution, from pure stream water to pure effluent. WWTP effluent affected the ecosystem processes we measured, although we found no clear subsidy-stress patterns except for biofilm biomass accrual. Instead, most of the processes were subsidized, although they showed complex and process-specific patterns. Benthic metabolism and OMD were subsidized without saturation, as they peaked at medium and high levels of pollution, respectively, but they never fell below control levels. SRP uptake was the only process that decreased with increasing effluent concentration. In a second phase of the experiment (23 d), all channels were kept on pure stream water to analyse the legacy effects of the effluent. For most of the processes, there were clear legacy effects, which followed either subsidy, stress, or subsidy-stress patterns. SRP uptake capacity was stressed with increasing pollution legacy, whereas algal accrual and benthic metabolism continued being subsidized.

This work demonstrates how the moduli and/or local polymer concentration play critical roles in sustaining contact, dynamic adhesion, and transport of bacterial cells along a hydrogel or hydrated brush surface. In particular, stiffer more concentrated hydrogels and brushes maintained the greatest dynamic contact, still allowing cells to travel along the surface in flow. This study addressed how the mechanical properties, molecular architectures, and thicknesses of minimally adhesive poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based coatings influence the flow-driven surface motion of Staphylococcus aureus MS2 cells. Three protein-repellant PEG-dimethylacrylate hydrogel films (∼100 μm thick) and two protein-repellant PEG brushes (8-16 nm thick) were sufficiently fouling-resistant to prevent the accumulation of flowing bacteria. However, the rolling or hopping-like motions of gently flowing S. aureus cells along the surfaces were specific to the particular hydrogel or brush, distinguishing these coatings in terms of their mechanical properties (with moduli from 2 to 1300 kPa) or local PEG concentrations (in the range 10-50% PEG). On the stiffer hydrogel coatings having higher PEG concentrations, S. aureus exhibited long runs of surface rolling, 20-50 μm in length, an increased tendency of cells to repeatedly return to some surfaces after rolling and escaping, and relatively long integrated contact times. By contrast, on the softer more dilute hydrogels, bacteria tended to encounter the surface for brief periods before escaping without return. The dynamic adhesion and motion signatures of the cells on the two brushes were bracketed by those on the soft and stiff hydrogels, demonstrating that PEG coating thickness was not important in these studies where the vertically oriented surfaces minimized the impact of gravitational forces. Control studies with similarly sized poly(ethylene oxide)-coated rigid spherical microparticles, that also did not arrest on the PEG coatings, established that the bacterial skipping and rolling signatures were specific to the S. aureus cells and not simply diffusive. Dynamic adhesion of the S. aureus cells on the PEG hydrogel surfaces correlated well with quiescent 24 h adhesion studies in the literature, despite the orientation of the flow studies that eliminated the influence of gravity on bacteria-coating normal forces.","authors":[{"name":"Kristopher W Kolewe"},{"name":"Surachate Kalasin"},{"name":"Molly Shave"},{"name":"Jessica D Schiffman"},{"name":"Maria M Santore"}],"keywords":[{"word":"S. aureus MS2"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofouling"},{"word":"hydrogel"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"microparticle"},{"word":"microsphere"},{"word":"polyethylene glycol"},{"word":"polyethylene oxide"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"30594743","title":"Whole room disinfection with hydrogen peroxide mist to control Listeria monocytogenes in food industry related environments.","abs":"Listeria monocytogenes surviving daily cleaning and disinfection is a challenge for many types of food industries.

To ensure similarity in effluent water quality between bench- and pilot- or full-scale biofilters at the same influent substrate concentration, the tested model requires that either mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss takes primacy over the other. The potential primacy of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss was evaluated via water quality testing (dissolved organic carbon, specific ultraviolet absorbance, liquid chromatography - organic carbon detection, trihalomethane formation potential, and haloacetic acid formation potential). The biofilters also were characterized for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, enzyme activity, extracellular polymeric substances, and microbial community structure. The results of this study indicate that biofilm shear loss takes primacy over mass transport resistance for bench-scale biofilter design in this system; thus, bench-scale biofilters designed in this manner accurately represent organics removal in pilot-scale biofilters.

These SODs are essential for virulence of fungal pathogens in pulmonary and disseminated infections, and we show here an additional role for copper-only SODs in promoting survival of fungal biofilms. The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans expresses three copper-only SODs, and deletion of one of them, SOD5, eradicated candidal biofilms on venous catheters in a rodent model. Fungal copper-only SODs harbor an irregular active site that, unlike their Cu,Zn-SOD counterparts, contains a copper co-factor unusually open to solvent and lacks zinc for stabilizing copper binding, making fungal copper-only SODs highly vulnerable to metal chelators. We found that unlike mammalian Cu,Zn-SOD1, C. albicans SOD5 indeed rapidly loses its copper to metal chelators such as EDTA, and binding constants for Cu(II) predict that copper-only SOD5 has a much lower affinity for copper than does Cu,Zn-SOD1. We screened compounds with a variety of indications and identified several metal-binding compounds, including the ionophore pyrithione zinc (PZ), that effectively inhibit C. albicans SOD5 but not mammalian Cu,Zn-SOD1. We observed that PZ both acts as an ionophore that promotes uptake of toxic metals and inhibits copper-only SODs. The pros and cons of a vulnerable active site for copper-only SODs and the possible exploitation of this vulnerability in antifungal drug design are discussed.","authors":[{"name":"Natalie G Robinett"},{"name":"Edward M Culbertson"},{"name":"Ryan L Peterson"},{"name":"Hiram Sanchez"},{"name":"David R Andes"},{"name":"Jeniel E Nett"},{"name":"Valeria C Culotta"}],"keywords":[{"word":"copper"},{"word":"yeast"},{"word":"superoxide dismutase (SOD)"},{"word":"superoxide ion"},{"word":"fungi"},{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"Cu-only SOD"},{"word":"metalloenzyme"},{"word":"mycocide"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article255":{"pmid":"30593366","title":"Partial prediction of the duration and the clinical status of Staphylococcus aureus bovine intramammary infections based on the phenotypic and genotypic analysis of isolates.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial pathogen causing bovine intramammary infections (IMIs) often leading to chronic clinical or subclinical mastitis. Predicting the outcome of S. aureus IMIs (duration and clinical vs subclinical) based on the characterization of isolates would help to make better case management decisions. For this purpose, 583 S. aureus isolates from series of quarter milk samples were characterized by genotypic tests (detection of virulence genes seg, tst, lukM), epidemiological typing (spa type) and by a phenotypic test (biofilm production). VNTR typing (variable number of tandem repeats) was used to establish persistence of the same S. aureus strain in each series of sequential isolates. This allowed to associate each strain to a clinical/subclinical status and to validate the duration of infection. We found differences in the distribution of spa types between the strains from clinical and subclinical cases. Prevalence of lukM was also higher in strains from clinical cases than in strains from subclinical cases. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was then used to determine factors influencing the duration of the infection. Considering a multivariable model of the logistic regression, time to elimination was shorter with the strains of the subclinical lactation series compared to the clinical series (series with at least one clinical case). Strains from the spa type t359 and t529 were less likely to persist compared to those of spa type t13410.

The aim of the present study was to determine the pathogenesis and arthritis induction of new Salmonella Pullorum isolates. We isolated and identified five Salmonella Pullorum strains from broilers with bacterial arthritis and lameness in a commercial poultry farm. Four of five isolates were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics and were defined as multidrug-resistant Salmonella Pullorum. All isolates had the same CRISPR sequence type and belonged to a single major cluster. The isolates exhibited high capability of biofilm formation, which may facilitate their dispersal and survival in hostile habitats, and showed high virulence based on embryo lethality and inoculation of newly hatched chicks. Tissue distribution analysis confirmed that SP1621 was more adapted to colonize the joint when compared to the white diarrhoea-causing Salmonella Pullorum reference strain S06004. Reproducible arthritis and typical joint lesions were observed in SP1621-infected chicks, and histopathological examination showed necrotic synovitis and cartilage tissue hyperplasia of the joint. Koch's postulates were confirmed when the novel Salmonella Pullorum strain was re-isolated from the joint tissues of experimentally inoculated chicks. These novel Salmonella Pullorum isolates have unique ability to induce arthritis in chickens, representing expanded pathogenic diversity in China.

Unlike pathological amyloid, FA has been subjected to evolutionary optimization which is likely to be reflected in the aggregation mechanism. FA from different bacteria, including Escherichia coli (CsgA) and Pseudomonas (FapC), contains a number of imperfect repeats which may be key to efficient aggregation. Here we report on the aggregative behavior of FapC constructs which represent all single, double, and triple deletions of the protein's three imperfect repeats. Analysis of the fibrillation kinetics by the program Amylofit reveals that the removal of these repeats increases the tendency of the growing fibrils to fragment and also generally increases aggregation half-times. Remarkably, even the mutant lacking all three repeats was able to fibrillate, although fibrillation was much more irregular and led to significantly altered and destabilized fibrils. We conclude that imperfect repeats can promote fibrillation efficiency thanks to their modular design, though the context of the imperfect repeats also plays a significant role.","authors":[{"name":"Casper B Rasmussen"},{"name":"Gunna Christiansen"},{"name":"Brian S Vad"},{"name":"Carina Lynggaard"},{"name":"Jan J Enghild"},{"name":"Maria Andreasen"},{"name":"Daniel Otzen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Amylofit"},{"word":"FapC"},{"word":"Thioflavin T"},{"word":"aggregation mechanisms"},{"word":"kinetic analysis"}]},"article258":{"pmid":"30592324","title":"Inhibitory effects of fruit berry extracts on Streptococcus mutans biofilms.","abs":"Dark-colored fruit berries are a rich source of polyphenols that could provide innovative bioactive molecules as natural weapons against dental caries.

Cisplatin was found to effectively kill strains of P. aeruginosa. In such experiments, transcriptomic profiling showed upregulation of the recA gene, which is known to be important for DNA repair, implicating that cisplatin could interfere with DNA replication in P. aeruginosa. Cisplatin treatment significantly repressed the type III secretion system (T3SS), which is important for the secretion of exotoxins. Furthermore, cisplatin was also demonstrated to eradicate in vitro biofilms and in vivo biofilms in a murine keratitis model. This showed that cisplatin could be effectively used to eradicate biofilm infections which were otherwise difficult to be treated by conventional antibiotics. Although cisplatin is highly toxic for humans upon systemic exposure, a low toxicity was demonstrated with topical treatment.

Current treatments using antimicrobials are under increasing scrutiny due to rising prevalence of multi-drug resistance in S. aureus. Objectives of this study were to determine: (1) genetic diversity of Staphylococcus species isolated from clinical mastitis in cows from large Chinese dairy farms; and (2) prevalence and distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) in these isolates. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 96) were isolated from 26 herds located in 12 provinces of China, whereas NAS (n = 112) were isolated from 59 herds located in 18 provinces of China. The NAS were identified at the species level using a partial 16S rRNA sequencing method, whereas random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR was done to determine genetic relationships of isolates. Finally, PCR was used to detect resistance and biofilm formation genes. Staphylococcus chromogenes (33%) was the most common NAS species, followed by Staphylococcus sciuri (17%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%). Staphylococcus aureus was grouped in 12 genotypes, of which 2 types represented 56% of isolates. Staphylococcus chromogenes (n = 37) clustered into 8 RAPD types, with 2 prevalent types containing 73% of isolates. The most prevalent ARG in S. aureus isolates was blaZ (95%), followed by tetM (33%), tetK (31%), ermT (26%), and aacA-aphD (23%).

Antimicrobial resistance genes mecA, tetK, tetL, tetM, dfrG, ermB, msrA, mphC, aadD, and aphA3 were more commonly detected in NAS than in S. aureus. Biofilm formation genes (icaA and icaD) were frequently detected in staphylococci isolated from bovine clinical mastitis. The existence of predominant RAPD types in S. aureus and S. chromogenes isolates across Chinese dairy farms indicated that specific genotypes had disseminated within herds and become more udder-adapted.

At the initial stage of the cell attachment, the electrochemical activity of Gs cells at a submonolayer coverage on the SAM-Au surface was independent of the linker length. Subsequently, multiple potential cyclings indicated that longer linkers provided more biocompatible conditions for Gs cells than shorter ones. For Gs biofilms, on the other hand, the turnover current decreased exponentially with the linker length. During the biofilm formation, bacteria need to adjust from the initial planktonic state to an electrode-respiring state, which was triggered by a strong electrochemical stress found for shorter linkers, resulting in the formation of mature biofilms.

The development of complementary and alternative effective strategies to antibiotics for the treatment of chronic wounds is highly desired. Phage therapy constitutes a very promising approach in the control of topical microbial populations. In this work newly isolated phages were tested for their efficacy to control bacterial species that predominate in chronic wounds. Phage effectiveness was studied on 24-h old biofilms formed in polystyrene microplates and in porcine skin explants using two treatment approaches: individual phage and a cocktail of phages against four main pathogens commonly isolated from chronic wounds. The two models produced variations in the surface colonization ability, assessed by viable bacterial counts and microscopy visualization after using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) or locked nucleic acid probes (LNA) and 2'-O-methyl (2'-OMe) in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and in the phage-host interactions. Phages alone and combined caused greater reductions in the number of viable cells when biofilms had been formed on porcine skins and with greater variations detected at 4 h and 24 h of sampling. These results suggest that porcine skin models should be preferentially used to assess the use of phages and phage cocktails intended for topical use in order to understand the fate, throughout treatment time, of the population when dealing with biofilm-related infections.","authors":[{"name":"C Milho"},{"name":"M Andrade"},{"name":"D Vilas Boas"},{"name":"D Alves"},{"name":"S Sillankorva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteriophages"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Chronic wounds"},{"word":"Porcine skin model"}]},"article272":{"pmid":"30589497","title":"PEEK materials as an alternative to titanium in dental implants: A systematic review.","abs":"Evaluation of the available research on PEEK materials to find that whether PEEK material has favorable properties and can enhance osseointegration, so that they can be utilize as implants material.","authors":[{"name":"Sunil Mishra"},{"name":"Ramesh Chowdhary"}],"keywords":[{"word":"carbon fiber-reinforced "},{"word":"fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone-nanohydroxyapatite"},{"word":"osseointegration"},{"word":"periimplantitis"},{"word":"polyetheretherketone"}]},"article273":{"pmid":"30589261","title":"Selective Labeling and Growth Inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Aminoguanidine Carbon Dots.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly virulent bacterium, particularly associated with the spread of multidrug resistance.

This study addresses LT diversity in the XccA genome and examines the role of plasmid and chromosomal TnXax1 LT passenger genes using site-directed deletion mutagenesis and functional characterization. We identified 13 XccA LTs: 12 belong to families 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D (two copies), 1F, 1G, 3A, 3B (two copies), 5A, 6A and one which is non-categorized. The non-categorized LT is exclusive to the Xanthomonas genus and related to the 3B family but contains an additional domain linked to carbohydrate metabolism. The categorized LTs are probably involved in cell wall remodeling to allow insertion of type 3, 4 and 6 secretion systems, flagellum assembly, division and recycling of cell wall and degradation and control of peptidoglycan production. The TnXax1 passenger LT genes (3B family) are not essential to XccA or for CC development but are implicated in peptidoglycan metabolism, directly impacting bacterial fitness and CC symptom enhancement in susceptible hosts (e.g., Citrus sinensis). This underlines the role of TnXax1 as a virulence and pathogenicity-propagating agent in XccA and suggests that LT acquisition by horizontal gene transfer mediated by TnXax1 may improve bacterial fitness, conferring adaptive advantages to the plant-pathogen interaction process.","authors":[{"name":"Amanda C P Oliveira"},{"name":"Rafael M Ferreira"},{"name":"Maria Inês T Ferro"},{"name":"Jesus A Ferro"},{"name":"Mick Chandler"},{"name":"Alessandro M Varani"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Comparative genomics"},{"word":"Lateral gene transfer"},{"word":"Tn3"},{"word":"Xanthan gum"}]},"article277":{"pmid":"30588133","title":"Inhibition of bacterial attachment and biofilm formation by a novel intravenous catheter material using an in vitro percutaneous catheter insertion model.","abs":"Despite sterile barrier precautions and vigorous skin antisepsis, percutaneous insertion of intravenous catheters has been shown to result in attachment to the catheter surface of bacteria residing in the deep structures of the skin.

Studies have demonstrated the proteomic approach to be a promising tool for the discovery and identification of biochemical markers of periodontal diseases. Recently, many studies have applied expression proteomics to identify proteins whose expression levels are altered by disease. As a fluid lying in close proximity to the periodontal tissue, the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is the principal target in the search for periodontal disease biomarkers because its protein composition may reflect the disease pathophysiology. Biochemical marker analysis of GCF is effective for objective diagnosis in the early and advanced stages of periodontal disease. Periodontal diseases are also promising targets for proteomics, and several groups, including ours, have applied proteomics in the search for GCF biomarkers of periodontal diseases.

Peptides isolated from Peganum harmala (PhAMP) exhibited maximum activity against laboratory strains. As clinical-isolates are more virulent and resistant to antibiotics, we tested the potential of PhAMP on these bacterial strains isolated from infected wounds.

Proteomic analysis reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying GOQD-induced microbial proliferation. GOQDs induce the overexpression of microbial divisomal proteins associated with division initiation, DNA replication and peptidoglycan hydrolysis/synthesis.

The biofilm formation was related to the presence of fimA (odds ratio (OR) 0.8571, 95% CI 1.733-6.267, p <0.0001), mrkA (OR 0.2462, 95% CI 2.723-4.622, p 0.001), matB (OR 0.4521, 95% CI 1.353-5.332, p 0.008) and pilQ (OR 0.1481, 95% CI 1.691-6.117, p <0.0001). The npsB toxin-encoding gene was detected among 46 (92%) isolates. Resistance to non-β-lactam antibiotics was significantly associated with the presence of adhesin-encoding genes. The presence of adhesins and the capsular encoding gene was significantly associated with biofilm formation among K. oxytoca isolates. The presence of surface adhesin-encoding genes was significantly associated with the biofilm formation and also with resistance to non-β-lactam antibiotics among K. oxytoca clinical isolates. In addition, biofilm production was not significantly associated with β-lactam resistance among the isolates.","authors":[{"name":"A Ghasemian"},{"name":"A M Mobarez"},{"name":"S N Peerayeh"},{"name":"A T Bezmin Abadi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adhesins"},{"word":"Klebsiella oxytoca"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilms"}]},"article299":{"pmid":"30581421","title":"Planning a One Health Case Study to Evaluate Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Its Economic Burden in Portugal.","abs":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most important multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens worldwide with infections leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality, a significant burden to human and veterinary clinical practices. The ability of S. aureus colonies to form biofilms on biotic and abiotic surfaces contributes further to its high antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates and persistence in both host and non-host environments, adding a major ecological dimension to the problem. While there is a lot of information on MRSA prevalence in humans, data about MRSA in animal populations is scarce, incomplete and dispersed. This project is an attempt to evaluate the current epidemiological status of MRSA in Portugal by making a single case study from a One Health perspective. We aim to determine the prevalence of MRSA in anthropogenic sources liable to contaminate different animal habitats. The results obtained will be compiled with existing data on antibiotic resistant staphylococci from Portugal in a user-friendly database, to generate a geographically detailed epidemiological output for surveillance of AMR in MRSA. To achieve this, we will first characterize AMR and genetic lineages of MRSA circulating in northern Portugal in hospital wastewaters, farms near hospitals, farm animals that contact with humans, and wild animals. This will indicate the extent of the AMR problem in the context of local and regional human-animal-environment interactions. MRSA strains will then be tested for their ability to form biofilms. The proteomes of the strains will be compared to better elucidate their AMR mechanisms. Proteomics data will be integrated with the genomic and transcriptomic data obtained. The vast amount of information expected from this omics approach will improve our understanding of AMR in MRSA biofilms, and help us identify new vaccine candidates and biomarkers for early diagnosis and innovative therapeutic strategies to tackle MRSA biofilm-associated infections and potentially other AMR superbugs.","authors":[{"name":"Gilberto Igrejas"},{"name":"Susana Correia"},{"name":"Vanessa Silva"},{"name":"Michel Hébraud"},{"name":"Manuela Caniça"},{"name":"Carmen Torres"},{"name":"Catarina Gomes"},{"name":"Fernanda Nogueira"},{"name":"Patrícia Poeta"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"One Health"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"omics"},{"word":"surveillance"}]},"article300":{"pmid":"30581112","title":"A Surface-Induced Asymmetric Program Promotes Tissue Colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa effectively colonizes host epithelia using pili as primary adhesins.

This leads to surface adherence and virulence induction by stimulating pili assembly through activation of the c-di-GMP receptor FimW. Surface-attached bacteria divide asymmetrically to generate a piliated, surface-committed progeny (striker) and a flagellated, motile offspring that leaves the surface to colonize distant sites (spreader). Cell differentiation is driven by a phosphodiesterase that asymmetrically positions to the flagellated pole, thereby maintaining c-di-GMP levels low in the motile offspring.

Currently, the most common method to analyze and quantify TEP only allows offline, and often offsite measurement, causing delays and slow response times. This paper introduces an improved method for TEP monitoring using a membrane-based spectrophotometric technique to quantify TEP in various water bodies. The proposed TEP monitor involves a crossflow filtration unit, reagent injection and a spectrophotometer system. The TEP retained on the membrane surface is stained by Alcian blue and the amount deposited is quantified directly using an optic fibre reflectance probe coupled with a spectrophotometer. The novel method shows a linear relationship with various concentrations of Xanthan gum (a model representing TEP).

The deletion of smu_833 decreases glucan and increases eDNA but maintains the overall biofilm biomass. The decrease in glucan is caused by a reduction in GtfB and GtfC, two key enzymes responsible for the synthesis of glucan. The increase in eDNA was accompanied by an elevated production of membrane vesicles, suggesting that SMU_833 modulates the release of eDNA via the membrane vesicles, thereby altering biofilm matrix constituents. Furthermore, glucan and eDNA were colocalized. The complete deletion of gtfBC from the smu_833 mutant significantly reduced the biofilm biomass despite the elevated eDNA, suggesting the requirement of minimal glucans as a binding substrate for eDNA within the biofilm. Despite no changes in overall biofilm biomass, the mutant biofilm was altered in biofilm architecture and was less acidic in vitro Concurrently, the mutant was less virulent in an in vivo rat model of dental caries, demonstrating that SMU_833 is a new virulence factor.

However, the conventional MFC biosensors may fail to distinguish between VFAs and other organics as real digestates containing complex organics and microbes are fed into anode directly. In the present study, an MFC based biosensor was developed and operated in a smart way for selective acetate detection. In the biosensor, acetate ions contained in the AD sample was first fed into the cathode, and then acetic ion transferred through the membrane from the cathode to anode chamber where it was further used as the sole substrate by pre-enriched electroactive biofilm for the current generation. A linear correlation between the current density and acetate concentrations (0.5-20 mM) at varied reaction time (1-5 h) was established. Then, the interference from propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and glucose on the performance of the biosensor was evaluated.

Seawater desalination by reverse osmosis (RO) suffers from biofilm growth on the membranes (biofouling), which limits its widespread use because biofouling decreases water permeance and necessitates module cleaning and replacement, leading to increased economic and environmental costs. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) bound covalently to RO membranes inhibit biofilm growth and might delay membrane biofouling. Here we examined how various hydrophilic membrane coatings composed of zwitterionic, neutral, positively charged, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-grafted polymers affected the biocidal activity and the biofilm inhibition of a covalently bonded AMP on RO membranes. AMP magainin-2 was linked by the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction to a series of RO membranes that were grafted with different methacrylate polymers. Surface characterization by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water drop contact angle gave evidence of successful RO modifications, and zeta potential analysis reflected the increase in surface charge due to the linked, positively charged peptide. All AMP-modified membranes inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth compared to unmodified membranes, and the grafted methacrylic polymers did not significantly interfere with the peptide activity. On the other hand, membranes coated with zwitterionic and other acrylate polymers including AMP attachment inhibited biofilm growth more than either the AMP or the polymer coating alone. This enhancement led to ∼20% less biofilm biovolume on the membrane surfaces. The combination of antimicrobial coatings with polymer coatings known to resist fouling might aid future designs of surface coatings susceptible to biofilm growth.","authors":[{"name":"Nitzan Shtreimer Kandiyote"},{"name":"Tehila Avisdris"},{"name":"Christopher J Arnusch"},{"name":"Roni Kasher"}],"keywords":[]},"article322":{"pmid":"30576101","title":"Biological Engineered Living Materials: Growing Functional Materials with Genetically Programmable Properties.","abs":"Natural biological materials exhibit remarkable properties: self-assembly from simple raw materials, precise control of morphology, diverse physical and chemical properties, self-repair, and the ability to sense-and-respond to environmental stimuli.

A total of 26 APEC strains were isolated from different farms in this study, and analysis showed that all of those isolates carried multiple virulence-associated genes and drug-resistance genes, which led to high pathogenicity (15/26), strong or moderate biofilm formation (24/26) and multidrug-resistant abilities (26/26). On the other hand, coinfection with APEC, H9 avian influenza virus (AIV) and Tembusu virus (TMUV) was very common on those farms (11/26), with APEC and TMUV sharing a similar morbidity peak (from May to September) and susceptibility (60% infections occurred in ducklings); thus, we speculated that the emerging TMUV infection escalated the APEC incidence in ducks. Finally, the data presented in this report enhance the current understanding of the epidemiology of APEC and different viral infections in ducks and provide additional insight into the critical factors that determine their pathogenicity.

Host recognition of pathogens is mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) that bind conserved molecular patterns shared by large groups of microorganisms. The oral epithelial cells respond to most periodontopathic bacteria via TLR-2 and TLR-4. In addition to the membrane-associated receptors, soluble forms of TLR-2 (sTLR-2) and TLR-4 (sTLR-4) have been identified and are thought to play a regulatory role by binding microbial ligands. sTLR-2 has been shown to arise from ectodomain shedding of the extracellular domain of the membrane receptor and sTLR-4 is thought to be an alternate spliced form. Many studies have previously reported the presence of elevated numbers of viable exfoliated epithelial cells in the saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential value of salivary sTLR-2 and sTLR-4 together with the paired epithelial cell-associated TLR-2/4 mRNA as diagnostic markers for chronic periodontitis. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected after obtaining informed consent from 40 individuals with either periodontitis or gingivitis. The sTLR-2 and sTLR4 in saliva was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TLR-2 and TLR-4 transcript in the epithelial cells in saliva was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction. While levels of sTLR-2 exhibited an inverse correlation, sTLR-4 positively correlated with clinical parameters in the gingivitis cohort. Interestingly, both correlations were lost in the periodontitis cohort indicating a dysregulated host response. On the other hand, while the sTLR-2 and the paired epithelial cell associated TLR-2 mRNA exhibited a direct correlation (r2 = 0.62), that of sTLR4 and TLR-4 mRNA exhibited an inverse correlation (r2 = 0.53) in the periodontitis cohort.

Therefore, knowledge about the diversity of plant pathogens, about potential reservoirs of inoculum and about the processes that contribute to their survival and adaptation is limited to these contexts. The agro-centric perspective of plant pathogen life histories is incoherent with respect to the capacity of many of them to persist as saprophytes on various substrates. In this context we have investigated the ubiquity of the broad host range necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea, outside of agricultural settings and have determined if the populations in these natural habitats can be distinguished phenotypically and phylogenetically from populations isolated from diseased crops. Over a period of 5 years, we isolated B. cinerea from 235 samples of various substrates collected in France including rainfall, snowpack, river, and lake water, epilithic biofilms in mountain streams, leaf litter and plant debris, rock surfaces, bird feathers and healthy wild plants from outside of agricultural fields. All substrates except rock surfaces harbored B. cinerea leading us to establish a collection of purified strains that were compared to B. cinerea from diseased tomato, grapes and various other crops in France. Phylogenetic comparisons of 321 strains from crop plants and 100 strains from environmental substrates based on sequences of 9 microsatellite markers revealed that strains from crops and the environment could not be distinguished. Furthermore, the genetic diversity of strains outside of agriculture was just as broad as within agriculture. In tests to determine the aggressiveness of strains on tomato stems, the mean disease severity caused by strains from environmental substrates was statistically identical to the severity of disease caused by strains from tomato, but was significantly greater than the severity caused by strains from grape or other crops.

The ability of this pathogen to colonize healthcare workers (HCW)' hands, and to form biofilm on medical devices has been associated with the occurrence of nosocomial outbreaks and high mortality rates. Fluconazole has been the leading antifungal drug for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in developing countries. However, azole-resistant C. parapsilosis isolates are emerging worldwide, including in Brazil. Few studies have correlated outbreak infections due to C. parapsilosis with virulence factors, such as biofilm production. We thus conducted a microbiological investigation of C. parapsilosis complex isolates from a Brazilian teaching hospital. Additionally, we identified a previously unrecognized outbreak caused by a persistent azole-resistant C. parapsilosis (sensu stricto) clone in the intensive care unit (ICU), correlating it with the main clinical data from the patients with invasive candidiasis. The molecular identification of the isolates was carried out by PCR-RFLP assay; antifungal susceptibility and biofilm formation were also evaluated. The genotyping of all C. parapsilosis (sensu stricto) was performed by microsatellite analysis and the presence of ERG11 mutations was assessed in the azole non-susceptible isolates. Fourteen C. parapsilosis (sensu stricto) isolates were recovered from patients with invasive candidiasis, eight being fluconazole and voriconazole-resistant, and two intermediate only to fluconazole (FLC). All non-susceptible isolates showed a similar pattern of biofilm formation with low biomass and metabolic activity. The A395T mutation in ERG11 was detected exclusively among the azole-resistant isolates. According to the microsatellite analysis, all azole non-susceptible isolates from the adult ICU were clustered together indicating the occurrence of an outbreak. Regarding clinical data, all patients infected by the clonal non-susceptible isolates and none of the patients infected by the susceptible isolates had been previously exposed to corticosteroids (p = 0.001), while the remaining characteristics showed no statistical significance. The current study revealed the persistence of an azole non-susceptible C. parapsilosis clone with low capacity to form biofilm over two years in the adult ICU. These results reinforce the need of epidemiological surveillance and monitoring antifungal susceptibility of C. parapsilosis isolates in hospital wards.","authors":[{"name":"Danilo Yamamoto Thomaz"},{"name":"João Nobrega de Almeida"},{"name":"Glaucia Moreira Espindola Lima"},{"name":"Maína de Oliveira Nunes"},{"name":"Carlos Henrique Camargo"},{"name":"Rafaella de Carvalho Grenfell"},{"name":"Gil Benard"},{"name":"Gilda M B Del Negro"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida parapsilosis"},{"word":"ERG11"},{"word":"antifungal susceptibility"},{"word":"azole"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"candidemia"},{"word":"genotyping"},{"word":"resistance"}]},"article344":{"pmid":"30568640","title":"An Update on the Evolution of Glucosyltransferase (Gtf) Genes in Streptococcus.","abs":"In many caries-promoting Streptococcus species, glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) are recognized as key enzymes contributing to the modification of biofilm structures, disruption of homeostasis of healthy microbiota community and induction of caries development. It is therefore of great interest to investigate how Gtf genes have evolved in Streptococcus. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive survey of Gtf genes among 872 streptococci genomes of 37 species and identified Gtf genes from 364 genomes of 18 species. To clarify the relationships of these Gtf genes, 45 representative sequences were used for phylogenic analysis, which revealed two clear clades. Clade I included 12 Gtf genes from nine caries-promoting species of the Mutans and Downei groups, which produce enzymes known to synthesize sticky, water-insoluble glucans (WIG) that are critical for modifying biofilm structures. Clade II primarily contained Gtf genes responsible for synthesizing water-soluble glucans (WSG) from all 18 species, and this clade further diverged into three subclades (IIA, IIB, and IIC). An analysis of 16 pairs of duplicated Gtf genes revealed high divergence levels at the C-terminal repeat regions, with ratios of the non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) to synonymous substitution rate (dS) ranging from 0.60 to 1.03, indicating an overall relaxed constraint in this region. However, among the clade I Gtf genes, some individual repeat units possessed strong functional constraints by the same criterion. Structural variations in the repeat regions were also observed, with detection of deletions or recent duplications of individual repeat units. Overall, by establishing an updated phylogeny and further elucidating their evolutionary patterns, this work enabled us to gain a greater understanding of the origination and divergence of Gtf genes in Streptococcus.","authors":[{"name":"Rong-Rong Xu"},{"name":"Wei-Dong Yang"},{"name":"Ke-Xin Niu"},{"name":"Bin Wang"},{"name":"Wen-Mei Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus"},{"word":"duplication"},{"word":"evolution"},{"word":"glucosyltransferase gene (Gtf)"},{"word":"selection"}]},"article345":{"pmid":"30568441","title":"Silica-gentamicin nanohybrids: combating antibiotic resistance, bacterial biofilms, and in vivo toxicity.","abs":"Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern in health care.

Recent studies have shown that a variety of enteric pathogens are able to colonize plant surfaces by forming biofilms and thereby persist for long periods, which can subsequently lead to human infections. Therefore, biofilm formation by enteric pathogens on plants poses a risk to human health. Here, we deciphered the roles of YcfR in biofilm formation by Salmonella enterica. YcfR is a putative outer membrane protein associated with bacterial stress responses. The lack of YcfR facilitated the formation of multicellular aggregates on cabbage leaves as well as glass surfaces while reducing bacterial motility. ycfR deletion caused extensive structural alterations in the outer membrane, primarily in lipopolysaccharides, outer membrane proteins, cellulose, and curli fimbria, thereby increasing cell surface hydrophobicity. However, the absence of YcfR rendered Salmonella susceptible to stressful treatments, despite the increased multicellular aggregation. These results suggest that YcfR is an essential constituent of Salmonella outer membrane architecture and its absence may cause multifaceted structural changes, thereby compromising bacterial envelope integrity. In this context, YcfR may be further exploited as a potential target for controlling Salmonella persistence on plants.","authors":[{"name":"Seul I Kim"},{"name":"Hyunjin Yoon"}],"keywords":[]},"article349":{"pmid":"30565778","title":"Multifunctional nanocarriers for the treatment of periodontitis: Immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and regenerative strategies.","abs":"Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease, in which the host immuno-inflammatory response against the dysbiotic subgingival biofilm leads to the breakdown of periodontal tissues.

Clinical oral examinations of dental caries status and visible plaque index were carried out at three follow-up time points. Pooled supragingival plaque biofilm samples were also collected at ages 12, 18, and 24 months. Plaque biofilm DNA was extracted and analyzed by MiSeq sequencing. A total of 18 toddlers completed three follow-ups. At 12 months of age, all the toddlers only had eruption of the anterior teeth, without dental caries. At ages 18 and 24 months, one and two toddlers showed two and three teeth with carious white spots, respectively. Depth, Good's coverage, and sample size of sequencing were reasonable. The dominant bacterial genera in the oral cavity of 12-month-old toddlers were Capnocytophaga, Neisseria, Streptococcus, Kingella, and Leptotrichia; the oral microflora composition was relatively stable by 18 months of age and included unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, Selenomonas, Prevotella, Leptotrichia, and Veillonella as the dominant genera; unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus, Neisseria, Leptotrichia, and Selenomonas were the dominant genera by 24 months.

When a prolonged incubation period (48 h) was applied for those 8 MRSA strains, an increased biofilm biomass accumulation was observed during the time course, whereas the number of viable cells within the biofilms decreased as the biomass increased. The capacity of biofilm production correlated pretty well between the experiments using polystyrene microtiter plates and stainless steel micro-well plates, and significant higher values were observed in stainless steel when glucose was added to TSB during the enrichment.

In conclusion, our results confirm that MRSA isolates from foods of animal origin have significant capacity for forming biofilms with a high protein content, which can play a key role for the successful dissemination of MRSA lineages via food.

However, mechanisms how multiple stressors act on aquatic community structure and functioning are poorly understood. This is especially true for two important stressors types, hydrodynamic alterations and toxicants. Here we perform a mesocosm experiment in hydraulic flumes connected as a bypass to a natural stream to test the interactive effects of both factors on natural (inoculated from streams water) biofilms. Biofilms, i.e., the community of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms and their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in association with substratum, are key players in stream functioning. We hypothesized (i) that the tolerance of biofilms toward toxicants (the herbicide Prometryn) decreases with increasing hydraulic stress. As EPS is known as an absorber of chemicals, we hypothesize (ii) that the EPS to cell ratio correlates with both hydraulic stress and herbicide tolerance. Tolerance values were derived from concentration-response assays. Both, the herbicide tolerance and the biovolume of the EPS significantly correlated with the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), while the diversity of diatoms (the dominant group within the stream biofilms) increased with flow velocity. This indicates that the positive effect of TKE on community tolerance was mediated by turbulence-induced changes in the EPS biovolume. This conclusion was supported by a second experiment, showing decreasing effects of the herbicide to a diatom biofilm (Nitzschia palea) with increasing content of artificial EPS. We conclude that increasing hydrodynamic forces in streams result in an increasing tolerance of microbial communities toward chemical pollution by changes in EPS-mediated bioavailability of toxicants.","authors":[{"name":"Bastian H Polst"},{"name":"Christine Anlanger"},{"name":"Ute Risse-Buhl"},{"name":"Floriane Larras"},{"name":"Thomas Hein"},{"name":"Markus Weitere"},{"name":"Mechthild Schmitt-Jansen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PICT"},{"word":"autotrophic biofilm"},{"word":"microbial communities"},{"word":"multiple stressors"},{"word":"near-bed hydrodynamics"},{"word":"periphyton"}]},"article357":{"pmid":"30564204","title":"Multiple Strategies for Light-Harvesting, Photoprotection, and Carbon Flow in High Latitude Microbial Mats.","abs":"Microbial mats are ubiquitous in polar freshwater ecosystems and sustain high concentrations of biomass despite the extreme seasonal variations in light and temperature.

Other bacterial species have also been shown to respond to PQS, supporting a common biophysical mechanism. Here, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the specific interactions between PQS and a model P. aeruginosa OM at the atomistic scale. We discovered two characteristic states of PQS interacting with the biologically relevant membrane, namely attachment to the membrane surface and insertion into the lipid A leaflet. The hydrogen bonds between PQS and the lipid A phosphates drove the PQS-membrane association. An analysis of PQS trajectory and molecular conformation revealed sequential events critical for spontaneous insertion, including probing, docking, folding, and insertion. Remarkably, PQS bent its hydrophobic side chain into a closed conformation to lower the energy barrier for penetration through the hydrophilic headgroup zone of the lipid A leaflet, which was confirmed by the potential of mean force (PMF) measurements. Attachment and insertion were simultaneously observed in the simulation with multiple PQS molecules.

Ceragenins are non-peptide AMP mimics that overcome these shortcomings while retaining broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. To further characterize the antibacterial activities of ceragenins, their activities against a collection of environmental isolates of bacteria were determined. These isolates were isolated in Nigeria from plants and water. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of selected ceragenins and currently available antimicrobials against these isolates were measured to determine resistance patterns. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we examined the morphological changes in bacterial membranes following treatment with ceragenins. Finally, we investigated the effectiveness of ceragenins in inhibiting biofilm formation and destroying established biofilms. We found that, despite high resistance to many currently available antimicrobials, including colistin, environmental isolates in planktonic and biofilm forms remain susceptible to ceragenins.

The severity of fungal infection requires the discovery of novel antimycotics and the extensive application of combination strategy. In this study, a group of Candida standard and clinical strains including C. albicans as well as several NAC species were employed to evaluate the antifungal potentials of palmatine (PAL) alone and in combination with fluconazole (FLC)/itraconazole (ITR) by microdilution method, checkerboard assay, gram staining, spot assay, and rhodamine 6G efflux test. Subsequently, the expressions of transporter-related genes, namely CDR1, CDR2, MDR1, and FLU1 for C. albicans, CDR1 and MDR1 for Candida tropicalis and Candida parapsilosis, ABC1 and ABC2 for Candida krusei, CDR1, CDR2, and SNQ2 for Candida glabrata were analyzed by qRT-PCR.

The susceptibility results were also confirmed by gram staining and spot assay. After combinations, a vast quantity of rhodamine 6G could not be pumped out as considerably intracellular red fluorescence was accumulated. Meanwhile, the expressions of efflux-associated genes were evaluated and presented varying degrees of inhibition. These results indicated that PAL was a decent antifungal synergist to promote the antifungal efficacy of azoles (such as FLC and ITR), and the underlying antifungal mechanism might be linked with the inhibition of efflux pumps and the elevation of intracellular drug content.","authors":[{"name":"Tianming Wang"},{"name":"Jing Shao"},{"name":"Wenyue Da"},{"name":"Qianqian Li"},{"name":"Gaoxiang Shi"},{"name":"Daqiang Wu"},{"name":"Changzhong Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida species"},{"word":"efflux"},{"word":"fluconazole"},{"word":"itraconazole"},{"word":"palmatine"},{"word":"resistance"}]},"article374":{"pmid":"30559713","title":"The Emerging Role of Microbial Biofilm in Lyme Neuroborreliosis.","abs":"Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi in North America and Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii in Europe and Asia, respectively.

Upon biofilm dispersal, bacteria become more antibiotic susceptible but are also able to readily infect another host. Various studies have shown that low, nontoxic levels of nitric oxide (NO) may induce biofilm dispersal in many bacterial species. While the molecular details of this phenotype remain largely unknown, in several species, NO has been implicated in biofilm-to-planktonic cell transitions via ligation to 1 of 2 characterized NO sensors, NosP or H-NOX. Based on the data available to date, it appears that NO binding to H-NOX or NosP triggers a downstream response based on changes in cellular cyclic di-GMP concentrations and/or the modulation of quorum sensing. In order to develop applications for control of biofilm infections, the identification and characterization of biofilm dispersal mechanisms is vital.

Dopamine polymerization was initiated during swelling of the hydrogels, which provided dopamine and pMPC an osmotic driving force into the hydrogel interior. Both PEG and agar hydrogels were synthesized over a broad range of storage moduli (1.7,1300 kPa), which remained statistically equivalent after being functionalized with pMPC and polydopamine (PDA). When challenged with fibrinogen, a model blood-clotting protein, the pMPC/PDA-functionalized PEG and agar hydrogels displayed a >90% reduction in protein adsorption compared to hydrogel controls. Further, greater than an order-of-magnitude reduction in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus adherence was observed. This study demonstrates a versatile materials platform to enhance the fouling resistance of hydrogels through a pMPC/PDA incorporation strategy that is independent of the chemical composition and network structure of the original hydrogel.","authors":[{"name":"Kristopher W Kolewe"},{"name":"Kerianne M Dobosz"},{"name":"Todd Emrick"},{"name":"Stephen S Nonnenmann"},{"name":"Jessica D Schiffman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifouling"},{"word":"Dopamine"},{"word":"Hydrogel"},{"word":"Microorganism"},{"word":"Poly(ethylene glycol)"},{"word":"Zwitterion"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"30556001","title":"Electricity Generation from Rice Bran by a Microbial Fuel Cell and the Influence of Hydrodynamic Cavitation Pretreatment.","abs":"Single-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were constructed using rice bran (carbon source) and pond bottom mud (microbial source).

Here, we compare the effects of long-term exposure of stream biofilms to diuron, a commonly used herbicide, on several traditional ecotoxicological endpoints (biomass growth, photosynthetic efficiency, chlorophyll-a content, and taxonomic composition), with the effects measured by recently developed methods [community structure assessed by flow cytometry (FC-CS) and measurement of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)]. Biofilms grown from local stream water in recirculating microcosms were exposed to a constant concentration of 20 μg/L diuron over a period of 3 weeks. During the experiment, we observed temporal variation in photosynthetic efficiency, biomass, cell size, presence of decaying cells and in the EPS protein fraction. While biomass growth, photosynthetic efficiency, and chlorophyll-a content were treatment independent, the effects of diuron were detectable with both FC and EPS measurements.

In this paper, we dismissed the significance of Rana box in the natural nigrocin-HL identified from skin secretion of Hylarana latouchii by comparing its activity with nigrocin-HLD without the motif. By substituting the Rana box sequence with an amidated phenylalanine residue, the natural peptide was modified into a shorter AMP nigrocin-HLM. Activities and toxicities of these two peptides in vitro and in vivo were compared. As a result, nigrocin-HLM not only displayed significantly increased potency against several representative microbes, but also high activity against the antibiotic-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, NCTC 12493 and ATCC43300 and several clinical isolates) as evidenced by markedly reduced minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC). More strikingly, nigrocin-HLM exhibited prominent inhibition against MRSA infection in a pneumonia mice model. In addition, the substitution attenuated the toxicity of nigrocin-HLM as evidenced by precipitously decreased hemolytic and cytotoxic activities in vitro, and acute toxicity to mice in vivo. Taken these results into consideration, nigrocin-HLM should be a promising therapeutic candidate for anti-infection.

They were represented by the reference strains of Corynebacterium striatum ATCC 6940 and C. amycolatum ATCC 700207. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the biofilm produced by the antibiotic-susceptible C. striatum strain was evaluated using three concentrations of the antimicrobial agent (2 ×, 4 ×, and 6 × the MIC - the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration). The basis for the interpretation of results was the statistical analysis of maximum points readings from the surface comprising a total of 245 areas of the biofilm image under the confocal microscope. It was observed that ciprofloxacin at a concentration equal to 4 × MIC paradoxically caused an enlargement of areas with live bacteria within the biofilm. Biofilm destruction required the application of ciprofloxacin at a concentration higher than 6 × MIC. This suggests that the use of relatively low doses of antimicrobial agents may increase the number of live bacteria within the biofilm, and further facilitate their detachment from the biofilm's structure thus leading to the spread of bacteria into the bloodstream or to the neighboring tissues. The method of biofilm analysis presented here provides the original and novel approach to the investigation of the diphtheroid biofilms and their interaction with antimicrobial agents.","authors":[{"name":"Alina Olender"},{"name":"Agnieszka Bogut"},{"name":"Agnieszka Magryś"},{"name":"Katarzyna Król-Turmińska"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Corynebacterium amycolatum"},{"word":"Corynebacterium striatum, biofilm"},{"word":"ciprofloxacin"},{"word":"confocal microscopy"}]},"article413":{"pmid":"30550129","title":"[Involvement of Th17/Treg imbalance in bacterial biofilm induced chronic rhinosinusitis].","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"H Li"},{"name":"X C Sun"},{"name":"Q Liu"},{"name":"Y Q Li"},{"name":"L Hu"},{"name":"H P Yu"},{"name":"D H Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":" laser confocal microscope"},{"word":"Th17/Treg cell"},{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"sinusitis"}]},"article414":{"pmid":"30549406","title":"Dual Therapy Coating on Micro/Nanoscale Porous Polyetheretherketone to Eradicate Biofilms and Accelerate Bone Tissue Repair.","abs":"Defective osteogenesis and latent infections continue to be two major issues in the therapy of bone tissue regeneration.

Eradication of these infections is challenging due to the elevated tolerance of biofilm cells against antimicrobial agents. In this study, we developed an antibiofilm coating consisting of 5-(4-bromophenyl)-N-cyclopentyl-1-octyl-1H-imidazol-2-amine, designated as LC0024, covalently bound to a titanium implant surface (LC0024-Ti). We showed in vitro that the LC0024-Ti surface reduces biofilm formation of S. aureus in a specific manner without reducing the planktonic cells above the biofilm, as evaluated by plate counting and fluorescence microscopy. The advantage of compounds that only inhibit biofilm formation without affecting the viability of the planktonic cells, is that reduced development of bacterial resistance is expected. To determine the antibiofilm activity of LC0024-Ti surfaces in vivo, a biomaterial-associated murine infection model was used. The results indicated a significant reduction in S. aureus biofilm formation (up to 96%) on the LC0024-Ti substrates compared to pristine titanium controls. Additionally, we found that the LC0024-Ti substrates did not affect the attachment and proliferation of human cells involved in osseointegration and bone repair. In summary, our results emphasize the clinical potential of covalent coatings of LC0024 on titanium implant surfaces to reduce the risk of orthopedic implant infections. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the early stationary phase of planktonic cultures, CalY was located at the bacterial cell-surface, as shown by immunodetection. Deletion of calY revealed that this protein plays a major role in adhesion to HeLa epithelial cells, to the insect Galleria mellonella hemocytes and in the bacterial virulence against larvae of this insect, suggesting that CalY is a cell-surface adhesin. In mid-stationary phase and in biofilms, the location of CalY shifted from the cell surface to the extracellular medium, where it was found as fibers.

Understanding how S. suis colonizes and interacts with its hosts is relevant for future strategies of drug and vaccine development. As with other Gram-positive bacteria, S. suis utilizes enzymes known as sortases to attach specific proteins bearing cell wall sorting signals to its surface, where they can play a role in host-pathogen interactions. The surface proteins of bacteria are often important in adhesion to and invasion of host cells. In this study, markerless in-frame deletion mutants of the housekeeping sortase srtA and the two pilus-associated sortases, srtB and srtF, were generated and their importance in S. suis infections was investigated. We found that all three of these sortases are essential to disease in pigs, concluding that their cognate-sorted proteins may also be useful in protecting pigs against infection.","authors":[{"name":"Alexandra Faulds-Pain"},{"name":"Helen Alexandra Shaw"},{"name":"Vanessa Sofia Terra"},{"name":"Steven Kellner"},{"name":"Susan L Brockmeier"},{"name":"Brendan W Wren"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Sortase"},{"word":"Streptococcus suis"},{"word":"pili"},{"word":"type C sortases"}]},"article436":{"pmid":"30543027","title":"Subgingival lipid A profile and endotoxin activity in periodontal health and disease.","abs":"Regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) chemical composition, particularly its lipid A domain, is an important, naturally occurring mechanism that drives bacteria-host immune system interactions into either a symbiotic or pathogenic relationship.

Precise quantification of endogenous miRNAs from different clinical patient and control samples combined with a one-to-one comparison to standard technologies is a challenging but necessary endeavor that is largely neglected by many emerging fluorescence technologies. Here, we present a simple, precise, sensitive, and specific ratiometric assay for absolute quantification of miRNAs. Isothermally amplified time-gated Förster resonance energy transfer (TG-FRET) between Tb donors and dye acceptors resulted in miRNA assays with single-nucleotide variant specificity and detection limits down to 4.2 ± 0.5 attomoles. Quantification of miR-21 from human tissues and plasma samples revealed the relevance for breast and ovarian cancer diagnostics. Analysis of miR-132 and miR-146a from acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) demonstrated the broad applicability to different miRNAs and other types of clinical samples. Direct comparison to the gold standard RT-qPCR showed advantages of amplified TG-FRET concerning precision and specificity when quantifying low concentrations of miRNAs as required for diagnostic applications. Our results demonstrate that a careful implementation of rolling circle amplification and TG-FRET into one straightforward nucleic acid detection method can significantly advance the possibilities of miRNA-based cancer diagnostics and research.","authors":[{"name":"Xue Qiu"},{"name":"Jingyue Xu"},{"name":"Jiajia Guo"},{"name":"Akram Yahia-Ammar"},{"name":"Nikiforos-Ioannis Kapetanakis"},{"name":"Isabelle Duroux-Richard"},{"name":"Julia J Unterluggauer"},{"name":"Nicole Golob-Schwarzl"},{"name":"Christophe Regeard"},{"name":"Catherine Uzan"},{"name":"Sébastien Gouy"},{"name":"Michael DuBow"},{"name":"Johannes Haybaeck"},{"name":"Florence Apparailly"},{"name":"Pierre Busson"},{"name":"Niko Hildebrandt"}],"keywords":[]},"article439":{"pmid":"30542333","title":"Characterization of the Desiccation Tolerance of Cronobacter sakazakii Strains.","abs":"Strong desiccation tolerance is an outstanding feature of Cronobacter sakazakii and can enable the bacterium to survive in a dry food matrix (such as milk powder) for a long time. Therefore, contamination of food possessing low water activity with C. sakazakii can increase the risk of infection in human beings, particularly in neonates and infants. However, the mechanism underlying the desiccation tolerance property of C. sakazakii is largely unknown. In this study, the desiccation tolerance characteristics of 42 C. sakazakii strains were analyzed. Simultaneously, the sequence types and biofilm formation abilities of the strains were investigated, and their correlations with desiccation tolerance were analyzed. The results showed no significant correlation between desiccation tolerance and sequence type. However, there was a positive correlation between biofilm formation ability and desiccation tolerance. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the biofilm formed by strains with distinct desiccation tolerance levels, and the results showed that the levels of polysaccharide, proteins and carotenoid might play important roles in the resistance to dry environments. In addition, 10 genes involved in osmoprotectant synthesis or transport were selected, and their differential expression in strains with diverse desiccation tolerance levels was compared to investigate whether these genes were responsible for cytoprotection in the dry environment. The results revealed a great difference in gene expression among strains with different desiccation tolerance levels, suggesting that these genes play a regulatory role in the resistance of C. sakazakii to dry environments. Our study provides a useful reference for follow-up studies investigating the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in C. sakazakii.","authors":[{"name":"Xin-Jun Du"},{"name":"Xiao-Yi Wang"},{"name":"Xuan Dong"},{"name":"Ping Li"},{"name":"Shuo Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cronobacter sakazakii"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"desiccation tolerance"},{"word":"desiccation tolerance related genes"},{"word":"multilocus sequence typing"}]}}
