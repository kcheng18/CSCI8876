The biofilm system was cultivated monoseptically in a continuous mode for more than 3 weeks. The higher cell densities that could be obtained in the continuous biofilm system compared with the planktonic culture led to a significantly increased space-time yield. The productivity reached 80% of the maximum value 10 days after start-up and no subsequent decline was observed, confirming the suitability of the system for long-term fermentation. The analysis of biofilm performance revealed that productivity increases with the flow velocity. This is explained by the reduced retention time of the liquid phase in the reactor, and, thus, a minor pH drop caused by the released lactic acid. At low flow velocities, the pH drops to a value where growth and production are significantly inhibited. The biofilm was visualized by magnetic resonance imaging to analyze biofilm thickness.

Here, bulk water and benthic biofilms were sampled from three Hong Kong streams having various pollution profiles, and subsequently compared via high-resolution microscopy, metagenomic analysis, and analytical chemistry. The results indicated that biofilms were, indeed, reservoirs of environmental pollutants, having different profiles compared with that of the corresponding bulk water samples. Moreover, the results also suggested that biofilms sampled in polluted areas were characterized by a higher species richness.

The protocol begins with an adapted commercial 3D printer in which the extruder has been replaced with a bio-ink dispenser connected to a syringe pump system enabling a controllable, continuous flow of bio-ink. To develop a bio-ink suitable for biofilm printing, engineered Escherichia coli bacteria were suspended in a solution of alginate, so that they solidify in contact with a surface containing calcium. The inclusion of an inducer chemical within the printing substrate drives expression of biofilm proteins within the printed bio-ink. This method enables 3D printing of various spatial patterns composed of discrete layers of printed biofilms. Such spatially-controlled biofilms can serve as model systems and can find applications in multiple fields that have a wide-ranging impact on society, including antibiotic resistance prevention or drinking water purification, among others.","authors":[{"name":"Ewa M Spiesz"},{"name":"Kui Yu"},{"name":"Benjamin A E Lehner"},{"name":"Dominik T Schmieden"},{"name":"Marie-Eve Aubin-Tam"},{"name":"Anne S Meyer"}],"keywords":[]},"article29":{"pmid":"31157229","title":"Detailed Soluble Proteome Analyses of a Dairy-Isolated Enterococcus faecalis: A Possible Approach to Assess Food Safety and Potential Probiotic Value.","abs":"Enterococci are common inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals and thanks to their capability to tolerate different environmental conditions and their high rates of gene transfer, they are able to colonize various ecological niches, as food matrices. Enterococcus faecalis bacteria are defined as controversial microorganisms. From one side they are used as food starters, bio-control agents and probiotics to improve human or animal health. From the other side, in the last two decades enterococci have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens, because bearing high-level of resistance to antibiotics and several putative virulence factors. In this study, the soluble proteome quantitation data (LC-MS/MS) of the food-isolated strain E. faecalis D27 (dairy-isolate) was compared with the soluble proteome quantitation data of the pathogenic E. faecalis UW3114 (urinary tract infection isolate) and with the one of the health promoting strain E. faecalis Symbioflor1, respectively. The comparison of cytosolic protein expression profiles highlighted statistically significant changes in the abundance of proteins mainly involved in specific metabolic pathways, nutrient transport, stress response, and cell wall modulation. Moreover, especially in the dairy isolate and the clinical isolate, several proteins with potential pathogenic implications were found, such as serine proteases, von Willebrand factor, serine hydrolase with beta lactamase activity, efflux transporter, and proteins involved in horizontal gene transfer. The analysis of the extracellular proteome provided interesting results concerning proteins involved in bacterial communication, such as pheromones and conjugative elements and also proteins able to interact with human components. The phenotypic characterization evaluating (i) biofilm formation (ii) hemolytic activity on blood agar plates (iii) protease activity (iv) gelatinase (v) antibiotic resistance pattern, enabled us to elucidate the risks associated with the poor characterized foodborne E. faecalis D27.","authors":[{"name":"Simona Cirrincione"},{"name":"Bernd Neumann"},{"name":"Daniela Zühlke"},{"name":"Katharina Riedel"},{"name":"Enrica Pessione"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"foodborne bacteria"},{"word":"gel-free proteomics"},{"word":"host interaction"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article30":{"pmid":"31157178","title":"Glutathione Activates Type III Secretion System Through Vfr in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant antioxidant in all living organisms.

In this study, a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of the GSH-deficient mutant ΔgshAΔgshB was used to elucidate the role of GSH in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa. The data show that the expression of genes in T3SS, type VI secretion system (T6SS) and some regulatory genes were impaired.

Under T3SS inducing conditions, GSH enhanced the expression of T3SS in both wild-type PAO1 and ΔgshAΔgshB, but not in Δvfr. Genetic complementation of Δvfr restored the ability of GSH to induce the expression of T3SS genes.

Many LOS structures are controlled by phase variation mediated by random slipped-strand base mispairing, which can reversibly switch gene expression on or off. Phase variation diversifies the LOS, however its adaptive role is not well-understood. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an important pathogen that causes a range of illnesses in the upper and lower respiratory tract. In NTHi a phase variable galactosyltransferase encoded by lic2A initiates galactose chain extension of the LOS outer core. The donor substrate for Lic2A, UDP-galactose, is generated from UDP-glucose by UDP-galactose epimerase encoded by galE. Our previous fitness profiling of H. influenzae mutants in a murine lung model showed that the galE mutant had a severe survival defect, while the lic2A mutant's defect was modest, leading us to postulate that unidentified factors act as suppressors of potential defects in a lic2A mutant. Herein we conducted a genome-wide genetic interaction screen to identify genes epistatic on lic2A for survival in the murine lung. An unexpected finding was that galE mutants exhibited restored virulence properties in a lic2A mutant background. We identified an alternative antibody epitope generated by Lic2A in the galE mutant that increased sensitivity to classical complement mediated killing in human serum. Deletion of lic2A or restoration of UDP-galactose synthesis alleviated the galE mutant's virulence defects. These studies indicate that when deprived of its galactosyl substrate, Lic2A acquires an alternative activity leading to increased recognition of NTHi by IgM and decreased survival in the lung model. Biofilm formation was increased by deletion of galE and by increased availability of UDP-GlcNAc precursors that can compete with UDP-galactose production. NTHi's ability to reversibly inactivate lic2A by phase-variation may influence survival in niches of infection in which UDP-Galactose levels are limiting.","authors":[{"name":"Sandy M Wong"},{"name":"Mary Darby Jackson"},{"name":"Brian J Akerley"}],"keywords":[{"word":"HITS"},{"word":"Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"NTHi"},{"word":"Tn-seq"},{"word":"immune evasion"},{"word":"lipooligosaccharide (LOS)"},{"word":"lung infection"}]},"article32":{"pmid":"31156716","title":"Emergence of three-dimensional order and structure in growing biofilms.","abs":"Surface-attached bacterial biofilms are self-replicating active liquid crystals and the dominant form of bacterial life on earth (1-4). In conventional liquid crystals and solid-state materials, the interaction potentials between the molecules that comprise the system determine the material properties. However, for growth-active biofilms it is unclear whether potential-based descriptions can account for the experimentally observed morphologies, and which potentials would be relevant. Here, we overcame previous limitations of single-cell imaging techniques (5,6) to reconstruct and track all individual cells inside growing three-dimensional (3D) biofilms with up to 10,000 individuals. Based on these data, we identify, constrain, and provide a microscopic basis for an effective cell-cell interaction potential, which captures and predicts the growth dynamics, emergent architecture, and local liquid crystalline order of Vibrio cholerae biofilms. Furthermore, we show how external fluid flows control the microscopic structure and 3D morphology of biofilms. Our analysis implies that local cellular order and global biofilm architecture in these active bacterial communities can arise from mechanical cell-cell interactions, which cells can modulate by regulating the production of particular matrix components. These results establish an experimentally validated foundation for improved continuum theories of active matter and thereby contribute to solving the important problem of controlling biofilm growth.","authors":[{"name":"Raimo Hartmann"},{"name":"Praveen K Singh"},{"name":"Philip Pearce"},{"name":"Rachel Mok"},{"name":"Boya Song"},{"name":"Francisco Díaz-Pascual"},{"name":"Jörn Dunkel"},{"name":"Knut Drescher"}],"keywords":[]},"article33":{"pmid":"31156635","title":"IL-1β Promotes Staphylococcus aureus Biofilms on Implants in vivo.","abs":"Implant associated infections represent a serious health burden in clinics since some microorganisms are able to colonize biological surfaces or surfaces of indwelling medical devices and form biofilms.

Little is known regarding the role of the immune system in the formation of biofilms during implant associated infections, largely due to the lack of suitable mouse models. Here we use colonized osmotic pumps in mice to study the interaction of an activated immune system with biofilm-forming Staphylococcus aureus encoding Gaussia luciferase. This approach permits biofilm formation on the osmotic pumps in living animals. It also allows the continuous supply of soluble immune cell activating agents, such as cytokines to study their effect on biofilm formation in vivo. Using non-invasive imaging of the bioluminescent signal emitted by the lux expressing bacteria for quantification of bacterial load in conjunction with light and electron microscopy, we observed that pump-supplied pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β strongly increased biofilm formation along with a massive influx of neutrophils adjacent to the biofilm-coated pumps.

XTT reduction assay showed that SK could not only inhibit the formation of biofilms but also destroy the maintenance of mature biofilms. In a mouse vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) model, the fungal burden was remarkably reduced upon SK treatment. Further study showed that SK could inhibit hyphae formation and reduce cellular surface hydrophobicity (CSH). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that several hypha- and adhesion-specific genes were differentially expressed in SK-treated biofilm, including the downregulation of ECE1, HWP1, EFG1, CPH1, RAS1, ALS1, ALS3, CSH1 and upregulation of TUP1, NRG1, BCR1. Moreover, SK induced the production of farnesol, a quorum sensing molecule, and exogenous addition of farnesol enhanced the antibiofilm activity of SK.

We propose that the presence of probiotics causes shifts in bacterial community structure in rearing tanks, leading to a net decrease in the relative abundance of potential pathogens. During three trials spanning the 2012-2015 hatchery seasons, larvae, tank biofilm, and rearing water samples were collected from control and probiotic-treated tanks in an oyster hatchery over a 12-day period after spawning. Samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing of the V4 or V6 regions followed by taxonomic classification, in order to determine bacterial community structures. There were significant differences in bacterial composition over time and between sample types, but no major effect of probiotics on the structure and diversity of bacterial communities (phylum level, Bray-Curtis k = 2, 95% confidence). Probiotic treatment, however, led to a higher relative percent abundance of Oceanospirillales and Bacillus spp. in water and oyster larvae. In the water, an increase in Vibrio spp. diversity in the absence of a net increase in relative read abundance suggests a likely decrease in the abundance of specific pathogenic Vibrio spp., and therefore lower chances of a disease outbreak. Co-occurrence network analysis also suggests that probiotic treatment had a systemic effect on targeted members of the bacterial community, leading to a net decrease in potentially pathogenic species.","authors":[{"name":"Rebecca J Stevick"},{"name":"Saebom Sohn"},{"name":"Tejashree H Modak"},{"name":"David R Nelson"},{"name":"David C Rowley"},{"name":"Karin Tammi"},{"name":"Roxanna Smolowitz"},{"name":"Kathryn Markey Lundgren"},{"name":"Anton F Post"},{"name":"Marta Gómez-Chiarri"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA sequencing analysis"},{"word":"Crassostrea virginica"},{"word":"Vibrio"},{"word":"larvae"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"oyster hatchery"},{"word":"probiotics"}]},"article36":{"pmid":"31156582","title":"Genomic Epidemiology and Phenotyping Reveal on-Farm Persistence and Cold Adaptation of Raw Milk Outbreak-Associated Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.","abs":"Packaged raw milk contaminated with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis mediated a large yersiniosis outbreak in southern Finland in 2014.

Here we explore risk factors leading to the outbreak through epidemiologic investigation of the outbreak farm and through genomic and phenotypic characterization of the farm's outbreak and non-outbreak associated Y. pseudotuberculosis strains. We show that the outbreak strain persisted on the farm throughout the 7-month study, whereas the non-outbreak strains occurred sporadically. Phylogenomic analysis illustrated that the outbreak strain was related to previously published genomes of wild animal isolates from Finland, implying that wild animals were a potential source of the outbreak strain to the farm. We observed allelic differences between the farm's outbreak and non-outbreak strains in several genes associated with virulence, stress response and biofilm formation, and found that the outbreak strain formed biofilm in vitro and maintained better growth fitness during cold stress than the non-outbreak strains. Finally, we demonstrate the rapid growth of the outbreak strain in packaged raw milk during refrigerated storage. This study provides insight of the risk factors leading to the Y. pseudotuberculosis outbreak, highlights the importance of pest control to avoid the spread of pathogens from wild to domestic animals, and demonstrates that the cold chain is insufficient as the sole risk management strategy to control Y. pseudotuberculosis risk associated with raw drinking milk.","authors":[{"name":"Hanna Castro"},{"name":"Anniina Jaakkonen"},{"name":"Anna Hakakorpi"},{"name":"Marjaana Hakkinen"},{"name":"Joana Isidro"},{"name":"Hannu Korkeala"},{"name":"Miia Lindström"},{"name":"Saija Hallanvuo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"comparative genomics"},{"word":"food safety"},{"word":"growth modeling"},{"word":"phylogenomics"},{"word":"raw milk"},{"word":"stress tolerance"},{"word":"whole genome sequencing"}]},"article37":{"pmid":"31156568","title":"Salmonella Establishment in Agricultural Soil and Colonization of Crop Plants Depend on Soil Type and Plant Species.","abs":"Human pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella enterica, are able to colonize crop plants.

In this study, we investigated the effects of soil type, organic fertilization, plant species and the way of Salmonella entry into the plant production system, on the survival of S. enterica in soil as well as the colonization of plants. The selected S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028s, S. Typhimurium strain LT2 and S. Senftenberg were able to persist in soil for several weeks. Salmonella's persistence in soil was prolonged in loamy, if compared to sandy soil, and when applied together with organic fertilizer. The leaves of lettuce and corn salad were colonized by S. enterica providing evidence for internalization from the soil via the root. Colonization rates were affected by soil type, plant species and S. enterica strain. Overall, S. enterica was detected in leaves of 0.5-0.9% of the plants, while lettuce was more frequently colonized than corn salad. Plants grown in sandy soil were more often colonized than plants grown in loamy soil. After spray inoculation, S. enterica could be detected on and in leaves for several weeks by cultivation-depending methods, confirmed by confocal microscopy using GFP-labeled S. Typhimurium 14028s. On the one hand, transcriptome data from S. Typhimurium 14028s assessed in response to lettuce medium or lettuce root exudates showed an upregulation of genes associated with biofilm formation and virulence. On the other hand, lettuce inoculated with S. Typhimurium 14028s showed a strong upregulation of genes associated with plant immune response and genes related to stress response. In summary, these results showed that organic fertilizers can increase the persistence of Salmonella in soil and that soil type and plant species play a crucial role in the interactions between human pathogens and crop plants.

We found that mild heat stress extended the period of hyphal stage maintenance in C. albicans biofilm. Although the rate of hyphal change from yeast form to hyphal form reached the maximum within 3 hr, later, almost every cell quickly reverted to the yeast growth phase within 6 hr at 37°C but not at 39°C, or under mild heat stress. Electron microscopy using a smart specimen preparation technique revealed that mild heat stress significantly increased the thickness of the inner cell wall accompanied by a decrease in density of the outer cell wall in the hyphae of C. albicans biofilm. To identify the gene responsible for the morphological changes associated with mild heat stress, we performed microarray gene expression analysis. Eleven genes were upregulated and 17 genes were downregulated under mild heat stress in biofilm cells. The increased PHR1 gene expression in response to mild heat stress was confirmed in quantitative RT-PCR analysis.

Speciation and quantity of DBPs generated rely heavily on the material characteristics, solution chemistry conditions, and operating factors. For example, quaternary ammonium polymer coagulants can increase concentrations of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) to above the California notification level (10 ng/L). Meanwhile, the application of strong base ion-exchange resins has been associated with the formation of N-nitrosamines and trichloronitromethane up to concentrations of 400 ng/L and 9.0 μg/L, respectively. Organic compounds leaching from membranes and plastic and rubber pipes can generate high NDMA (180-450 ng/L) and chloral hydrate (∼12.4 μg/L) upon downstream disinfection. Activated carbon and membranes preferentially remove organic precursors over bromide, resulting in a higher proportion of brominated DBPs. Copper corrosion products (CCPs) accelerate the decay of disinfectants and increase the formation of halogenated DBPs. Chlorination of high bromide waters containing CCPs can form bromate at concentrations exceeding regulatory limits. Owing to the aforementioned concern for the drinking water quality, the application of these materials and reagents during drinking water treatment and distribution should be based on the removal of pollutants with consideration for balancing DBP formation during disinfection scenarios.

Studies on MK-7 every year show more and more magnificent benefits of it in preventing cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis to battling cancer cells, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Thus, it needs to be supplemented to daily diet for accumulative and long-term benefits. Chemical synthesis of MK-7 produces a significant cis-isomer form of it, which has no biological activity. Fortunately, due to its key role in electron transfer in bacteria, trans-MK-7 is biosynthesized by especially Gram-positive strains mainly Bacillus genus. Concordantly, MK-7 could be produced via solid or liquid state fermentation strategies. In either regime, when static fermentation is applied in the absence of agitation and aeration, operational issues arise such as heat and mass transfer inefficiencies. Thus, scaling up the process becomes a challenge. On the other hand, studies have indicated that biofilm and pellicle formation that occur in static fermentations are key characteristics for extracellular MK-7 secretion. Therefore, this review covers the most recent discoveries of the therapeutic properties of MK-7 and optimization attempts at increasing its biosynthesis in different media compositions and effective growth parameters as well as the cutting-edge use of biofilm reactors where B. subtilis cells have the infrastructures to form mature biofilm formations on plastic composite supports. Biofilm reactors therefore can provide robust extracellular MK-7 secretion while simultaneously enduring high agitation and aeration rates, which then address the scale-up and operational issues associated with static fermentation strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Mahdinia"},{"name":"Ali Demirci"},{"name":"Aydin Berenjian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Agitated bioreactors"},{"word":"Bacillus"},{"word":"Biofilm reactors"},{"word":"MK-7"},{"word":"Menaquinone-7"},{"word":"Microbial fermentation"},{"word":"vitamin K"}]},"article49":{"pmid":"31151767","title":"Direct microbial transformation of carbon dioxide to value-added chemicals: A comprehensive analysis and application potentials.","abs":"Carbon dioxide storage in petroleum and other geological reservoirs is an economical option for long-term separation of this gas from the atmosphere.

Therefore, staphylococcin antimicrobial activity against six strains of S. aureus isolated from cheese was tested aiming at their industrial application in biopreservation of Minas fresh (Frescal) cheese with reduced sodium content. Three staphylococcins were selected for these tests: Pep 5, aureocin A53 and lysostaphin. All three staphylococcins proved to be bacteriolytic against all six strains of S. aureus. The antimicrobial activity of the partially purified staphylococcins was subsequently investigated against strains S. aureus Q1 and QJ3 in cheese matrices (6.0 log CFU/g) with different NaCl contents (control, a 25% reduction, and a 50% reduction), kept under refrigeration at 4 °C, for 21 days. Both strains were shown to be of concern for food industry as they carry the SEA, SEB and SEH enterotoxin genes, and are resistant to β-lactam drugs and moderate biofilm formers when grown in TSB. When used singly, Pep5, aureocin A53 and lysostaphin reduced approximately 95%, 99% and 99.99% of the viable cell counts, respectively, irrespective of the sodium content of the cheese matrix. The combined action of aureocin A53 and Pep5 resulted in an additional and significant reduction (p < 0.05) of ~1.0 log CFU/g when compared with the reduction caused by the use of either one singly. The combined action of lysostaphin and aureocin A53 or lysostaphin and Pep5 resulted in a reduction similar to or slightly smaller (p > 0.05) than that observed when lysostaphin was employed singly. Lysostaphin also proved to reduce the number of the staphylococcal viable cells to a level (~ 2.0 log CFU/g) at which enterotoxin production should not reach a sufficient quantity to cause food poisoning. Therefore, lysostaphin may have a practical application in the food industry to control staphylococcal contamination of Minas fresh cheese with a sodium content reduced up to 50%, providing consumers with more safe options to reduce their intake of sodium.","authors":[{"name":"Felipe Miceli de Farias"},{"name":"Janaína Dos Santos Nascimento"},{"name":"Olinda Cabral da Silva Santos"},{"name":"Maria do Carmo de Freire Bastos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteriocin"},{"word":"Minas frescal cheese"},{"word":"Sodium content"},{"word":"Staphylococcin"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"}]},"article54":{"pmid":"31151056","title":"Biosynthesized silver nanoparticles for inhibition of antibacterial resistance and biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci.","abs":"The ability of a natural stabilizing and reducing agent on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) was explored using a rapid and single-pot biological reduction method using Nocardiopsis sp.

In the first stages of citrus canker cycle, bacteria encounter low water availability and osmotic stress that can affect their maintenance on plant surfaces. To examine such conditions, we conducted a proteome analysis of Xcc grown in culture medium supplemented with 0.25 M sodium chloride and compared it to control conditions. We found that salt stress induced changes in known stress-induced proteins and also revealed novel stress response proteins. Moreover, some of the bacterial processes associated with bacterial fitness and virulence were modified under salt stress conditions. In particular, swimming, twitching and surface motilities were decreased, while biofilm formation was increased under salt stress. Other adaptations to high salt included reduced bacterial size and increased survival of bacteria exposed to oxidative stress. Furthermore, expression of type III protein secretion system related genes were augmented under salt stress condition.

Within the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes persistent biofilm infection that is commonly treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics such as tobramycin. However, sublethal concentrations of this aminoglycoside were previously shown to increase biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa, but the underlying adaptive mechanisms still remain elusive. Herein, we combined confocal laser scanning microscope analyses, proteomics profiling, gene expression assays and phenotypic studies to unravel P. aeruginosa potential adaptive mechanisms in response to tobramycin exposure during biofilm growth. Under this condition, we show that the modified biofilm architecture is related at least in part to increased extracellular DNA (eDNA) release, most likely as a result of biofilm cell death. Furthermore, the activity of quorum sensing (QS) systems was increased, leading to higher production of QS signaling molecules. We also demonstrate upon tobramycin exposure an increase in expression of the PrrF small regulatory RNAs, as well as expression of iron uptake systems. Remarkably, biofilm biovolumes and eDNA relative abundances in pqs and prrF mutant strains decrease in the presence of tobramycin. Overall, our findings offer experimental evidences for a potential adaptive mechanism linking PrrF sRNAs, QS signaling, biofilm cell death, eDNA release, and tobramycin-enhanced biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. These specific adaptive mechanisms should be considered to improve treatment strategies against P. aeruginosa biofilm establishment in CF patients' lungs.","authors":[{"name":"Ali Tahrioui"},{"name":"Rachel Duchesne"},{"name":"Emeline Bouffartigues"},{"name":"Sophie Rodrigues"},{"name":"Olivier Maillot"},{"name":"Damien Tortuel"},{"name":"Julie Hardouin"},{"name":"Laure Taupin"},{"name":"Marie-Christine Groleau"},{"name":"Alain Dufour"},{"name":"Eric Déziel"},{"name":"Gerald Brenner-Weiss"},{"name":"Marc Feuilloley"},{"name":"Nicole Orange"},{"name":"Olivier Lesouhaitier"},{"name":"Pierre Cornelis"},{"name":"Sylvie Chevalier"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobials"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Pathogens"}]},"article59":{"pmid":"31148964","title":"Glyceryl trinitrate blocks staphyloxanthin and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus.","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is an important nosocomial bacterium that is responsible for a number of infections that may be fatal.

EPSs, the major component of the biofilm, mainly consist of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Because these biomolecules have a variety of hydrophilicities or hydrophobicities, the substrate covered with the biofilm shows different wettability from the initial state. To detect the biofilm formation, this study employed a liquid-squeezing-based wettability assessment method with a simple wettability index: the liquid-squeezed diameter of a smaller value indicates higher wettability. The method is based on the liquid-squeezing behaviour of a liquid that covers sample surfaces when an air-jet is applied. To form the biofilm, polystyrene surfaces were immersed and incubated in a water-circulated bioreactor that had collected microorganisms in ambient air. After the 14-d incubation, good formation of the biofilm on the surfaces was confirmed by staining with crystal violet. Although the contact angles of captive bubbles on the surfaces with the biofilm were unmeasurable, the liquid-squeezing method could distinguish between hydrophilic and hydrophobic initial surfaces with and without biofilm formation using the diameter of the liquid-squeezed area. The surface wettability is expected to be a promising property for in-situ detection of biofilm formation on a macroscopic scale.","authors":[{"name":"Nobuyuki Tanaka"},{"name":"Takeshi Kogo"},{"name":"Nobumitsu Hirai"},{"name":"Akiko Ogawa"},{"name":"Hideyuki Kanematsu"},{"name":"Junko Takahara"},{"name":"Akane Awazu"},{"name":"Nobuko Fujita"},{"name":"Yoshihide Haruzono"},{"name":"Shunji Ichida"},{"name":"Yo Tanaka"}],"keywords":[]},"article62":{"pmid":"31147297","title":"Effects of denture adhesives on growth and morphological transformation of Candida albicans.","abs":"We investigated the effects of denture adhesives (cream (Cr), powder (Po), and cushion (Cu)) on growth and adhesive-related morphological transformation of Candida albicans.

Still, very little is known about how the coexistence of multiple organisms impact the multispecies biofilm properties. In this study, we examined the behaviour of a dual-species biofilm at the air-liquid interface composed by two environmental bacteria: Bacillus licheniformis and a phenazine mutant of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Study of the planktonic and biofilm growths for each species revealed that P. fluorescens grew faster than B. licheniformis and no bactericidal effect from P. fluorescens was detected, suggesting that the growth kinetics could be the main factor in the dual-species biofilm composition. To validate this hypothesis, the single- and dual-species biofilm were characterized by biomass quantification, microscopy and rheology. Bacterial counts and microscale architecture analysis showed that both bacterial populations coexist in the mature pellicle, with a dominance of P. fluorescens. Real-time measurement of the dual-species biofilms' viscoelastic (i.e. mechanical) properties using interfacial rheology confirmed that P. fluorescens was the main contributor of the biofilm properties. Evaluation of the dual-species pellicle viscoelasticity at longer time revealed that the biofilm, after reaching a first equilibrium, created a stronger and more cohesive network. Interfacial rheology proves to be a unique quantitative technique, which combined with microscale imaging, contributes to the understanding of the time-dependent properties within a polymicrobial community at various stages of biofilm development.

Sharp debridement, a possible effective method for eliminating biofilms, can only be applied to the wound with visible necrotic tissue; thus, no option has been available for eliminating biofilms that are not accompanied by necrotic tissue. Wound blotting was recently developed to visualize biofilm noninvasively and quickly, and ultrasonic debridement is available for biofilm removal. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of biofilm-based wound care system (BWCS), a combination of wound blotting as a point-of-care testing and ultrasonic debridement, for promoting wound healing. Firstly, the cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the proportion of biofilm removal by ultrasonic debridement in pressure ulcers [Study 1]. Subsequently, the retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of BWCS for healing of chronic wounds [Study 2]. The proportions of wound healing between wounds treated with BWCS and those with standard care in the home-visiting clinic were compared by Kaplan-Meier curve, and the Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to assess the effect of BWCS on wound healing. In Study 1, the median of biofilm removal proportion was 38.9% (interquartile range, 12.9-68.0%) for pressure ulcers treated with standard care and 65.2% (41.1-78.8%) for those treated with ultrasonic debridement (p = 0.009). In Study 2, the proportion of wound healing within 90 days was significantly higher in wounds treated with BWCS than in those treated with standard care (p = 0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio of BWCS for wound healing was 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-15.0; p = 0.015).

Binding to FnIII repeats was mediated through conserved structural determinants present within the Scl1 globular domain and facilitated GAS adherence and biofilm formation. Isoforms of cellular fibronectin that contain extra domains A and B, as well as tenascin-C, are present for several days in the wound extracellular matrix. Scl1-FnIII binding is therefore an example of GAS adaptation to the host's wound environment. Similarly, cellular fibronectin isoforms and tenascin-C are present in the tumor microenvironment.

This is due to its unique ability to transform from a drug-tolerant planktonic to a more dangerous and treatment-resistant sessile life form, called biofilm. Recently, two derivatives of the frog skin antimicrobial peptide esculentin-1a, i.e. Esc(1-21) and its D-amino acids containing diastereomer Esc(1-21)-1c, were characterized for their powerful anti-Pseudomonal activity against both forms. Prevention of biofilm formation already in its early stages could be even more advantageous for counteracting infections induced by this bacterium. In this work, we studied how the diastereomer Esc(1-21)-1c can inhibit Pseudomonas biofilm formation in comparison to the parent peptide and two clinically-used conventional antibiotics, i.e. colistin and aztreonam, when applied at dosages below the minimal growth inhibitory concentration. Biofilm prevention was correlated to the peptides' ability to inhibit Pseudomonas motility and to reduce the production of virulent metabolites, for example, pyoverdine and rhamnolipids. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism underlying these activities was evaluated by studying the peptides' effect on the expression of key genes involved in the virulence and motility of bacteria, as well as by monitoring the peptides' binding to the bacterial signaling nucleotide ppGpp. Our results demonstrate that the presence of only two D-amino acids in Esc(1-21)-1c is sufficient to downregulate ppGpp-mediated expression of biofilm-associated genes, presumably as a result of higher peptide stability and therefore prolonged interaction with the nucleotide.

This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial action of cationic CIP-Cu complex in PA biofilms in terms of drug concentration and time. Two PA strains, PA01 and PA14, were grown to form biofilm layers in equilibrium with planktonic cells. Static parameters such as pyoverdine production by planktonic cells, enzymatic activity within biofilms, and biofilm biomass 24 h after the addition of CIP or CIP-Cu were evaluated. Also, the kinetic effects of CIP and CIP-Cu on biofilms were evaluated by bioluminescence kinetics using transgenic strains. No differences were observed between CIP and CIP-Cu in terms of efficacy against biofilms, validating the potential of using this complex to treat PA biofilms. Interestingly, CIP concentrations slightly below the MIC value against planktonic bacteria stimulated both virulence and biofilm PA01 production.

Specifically, we asked whether chemorepulsion from a self-produced quorum-sensing molecule, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), was sufficient to recapitulate biofilm growth and cellular organization observed for biofilms of Helicobacter pylori, a common bacterial resident of human stomachs. To carry out this modeling, we modified an existing platform, Individual-based Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator (iDynoMiCS), to incorporate three-dimensional chemotaxis, planktonic cells that could join or leave the biofilm structure, and cellular production of AI-2. We simulated biofilm growth of previously characterized H. pylori strains with various AI-2 production and sensing capacities. Using biologically plausible parameters, we were able to recapitulate both the variation in biofilm mass and cellular distributions observed with these strains. Specifically, the strains that were competent to chemotax away from AI-2 produced smaller and more heterogeneously spaced biofilms, whereas the AI-2 chemotaxis-defective strains produced larger and more homogeneously spaced biofilms.

We applied deep sequencing to profile luminal biofilms of 46 endobronchial stents removed from 20 subjects primarily with lung transplantation-associated airway compromise. Microbial communities were analyzed by bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker gene sequencing. Corynebacterium was the most common bacterial taxa across biofilm communities. Clustering analysis revealed three bacterial biofilm types: one low diversity and dominated by Corynebacterium; another was polymicrobial and characterized by Staphylococcus; and the third was polymicrobial and associated with Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, and Prevotella. Biofilm type was significantly correlated with stent material: covered metal with the Staphylococcus-type biofilm, silicone with the Corynebacterium-dominated biofilm, and uncovered metal with the polymicrobial biofilm. Subjects with sequential stents had frequent transitions between community types. Fungal analysis found Candida was most prevalent, Aspergillus was common and highly enriched in two of three stents associated with airway anastomotic dehiscence, and fungal taxa not typically considered pathogens were highly enriched in some stents. Thus, molecular analysis revealed a complex and dynamic endobronchial stent biofilm with three bacterial types that associate with stent material, a central role for Corynebacterium, and that both expected and unexpected fungi inhabit this unique niche. The current work provides a foundation for studies to investigate the relationship between stent biofilm composition and clinical outcomes, mechanisms of biofilm establishment, and strategies for improved stent technology and use in airway compromise.","authors":[{"name":"John E McGinniss"},{"name":"Ize Imai"},{"name":"Aurea Simon-Soro"},{"name":"Melanie C Brown"},{"name":"Vincent R Knecht"},{"name":"Laura Frye"},{"name":"Priyanka M Ravindran"},{"name":"Marisol I Dothard"},{"name":"Dylan A Wadell"},{"name":"Michael B Sohn"},{"name":"Hongzhe Li"},{"name":"Jason D Christie"},{"name":"Joshua M Diamond"},{"name":"Andrew R Haas"},{"name":"Anthony R Lanfranco"},{"name":"David M DiBardino"},{"name":"Frederic D Bushman"},{"name":"Ronald G Collman"}],"keywords":[]},"article96":{"pmid":"31141184","title":"Comparative proteomics analysis between biofilm and planktonic cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","abs":"Tuberculosis is highly persistent and displays phenotypic resistance to high concentrations of antimicrobials.

It is clearly illustrated how the accumulation of excreted metabolites (concomitant with the sodium build-up due to base dosing) has a severe effect on the biofilm structure and physiology. Under high accumulation (HA) conditions, some cells exhibit severe elongation while maintaining a cross-sectional diameter like the rod/cocci-shaped cells predominantly found in low accumulation (LA) conditions.

This complex group has been used for decades as a hodgepodge, including many taxonomically related species. More than 60 pathovars of P. syringae have been described based on distinct host ranges and disease symptoms they cause. These pathovars cause disease relying on an array of virulence mechanisms. However, P. syringae pv. syringae (Pss) is the most polyphagous bacterium in the P. syringae complex, based on its wide host range, that primarily affects woody and herbaceous host plants. In early 1990s, bacterial apical necrosis (BAN) of mango trees, a critical disease elicited by Pss in Southern Spain was described for the first time. Pss exhibits important epiphytic traits and virulence factors, which may promote its survival and pathogenicity in mango trees and in other plant hosts. Over more than two decades, Pss strains isolated from mango trees have been comprehensively investigated to elucidate the mechanisms that governs their epiphytic and pathogenic lifestyles. In particular, the vast majority of Pss strains isolated from mango trees produce an antimetabolite toxin, called mangotoxin, whose leading role in virulence has been clearly demonstrated. Moreover, phenotypic, genetic and phylogenetic approaches support that Pss strains producers of BAN symptoms on mango trees all belong to a single phylotype within phylogroup 2, are adapted to the mango host, and produce mangotoxin. Remarkably, a genome sequencing project of the Pss model strain UMAF0158 revealed the presence of other factors that may play major roles in its different lifestyles, such as the presence of two different type III secretion systems, two type VI secretion systems and an operon for cellulose biosynthesis. The role of cellulose in increasing mango leaf colonization and biofilm formation, and impairing virulence of Pss, suggests that cellulose may play a pivotal role with regards to the balance of its different lifestyles. In addition, 62-kb plasmids belonging to the pPT23A-family of plasmids (PFPs) have been strongly associated with Pss strains that inhabit mango trees. Further, complete sequence and comparative genomic analyses revealed major roles of PFPs in detoxification of copper compounds and ultraviolet radiation resistance, both improving the epiphytic lifestyle of Pss on mango surfaces. Hence, in this review we summarize the research that has been conducted on Pss by our research group to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the epiphytic and pathogenic lifestyle on mango trees.

During systemic infection of host trees, pathogen cells must rapidly respond to changes in their environment as they move through different host tissues that present distinct challenges and sources of nutrition. Growing evidence indicates that small RNAs (sRNAs) play an important role in disease progression as posttranscriptional regulators. The sRNA ArcZ positively regulates the motility phenotype and transcription of flagellar genes in E. amylovora Ea1189 yet is a direct repressor of translation of the flagellar master regulator, FlhD. We utilized transposon mutagenesis to conduct a forward genetic screen and identified suppressor mutations that increase motility in the Ea1189ΔarcZ mutant background. This enabled us to determine that the mechanism of transcriptional activation of the flhDC mRNA by ArcZ is mediated by the leucine-responsive regulatory protein, Lrp. We show that Lrp contributes to expression of virulence and several virulence-associated traits, including production of the exopolysaccharide amylovoran, levansucrase activity, and biofilm formation. We further show that Lrp is regulated posttranscriptionally by ArcZ through destabilization of lrp mRNA. Thus, ArcZ regulation of FlhDC directly and indirectly through Lrp forms an incoherent feed-forward loop that regulates levansucrase activity and motility as outputs. This work identifies Lrp as a novel participant in virulence regulation in E. amylovora and places it in the context of a virulence-associated regulatory network.","authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey K Schachterle"},{"name":"George W Sundin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FlhDC"},{"word":"Hfq"},{"word":"fire blight"}]},"article106":{"pmid":"31138629","title":"Single-Cell Microscopy Reveals That Levels of Cyclic di-GMP Vary among Bacillus subtilis Subpopulations.","abs":"The synthesis of signaling molecules is one strategy bacteria employ to sense alterations in their environment and rapidly adjust to those changes.

However, c-di-GMP signaling has been less intensively studied in Gram-positive organisms. To that end, we constructed a fluorescent yfp reporter based on a c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitch to visualize the relative abundance of c-di-GMP for single cells of the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis Coupled with cell-type-specific fluorescent reporters, this riboswitch reporter revealed that c-di-GMP levels are markedly different among B. subtilis cellular subpopulations. For example, cells that have made the decision to become matrix producers maintain higher intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations than motile cells. Similarly, we find that c-di-GMP levels differ between sporulating and competent cell types. These results suggest that biochemical measurements of c-di-GMP abundance are likely to be inaccurate for a bulk ensemble of B. subtilis cells, as such measurements will average c-di-GMP levels across the population.

While a number of known signals that trigger biofilm formation do so through the activation of one or more sensory histidine kinases, it was discovered that biofilm activation is also coordinated by sensing intracellular metabolic signals, including serine starvation. Serine starvation causes ribosomes to pause on specific serine codons, leading to a decrease in the translation rate of sinR, which encodes a master repressor for biofilm matrix genes and ultimately triggers biofilm induction. How serine levels change in different growth stages, how B. subtilis regulates intracellular serine levels, and how serine starvation triggers ribosomes to pause on selective serine codons remain unknown. Here, we show that serine levels decrease as cells enter stationary phase and that unlike most other amino acid biosynthesis genes, expression of serine biosynthesis genes decreases upon the transition into stationary phase. The deletion of the gene for a serine deaminase responsible for converting serine to pyruvate led to a delay in biofilm formation, further supporting the idea that serine levels are a critical intracellular signal for biofilm activation. Finally, we show that levels of all five serine tRNA isoacceptors are decreased in stationary phase compared with exponential phase.

The enormous potential in genetic diversity of the marine microbial community make it a valuable resource for mining activities responsible for a broad range of metabolic processes, including the alginolytic activity responsible for degrading alginate.

The purified alginate lyase (AlyP1400) produced by Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400 showed a band of 23 KDa on a protein electrophoresis gel and exhibited a bifunctional lyase activity for both poly-mannuronic acid and poly-glucuronic acid degradation.

These stimuli can either be exogenous (e.g., light, ultrasound) or endogenous (e.g., pH, variation in redox gradient, enzymes). This promising therapeutic approach relies on advances in materials science and increased knowledge of microorganism growth and biofilm formation. This review provides an overview in the field of antibacterial drug-delivery systems and nanoantibiotics that benefit from a response to specific triggers, and also presents a number of future prospects.","authors":[{"name":"Roberto Canaparo"},{"name":"Federica Foglietta"},{"name":"Francesca Giuntini"},{"name":"Carlo Della Pepa"},{"name":"Franco Dosio"},{"name":"Loredana Serpe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics drug delivery systems"},{"word":"bacterial biofilms"},{"word":"drug delivery systems"},{"word":"multi-drug resistant bacteria"},{"word":"nanoantibiotics"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"stimuli-responsive antibiotic-loaded nanoparticles"},{"word":"stimuli-responsive nanoantibiotics"},{"word":"stimuli-responsive nanoparticles"}]},"article114":{"pmid":"31137026","title":"Effect of Silver Diamine Fluoride Treatment on Microbial Profiles of Plaque Biofilms from Root/Cervical Caries Lesions.","abs":"To assess the effect of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) on microbial profiles present in plaque from root/cervical carious lesions, and its association with caries lesion arrest.","authors":[{"name":"Heba Mitwalli"},{"name":"Marcio D A Mourao"},{"name":"Joseph Dennison"},{"name":"Peter Yaman"},{"name":"Bruce J Paster"},{"name":"Margherita Fontana"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial effect"},{"word":"Bacterial taxa"},{"word":"DNA"},{"word":"Dental caries"},{"word":"HOMINGS technology"},{"word":"Silver diamine fluoride"}]},"article115":{"pmid":"31137006","title":"High frequency of low-virulent microorganisms detected by sonication of pedicle screws: a potential cause for implant failure.","abs":"Loosening of pedicle screws is a frequent complication after spinal surgery.

During UTI pathogenesis, UPECs utilize various virulence factors, especially mono- and polyadhesive appendages of the chaperone-usher secretion pathway (CUP) required for adhesion, invasion and biofilm formation. Commonly used antibiotics for UTI treatment are usually effective, but their long-term utility may affect gut microbiota of the treated individuals and cause selection of drug resistant uropathogenic variants. Due to increasing resistance of UPEC strains to antibiotics via the evolution of specific defense mechanisms, there is a need to develop alternative methods and therapeutic strategies to fight UTIs (vaccines, receptor analogues, pilicides and curlicides, bacterial interference or phagotherapy).

GSE solution diluted with distilled water to 0.1% (0.1% GSE) and 1% (1% GSE) and solutions with Polident® denture cleansing tablet dissolved in distilled water (Polident) or in 0.1% GSE solution (0.1% G+P) were prepared as cleansing solutions. Discs of acrylic resin were prepared, and the biofilm of C. albicans was formed on the discs. The discs with the biofilm were treated with each solution for 5 min at 25°C. After the treatment, the biofilm on the discs was analyzed using a colony forming unit (CFU) assay, fluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In order to assess the persistent cleansing effect, the discs treated with each solution for 5 min were aerobically incubated in Yeast Nitrogen Base medium for another 24 h. After incubation, the persistent effect was assessed by CFU assay. Some specimens of acrylic resin were immersed in each solution for 7 days, and changes in surface roughness (Ra), Vickers hardness (VH), flexural strength (FS), and flexural modulus (FM) were evaluated. As a result, the treatment with 1% GSE for 5 min almost completely eliminated the biofilm formed on the resin; whereas, the treatment with 0.1% GSE, Polident, and 0.1% G+P for 5 min showed a statistically significant inhibitory effect on biofilms. In addition, 0.1% GSE and 0.1% G+P exerted a persistent inhibitory effect on biofilms. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Polident mainly induced the death of yeast, while the cleansing solutions containing at least 0.1% GSE induced the death of hyphae as well as yeast. SEM also revealed that Polident caused wrinkles, shrinkage, and some deep craters predominantly on the cell surfaces of yeast, while the solutions containing at least 0.1% GSE induced wrinkles, shrinkage, and some damage on cell surfaces of not only yeasts but also hyphae. No significant changes in Ra, VH, FS, or FM were observed after immersion in any of the solutions. Taken together, GSE solution is capable of cleansing C. albicans biofilms on denture-base resin and has a persistent inhibitory effect on biofilm development, without any deteriorations of resin surface.","authors":[{"name":"Chiaki Tsutsumi-Arai"},{"name":"Kensuke Takakusaki"},{"name":"Yuki Arai"},{"name":"Chika Terada-Ito"},{"name":"Yusuke Takebe"},{"name":"Takahiro Imamura"},{"name":"Shinji Ide"},{"name":"Seiko Tatehara"},{"name":"Reiko Tokuyama-Toda"},{"name":"Noriyuki Wakabayashi"},{"name":"Kazuhito Satomura"}],"keywords":[]},"article121":{"pmid":"31136296","title":"Expression of adhesin genes and biofilm formation among Klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolates from patients with antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis.","abs":"Biofilm formation and resistance to last-line antibiotics have restricted chemotherapy options toward infection eradication.","authors":[{"name":"Abdolmajid Ghasemian"},{"name":"Ashraf Mohabati Mobarez"},{"name":"Shahin Najar Peerayeh"},{"name":"Amin Talebi Bezmin Abadi"},{"name":"Sepideh Khodaparast"},{"name":"Suhad Saad Mahmood"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Klebsiella oxytoca"},{"word":"carbapenemase"},{"word":"colistin"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article122":{"pmid":"31136265","title":"Functional Regulators of Bacterial Flagella.","abs":"Bacteria move by a variety of mechanisms, but the best understood types of motility are powered by flagella (72).

The growing problem about toxicity of antifungal drugs and multidrug resistance aggravates the need for the development of new effective strategies. Natural compounds in this context represent promising alternatives having potential to be exploited for improving human health. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the antifungal effect of a naturally occurring phenolic, octyl gallate (OG), on Candida albicans and to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved. We demonstrated that OG at 25 μg/ml could effectively inhibit C. albicans. Mechanistic insights revealed that OG affects mitochondrial functioning as Candida cells exposed to OG did not grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. Dysfunctional mitochondria triggered generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which led to membrane damage mediated by lipid peroxidation. We explored that OG inhibited glucose-induced reduction in external pH and causes decrement in ergosterol levels by 45%. Furthermore, OG impedes the metabolic flexibility of C. albicans by inhibiting the glyoxylate enzyme isocitrate lyase, which was also confirmed by docking analysis. Additionally, OG affected virulence traits such as morphological transition and cell adherence. Furthermore, we depicted that OG not only prevented biofilm formation but eliminates the preformed biofilms. In vivo studies with Caenorhabditis elegans nematode model confirmed that OG could enhance the survival of C. elegans after infection with Candida. Toxicity assay using red blood cells showed only 27.5% haemolytic activity.

These two nanostructures exhibited different antibacterial properties from BBR. NPs showed significantly enhanced bacteriostatic activity, whereas NFs displayed a much weaker effect than BBR. The distinguishing properties can be attributed to the different spatial configurations and self-assembly processes of NPs and NFs. Flavonoid glycosides and BBR first formed a one-dimensional complex unit and subsequently self-assembled into three-dimensional nanostructures. With the hydrophilic glucuronic acid toward the outside, NPs exhibited stronger affinity to bacteria, thereby inducing the collapse of the bacteria population and the decrease in biofilm. In addition, in vitro hemolysis tests, cytotoxicity tests, and in vivo zebrafish toxicity evaluation showed that the obtained self-assemblies had good biocompatibility.

In this work, we describe the biofilm formed by a clinical keratomycosis isolate in terms of its development, composition and susceptibility to different antifungals and ultraviolet light (UV) at different biofilm formation stages. We found five biofilm formation stages using scanning electron microscopy: adherence, germination, hyphal development, maturation, and cell detachment. Using epifluorescence microscopy with specific fluorochromes, it was elucidated that the extracellular matrix consists of carbohydrates, proteins, and extracellular DNA. Specific inhibitors for these molecules showed significant biofilm reductions. The antifungal susceptibility against natamycin, voriconazole, caspofungin, and amphotericin B was evaluated by metabolic activity and crystal violet assay, with the F. solani biofilm preformation to 24 h increased in resistance to natamycin, voriconazole, and caspofungin, while the biofilm preformation to 48 h increased in resistance to amphotericin B. The preformed biofilm at 24 h protected and reduced UV light mortality. F. solani isolate could produce a highly structured extra biofilm; its cellular matrix consists of carbohydrate polymers, proteins, and eDNA.

The analysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by a non-destructive lectin approach (fluorescence lectin-barcoding analysis) using several fluorochromes shows that intial attachment was featured by footprints rich in biofilm cells that were embedded in an EPS matrix consisting of various glycoconjugates. Wet chemistry data indicate that carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and uronic acids are the main components. Attenuated reflectance (ATR)-Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD) indicate glucose and mannose as the main monosaccharides in EPS polysaccharides. EPS composition as well as sugar types in EPS vary according to substrate (sulfur or tetrathionate) and lifestyle (biofilms and planktonic cells). This study provides information on the building blocks/make up as well as dynamics of biofilms of thermoacidophilic archaea in extremely acidic environments.","authors":[{"name":"Ruiyong Zhang"},{"name":"Thomas R Neu"},{"name":"Qian Li"},{"name":"Véronique Blanchard"},{"name":"Yutong Zhang"},{"name":"Axel Schippers"},{"name":"Wolfgang Sand"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"attachment"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"elemental sulfur"},{"word":"fluorescence microscopy"},{"word":"thermophile"}]},"article137":{"pmid":"31133996","title":"Purification and Characterization of NDH-2 Protein and Elucidating Its Role in Extracellular Electron Transport and Bioelectrogenic Activity.","abs":"In microbial electrochemical systems, transport of electrons from bacteria to an electrode is the key to its functioning. However, the roles of several electron transport proteins, especially the membrane-bound dehydrogenases which link cellular metabolism to EET pathway are yet to be identified. NDH-2 is a non-proton pumping NADH dehydrogenase located in the inner membrane of several bacteria like Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, etc. Unlike NADH dehydrogenase I, NDH-2 is not impeded by a high proton motive force thus helping in the increase of metabolic flux and carbon utilization. In the current study, NADH dehydrogenase II protein (NDH-2) was heterologously expressed from B. subtilis into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for enhancing electron flux through EET pathway and to understand its role in bioelectrogenesis. We found that E. coli expressing NDH-2 has increased the electron flux through EET and has shown a ninefold increase in current (4.7 μA) production when compared to wild strain with empty vector (0.52 μA). Furthermore, expression of NDH-2 also resulted in increased biofilm formation which can be corroborated with the decrease in charge transfer resistance of NDH-2 strain and increased NADH oxidation. It was also found that NDH-2 strain can reduce ferric citrate at a higher rate than wild type strain suggesting increased electron flux through electron transport chain due to NADH dehydrogenase II activity. Purified NDH-2 was found to be ∼42 kDa and has FAD as a cofactor. This work demonstrates that the primary dehydrogenases like NADH dehydrogenases can be overexpressed to increase the electron flux in EET pathway which can further enhance the microbial fuel cells performance.","authors":[{"name":"K Vamshi Krishna"},{"name":"S Venkata Mohan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"NADH dehydrogenase II"},{"word":"bioelectricity"},{"word":"bioelectrochemical systems"},{"word":"electron flux"},{"word":"extracellular electron transport"}]},"article138":{"pmid":"31133642","title":"Modulation of antibiotic sensitivity and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by interspecies signal analogues.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a significant opportunistic pathogen, can participate in inter-species communication through signaling by cis-2-unsaturated fatty acids of the diffusible signal factor (DSF) family.

Here, we show that the membrane-associated sensory input domain of PA1396 has five transmembrane helices, two of which are required for DSF sensing. DSF binding is associated with enhanced auto-phosphorylation of PA1396 incorporated into liposomes. Further, we examined the ability of synthetic DSF analogues to modulate or inhibit PA1396 activity. Several of these analogues block the ability of DSF to trigger auto-phosphorylation and gene expression, whereas others act as inverse agonists reducing biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance, both in vitro and in murine infection models. These analogues may thus represent lead compounds to develop novel adjuvants improving the efficacy of existing antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Shi-Qi An"},{"name":"Julie Murtagh"},{"name":"Kate B Twomey"},{"name":"Manoj K Gupta"},{"name":"Timothy P O'Sullivan"},{"name":"Rebecca Ingram"},{"name":"Miguel A Valvano"},{"name":"Ji-Liang Tang"}],"keywords":[]},"article139":{"pmid":"31133641","title":"BD-2 and BD-3 increase skin flap survival in a model of ischemia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.","abs":"The main aim of this work was to study the usefulness of human β-defensins 2 (BD-2) and 3 (BD-3), which are part of the innate immune system, in the treatment of infected ischemic skin flaps.

Among the extracts, pimenta-malagueta methanolic extract (PMME) was chosen because it contained capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, and luteolin in greater amount than the other extracts. In general, PMME partially inhibited bacterial growth at 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL, as well as capsaicin at 100 µg/mL and luteolin at 62.5, 125, and 250 µg/mL. At lower concentrations, PMME and luteolin reduced violacein production in C. violaceum ATCC 12472 without affecting growth, a result that was not observed with capsaicin. We show that violacein inhibition by PMME is likely due to luteolin. In silico docking evaluation showed that luteolin binds to the CviR QS regulator. Crystal violet staining and confocal microscopy revealed that BF was increased by PMME and capsaicin, being remarkably superior for P. aeruginosa PAO1 at 30 °C. Capsaicin is not an effective QS inhibitor, while luteolin should be further investigated for its potential effects in QS regulated phenotypes. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Quorum sensing (QS) is a form of bacterial communication targeted for studies aiming to inhibit bacterial virulence. QS regulates phenotypes that influence microbial activities across many areas, including Food Science. Capsicum frutescens is a type of chili pepper consumed in Brazil, rich in bioactive compounds such as capsaicin (which gives its pungency) and luteolin (a phenolic compound). We show that C. frutescens extract and luteolin inhibit QS in a model bacterium, along with the possible molecular mechanism of inhibition. Capsaicin did not inhibit QS neither biofilm formation.

Micro-analysis of gold particles obtained from Western Australia revealed porous textures and aggregates of pure gold nanoparticles, attributable to gold dissolution and re-precipitation, respectively. By interpreting structure and chemistry of particles, the kinetics of gold biogeochemical cycling at the site was estimated to be 1.60 × 10-9 M year-1. Bacterial communities residing on particles were composed of Proteobacteria (42.5%), Bacteroidetes (20.1%), Acidobacteria (19.1%), Firmicutes (8.2%), Actinobacteria (3.7%) and Verrucomicrobia (3.6%). A bacterial enrichment culture obtained from particles contained a similar composition. Exposure of enrichments to increasing concentrations of soluble gold decreased community diversity and selected for metal-resistant bacteria. Lower gold concentrations, which corresponded well with the concentration from the kinetic rate, provided a selective pressure for the selection of metal-resistant organisms while retaining the overall diversity.

The tolerance of biofilms to antibiotics is multifactorial involving physical, physiological, and genetic determinants, whereas the antibiotic resistance of bacteria in biofilms is caused by mutations and driven by the repeated exposure of the bacteria to high levels of antibiotics.

The goal of the research was to determine the contribution of electrochemical reduction of nitrogen, hydrogenotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification in the process of nitrogen removal in a rotating electrobiological contactor (REBC) depending on hydraulic retention time (HRT) and electric current density (J). Synthetic sewage with characteristics corresponding to wastewater from soilless cultivation of tomatoes was the subject of the research.

The second concerned the effect of HRT and J on the effectiveness of nutrients removal in a rotating electrochemical contactor (RECC), while the third part - the effect of HRT and J on the effectiveness of nutrients removal in REBC. RBC was characterized by low efficiency of denitrification (6.2 to 9.2%). The effectiveness of nitrogen removal in RECC was determined by both electric current density and hydraulic retention time.

While measures to minimize public health risks are in place, the general microbial and protist community structure and dynamics in these systems remain largely elusive. In this study, we analysed the microbiome of the bulk water from the basins of three cooling towers by 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing over the course of one year. Bacterial diversity in all three towers was broadly comparable to other freshwater systems, yet less diverse than natural environments; the most abundant taxa are also frequently found in freshwater or drinking water. While each cooling tower had a pronounced site-specific microbial community, taxa shared among all locations mainly included groups generally associated with biofilm formation. We also detected several groups related to known opportunistic pathogens, such as Legionella, Mycobacterium, and Pseudomonas species, albeit at generally low abundance. Although cooling towers represent a rather stable environment, microbial community composition was highly dynamic and subject to seasonal change. Protists are important members of the cooling tower water microbiome and known reservoirs for bacterial pathogens. Co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and protist taxa successfully captured known interactions between amoeba-associated bacteria and their hosts, and predicted a large number of additional relationships involving ciliates and other protists.

For this purpose, we transform by chlorination discarded brackish (BWd) and seawater (SWd) membranes into nanofiltration (BWt-NF and SWt-NF) and ultrafiltration (BWt-UF and SWt-UF) membranes. Our results show that chlorine attacks allow the fouling cleaning while improves the hydrophilicity and maintains roughness only in BWt-NF. Therefore, the bacterial deposition in this membrane is greater than the other tested membranes. Besides, the microcystin (MC) degradation capacity of BWt-NF verifies the compatibility of the chemical modification for the biological activity of MC-degrading bacteria. Finally, our results also provide that polyamide thin-film composite (PA-TFC) membranes, originally manufactured for salt rejection during desalination processes, offer competitive gases diffusion at low pressures.

Several methods of surface modification are chronologically described bridging ordinary methods (e.g. grit blasting and etching) and advanced physicochemical approaches such as 3D-laser texturing and biomimetic modification. Functionalization procedures by using proteins, peptides, and bioactive ceramics have provided an enhancement in wettability and bioactivity of implant surfaces. Furthermore, recent findings have revealed a combined beneficial effect of micro- and nano-scale modification and biomimetic functionalization of titanium surfaces. However, some technological developments of implant surfaces are not commercially available yet due to costs and a lack of clinical validation for such recent surfaces. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to endorse the use of enhanced biomimetic implant surfaces. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Grit-blasting followed by acid-etching is currently used for titanium implant modifications, although recent technological biomimetic physicochemical methods have revealed enhanced osteoconductive and anti-microbial outcomes. An improvement in wettability and bioactivity of titanium implant surfaces has been accomplished by combining micro and nano-scale modification and functionalization with protein, peptides, and bioactive compounds. Such morphological and chemical modification of the titanium surfaces induce the migration and differentiation of osteogenic cells followed by an enhancement of the mineral matrix formation that accelerate the osseointegration process.

Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis shows that DHA is degraded nonenzymatically into substrates known to be unfavorable to high growth rates. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that DHA promotes genes involved in biofilm formation, which may reduce the bacterial growth rate. Functional analysis of the genes involved in DHA metabolism proves that under the aerobic conditions used in this study, DHA is mainly assimilated via the dihydroxyacetone kinase pathway. In addition, these results show that the alternative routes of DHA assimilation (i.e., the glycerol and fructose-6-phosphate aldolase pathways) are not fully activated under our conditions because of anaerobically mediated hierarchical control. These pathways are therefore certainly unable to sustain fluxes as high as the ones predicted in silico for optimal aerobic growth on DHA.

Research for almost three decades has provided novel insights into environmental processes and biogeochemical reactions not previously known to be carried out by microorganisms. At the heart of the environmental roles played by Geobacter bacteria is their ability to integrate redox pathways and regulatory checkpoints that maximize growth efficiency with electron donors derived from the decomposition of organic matter while respiring metal oxides, particularly the often abundant oxides of ferric iron. This metabolic specialization is complemented by versatile metabolic reactions, respiratory chains, and sensory networks that allow specific members to adaptively respond to environmental cues to integrate organic and inorganic contaminants in their oxidative and reductive metabolism, respectively. Thus, Geobacteraceae are important members of the microbial communities that degrade hydrocarbon contaminants under iron-reducing conditions and that contribute, directly or indirectly, to the reduction of radionuclides, toxic metals, and oxidized species of nitrogen. Their ability to produce conductive pili as nanowires for discharging respiratory electrons to solid-phase electron acceptors and radionuclides, or for wiring cells in current-harvesting biofilms highlights the unique physiological traits that make these organisms attractive biological platforms for bioremediation, bioenergy, and bioelectronics application.

Although the concept of PUMPT is well established, the relationship between protein unmasking and reinstatement of bioactivity is unclear. Here, we used dextrin-colistin conjugates to study the relationship between the molecular structure (degree of unmasking) and biological activity. Size exclusion chromatography was employed to collect fractions of differentially degraded conjugates and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) employed to characterize the corresponding structures. Antimicrobial activity was studied using a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy of LIVE/DEAD-stained biofilms with COMSTAT analysis. In vitro toxicity of the degraded conjugate was assessed using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. UPLC-MS revealed that the fully unmasked dextrin-colistin conjugate composed of colistin bound to at least one linker, whereas larger species were composed of colistin with varying lengths of glucose units attached. Increasing the degree of dextrin modification by succinoylation typically led to a greater number of linkers bound to colistin. Greater antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity were observed for the fully unmasked conjugate compared to the partially degraded species (MIC = 0.25 and 2-8 μg/mL, respectively), whereas dextrin conjugation reduced colistin's in vitro toxicity toward kidney cells, even after complete unmasking.

Besides virulence-associated genes, biofilm production also helps in the survival of E. coli in environmental waterbodies. Thus, the aim of the current study was to assess the virulence potential, ExPEC status, and biofilm-producing capability of E. coli isolated from the River Yamuna, a major river traversing the National Capital Region of Delhi, India. We also tried to discern a co-relation, if any, between virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance in these strains. Our results indicated that virulence-associated genes were scarce and none of the strain qualified the molecular criteria essential for ExPEC. This suggested that E. coli strains which can presumably cause human extra-intestinal infections were not prominent in the River Yamuna. However, the fact that more than 80% of the aquatic E. coli isolates were moderate and strong biofilm producers suggests that E. coli in these environments might serve as opportunistic pathogens. Also, no unequivocal association was observed between biofilm production, virulence, and β-lactamase genes in E. coli strains.

Additionally, gallium maltolate (GaM) was incorporated into the dressing to investigate the efficacy of this antimicrobial agent. Loading profiles, release kinetics, and the bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) of GaM were investigated in vitro to identify target profiles that supported infection control. Finally, GaM-loaded hydrogel dressings were evaluated in vivo, utilizing a murine splinted-wound model that was inoculated with S. aureus. In comparison to an untreated control, GaM dressings markedly reduced the wound bacterial load without compromising wound closure rates. Overall, this work demonstrates the utility of a 3D-printed hydrogel dressing as an antimicrobial dressing to control infection in chronic wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Stacy Cereceres"},{"name":"Ziyang Lan"},{"name":"Laura Bryan"},{"name":"Michael Whitely"},{"name":"Thomas Wilems"},{"name":"Hunter Greer"},{"name":"Ellen Ruth Alexander"},{"name":"Robert J Taylor"},{"name":"Lawrence Bernstein"},{"name":"Noah Cohen"},{"name":"Canaan Whitfield-Cargile"},{"name":"Elizabeth Cosgriff-Hernandez"}],"keywords":[]},"article191":{"pmid":"31123307","title":"Differential effects of alkyl gallates on quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"Virulence factors and biofilms constitute attractive targets for the prevention of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

Here, we use quantitative RT-PCR to demonstrate that expression of the flagellin locus fliC is repressed during the course of infection and subsequently up-regulated upon host mortality in a motile strain of Yersinia ruckeri. The kinetics of fliC repression during the infection process is relatively slow as full repression occurs 7-days after the initiation of infection and after approximately 3-logs of bacterial growth in vivo. These results suggests that Y. ruckeri possesses a regulatory system capable of sensing host and modulating the expression of motility in response.

Experimental challenge with ΔrcsB and ΔrcsBΔfliC1ΔfliC2 mutants revealed that mutation of the Rcs pathway results in virulence attenuation which is dependent on presence of the flagellin gene. These results suggest that the inappropriate expression of flagellin during infection triggers host recognition and thus immune stimulation resulting in attenuation of virulence.

Taken together, the diverse structures and functions of Cm-CATHs indicated their pleiotropic role in innate immunity of green sea turtle, and the potent antimicrobial, anti-biofilm and immunomodulatory properties make them ideal candidates for the development of novel anti-infective drugs.","authors":[{"name":"Xue Qiao"},{"name":"Huaixin Yang"},{"name":"Jiuxiang Gao"},{"name":"Fen Zhang"},{"name":"Peng Chu"},{"name":"Yongliang Yang"},{"name":"Minghui Zhang"},{"name":"Yipeng Wang"},{"name":"Haining Yu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial"},{"word":"Cathelicidin"},{"word":"Chelonia mydas"},{"word":"Host defense peptides (HDPs)"},{"word":"Immunomodulatory"},{"word":"TLR4-MD2 complex"}]},"article202":{"pmid":"31121095","title":"Monitoring Biohydrogen Production and Metabolic Heat in Biofilms by Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors.","abs":"A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) was created to accurately and simultaneously monitor the biohydrogen and metabolic heat production in biofilms containing Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK-01 photosynthetic bacteria (PSB). The proposed hydrogen sensor was made from an FBG unit separated into two regions by a wet etching process; a thin region with a diameter of 15 μm was employed to monitor the temperature. A smaller region of the etched FBG with a diameter of 8.0 μm was coated with a 50 nm-thick Pd film by sputtering to determine the responses to the temperature and hydrogen concentration. To monitor the biohydrogen production and metabolic heat within the biofilms, three FBGs were evenly distributed in a polydimethylsiloxane channel (biofilm carrier) with vertical distances of 80 μm. In addition, the thickness, surface morphology, active biomass, and porosity of the biofilms were investigated. The FBG sensor can rapidly and accurately determine the difference in Bragg wavelength shifts caused by changes in the hydrogen concentration and temperature. The measured biohydrogen concentration is highly correlated with the real biohydrogen production with a correlation of 0.9765.

Affitins are small affinity proteins characterized by higher stability and lower cost-effective production than antibodies. The strategy presented provides a platform for the rational design of multivalent nanodevices that, retaining the ability of Affitins to recognize their target with high specificity, achieve a largely enhanced affinity. Affidendrons with precisely designed size and valency have been exploited to modulate complex multicellular behaviors of S. aureus, such as agglutination and biofilm formation. Agglutination assays showed that Affidendrons rapidly cross-link S. aureus strains with high bacterial cell selectivity. Moreover, remarkably low concentrations of Affidendrons were able to effectively prevent biofilm formation. Overall, Affidendrons represent a promising platform for the rapid and selective pathogen identification, infection imaging, and theranostic applications.","authors":[{"name":"Petar Vukojicic"},{"name":"Ghislaine Béhar"},{"name":"Maun H Tawara"},{"name":"Marcos Fernandez-Villamarin"},{"name":"Frédéric Pecorari"},{"name":"Eduardo Fernandez-Megia"},{"name":"Barbara Mouratou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"Affidendrons"},{"word":"Affitins"},{"word":"GATG dendrimers"},{"word":"conjugation"}]},"article204":{"pmid":"31120391","title":"Characterization of Antibiotic Resistance Genes, Plasmids, Biofilm Formation, and In Vitro Invasion Capacity of Salmonella Enteritidis Isolates from Children with Gastroenteritis.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Xiujuan Zhou"},{"name":"Meiya Li"},{"name":"Li Xu"},{"name":"Chunlei Shi"},{"name":"Xianming Shi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Caco2 invasion"},{"word":"Salmonella Enteritidis"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance genes"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"plasmids"}]},"article205":{"pmid":"31120377","title":"Impact of flow hydrodynamics and pipe material properties on biofilm development within drinking water systems.","abs":"The aim of this study was to investigate the combined impact of flow hydrodynamics and pipe material on biofilm development in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS). Biofilms were formed on four commonly used pipe materials (namely polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, structured wall high-density polyethylene and solid wall high-density polyethylene) within a series of purpose built flow cell reactors at two different flow regimes. Results indicate that varying amounts of microbial material with different morphologies were present depending on the pipe material and conditioning. The amount of microbial biomass was typically greater for the biofilms conditioned at lower flows. Whereas, biofilm development was inhibited at higher flows indicating shear forces imposed by flow conditions were above the critical levels for biofilm attachment. Alphaproteobacteria was the predominant bacterial group within the biofilms incubated at low flow and represented 48% of evaluated phylotypes; whilst at higher flows, Betaproteobacteria (45%) and Gammaproteobacteria (33%) were the dominant groups. The opportunistic pathogens, Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas were found to be particularly abundant in biofilms incubated at lower flows, and only found within biofilms incubated at higher flows on the rougher materials assessed. This suggests that these bacteria have limited ability to propagate within biofilms under high shear conditions without sufficient protection (roughness).

One cause of this variation is circuit diversification, the alteration of gene regulatory relationships among members of a species. Circuit diversification is thought to be a starting point for the circuit divergence or rewiring that occurs during speciation. How widespread is circuit diversification? Here we address this question with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, which forms biofilms rich in distinctive hyphal cells as a prelude to infection. Our understanding of the biofilm/hyphal regulatory network comes primarily from studies of one clinical isolate, strain SC5314, and its marked derivatives. We used CRISPR-based methods to create mutations of four key biofilm transcription factor genes-BCR1, UME6, BRG1, and EFG1 -in SC5314 and four additional clinical isolates. Phenotypic analysis revealed that mutations in BCR1 or UME6 have variable impact across strains, while mutations in BRG1 or EFG1 had uniformly severe impact. Gene expression, sampled with Nanostring probes and examined comprehensively for EFG1 via RNA-Seq, indicates that regulatory relationships are highly variable among isolates. Our results suggest that genotype-phenotype relationships vary in this strain panel in part because of differences in control of BRG1 by BCR1, a hypothesis that is supported through engineered constitutive expression of BRG1. Overall, the data show that circuit diversification is the rule, not the exception, in this biofilm/hyphal regulatory network.","authors":[{"name":"Manning Y Huang"},{"name":"Carol A Woolford"},{"name":"Gemma May"},{"name":"C Joel McManus"},{"name":"Aaron P Mitchell"}],"keywords":[]},"article227":{"pmid":"31116540","title":"Characterization of a Cathelicidin from the Colubrinae Snake, Sinonatrix annularis.","abs":"The cathelicidins represent an important family of host defense peptides (HDPs) found exclusively in vertebrates, which serve as a critical effector in host immune response against microbial infections.

However, detailed morphometric studies including mucin histochemistry are scarce. This study compares various GIT measurements as well as the quantification of intestinal mucin secreting cells in four insectivorous bat species representing four different families of Chiroptera. Alcian blue/Periodic acid Schiff's stain was used to differentiate between acid and neutral mucin-secreting cells while the Aldehyde fuchsin/Alcian blue stain further differentiated between two acid mucins, namely sialo-, and sulphomucins. The number of cells was quantified and statistically analysed. All species had a simple GIT morphology represented by a simple, completely glandular stomach and the absence of a cecum. The exception was R. hardwickii, where a small cecum was observed which had histological mucosal features of both the small and large intestine. In R.hardwickii, distal to the cecum, typical colonic mucosal features such as the absence of villi and an abundance of goblet cells were observed. In all four species, the total number of goblet cells increased from the proximal to the distal intestinal regions. Mixed (acid and neutral) mucins dominated the entire GIT of all species. Neutral mucin-secreting cells were observed in the gastric pylorus and proximal intestinal regions in all species. Brunner's glands stained positive for neutral mucins.

Samples were tested using PCR (ompW and ctxA) with DNA extracted from bacterial isolates and samples enriched in alkaline peptone water. Isolates were screened with polyvalent antiserum O1 followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools were employed to investigate the genomic characteristics of the isolates.

Here, we assessed the impact of coaggregation between two key initial colonizers of dental plaque, Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula, on gene expression in each partner. These species were shown to coaggregate in buffer or human saliva. To monitor gene regulation, coaggregates were formed in human saliva and, after 30 minutes, whole-transcriptomes were extracted for sequencing and Dual RNA-Seq analysis. In total, 272 genes were regulated in V. parvula, including 39 genes in oxidoreductase processes. In S. gordonii, there was a high degree of inter-sample variation. Nevertheless, 69 genes were identified as potentially regulated by coaggregation, including two phosphotransferase system transporters and several other genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Overall, these data indicate that responses of V. parvula to coaggregation with S. gordonii are dominated by oxidative stress-related processes, whereas S. gordonii responses are more focussed on carbohydrate metabolism.

Here, we performed a time-resolved analysis of the metabolic changes associated with pellicle biofilm formation and development in B. subtilis by combining metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. We report surprisingly widespread and dynamic remodeling of metabolism affecting central carbon metabolism, primary biosynthetic pathways, fermentation pathways, and secondary metabolism. Most of these metabolic alterations were hitherto unrecognized as biofilm associated. For example, we observed increased activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle during early biofilm growth, a shift from fatty acid biosynthesis to fatty acid degradation, reorganization of iron metabolism and transport, and a switch from acetate to acetoin fermentation. Close agreement between metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic measurements indicated that remodeling of metabolism during biofilm development was largely controlled at the transcriptional level. Our results also provide insights into the transcription factors and regulatory networks involved in this complex metabolic remodeling. Following upon these results, we demonstrated that acetoin production via acetolactate synthase is essential for robust biofilm growth and has the dual role of conserving redox balance and maintaining extracellular pH. This report represents a comprehensive systems-level investigation of the metabolic remodeling occurring during B. subtilis biofilm development that will serve as a useful road map for future studies on biofilm physiology.","authors":[{"name":"Tippapha Pisithkul"},{"name":"Jeremy W Schroeder"},{"name":"Edna A Trujillo"},{"name":"Ponlkrit Yeesin"},{"name":"David M Stevenson"},{"name":"Tai Chaiamarit"},{"name":"Joshua J Coon"},{"name":"Jue D Wang"},{"name":"Daniel Amador-Noguez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"acetoin"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"metabolism"},{"word":"metabolomics"},{"word":"proteomics"},{"word":"transcriptomics"}]},"article244":{"pmid":"31113860","title":"Inorganic polyphosphate accumulation suppresses the dormancy response and virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","abs":"Stringent response pathways involving inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) play an essential role in bacterial stress adaptation and virulence.

The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes two functional PPXs, and simultaneous deletion of ppx1 and ppx2 results in a defect in biofilm formation. We demonstrate here that these PPXs cumulatively contribute to the ability of M. tuberculosis to survive in nutrient-limiting, low-oxygen growth conditions and also in macrophages. Characterization of single (Δppx2) and double knockout (dkppx) strains of M. tuberculosis indicated that PPX-mediated PolyP degradation is essential for establishing bacterial infection in guinea pigs. RNA-Seq-based transcriptional profiling revealed that relative to the parental strain, the expression levels of DosR regulon-regulated dormancy genes were significantly reduced in the dkppx mutant strain. In concordance, we also provide evidence that PolyP inhibits the autophosphorylation activities associated with DosT and DosS sensor kinases. The results in this study uncover that enzymes involved in PolyP homeostasis play a critical role in M. tuberculosis physiology and virulence and are attractive targets for developing more effective therapeutic interventions.","authors":[{"name":"Prabhakar Tiwari"},{"name":"Tannu Priya Gosain"},{"name":"Mamta Singh"},{"name":"Gaurav D Sankhe"},{"name":"Garima Arora"},{"name":"Saqib Kidwai"},{"name":"Sakshi Agarwal"},{"name":"Saurabh Chugh"},{"name":"Deepak K Saini"},{"name":"Ramandeep Singh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"word":"bacterial pathogenesis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dormancy-associated genes"},{"word":"exopolyphosphatases"},{"word":"hypoxia"},{"word":"inorganic polyphosphate homeostasis"},{"word":"microbial pathogenesis"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"molecular biology"},{"word":"mycobacteria"},{"word":"stress adaptation"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article245":{"pmid":"31113736","title":"Effect of amyloid curli fibrils and curli CsgA monomers from Escherichia coli on in vitro model of intestinal epithelial barrier stimulated with cytokines.","abs":"Amyloid curli fibrils produced by Escherichia coli are well-known virulence factor influencing E. coli adhesion and biofilm formation.

Until recently, complications from biofilm-associated infection have been primarily ascribed to increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics and host immune evasion, leading to persistent infection. In this theory and hypothesis article we present a relatively new argument that biofilm formation has potential etiological role in the development of digestive tract cancer. First, we summarize recent new findings suggesting the potential link between bacterial biofilm and various types of cancer to build the foundation of our hypothesis. To date, evidence has been particularly convincing for colorectal cancer and its precursor, i.e., polyps, pointing to several key individual bacterial species, such as Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. Gallolyticus. Then, we further extend this hypothesis to one of the most common bacterial infection in humans, Helicobacter pylori (Hp), which is considered a major cause of gastric cancer. Thus far, there has been no direct evidence linking in vivo Hp gastric biofilm formation to gastric carcinogenesis. Yet, we synthesize the information to support an argument that biofilm associated-Hp is potentially more carcinogenic, summarizing biological characteristics of biofilm-associated bacteria. We also discuss mechanistic pathways as to how Hp or other biofilm-associated bacteria control biofilm formation and highlight recent findings on Hp genes that influence biofilm formation, which may lead to strain variability in biofilm formation. This knowledge may open a possibility of developing targeted intervention. We conclude, however, that this field is still in its infancy. To test the hypothesis rigorously and to link it ultimately to gastric pathologies (e.g., premalignant lesions and cancer), studies are needed to learn more about Hp biofilms, such as compositions and biological properties of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), presence of non-Hp microbiome and geographical distribution of biofilms in relation to gastric gland types and structures. Identification of specific Hp strains with enhanced biofilm formation would be helpful not only for screening patients at high risk for sequelae from Hp infection, but also for development of new antibiotics to avoid resistance, regardless of its association with gastric cancer.","authors":[{"name":"Cosmeri Rizzato"},{"name":"Javier Torres"},{"name":"Elena Kasamatsu"},{"name":"Margarita Camorlinga-Ponce"},{"name":"Maria Mercedes Bravo"},{"name":"Federico Canzian"},{"name":"Ikuko Kato"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Helicobacter pylori"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cancer"},{"word":"persistent infection"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article254":{"pmid":"31110495","title":"Biogenic Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Using Phyllanthus emblica Fruit Extract and Its Inhibitory Action Against the Pathogen Acidovorax oryzae Strain RS-2 of Rice Bacterial Brown Stripe.","abs":"Biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using plants has become a promising substitute to the conventional chemical synthesis method.

The metabolites extracted from the dynamic C. albicans biofilm matrix using the CER-VU and VU were identified with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) via untargeted filtration. Compared with other physical and chemical extraction methods, CER-VU was demonstrated to be an ideal approach with high-yield acquisitions of EM constituents including proteins, triglycerides and carbohydrates and low-level damages on fungal cell viability and integrity. The untargeted MS analysis further showed the high efficacy of CER-VU, as a large quantity of metabolites (217 versus 198) was matched comprising a great number of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleic acids and their derivatives together with a high involvement of signaling pathways compared with the VU alone. However, combining the results from both the CER-VU and VU methods could generate more metabolites. In summary, the EM analysis of the dynamic C. albicans biofilm expands our understanding upon a comprehensive depiction of matrix components and provides another effective approach for EM extraction.","authors":[{"name":"Wenyue Da"},{"name":"Jing Shao"},{"name":"Qianqian Li"},{"name":"Gaoxiang Shi"},{"name":"Tianming Wang"},{"name":"Daqiang Wu"},{"name":"Changzhong Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cation exchange resin"},{"word":"continuous flow"},{"word":"extraction"},{"word":"matrix"}]},"article256":{"pmid":"31110045","title":"Disruption of the SucT acyltransferase in Mycobacterium smegmatis abrogates succinylation of cell envelope polysaccharides.","abs":"Similar to other prokaryotes, mycobacteria decorate their major cell envelope glycans with minor covalent substituents whose biological significance remains largely unknown.

Low concentrations of ethanol reduced P. aeruginosa swim zone area by up to 45% in soft agar. The reduction of swimming by ethanol required the flagellar motor proteins MotAB and two PilZ domain proteins (FlgZ and PilZ). PilY1 and the type 4 pilus alignment complex (comprising PilMNOP) were previously implicated in MotAB regulation in surface-associated cells and were required for ethanol-dependent motility repression. As FlgZ requires the second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) to represses motility, we screened mutants lacking genes involved in c-di-GMP metabolism and found that mutants lacking diguanylate cyclases SadC and GcbA were less responsive to ethanol. The double mutant was resistant to its effects. As published previously, ethanol also represses swarming motility, and the same genes required for ethanol effects on swimming motility were required for its regulation of swarming. Microscopic analysis of single cells in soft agar revealed that ethanol effects on swim zone area correlated with ethanol effects on the portion of cells that paused or stopped during the time interval analyzed. Ethanol increased c-di-GMP in planktonic wild-type cells but not in ΔmotAB or ΔsadC ΔgcbA mutants, suggesting c-di-GMP plays a role in the response to ethanol in planktonic cells. We propose that ethanol produced by other microbes induces a regulated decrease in P. aeruginosa motility, thereby promoting P. aeruginosa colocalization with ethanol-producing microbes. Furthermore, some of the same factors involved in the response to surface contact are involved in the response to ethanol.","authors":[{"name":"Kimberley A Lewis"},{"name":"Amy E Baker"},{"name":"Annie I Chen"},{"name":"Colleen E Harty"},{"name":"Sherry L Kuchma"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"},{"name":"Deborah A Hogan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Ethanol"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"stator"}]},"article258":{"pmid":"31109992","title":"The Two Chemotaxis Clusters in Caulobacter crescentus Play Different Roles in Chemotaxis and Biofilm Regulation.","abs":"The holdfast polysaccharide adhesin is crucial for irreversible cell adhesion and biofilm formation in Caulobacter crescentus Holdfast production is tightly controlled via developmental regulators, as well as via environmental and physical signals.

Here, we characterized the transcriptional responses of three S. maltophilia strains during exposure to synthetic CF sputum medium (SCFM2) to gain insight into how this organism interacts with the host in the CF lung. These efforts led to the identification of 881 transcripts differentially expressed by all three strains, many of which reflect the metabolic pathways used by S. maltophilia in sputum, as well as altered stress responses. The latter correlated with increased resistance to peroxide exposure after pregrowth in SCFM2 for two of the strains. We also compared the SCFM2 transcriptomes of two S. maltophilia CF isolates to that of the acute infection strain, S. maltophilia K279a, allowing us to identify CF isolate-specific signatures in differential gene expression. The expression of genes from the accessory genomes was also differentially altered in response to SCFM2. Finally, a number of biofilm-associated genes were differentially induced in SCFM2, particularly in K279a, which corresponded to increased aggregation and biofilm formation in this strain relative to both CF strains.

When injected intramuscularly into mice, the immunogenicity of PE within the fusion was equivalent to that of isolated PE, except when it was formulated with alum. In contrast, in our murine models PilA was consistently found to be more immunogenic as a subentity of the PE-PilA fusion protein than when it was injected as an isolated antigen. Following immunization with PE-PilA, anti-PE antibodies demonstrated the same capacity to inhibit the binding of PE to vitronectin as those induced after PE immunization.

Clinical and epidemiological studies show that different types of therapies are able to eliminate the signs and symptoms of mycotic vaginitis in the acute phase, but so far none of these has proved able to significantly reduce the risk of long-term recurrence. In this review, based on the available literature and original data from a preliminary in-vitro microbiological study on the compatibility between fluconazole, clotrimazole and metronidazole a new therapeutic approach to RVVC is discussed and presented. The treatment proposed is a combined scheme using both systemic antimicrobial drug therapy with oral fluconazole 200 mg and topical drug therapy using the association metronidazole 500 mg and clotrimazole 100 mg (vaginal ovules) with adjuvant oral probiotic therapy. In detail, at the time of diagnosis in the acute symptom phase, we propose the following treatment scheme: fluconazole 200 mg on day 1, 4, 11, 26, then 1 dose/month for 3 months at the end of the menstrual cycle; plus metronidazole/clotrimazole ovules 1/day for 6 days the first week, then 1 ovule/day for 3 days the week before the menstrual cycle for 3 months; plus probiotic 1 dose/day for 10 days for 3 months starting from the second month to the end of the menstrual cycle. This scheme aims to address the recurrent infection aggressively from the outset by attempting not only to treat acute symptoms, but also to prevent a new event by countering many of the potential risk factors of recurrence, such as the intestinal Candida reservoir, the mycotic biorhythm, the formation of biofilm, the phenotype switching and the presence of infections complicated by the presence of C. non albicans or G. Vaginalis, without interfering, but rather favoring the restoration of the vaginal lactobacillus species.

To be able to eliminate such biofilms, it is important to understand the key bacterial factors that contribute to their formation. A common practice in the lab setting is to study biofilms grown in laboratory media. However, these media do not fully reflect the host environment conditions, potentially masking relevant biological determinants. This is the case during urinary catheterization, where a key element for Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus colonization and biofilm formation is the release of fibrinogen (Fg) into the bladder and its deposition on the urinary catheter. To recapitulate bladder conditions during catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), we have developed a fibrinogen-coated catheter and 96-well plate biofilm assay in urine. Notably, enterococcal biofilm factors identified in these in vitro assays proved to be important for biofilm formation in vivo in a mouse model of CAUTI.

Secondly, combination of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin was chosen as the selective stress for the following cultivation; it is able to penetrate the biofilms and kill the bacterial cells inside the aggregate, contributing to the AOA enrichments reached high abundances (90%) only after one-time cultivation. Basing on this strategy, three AOA strains were obtained from agricultural soils only after 90-150 days cultivation. Phylogenetic analysis suggested these AOA belong to the soil group I.1b Thaumarchaeota and are closely related to the genus Nitrosocosmicus. In general, AOA enrichment or isolation is very difficult and time-consuming (an average of 2-3 years). Here, we provide a new strategy for the rapid enrichment of high abundance of Nitrosocosmicus-like AOA from soil, which gives a new solution to the AOA enrichment and cultivation in a short period.","authors":[{"name":"Liangting Liu"},{"name":"Surong Li"},{"name":"Jiamin Han"},{"name":"Weitie Lin"},{"name":"Jianfei Luo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Nitrosocosmicus"},{"word":"ammonia-oxidizing archaea"},{"word":"azithromycin"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"ciprofloxacin"},{"word":"quartz sand"}]},"article280":{"pmid":"31105667","title":"Anti-pseudomonad Activity of Manuka Honey and Antibiotics in a Specialized ex vivo Model Simulating Cystic Fibrosis Lung Infection.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes problematic chronic lung infections in those suffering from cystic fibrosis. This is due to its antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and its ability to form robust biofilm communities with increased antimicrobial tolerances. Using novel antimicrobials or repurposing current ones is required in order to overcome these problems. Manuka honey is a natural antimicrobial agent that has been used for many decades in the treatment of chronic surface wounds with great success, particularly those infected with P. aeruginosa. Here we aim to determine whether the antimicrobial activity of manuka honey could potentially be repurposed to inhibit pulmonary P. aeruginosa infections using two ex vivo models. P. aeruginosa isolates (n = 28) from an international panel were tested for their susceptibility to manuka honey and clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and tobramycin), alone and in combination, using conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). To increase clinical applicability, two ex vivo porcine lung (EVPL) models (using alveolar and bronchiolar tissue) were used to determine the anti-biofilm effects of manuka honey alone and in combination with antibiotics. All P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to manuka honey, however, varying incidences of resistance were seen against antibiotics. The combination of sub-inhibitory manuka honey and antibiotics using conventional AST had no effect on activity against the majority of isolates tested. Using the two ex vivo models, 64% (w/v) manuka honey inhibited many of the isolates where abnormally high concentrations of antibiotics could not. Typically, combinations of both manuka honey and antibiotics had increased antimicrobial activity. These results highlight the potential of manuka honey as a future antimicrobial for the treatment of pulmonary P. aeruginosa isolates, clearing potential infection reservoirs within the upper airway.","authors":[{"name":"Aled E L Roberts"},{"name":"Lydia C Powell"},{"name":"Manon F Pritchard"},{"name":"David W Thomas"},{"name":"Rowena E Jenkins"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antimicrobial susceptibility testing"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"ex vivo model"},{"word":"manuka honey"}]},"article281":{"pmid":"31105665","title":"Effect of Quercetin Rich Onion Extracts on Bacterial Quorum Sensing.","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) regulates bacterial gene expression and studies suggest quercetin, a flavonol found in onion, as a QS inhibitor.

Three phenolic extracts were obtained: red onion extract in methanol acidified with 2.5% acetic acid (RO-1), white onion extract in methanol (WO-1) and white onion extract in methanol ammonium (WO-2). Quercetin 4-O-glucoside and quercetin 3,4-O-diglucoside were identified as the predominant compounds in both onion varieties using HPLC-DAD and LC-ESI-MS/MS. However, quercetin aglycone, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and quercetin glycoside were identified only in RO-1. The three extracts showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values equal to or above 125 μg/ml of dried extract. Violacein production was significantly reduced by RO-1 and quercetin aglycone, but not by quercetin 3-β-D-glucoside. Motility in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was inhibited by RO-1, while WO-2 inhibited S. marcescens MG1 motility only in high concentration. Quercetin aglycone and quercetin 3-β-D-glucoside were effective at inhibiting motility in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and S. marcescens MG1. Surprisingly, biofilm formation was not affected by any extracts or the quercetins tested at sub-MIC concentrations. In silico studies suggested a better interaction and placement of quercetin aglycone in the structures of the CviR protein of C. violaceum ATCC 12472 than the glycosylated compound which corroborates the better inhibitory effect of the former over violacein production. On the other hand, the two quercetins were well placed in the AHLs binding pockets of the LasR protein of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Overall onion extracts and quercetin presented antimicrobial activity, and interference on QS regulated production of violacein and swarming motility.","authors":[{"name":"B X V Quecan"},{"name":"J T C Santos"},{"name":"M L C Rivera"},{"name":"N M A Hassimotto"},{"name":"F A Almeida"},{"name":"U M Pinto"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"glycosylation"},{"word":"onion"},{"word":"phenolic compounds"},{"word":"quorum quenching"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article282":{"pmid":"31105657","title":"A Sequence of Developmental Events Occurs Underneath Growing Bacillus subtilis Pellicles.","abs":"Biofilms are structured communities of bacteria that exhibit complex spatio-temporal dynamics. In liquid media, Bacillus subtilis produces an opaque floating biofilm, or a pellicle. Biofilms are generally associated with an interface, but the ability of Bacillus subtilis to swim means the bacteria are additionally able to reside within the liquid phase. However, due to imaging complications associated with the opacity of pellicles, the extent to which bacteria coexist within the liquid bulk as well as their behavior in the liquid is not well studied. We therefore develop a high-throughput imaging system to image underneath developing pellicles. Here we report a well-defined sequence of developmental events that occurs underneath a growing pellicle. Comparison with bacteria deficient in swimming and chemotaxis suggest that these properties enable collective bacterial swimming within the liquid phase which facilitate faster surface colonization. Furthermore, comparison to bacteria deficient in exopolymeric substances (EPS) suggest that the lack of a surface pellicle prevents further developmental steps from occurring within the liquid phase. Our results reveal a sequence of developmental events during pellicle growth, encompassing adhesion, conversion, growth, maturity, and detachment on the interface, which are synchronized with the bacteria in the liquid bulk increasing in density until the formation of a mature surface pellicle, after which the density of bacteria in the liquid drops.","authors":[{"name":"Lisa M Lee"},{"name":"Gili Rosenberg"},{"name":"Shmuel M Rubinstein"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"collective behavior"},{"word":"development"},{"word":"flagellar motility"},{"word":"pellicles"}]},"article283":{"pmid":"31105656","title":"In vitro Antimicrobial Activity of Robenidine, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid and Polymyxin B Nonapeptide Against Important Human and Veterinary Pathogens.","abs":"The emergence and global spread of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens demand alternative strategies to treat life-threatening infections. Combination drugs and repurposing of old compounds with known safety profiles that are not currently used in human medicine can address the problem of multidrug-resistant infections and promote antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of robenidine alone or in combination with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including those associated with canine otitis externa and human skin and soft tissue infection, was evaluated in vitro using microdilution susceptibility testing and the checkerboard method. Fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) and dose reduction indices (DRI) of the combinations against tested isolates were determined. Robenidine alone was bactericidal against Acinetobacter baumannii [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) mode = 8 μg/ml] and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MIC mode = 2 μg/ml). Against Acinetobacter spp., an additivity/indifference of the combination of robenidine/EDTA (0.53 > FICIs > 1.06) and a synergistic effect of the combination of robenidine/PMBN (0.5 < FICI) were obtained. DRIs of robenidine were significantly increased in the presence of both EDTA and PMBN from 2- to 2048-fold. Robenidine exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of either EDTA or PMBN. Robenidine also demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens and all Gram-negative pathogens isolated from cases of canine otitis externa in the presence of EDTA. Robenidine did not demonstrate antibiofilm activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. EDTA facilitated biofilm biomass degradation for both Gram-positives and Gram-negatives. The addition of robenidine to EDTA was not associated with any change in the effect on biofilm biomass degradation. The combination of robenidine with EDTA or PMBN has potential for further exploration and pharmaceutical development, such as incorporation into topical and otic formulations for animal and human use.","authors":[{"name":"Manouchehr Khazandi"},{"name":"Hongfei Pi"},{"name":"Wei Yee Chan"},{"name":"Abiodun David Ogunniyi"},{"name":"Jowenna Xiao Feng Sim"},{"name":"Henrietta Venter"},{"name":"Sanjay Garg"},{"name":"Stephen W Page"},{"name":"Peter B Hill"},{"name":"Adam McCluskey"},{"name":"Darren J Trott"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EDTA"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"canine otitis externa"},{"word":"combination"},{"word":"robenidine"}]},"article284":{"pmid":"31105285","title":"Assessment of biofilm formation by pseudomonas aeruginosa and hydrodynamic evaluation of microtiter plate assay.","abs":"To assess the biofilm formation in clinical and environmental isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to evaluate the hydrodynamics in microtiter plate assay and compare it with conventional assays for biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Abdus Samad"},{"name":"Amir Afzal Khan"},{"name":"Muhammad Sajid"},{"name":"Rabaab Zahra"}],"keywords":[{"word":" Biofilm, P. aeruginosa,Microtiter plate assay, Computational fluid dynamics"}]},"article285":{"pmid":"31105214","title":"Cell Shape and Surface Colonisation in the Diatom Genus Cocconeis-An Opportunity to Explore Bio-Inspired Shape Packing?","abs":"Optimal packing of 2 and 3-D shapes in confined spaces has long been of practical and theoretical interest, particularly as it has been discovered that rotatable ellipses (or ellipsoids in the 3-D case) can, for example, have higher packing densities than disks (or spheres in the 3-D case). Benthic diatoms, particularly those of the genus Cocconeis (Ehr.)-which are widely regarded as prolific colonisers of immersed surfaces-often have a flattened (adnate) cell shape and an approximately elliptical outline or footprint that allows them to closely contact the substratum. Adoption of this shape may give these cells a number of advantages as they colonise surfaces, such as a higher packing fraction for colonies on a surface for more efficient use of limited space, or an increased contact between individual cells when cell abundances are high, enabling the cells to minimize energy use and maximize packing (and biofilm) stability on a surface. Here, the outline shapes of individual diatom cells are measured using scanning electron and epifluorescence microscopy to discover if the average cell shape compares favourably with those predicted by theoretical modelling of efficient 2-D ellipse packing. It is found that the aspect ratio of measured cells in close association in a biofilm-which are broadly elliptical in shape-do indeed fall within the range theoretically predicted for optimal packing, but that the shape of individual diatoms also differ subtly from that of a true ellipse. The significance of these differences for optimal packing of 2-D shapes on surfaces is not understood at present, but may represent an opportunity to further explore bio-inspired design shapes for the optimal packing of shapes on surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Timothy Sullivan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"biomimetics"},{"word":"diatoms"},{"word":"ellipse"},{"word":"interfaces"},{"word":"optimal packing"}]},"article286":{"pmid":"31105160","title":"Antimicrobial potential of bismuth lipophilic nanoparticles embedded into chitosan-based membrane.","abs":"The objective of this work was to analyze the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of bismuth lipophilic nanoparticles (BisBAL NPs) incorporated into chitosan-based membranes.

Meanwhile, electrically nonconductive extracellular polysaccharide-dominated interior layers were formed in the biofilms grown at 0.4 and 0.6 V, which limited direct EET but might serve as physical barriers for protecting cells in these biofilms from the increasing stress by poised electrodes.

Even pan drug-resistant strains have been reported in some countries. The intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rate ranged from 45.6% to 60.9% and it is as high as 84.3% when ventilator-associated pneumonia was caused by XDR (extensively drug resistant) A. baumannii. Acinetobacter baumannii constituted 9.4% of all Gram-negative organisms throughout the hospital and 22.6% in the ICUs according to a study carried out in an Indian hospital. One of the major factors contributing to drug resistance in A. baumannii infections is biofilm development. Quorum sensing (QS) facilitates biofilm formation and therefore the search for 'quorum quenchers' has increased recently. Such compounds are expected to inhibit biofilm formation and hence reduce/prevent development of drug resistance in the bacteria. Some of these compounds also target synthesis of some virulence factors (VF). Several candidate drugs have been identified and are at various stages of drug development. Since quorum quenching, inhibition of biofilm formation and inhibition of VF synthesis do not pose any threat to the DNA replication and cell division of the bacteria, chances of resistance development to such compounds is presumably rare. Thus, these compounds ideally qualify as adjunct therapeutics and could be administered along with an antibiotic to reduce chances of resistance development and also to increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. This review describes the state-of-art in QS process in Gram-negative bacteria in general and in A. baumannii in particular. This article elaborates the nature of QS mediators, their characteristics, and the methods for their detection and quantification.

This secretion system has emerged as a key player in regulating the microbial diversity in a population. In the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the signalling cascades regulating the activity of this secretion system are poorly understood. Here, we outline how the universal eubacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP impacts the production of T6SS toxins and T6SS structural components. We demonstrate that this has a significant impact on the ability of the phytopathogen to compete with other bacterial species in vitro and in planta. Our results suggest that, as opposed to other bacteria, c-di-GMP turns down the T6SS in A. tumefaciens thus impacting its ability to compete with other bacterial species within the rhizosphere. We also demonstrate that elevated levels of c-di-GMP within the cell decrease the activity of the Type IV secretion system (T4SS) and subsequently the capacity of A. tumefaciens to transform plant cells. We propose that such peculiar control reflects on c-di-GMP being a key second messenger that silences energy-costing systems during early colonization phase and biofilm formation, while low c-di-GMP levels unleash T6SS and T4SS to advance plant colonization.","authors":[{"name":"Ronan R McCarthy"},{"name":"Manda Yu"},{"name":"Kira Eilers"},{"name":"Yi-Chieh Wang"},{"name":"Erh-Min Lai"},{"name":"Alain Filloux"}],"keywords":[]},"article303":{"pmid":"31102321","title":"Tropodithietic acid induces oxidative stress response, cell envelope biogenesis and iron uptake in Vibrio vulnificus.","abs":"The Roseobacter group is a widespread marine bacterial group, of which some species produce the broad-spectrum antibiotic tropodithietic acid (TDA). A mode of action for TDA has previously been proposed in Escherichia coli, but little is known about its effect on non-producing marine bacteria at in situ concentrations. The purpose of this study was to investigate how a sub-lethal level of TDA affects Vibrio vulnificus at different time points (30 and 60 min) using a transcriptomic approach. Exposure to TDA for as little as 30 min resulted in the differential expression of genes associated with cell regeneration, including the up-regulation of those involved in biogenesis of the cell envelope. Defence mechanisms including oxidative stress defence proteins and iron uptake systems were also up-regulated in response to TDA, while motility-related genes were down-regulated. Gene expression data and scanning electron microscopy imaging revealed a switch to a biofilm phenotype in the presence of TDA. Our study shows that a low concentration of this antibiotic triggers a defence response to reactive oxygen species and iron depletion in V. vulnificus, which indicates that the mode of action of TDA is likely more complex in this bacterium than what is known for E. coli.","authors":[{"name":"Karen K Dittmann"},{"name":"Cisse H Porsby"},{"name":"Priscila Goncalves"},{"name":"Ramona Valentina Mateiu"},{"name":"Eva C Sonnenschein"},{"name":"Mikkel Bentzon-Tilia"},{"name":"Suhelen Egan"},{"name":"Lone Gram"}],"keywords":[]},"article304":{"pmid":"31101943","title":"Peptide dendrimers G3KL and TNS18 inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.","abs":"Herein we report that peptide dendrimers G3KL and TNS18, which were recently reported to control multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, strongly inhibit biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa PA14 below their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value, under which conditions they also strongly affect swarming motility.

The antibacterial agents comprise a quorum sensing inhibitor (5,6-dimethyl-2-aminobenzimidazole, DMABI) and two antibiotics (erythromycin and rifampicin), and the cyclodextrin nanocarriers were tested on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive).

These antibacterial compounds loaded in the CD-GLU and CD-MAN carriers were somewhat less effective in eradicating Staphylococcus aureus biofilm as compared to Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm.

Many of these peptides disturb cells by forming pores in the plasma membrane that eventually lead to the cell death. The complexity of these peptide-lipid interactions is mainly related to electrostatic, hydrophobic and topological issues of these counterparts. Diverse studies have shed some light on how AMPs act on lipid bilayers composed by different phospholipids, and how mechanical properties of membranes could affect the antimicrobial effects of such compounds. On the other hand, cyclic lipopeptides (cLPs), an important class of microbial secondary metabolites, have received comparatively less attention. Due to their amphipathic structures, cLPs exhibit interesting biological activities including interactions with biofilms, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, antiviral, and anti-tumoral properties, which deserve more investigation. Understanding how physicochemical properties of lipid bilayers contribute and determining the antagonistic activity of these secondary metabolites over a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens could establish a framework to design and select effective strategies of biological control. This implies unravelling-at the biophysical level-the complex interactions established between cLPs and lipid bilayers.

Among the three lectins examined in this study (concanavalin A [Con A], wheat germ agglutinin [WGA] and peanut agglutinin [PNA]), PNA substantially increased the accumulated intracellular and extracellular iron content. The binding of PNA and Con A to M. aeruginosa cells was visualized via fluorescence microscopy using a lectin adjunct with fluorescein isothiocyanate, and resulted in carbohydrate and protein accumulation in the cellular capsule. Given that the highest carbohydrate accumulation was seen in the Con A system (where iron accumulation was relatively lower), carbohydrate quality is likely important factor that influences cellular iron accumulation. Since PNA specifically binds to sugars such as galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, these saccharide species could be important candidates for intracellular and extracellular iron accumulation and transport. Microcystin biosynthesis was stimulated in the presence of PNA and WGA, whereas cellular iron uptake increased only in the presence of PNA. Thus, the iron uptake was not necessarily congruent with the upregulation of microcystin synthesis, which suggested that the positive effect of lectin on iron uptake is probably attributable to the PNA-assisted iron accumulation around the cell surface. Overall, the present study provides insights into the interactions of lectin that influence cellular metabolic activities such as iron uptake, extracellular polymeric substance accumulation, and toxin production.","authors":[{"name":"Tomoko Takaara"},{"name":"Shiori Sasaki"},{"name":"Manabu Fujii"},{"name":"Hiroaki Ito"},{"name":"Yoshifumi Masago"},{"name":"Tatsuo Omura"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Iron uptake"},{"word":"Lectin"},{"word":"Microcystis aeruginosa"},{"word":"Polysaccharide"},{"word":"Toxin production"}]},"article326":{"pmid":"31097026","title":"Metamorphoses of Lyme disease spirochetes: phenomenon of Borrelia persisters.","abs":"The survival of spirochetes from the Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) complex in a hostile environment is achieved by the regulation of differential gene expression in response to changes in temperature, salts, nutrient content, acidity fluctuation, multiple host or vector dependent factors, and leads to the formation of dormant subpopulations of cells. From the other side, alterations in the level of gene expression in response to antibiotic pressure leads to the establishment of a persisters subpopulation. Both subpopulations represent the cells in different physiological states. Dormancy and persistence do share some similarities, e.g. both represent cells with low metabolic activity that can exist for extended periods without replication, both constitute populations with different gene expression profiles and both differ significantly from replicating forms of spirochetes. Persisters are elusive, present in low numbers, morphologically heterogeneous, multi-drug-tolerant cells that can change with the environment. The definition of persisters substituted the originally-used term survivors, referring to the small bacterial population of Staphylococcus that survived killing by penicillin. The phenomenon of persisters is present in almost all bacterial species; however, the reasons why Borrelia persisters form are poorly understood. Persisters can adopt varying sizes and shapes, changing from well-known forms to altered morphologies. They are capable of forming round bodies, L-form bacteria, microcolonies or biofilms-like aggregates, which remarkably change the response of Borrelia to hostile environments. Persisters remain viable despite aggressive antibiotic challenge and are able to reversibly convert into motile forms in a favorable growth environment. Persisters are present in significant numbers in biofilms, which has led to the explanation of biofilm tolerance to antibiotics. Considering that biofilms are associated with numerous chronic diseases through their resilient presence in the human body, it is not surprising that interest in persisting cells has consequently accelerated. Certain diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria (e.g. tuberculosis, syphilis or leprosy) are commonly chronic in nature and often recur despite antibiotic treatment.

Carotenoids are sterol analogs that are important for regulating membrane dynamics. The membrane of Pantoea sp. YR343 is characterized by the presence of the carotenoid zeaxanthin, and a carotenoid-deficient mutant, ΔcrtB, displays defects in root colonization, reduced secretion of indole-3-acetic acid, and defects in biofilm formation. Here we demonstrate that the loss of carotenoids results in changes to the membrane lipid composition in Pantoea sp. YR343, including increased amounts of unsaturated fatty acids in the ΔcrtB mutant membranes. These mutant cells displayed less fluid membranes in comparison to wild type cells as measured by fluorescence anisotropy of whole cells. Studies with artificial systems, however, have shown that carotenoids impart membrane rigidifying properties. Thus, we examined membrane fluidity using spheroplasts and vesicles composed of lipids extracted from either wild type or mutant cells. Interestingly, with the removal of the cell wall and membrane proteins, ΔcrtB vesicles were more fluid than vesicles made from lipids extracted from wild type cells. In addition, carotenoids appeared to stabilize membrane fluidity during rapidly changing temperatures. Taken together, these results suggest that Pantoea sp. YR343 compensates for the loss of carotenoids by changing lipid composition, which together with membrane proteins, results in reduced membrane fluidity. These changes may influence the abundance or function of membrane proteins that are responsible for the physiological changes observed in the ΔcrtB mutant cells.","authors":[{"name":"Sushmitha Vijaya Kumar"},{"name":"Graham Taylor"},{"name":"Sahar Hasim"},{"name":"C Patrick Collier"},{"name":"Abigail T Farmer"},{"name":"Shawn R Campagna"},{"name":"Amber N Bible"},{"name":"Mitchel J Doktycz"},{"name":"Jennifer Morrell-Falvey"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Atomic force microscopy"},{"word":"Fluorescence anisotropy"},{"word":"Membrane fluidity"},{"word":"Pantoea"},{"word":"Zeaxanthin"}]},"article334":{"pmid":"31095643","title":"Evaluation of biological and enzymatic quorum quencher coating additives to reduce biocorrosion of steel.","abs":"Microbial colonization can be detrimental to the integrity of metal surfaces and lead to microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC).

We also evaluated a previously engineered, extremely stable, non-biocidal enzyme known to interfere in bacterial signaling, SsoPox (a quorum quenching lactonase). Experimental steel coupons were submerged in water from the Duluth Superior Harbor (DSH) for 8 weeks in the laboratory. Biocorrosion was evaluated by counting the number and the coverage of corrosion tubercles on coupons and also by ESEM imaging of the coupon surface. Three experimental coating additives significantly reduced the formation of corrosion tubercles: surfactin, magnesium peroxide and the quorum quenching lactonase by 31%, 36% and 50%, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that these decreases in corrosion were associated with significant changes in the composition of bacterial communities on the steel surfaces.

From June-November, we performed monthly short-term additions of leached Cry1Ab into four experimental streams with varying benthic substrate to estimate Cry1Ab transport and removal. At the start of the experiments, when rocks were bare, we found no evidence of Cry1Ab removal from the water column, but uptake steadily increased as biofilm colonized the stream substrate. Overall, Cry1Ab uptake was strongly predicted by measures of biofilm accumulation, including algal chlorophyll a and percent cover of filamentous algae. Average Cry1Ab uptake velocity (vf = 0.059 ± 0.009 mm s-1) was comparable to previously reported uptake of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC; mean vf = 0.04 ± 0.008 mm s-1). Although Cry1Ab has been shown to rapidly degrade in stream water, benthic biofilms may decrease the distance proteins are transported in lotic systems.

In this addendum, we discuss the interconnected role of a healthy mucus barrier and the role commensal microbiota play in shaping innate host defense against Eh-induced pro-inflammatory and secretory responses critical in disease pathogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Aralia Leon-Coria"},{"name":"Manish Kumar"},{"name":"Kris Chadee"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Entamoeba histolytica"},{"word":"Muc2 mucin"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"goblet cell"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"mucosal epithelium"},{"word":"mucus"},{"word":"pro-inflammatory cytokines"},{"word":"secretion"}]},"article345":{"pmid":"31090140","title":"Nonneoplastic diseases and disorders of the oral mucosa: A contemporary overview.","abs":"Oral mucosal diseases encompass a diverse array of conditions and disorders arising from malignant, potentially malignant, and nonneoplastic processes. Considerable attention has been paid to the former in recent years, much less to the wide range of nonneoplastic disease processes, which constitute a sizeable proportion of the oral disease burden globally. Many nonneoplastic disease processes of the oral mucosa significantly affect the patient's quality of life. Fortunately, timely identification and intervention can reduce the associated morbidity and, sometimes, mortality. As such, it is of utmost importance that dentists are familiar with early identification and management of this wide range of oral mucosal diseases. This volume of Periodontology 2000 provides a comprehensive contemporary review of such diseases and disorders through 15 chapters. We cover all relevant disease categories: developmental anomalies, infections, white and red lesions, vesiculo-bullous diseases, oral dermatoses, oral ulcerative conditions, dysplastic lesions, and mucosal diseases as manifestations of systemic disease or oral lesions as a part of systemic diseases. Each chapter discusses epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management. Controversies and many significant gaps in knowledge are exposed, with suggestions for research to address limitations in current understandings. We take a look at the 2017 classification of the periodontal diseases and discuss the importance of close liaison between the specialties of oral medicine and of periodontology in the management of the many oral diseases, apart from the common forms primarily related to oral biofilm, affecting the gingivae and other parts of the periodontium.","authors":[{"name":"Anura Ariyawardana"},{"name":"Newell W Johnson"}],"keywords":[]},"article346":{"pmid":"31089795","title":"The OmpA Gene of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines is Involved in Pathogenesis of Pustule Disease on Soybean.","abs":"The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of the outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines in bacterial pustule pathogenesis of soybean.

In the environment, free-living amoebae represent key hosts providing nutrients and shelter for highly efficient intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila, which eventually leads to lysis of the protist. However, the significance of other bacterial players for L. pneumophila ecology is poorly understood. In this study, we used a ubiquitous amoeba and bacterial endosymbiont to investigate the impact of this common association on L. pneumophila infection. We demonstrate that L. pneumophila proliferation was severely suppressed in Acanthamoeba castellanii harboring the chlamydial symbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila The amoebae survived the infection and were able to resume growth. Different environmental amoeba isolates containing the symbiont were equally well protected as different L. pneumophila isolates were diminished, suggesting ecological relevance of this symbiont-mediated defense. Furthermore, protection was not mediated by impaired L. pneumophila uptake. Instead, we observed reduced virulence of L. pneumophila released from symbiont-containing amoebae. Pronounced gene expression changes in the presence of the symbiont indicate that interference with the transition to the transmissive phase impedes the L. pneumophila infection. Finally, our data show that the defensive response of amoebae harboring P. amoebophila leaves the amoebae with superior fitness reminiscent of immunological memory. Given that mutualistic associations between bacteria and amoebae are widely distributed, P. amoebophila and potentially other amoeba endosymbionts could be key in shaping environmental survival, abundance, and virulence of this important pathogen, thereby affecting the frequency of human infection.","authors":[{"name":"Lena König"},{"name":"Cecilia Wentrup"},{"name":"Frederik Schulz"},{"name":"Florian Wascher"},{"name":"Sarah Escola"},{"name":"Michele S Swanson"},{"name":"Carmen Buchrieser"},{"name":"Matthias Horn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Legionella"},{"word":"amoeba"},{"word":"antimicrobial defense"},{"word":"coinfection"},{"word":"endosymbionts"},{"word":"protists"}]},"article353":{"pmid":"31088827","title":"Functional Amyloids.","abs":"When protein/peptides aggregate, they usually form the amyloid state consisting of cross β-sheet structure built by repetitively stacked β-strands forming long fibrils.

Accordingly, amyloid is used by nature in multifaceted and ingenious ways of life, ranging from bacteria and fungi to mammals. These include (1) Structure: Templating for small chemical molecules (Pmel17), biofilm formation in bacteria (curli), assisting aerial hyphae formation in streptomycetes (chaplins) or monolayer formation at a surface (hydrophobins). (2) Reservoirs: A storage state for peptide/proteins to protect them from their surroundings or vice versa (storage of peptide hormones in mammalian secretory granules or major basic protein in eosinophils).

The restoration of PAH-polluted sites considers the use of bacteria capable of degrading aromatic compounds to carbon dioxide and water. Here we characterize a new Xanthobacteraceae strain, Starkeya sp. strain N1B, previously isolated during enrichment under microaerophilic conditions, which is capable of using naphthalene crystals as the sole carbon source. The strain produced a structured biofilm when grown on naphthalene crystals, which had the shape of a half-sphere organized over the crystal. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and GC-MS analysis indicated that the biofilm was essentially made of cellulose, composed of several micron-long nanofibrils of 60 nm diameter. A cellulosic biofilm was also formed when the cells grew with glucose as the carbon source. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed that the polymer was type I cellulose in both cases, although the crystallinity of the material greatly depended on the carbon source used for growth. Using genome mining and mutant analysis, we identified the genetic complements required for the transformation of naphthalene into cellulose, which seemed to have been successively acquired through horizontal gene transfer.

A ΔprkC mutant was able to sporulate and germinate but was less motile and formed more biofilm than the wild-type strain. Moreover, a ΔprkC mutant was more sensitive to antimicrobial compounds that target the cell envelope, such as the secondary bile salt deoxycholate, cephalosporins, cationic antimicrobial peptides, and lysozyme. This increased susceptibility was not associated with differences in peptidoglycan or polysaccharide II composition.

Although most GAS serotypes are able to form biofilms, there is a large amount of heterogeneity between individual strains in biofilm formation, as measured by standard crystal violet assays. It is generally accepted that biofilm formation includes the initial adhesion of bacterial cells to a surface followed by microcolony formation, biofilm maturation, and extensive production of extracellular matrix that links together proliferating cells and provides a scaffold for the three-dimensional (3D) biofilm structure. However, our studies show that for GAS strain JS95, microcolony formation is not an essential step in static biofilm formation, and instead, biofilm can be effectively formed from slow-growing or nonreplicating late-exponential- or early-stationary-phase planktonic cells via sedimentation and fixation of GAS chains. In addition, we show that the GAS capsule specifically contributes to the alternative sedimentation-initiated biofilms. Microcolony-independent sedimentation biofilms are similar in morphology and 3D structure to biofilms initiated by actively dividing planktonic bacteria. We conclude that GAS can form biofilms by an alternate noncanonical mechanism that does not require transition from microcolony formation to biofilm maturation and which may be obscured by biofilm phenotypes that arise via the classical biofilm maturation processes.","authors":[{"name":"Artur Matysik"},{"name":"Kimberly A Kline"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus pyogenes"},{"word":"adherence"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"capsule"},{"word":"group A streptococcus"},{"word":"static biofilm assay"}]},"article377":{"pmid":"31085473","title":"Do transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) affect the toxicity of nanoplastics on Chaetoceros neogracile?","abs":"The potential presence of nanoplastics (NP) in aquatic environments represents a growing concern regarding their possible effects on aquatic organisms.

Definition of High-Grade and Low-Grade Peri-Prosthetic Joint Infection.","abs":"The definition of peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI) has a strong impact on the diagnostic pathway and on treatment decisions. In the last decade, at least five different definitions of peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI) have been proposed, each one with intrinsic limitations. In order to move a step forward, the World Association against Infection in Orthopedics and Trauma (W.A.I.O.T.) has studied a possible alternative solution, based on three parameters: 1. the relative ability of each diagnostic test or procedure to Rule OUT and/or to Rule IN a PJI; 2. the clinical presentation; 3. the distinction between pre/intra-operative findings and post-operative confirmation. According to the WAIOT definition, any positive Rule IN test (a test with a specificity > 90%) scores +1, while a negative Rule OUT test (a test with a sensitivity > 90%) scores -1. When a minimum of two Rule IN and two Rule OUT tests are performed in a given patient, the balance between positive and negative tests, interpreted in the light of the clinical presentation and of the post-operative findings, allows to identify five different conditions: High-Grade PJI (score ≥ 1), Low-Grade PJI (≥0), Biofilm-related implant malfunction, Contamination and No infection (all scoring < 0). The proposed definition leaves the physician free to choose among different tests with similar sensitivity or specificity, on the basis of medical, logistical and economic considerations, while novel tests or diagnostic procedures can be implemented in the definition at any time, provided that they meet the required sensitivity and/or specificity thresholds. Key procedures to confirm or to exclude the diagnosis of PJI remain post-operative histological and microbiological analysis; in this regard, given the biofilm-related nature of PJI, microbiological investigations should be conducted with proper sampling, closed transport systems, antibiofilm processing of tissue samples and explanted biomaterials, and prolonged cultures. The proposed WAIOT definition is the result of an international, multidisciplinary effort.

Onychomycosis in HIV/AIDS patients showed a high prevalence of emerging yeasts, among which C. parapsilosis complex species and K. ohmeri were the most frequent. Three C. parapsilosis sensu stricto and two C. orthopsilosis isolates were resistant to amphotericin B and 83% of isolates were resistant to terbinafine.

All isolates adhered to stainless steel and siliconized latex surfaces, and carbohydrates intensified adhesion of all isolates. Isolates adhered to keratinous nail and 50% formed biofilms with strong intensity. In multispecies or polymicrobial biofilms, C. albicans and Staphylococcus aureus regulated the biofilm formation of the analyzed species, decreasing the number of their cells in biofilms.

Understanding the sequence characterization of fungal adhesins may facilitate a better understanding of its role in pathogenesis. Experimental methods for investigation and characterization of fungal adhesins are labor intensive and expensive. Therefore, there is a need for fast and efficient computational methods for the identification and characterization of fungal adhesins.

Of the many supervised learning algorithms implemented in the current study, voting ensembles resulted in enhanced prediction accuracy. The best voting-ensemble consisting of three support vector machines with three different kernels (PolyK, RBF, PuK) achieved an accuracy of 94.9% on leave one out cross validation and 98.0% accuracy on blind testing set.

The diversity of alpine stream biota is largely reflective of environmental heterogeneity stemming from varying hydrological sources. Globally, alpine stream diversity is under threat as meltwater sources recede and stream conditions become increasingly homogeneous. Much attention has been devoted to macroinvertebrate diversity in alpine headwaters, yet to fully understand the breadth of climate change threats, a more thorough accounting of microbial diversity is needed. We characterized microbial diversity (specifically Bacteria and Archaea) of 13 streams in two disjunct Rocky Mountain subranges through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our study encompassed the spectrum of alpine stream sources (glaciers, snowfields, subterranean ice, and groundwater) and three microhabitats (ice, biofilms, and streamwater). We observed no difference in regional (γ) diversity between subranges but substantial differences in diversity among (β) stream types and microhabitats. Within-stream (α) diversity was highest in groundwater-fed springs, lowest in glacier-fed streams, and positively correlated with water temperature for both streamwater and biofilm assemblages. We identified an underappreciated alpine stream type-the icy seep-that are fed by subterranean ice, exhibit cold temperatures (summer mean <2°C), moderate bed stability, and relatively high conductivity. Icy seeps will likely be important for combatting biodiversity losses as they contain similar microbial assemblages to streams fed by surface ice yet may be buffered against climate change by insulating debris cover. Our results show that the patterns of microbial diversity support an ominous trend for alpine stream biodiversity; as meltwater sources decline, stream communities will become more diverse locally, but regional diversity will be lost.

In this study, we observed that translucent variants were generated at a rate of ∼20% in colony biofilms of P. lipolytica cultured on HSLB agar plates for 12 days. The DNA sequencing results revealed that nearly 90% of these variants had an IS5-like element inserted within the coding or promoter regions of nine genes in the cps operon. In contrast, IS5 insertion into the cps operon was not detected in planktonic cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the IS5 insertion event inactivated CPS production, which leads to a translucent colony morphology. The CPS-deficient variants showed an increased ability to form attached biofilms but exhibited reduced resistance to sublethal concentrations of antibiotics.

These secreted enzymes can mediate nutrient acquisition, biofilm assembly, and V. cholerae interactions with its host. We recently identified a V. cholerae-secreted serine protease, IvaP, that is active in V. cholerae-infected rabbits and human choleric stool. IvaP alters the activity of several host and pathogen enzymes in the gut and, along with other secreted V. cholerae proteases, decreases binding of intelectin, an intestinal carbohydrate-binding protein, to V. cholerae in vivo IvaP bears homology to subtilisin-like enzymes, a large family of serine proteases primarily comprised of secreted endopeptidases. Following secretion, IvaP is cleaved at least three times to yield a truncated enzyme with serine hydrolase activity, yet little is known about the mechanism of extracellular maturation. Here, we show that IvaP maturation requires a series of sequential N- and C-terminal cleavage events congruent with the enzyme's mosaic protein domain structure. Using a catalytically inactive reporter protein, we determined that IvaP can be partially processed in trans, but intramolecular proteolysis is most likely required to generate the mature enzyme. Unlike many other subtilisin-like enzymes, the IvaP cleavage pattern is consistent with stepwise processing of the N-terminal propeptide, which could temporarily inhibit, and be cleaved by, the purified enzyme. Furthermore, IvaP was able to cleave purified intelectin, which inhibited intelectin binding to V. cholerae These results suggest that IvaP plays a role in modulating intelectin-V. cholerae interactions.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Howell"},{"name":"Daniel G Dumitrescu"},{"name":"Lauren R Blankenship"},{"name":"Darby Herkert"},{"name":"Stavroula K Hatzios"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"cholera"},{"word":"host-pathogen interaction"},{"word":"intelectin"},{"word":"lectin"},{"word":"pathogenesis"},{"word":"serine protease"},{"word":"subtilisin"}]},"article419":{"pmid":"31076438","title":"Motility-Independent Formation of Antibiotic-Tolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aggregates.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterial pathogen that causes severe chronic infections in immunocompromised individuals. This bacterium is highly adaptable to its environments, which frequently select for traits that promote bacterial persistence. A clinically significant temporal adaptation is the formation of surface- or cell-adhered bacterial biofilms that are associated with increased resistance to immune and antibiotic clearance. Extensive research has shown that bacterial flagellar motility promotes formation of such biofilms, whereupon the bacteria subsequently become nonmotile. However, recent evidence shows that antibiotic-tolerant nonattached bacterial aggregates, distinct from surface-adhered biofilms, can form, and these have been reported in the context of lung infections, otitis media, nonhealing wounds, and soft tissue fillers. It is unclear whether the same bacterial traits are required for aggregate formation as for biofilm formation. In this report, using isogenic mutants, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa aggregates in liquid cultures are spontaneously formed independent of bacterial flagellar motility and independent of an exogenous scaffold. This contrasts with the role of the flagellum to initiate surface-adhered biofilms. Similarly to surface-attached biofilms, these aggregates exhibit increased antibiotic tolerance compared to planktonic cultures. These findings provide key insights into the requirements for aggregate formation that contrast with those for biofilm formation and that may have relevance for the persistence and dissemination of nonmotile bacteria found within chronic clinical infections.","authors":[{"name":"Sally Demirdjian"},{"name":"Hector Sanchez"},{"name":"Daniel Hopkins"},{"name":"Brent Berwin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"aggregates"},{"word":"antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"biofilms"}]},"article420":{"pmid":"31076428","title":"Effects of Sublethal Thymol, Carvacrol, and trans-Cinnamaldehyde Adaptation on Virulence Properties of Escherichia coli O157:H7.","abs":"Essential oils (EOs) have demonstrated wide-spectrum antimicrobial activities and have been actively studied for their application in foods as alternative natural preservatives.

In this study, the CRISPR-Cas9 system was used to construct the Escherichia coli MG1655ΔqseB strain (strain ΔqseB), and the effects of the qseB gene on changes in motility and biofilm formation in the wild type (WT) were determined. The motility assay results showed that the ΔqseB strain had higher (p < 0.05) motility than the WT strain. However, there was no difference in the formation of biofilm between the ΔqseB and WT strains. Real-time quantitative PCR illustrated that deletion of qseB in the WT strain downregulated expression of the type I pili gene fimA.

Children are at greater risk and suffer most frequently from OM, which can cause serious deterioration in the quality of life. OM is generally classified into two main types: acute and chronic OM (AOM and COM). AOM is characterized by tympanic membrane swelling or otorrhea and is accompanied by signs or symptoms of ear infection. In COM, there is a tympanic membrane perforation and purulent discharge. The most common pathogens that cause AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are commonly associated with COM. Innate and adaptive immune responses provide protection against OM. However, pathogens employ a wide arsenal of weapons to evade potent immune responses and these mechanisms likely contribute to AOM and COM. Immunologic evasion is multifactorial, and involves damage to host mucociliary tract, genetic polymorphisms within otopathogens, the number and variety of different otopathogens in the nasopharynx as well as the interaction between the host's innate and adaptive immune responses. Otopathogens utilize host mucin production, phase variation, biofilm production, glycans, as well as neutrophil and eosinophilic extracellular traps to induce OM. The objective of this review article is to discuss our current understanding about the mechanisms through which otopathogens escape host immunity to induce OM. A better knowledge about the molecular mechanisms leading to subversion of host immune responses will provide novel clues to develop effective treatment modalities for OM.","authors":[{"name":"James M Parrish"},{"name":"Manasi Soni"},{"name":"Rahul Mittal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Otitis media"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"chronic suppurative otitis media"},{"word":"defensins"},{"word":"immune responses"},{"word":"otopathogens"},{"word":"phase variation"}]},"article426":{"pmid":"31075124","title":"Bacterial community dynamics in lait caillé, a traditional product of spontaneous fermentation from Senegal.","abs":"Spontaneously fermented food products contain a complex, natural microbial community with potential probiotic activity.

We produced the lait caillé in a traditional way and added a probiotic starter containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 to the traditional process. We found various species that are known for their ability to ferment milk, including species from the genera Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus. Our results show that the addition of L. rhamnosus to the inoculum, can result in detectable levels of this strain in the final product, ranging between 0.2 and 1 percent of the total bacterial population. Subsequent rounds of fermentation using passive back-slopping without the addition of new L. rhamnosus led to a loss of this strain from the community of fermenting bacteria.

Collected maize root exudates significantly induced the chemotaxis, cluster movement, and biofilm formation of strain S3-1, showing increases of 1.43, 1.6, and 2.08 times, respectively, compared with the control. In addition, the components of root exudates (organic acids: citric acid, malic acid, and oxalic acid; amino acids: glycine, proline and phenylalanine; sugars: glucose, fructose, and sucrose) were tested. Each of these compounds could induce chemotactic response, swarming motility, and biofilm formation significantly. The strongest chemotactic response and swarming motility were found when malic acid was applied, but maximal ability of biofilm formation was stimulated by proline. Furthermore, we found that these compounds of root exudates stimulated the population of S3-1 adhering to the maize root surface, especially in the presence of malic acid. These results indicate that maize root exudates play an important role in the colonization of S3-1, and provide a deeper understanding of the interaction between plants and microorganisms.","authors":[{"name":"Yeqing Jin"},{"name":"Hangfei Zhu"},{"name":"Si Luo"},{"name":"Wenwu Yang"},{"name":"Li Zhang"},{"name":"Shanshan Li"},{"name":"Qing Jin"},{"name":"Qin Cao"},{"name":"Shurong Sun"},{"name":"Ming Xiao"}],"keywords":[]},"article431":{"pmid":"31073298","title":"Attenuation of Multiple Vibrio parahaemolyticus Virulence Factors by Citral.","abs":"Citral was known as a widely used food additive with antimicrobial activity; however, whether it can be a potential therapy for controlling bacterial virulence with less risk of antimicrobial resistance remains to be investigated.

A growing literature has focused on the microbial life growing on the surfaces of these pollutants called the plastisphere, but the general concepts of microbial ecotoxicology have only rarely been integrated. Microbial ecotoxicology deals with (i) the impact of pollutants on microbial communities and inversely (ii) how much microbes can influence their biodegradation. The goal of this review is to enlighten the growing literature of the last 15 years on microbial ecotoxicology related to plastic pollution in the oceans. First, we focus on the impact of plastic on marine microbial life and on the various functions it ensures in the ecosystems. In this part, we also discuss the driving factors influencing biofilm development on plastic surfaces and the potential role of plastic debris as vector for dispersal of harmful pathogen species. Second, we give a critical view of the extent to which marine microorganisms can participate in the decomposition of plastic in the oceans and of the relevance of current standard tests for plastic biodegradability at sea. We highlight some examples of metabolic pathways of polymer biodegradation. We conclude with several questions regarding gaps in current knowledge of plastic biodegradation by marine microorganisms and the identification of possible directions for future research.","authors":[{"name":"Justine Jacquin"},{"name":"Jingguang Cheng"},{"name":"Charlène Odobel"},{"name":"Caroline Pandin"},{"name":"Pascal Conan"},{"name":"Mireille Pujo-Pay"},{"name":"Valérie Barbe"},{"name":"Anne-Leila Meistertzheim"},{"name":"Jean-François Ghiglione"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biodegradation"},{"word":"colonization"},{"word":"marine plastics debris"},{"word":"metabolic pathways"}]},"article433":{"pmid":"31073296","title":"Effect of Dissolved Oxygen Concentration on the Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion of Q235 Carbon Steel by Halophilic Archaeon Natronorubrum tibetense.","abs":"The influence of dissolved oxygen concentration (DOC) on the microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) of Q235 carbon steel in the culture medium of halophilic archaeon Natronorubrum tibetense was investigated. The increase of DOC from 0.0 to 3.0 ppm was found to strengthen the oxygen concentration cell by promoting cathodic reaction. Meanwhile, the increased DOC also promoted archaeal cell growth, which could consume more metallic iron as energy source and aggravated the localized corrosion. When the DOC further increased to 5.0 ppm, the uniform corrosion was dominant as the biofilms became uniformly presented on the steel surface. Combined with the stronger inhibition effect of oxygen diffusion by the increased biofilm coverage, the MIC of carbon steel in the 5.0 ppm medium was weaker than that in the 3.0 ppm medium. From weight loss and electrochemical tests, the results all demonstrated that the carbon steel in the 3.0 ppm medium had the largest corrosion rate.","authors":[{"name":"Hongchang Qian"},{"name":"Pengfei Ju"},{"name":"Dawei Zhang"},{"name":"Lingwei Ma"},{"name":"Yuting Hu"},{"name":"Ziyu Li"},{"name":"Luyao Huang"},{"name":"Yuntian Lou"},{"name":"Cuiwei Du"}],"keywords":[{"word":"archaea"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"carbon steel"},{"word":"microbiological influenced corrosion"},{"word":"oxygen concentration"}]},"article434":{"pmid":"31072275","title":"Antibacterial behaviour of surface modified composite polyamide nanofiltration (NF) membrane by immobilizing Ag-doped TiO","abs":"Modification of active membrane surface is an auspicious way to enhance the membrane performance.
