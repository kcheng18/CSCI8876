These leukocytes facilitate the establishment and maintenance of local homeostasis but are also capable to cause oral pathologies when are unrestrained. γδT cells represent an important tissue-resident innate T-cell population in various mucosal and nonmucosal barrier tissues, in which they are ideally located to assist in immunosurveillance, tissue repair, and homeostasis. Whereas most works studying γδT cells were focused on tissues such as the skin and intestine, these cells in the oral mucosa were only recently thoroughly studied. The findings obtained by those studies appear to be both complementary and contradicting, likely reflecting differences in the experimental settings and the type of transgenic mouse modalities employed by each study. Nevertheless, oral γδT cells were shown to consist of developmentally distinct tissue-resident Vγ6 cells and circulating Vγ1 and Vγ4 subsets that are independently maintained in the oral mucosa. In the gingiva, a particularly challenging barrier tissue due to its proximity to the dental plaque, γδT cells are strategically positioned close to the plaque and represent the major source of IL-17. While this suggests that γδT cells might be involved in controlling the dental biofilm, conflicting data were reported in this regard. In vivo studies have shown that γδT cells either play a protective role during age-associated bone loss or, alternatively, have no impact in this process. Also, recent reports suggested opposing data concerning the impact of γδT cells in experimental periodontitis based on the ligature model. This review summarizes and discusses the most up-to-date literature on oral γδT cells, providing a balanced perspective regarding our current understanding on the development of oral γδT cells and their role under physiologic conditions and certain oral pathologies.","authors":[{"name":"A H Hovav"},{"name":"A Wilharm"},{"name":"O Barel"},{"name":"I Prinz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"bone loss"},{"word":"gingiva"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"mucosal immunity"},{"word":"periodontal disease(s)/periodontitis"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"32091935","title":"Single-Cell Genomics and the Oral Microbiome.","abs":"The human oral cavity is one of the first environments where microbes have been discovered and studied since the dawn of microbiology.

However, the detailed functions of this operon and the relationships among its constituent genes are unknown.

The effects of lysozyme (hydrolytic enzyme) and proteinase K (protease) on biofilm formation were evaluated at different concentrations. Lysozyme (30 μg/mL), but not proteinase K, significantly inhibited biofilm formation (19% inhibition).

HGF-1 and THP-1 cells were exposed either to F. alocis or to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) for 1 and 2 d to examine the COX2 expression by qPCR. COX2 protein levels were evaluated by ELISA in F. alocis-stimulated cells. Both types of cells were also stimulated with a blocking toll-like receptor (TLR)2 antibody or specific inhibitors against MAPKs. F. alocis significantly (p < 0.05) increased COX2 at both transcriptional and protein levels in both HGF-1 and THP-1 cells. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of F. alocis on COX2 was more pronounced in HGF-1 cells in comparison to THP-1 cells. F. alocis upregulated the COX2 expression in a dose-dependent manner in both type cells at 1 d. TNFα also significantly (p < 0.05) increased the COX2 expression in both cells.

These coefficients coupled with inactivation kinetics of L. pneumophila released from biofilms reported previously were integrated into a Monte Carlo framework to estimate the infection risk of biofilm-derived L. pneumophila from 1 to 48 h of stagnation. The annual infection risk was significantly higher when water stayed stagnant for up to 48 h in pipes covered internally with biofilms, compared to clean pipes without biofilms. The decay of residual chlorine due to biofilms during 48-hour stagnation led to up to 6 times increase in the annual infection risk compared to the case where biofilms was absent. Global sensitivity analysis revealed that the rate of L. pneumophila detachment from biofilms and the decay of chlorine residual during stagnation are the two most important factors influencing the infection risks. Stagnation caused by water use patterns and water-saving devices in the premise plumbing can lead to increased infection risk by biofilm-derived L. pneumophila.

However, the functions of all Csps in R. solanacearum remain unclear. According to phylogenetic analysis, the Csps from R. solanacearum are clustered into a group with CspD from E. coli. Here, we studied the role of CspD3, which was closer to CspD of E. coli in the phylogenetic tree. A cspD3 deletion strain was constructed to assess its effect on the phenotype of R. solanacearum, including growth, biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. The results showed that cspD3 of R. solanacearum was not necessary for normal growth, cold-shock adaptation, or biofilm formation. However, deletion of cspD3 in R. solanacearum CQPS-1 led to increased swimming motility, and the mean diameters of swimming haloes produced by the ΔcspD3 mutant were 1.3-fold larger than those produced by wild-type strain and 1.2-fold larger than those produced by the complemented strain.

Under static conditions, pH dropped in the biofilms, with pronounced differences between individual biofilms, but also between different microscopic fields of view within one biofilm. pH in the top layer of the biofilms tended to be lower than pH in the bottom layer. Under conditions of stimulated saliva flow (5 mm/min), pH rose to neutral or slightly alkaline values in all biofilms, and the vertical gradients were reversed, with the biofilm bottom becoming more acidic than the top. Hence, the present work demonstrates the importance of flow for the study of pH in dental biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Mathilde Frost Kristensen"},{"name":"Dirk Leonhardt"},{"name":"Merethe Louise Bønneland Neland"},{"name":"Sebastian Schlafer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3D-print"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Confocal microscopy"},{"word":"Extracellular pH"},{"word":"Flow-cell"},{"word":"Microfluidic device"}]},"article23":{"pmid":"32086747","title":"Inhibition of quorum sensing-associated virulence factors and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 by Mycoleptodiscus indicus PUTY1.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the second most emerging multidrug-resistant, opportunistic pathogen after Acinetobacter baumannii that poses a threat in nursing homes, hospitals, and patients who need devices such as ventilators and blood catheters.

Heterogeneous polysaccharides form a major constituent of the EPS and are crucial for the formation and integrity of the biofilms/slime. Thus, breakdown of polysaccharides might help in dispersion of biofilms from abiotic surfaces. In the present study we isolated a fungus, Aspergillus niger APS, capable of concurrently producing a cocktail of carbohydrases and optimized the conditions for higher yields of all the enzymes by one variable at a time (OVAT) approach. The optimization studies resulted in 1.5 to 12 fold augmentation in the enzyme yields using biodegradable waste. Further, keeping in view the heterogeneous nature of polysaccharides in biofilm matrix, the in-house produced enzyme cocktail was used for the dispersal of biofilms formed by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment with enzyme preparation caused 90.23 ± 4.0, 82.64 ± 5.0 and 76.32 ± 5.0% reduction of the biofilms formed by these organisms respectively which was also evidenced by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealing the loss of biofilm architecture.

The exponential rise of pest resistances to different chemical pesticides and the global appeal of consumers for a sustainable agriculture and healthy nutrition have led to the search of new solutions for pest control. Furthermore, new laws require a different stance of producers. Based on that, bacteria of the genus Bacillus present a great agricultural potential, producing lipopeptides (LPs) that have high activity against insects, mites, nematodes, and/or phytopathogens that are harmful to plant cultures. Biopesticide activity can be found mainly in three families of Bacillus lipopeptides: surfactin, iturin, and fengycin. These molecules have an amphiphilic nature, interfering with biological membrane structures. Their antimicrobial properties include activity against bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and viruses. Recent studies also highlight the ability of these compounds to stimulate defense mechanisms of plants and biofilm formation, which is a key factor for the successful colonization of biocontrol organisms. The use of molecular biology has also recently been researched for continuous advances and discoveries of new LPs, avoiding possible future problems of resistance against these molecules.

This screening reveals the presence of competing strains drives up the expression of genes associated with biofilm matrix production (CsgD pathway), epithelial invasion (SPI1 invasion system), and, finally, chemical efflux and antibiotic tolerance (TolC efflux pump and AadA aminoglycoside 3-adenyltransferase). We validate that these regulatory changes result in the predicted phenotypic changes in biofilm, mammalian cell invasion, and antibiotic tolerance. We further show that these responses arise via activation of major stress responses, providing direct support for the competition sensing hypothesis. Moreover, inactivation of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) of a competitor annuls the responses to competition, indicating that T6SS-derived cell damage activates these stress response systems.

Current treatments are ineffective in resolving biofilm and simultaneously killing the bacteria; therefore, effective biofilm-resolving drugs are needed. We have previously shown that, together with α-tocopherol, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) significantly improves the healing of biofilm-containing chronic wounds, in a diabetic mouse model we developed, by causing disappearance of the bacteria and breakdown of the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). We hypothesize that NAC creates a microenvironment that affects bacterial survival and EPS integrity. To test this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro biofilm system using microbiome taken directly from diabetic mouse chronic wounds. For these studies, we chose mice in which chronic wound microbiome was rich in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (97%). We show that NAC at concentrations with pH < pKa causes bacterial cell death and breakdown of EPS. When used before biofilm is formed, NAC leads to bacterial cell death whereas treatment after the biofilm is established NAC causes biofilm dismantling accompanied by bacterial cell death. Mechanistically, we show that NAC can penetrate the bacterial membrane, increase oxidative stress, and halt protein synthesis. We also show that low pH is important for the actions of NAC and that bacterial death occurs independently of the presence of biofilm. In addition, we show that both the acetyl and carboxylic groups play key roles in NAC functions. The results presented here provide insight into the mechanisms by which NAC dismantles biofilm and how it could be used to treat chronic wounds after debridement (NAC applied at the start of culture) or without debridement (NAC applied when biofilm is already formed). This approach can be taken to develop biofilm from microbiome taken directly from human chronic wounds to test molecules that could be effective for the treatment of specific biofilm compositions.","authors":[{"name":"Xin Li"},{"name":"Jane Kim"},{"name":"Jiabin Wu"},{"name":"Alaa' I Ahamed"},{"name":"Yinsheng Wang"},{"name":"Manuela Martins-Green"}],"keywords":[]},"article42":{"pmid":"32082281","title":"FeGenie: A Comprehensive Tool for the Identification of Iron Genes and Iron Gene Neighborhoods in Genome and Metagenome Assemblies.","abs":"Iron is a micronutrient for nearly all life on Earth. It can be used as an electron donor and electron acceptor by iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing microorganisms and is used in a variety of biological processes, including photosynthesis and respiration. While it is the fourth most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, iron is often limiting for growth in oxic environments because it is readily oxidized and precipitated. Much of our understanding of how microorganisms compete for and utilize iron is based on laboratory experiments. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing and surge in publicly available sequence data has made it possible to probe the structure and function of microbial communities in the environment. To bridge the gap between our understanding of iron acquisition, iron redox cycling, iron storage, and magnetosome formation in model microorganisms and the plethora of sequence data available from environmental studies, we have created a comprehensive database of hidden Markov models (HMMs) based on genes related to iron acquisition, storage, and reduction/oxidation in Bacteria and Archaea. Along with this database, we present FeGenie, a bioinformatics tool that accepts genome and metagenome assemblies as input and uses our comprehensive HMM database to annotate provided datasets with respect to iron-related genes and gene neighborhood. An important contribution of this tool is the efficient identification of genes involved in iron oxidation and dissimilatory iron reduction, which have been largely overlooked by standard annotation pipelines. We validated FeGenie against a selected set of 28 isolate genomes and showcase its utility in exploring iron genes present in 27 metagenomes, 4 isolate genomes from human oral biofilms, and 17 genomes from candidate organisms, including members of the candidate phyla radiation. We show that FeGenie accurately identifies iron genes in isolates. Furthermore, analysis of metagenomes using FeGenie demonstrates that the iron gene repertoire and abundance of each environment is correlated with iron richness. While this tool will not replace the reliability of culture-dependent analyses of microbial physiology, it provides reliable predictions derived from the most up-to-date genetic markers.

To thrive in oxygen limited niches, bacteria's versatile physiology enables the utilization of alternative electron acceptors. Nitrate, the second most favorable electron acceptor after oxygen, plays a prominent role in the physiology of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) and is abundantly found in urine. Here we analyzed the role of extracellular nitrate in the pathogenesis of the UPEC strain CFT073 with an initial focus on biofilm formation. Colony morphotyping in combination with extensive mutational, transcriptional, and protein expression analyses of CFT073 wild-type and mutants deficient in one or several nitrate reductases revealed an association between nitrate reduction and the biosynthesis of biofilm extracellular matrix components. We identified a role for the nitrate response regulator NarL in modulating expression of the biofilm master regulator CsgD. To analyze the role of nitrate reduction during infection in vivo, we tested wild-type CFT073 and a nitrate reductase null mutant in an ascending urinary tract infection (UTI) model. Individually, each strain colonized extensively, suggesting that nitrate reduction is expendable during UTI. However, during competitive co-infection, the strain incapable of nitrate reduction was strongly outcompeted. This suggests that nitrate reduction can be considered a non-essential but advantageous fitness factor for UPEC pathogenesis. This implies that UPEC rapidly adapts their metabolic needs to the microenvironment of infected tissue. Collectively, this work demonstrates a unique association between nitrate respiration, biofilm formation, and UPEC pathogenicity, highlighting how the use of alternative electron acceptors enables bacterial pathogens to adapt to challenging infectious microenvironments.","authors":[{"name":"Alberto J Martín-Rodríguez"},{"name":"Mikael Rhen"},{"name":"Keira Melican"},{"name":"Agneta Richter-Dahlfors"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"curli"},{"word":"in vivo"},{"word":"nitrate respiration"},{"word":"tissue microbiology"},{"word":"urinary tract infection"},{"word":"uropathogenic Escherichia coli"}]},"article44":{"pmid":"32082276","title":"Association of Novel Streptococcus sanguinis Virulence Factors With Pathogenesis in a Native Valve Infective Endocarditis Model.","abs":"Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis) is an abundant oral commensal which can cause disseminated human infection if it gains access to the bloodstream. The most important among these diseases is infective endocarditis (IE). While virulence phenotypes of S. sanguinis have been correlated to disease severity, genetic factors mediating these phenotypes, and contributing to pathogenesis are largely uncharacterized. In this report, we investigate the roles of 128 genes in virulence-related phenotypes of S. sanguinis and characterize the pathogenic potential of two selected mutants in a left-sided, native valve IE rabbit model. Assays determining the ability of our mutant strains to produce a biofilm, bind to and aggregate platelets, and adhere to or invade endothelial cells identified sixteen genes with novel association to these phenotypes. These results suggest the presence of many uncharacterized genes involved in IE pathogenesis which may be relevant for disease progression. Two mutants identified by the above screening process - SSA_1099, encoding an RTX-like protein, and mur2, encoding a peptidoglycan hydrolase - were subsequently evaluated in vivo. Wild type (WT) S. sanguinis reliably induced cardiac vegetations, while the SSA_1099 and mur2 mutants produced either no vegetation or vegetations of small size. Splenomegaly was reduced in both mutant strains compared to WT, while pathology of other distal organs was indistinguishable. Histopathology analyses suggest the cardiac lesions and vegetations in this model resemble those observed in humans. These data indicate that SSA_1099 and mur2 encode virulence factors in S. sanguinis which are integral to pathogenesis of IE.","authors":[{"name":"Anthony M Martini"},{"name":"Bridget S Moricz"},{"name":"Allison K Ripperger"},{"name":"Phuong M Tran"},{"name":"Molly E Sharp"},{"name":"Ana N Forsythe"},{"name":"Katarina Kulhankova"},{"name":"Wilmara Salgado-Pabón"},{"name":"Bradley D Jones"}],"keywords":[{"word":"commensal"},{"word":"endocarditis"},{"word":"heart"},{"word":"pathogenesis"},{"word":"sanguinis"},{"word":"streptococcus"},{"word":"valve"}]},"article45":{"pmid":"32082144","title":"Exploring the Anti-Acne Potential of Impepho [Helichrysum odoratissimum (L.)

Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent bioactive gas that induces a variety of therapeutic effects, including bactericidal and biofilm dispersion properties. The short half-life, high reactivity, and rapid diffusivity of NO make therapeutic delivery challenging. The goal of this work was to characterize NO-loaded microbubbles (MB) stabilized with a lipid shell and to assess the feasibility of antibacterial therapy in vitro. MB were loaded with either NO alone (NO-MB) or with NO and octafluoropropane (NO-OFP-MB) (9:1 v/v and 1:1 v/v). The size distribution and acoustic attenuation coefficient of NO-MB and NO-OFP-MB were measured. Ultrasound-triggered release of the encapsulated gas payload was demonstrated with 3-MHz pulsed Doppler ultrasound. An amperometric microelectrode sensor was used to measure NO concentration released from the MB and compared to an NO-OFP-saturated solution. The effect of NO delivery on the viability of planktonic (free living) Staphylococcus aureus (SA) USA 300, a methicillin-resistant strain, was evaluated in a 96 well-plate format. The co-encapsulation of NO with OFP increased the total volume and attenuation coefficient of MB. The NO-OFP-MB were destroyed with a clinical ultrasound scanner with an output of 2.48 MPa peak negative pressure (in situ MI of 1.34) but maintained their echogenicity when exposed to 0.02 MPa peak negative pressure (in situ MI of 0.01. The NO dose in NO-MB and NO-OFP-MB was more than 2-fold higher than the NO-OFP-saturated solution. Delivery of NO-OFP-MB increased bactericidal efficacy compared to the NO-OFP-saturated solution or air and OFP-loaded MB. These results suggest that encapsulation of NO with OFP in lipid-shelled MB enhances payload delivery.

ATCC 19606 genome consists of a 3,980,848-bp chromosome and a 9,450-bp plasmid pMAC, and harbours a chromosomal dihydropteroate synthase gene sul2 conferring resistance to sulphonamides and a plasmid-borne ohr gene conferring resistance to peroxides. The genome also contains 69 virulence genes involved in surface adherence, biofilm formation, extracellular phospholipase, iron uptake, immune evasion and quorum sensing. Insertion sequences ISCR2 and ISAba11 are embedded in a 36.1-Kb genomic island, suggesting an IS-mediated large-scale DNA recombination. Furthermore, a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) iATCC19606v2 was constructed using the complete genome annotation. The model iATCC19606v2 incorporated a periplasmic compartment, 1,422 metabolites, 2,114 reactions and 1,009 genes, and a set of protein crowding constraints taking into account enzyme abundance limitation.

Several bacteria exhibit a large number of c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins, thus a fine-tuning of this nucleotide levels may occur. It is hypothesized that some c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins would provide the global c-di-GMP levels inside the cell whereas others would maintain a localized pool, with the resulting c-di-GMP acting at the vicinity of its production. Although attractive, this hypothesis has yet to be demonstrated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that the diguanylate cyclase DgcP interacts with the cytosolic region of FimV, a polar peptidoglycan-binding protein involved in type IV pilus assembly. Moreover, DgcP is located at the cell poles in wild type cells but scattered in the cytoplasm of cells lacking FimV. Overexpression of dgcP leads to the classical phenotypes of high c-di-GMP levels (increased biofilm and impaired motilities) in the wild-type strain, but not in a ΔfimV background. Therefore, our findings suggest that DgcP activity is regulated by FimV.

Cranberry oligosaccharides have shown similar biological properties as other dietary oligosaccharides, including effects on bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation, and microbial growth. Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity has also been observed. Oligosaccharides may therefore be significant contributors to many of the health benefits associated with cranberry products. Soluble oligosaccharides are present at relatively high concentrations (~20% w/w or greater) in many cranberry materials, and yet their possible contributions to biological activity have remained unrecognized. This is partly due to the inherent difficulty of detecting these compounds without intentionally seeking them. Inconsistencies in product descriptions and terminology have led to additional confusion regarding cranberry product composition and the possible presence of oligosaccharides. This review will present our current understanding of cranberry oligosaccharides and will discuss their occurrence, structures, ADME, biological properties, and possible prebiotic effects for both gut and urinary tract microbiota.

To test this hypothesis, an in vitro saliva-derived multispecies biofilm model was established, and by comparing caries lesions on enamel blocks cocultured with biofilms treated with sucrose, glucose and lactose, we confirmed that this model can reproduce the in vivo finding that sucrose has the strongest cariogenic potential. In parallel, compared to a control treatment, sucrose treatment led to significant changes within the microbial structure and assembly of oral microflora, while no significant difference was detected between the lactose/glucose treatment group and the control. Specifically, sucrose supplementation disrupted the homeostasis between acid-producing and alkali-producing bacteria. Consistent with microbial dysbiosis, we observed the most significant disequilibrium between acid and alkali metabolism in sucrose-treated biofilms.

Here, we conducted in vitro batch incubations of human faecal microbiota to obtain a mechanistic proof-of-concept of the short-term impact of celecoxib on activity and composition of colon bacterial communities. Celecoxib-exposed microbiota shifted metabolic activity and community composition, whereas total transcriptionally active bacterial population was not significantly changed.

Microbiota-derived acetate has been associated with inhibition of cancer markers and our results suggest uptake of acetate for bacterial functions when celecoxib was supplied, which potentially favoured bacterial competition for acetyl-CoA. We further assessed whether colon microbiota modulates anti-inflammatory efficacy of celecoxib using a simplified inflammation model, and a novel in vitro simulation of the enterohepatic metabolism. Celecoxib was responsible for only 5% of the variance in bacterial community composition but celecoxib-exposed microbiota preserved barrier function and decreased concentrations of IL-8 and CXCL16 in a donor-dependent manner in our two models simulating gut inflammatory milieu.

However, the function of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in C. albicans has not been extensively investigated. To better understand the DNA damage response and its role in virulence, we studied the function of the Rad23 nucleotide excision repair protein in detail. The RAD23 deletion strain and overexpression strain both exhibit UV sensitivity, confirming the critical role of RAD23 in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Genetic interaction assays revealed that the role of RAD23 in the UV response relies on RAD4 but is independent of RAD53, MMS22, and RAD18RAD4 and RAD23 have similar roles in regulating cell morphogenesis and biofilm formation; however, only RAD23, but not RAD4, plays a negative role in virulence regulation in a mouse model. We found that the RAD23 deletion strain showed decreased survival in a Candida-macrophage interaction assay. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) data further revealed that RAD23, but not RAD4, regulates the transcription of a virulence factor, SUN41, suggesting a unique role of RAD23 in virulence regulation. Taking these observations together, our work reveals that the RAD23-related nucleotide excision pathway plays a critical role in the UV response but may not play a direct role in virulence.

The number of reports concerning their toxicity and emphasizing the ultimate need to remove them from marine and soil environments confirms the unceasing interest of scientists in this field. Among the various techniques used for clean-up actions, bioremediation seems to be the most acceptable and economically justified. Analysis of recent reports regarding unsuccessful bioremediation attempts indicates that there is a need to highlight the fundamental aspects of hydrocarbon microbiology in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, in this review, we would like to elucidate some crucial, but often overlooked, factors. First, the formation of crude oil and abundance of naturally occurring hydrocarbons is presented and compared with bacterial ability to not only survive but also to utilize such compounds as an attractive energy source. Then, the significance of nutrient limitation on biomass growth is underlined on the example of a specially designed experiment and discussed in context of bioremediation efficiency. Next, the formation of aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as the role of surfactants for maintaining appropriate C:N:P ratio during initial stages of biodegradation is explained. Finally, a summary of recent scientific reports focused on the removal of hydrocarbon contaminants using bioaugmentation, biostimulation and introduction of surfactants, as well as biosurfactants, is presented. This review was designed to be a comprehensive source of knowledge regarding the unique aspects of hydrocarbon microbiology that may be useful for planning future biodegradation experiments. In addition, it is a starting point for wider debate regarding the limitations and possible improvements of currently employed bioremediation strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Łukasz Ławniczak"},{"name":"Marta Woźniak-Karczewska"},{"name":"Andreas P Loibner"},{"name":"Hermann J Heipieper"},{"name":"Łukasz Chrzanowski"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PAHs"},{"word":"bioaugmentation"},{"word":"biodegradation"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biostimulation"},{"word":"biosurfactants"},{"word":"crude oil"},{"word":"hydrocarbons"},{"word":"marine and terrestrial contamination"},{"word":"nutrient limitation"},{"word":"surfactants"}]},"article71":{"pmid":"32075040","title":"Management of Streptococcus mutans-Candida spp. Oral Biofilms' Infections: Paving the Way for Effective Clinical Interventions.","abs":"Oral diseases are considered the most common noncommunicable diseases and are related to serious local and systemic disorders.

All recovered isolates of the two species fall within monophyletic clades based on phylogenomic trees of conserved single-copy core genes. Within species, the ISS-derived isolates all demonstrate greater than 99% average nucleotide identity (with 95-99% of genomes aligning) and share around 90% of the identified gene clusters from a pangenomic analysis-suggesting that the two groups are each composed of highly similar genomic lineages and their members may have all stemmed from the same two founding populations. The differences that can be observed between the recovered isolates at the pangenomic level are primarily located within putative plasmids. Phenotypically, macrophage intracellularization and lysis occurred at generally similar rates between all ISS-derived isolates, as well as with their respective type-terrestrial strain references. All ISS-derived isolates exhibited antibiotic sensitivity similar to that of the terrestrial reference strains, and minimal differences between isolates were observed. With a few exceptions, biofilm formation rates were generally consistent across each species. And lastly, though isolation date does not necessarily provide any insight into how long a given isolate had been aboard the ISS, none of the assayed physiology correlated with either date of isolation or distances based on nucleotide variation.

Rather than specifying a certain time frame, a nonunion is better defined as a fracture that will not heal without further intervention.Successful fracture healing depends on local biology, biomechanics and a variety of systemic factors. All components can principally be decisive and determine the classification of atrophic, oligotrophic or hypertrophic nonunions. Treatment prioritizes mechanics before biology.The degree of motion between fracture parts is the key for healing and is described by strain theory. If the change of length at a given load is > 10%, fibrous tissue and not bone is formed. Therefore, simple fractures require absolute and complex fractures relative stability.The main characteristics of a nonunion are pain while weight bearing, and persistent fracture lines on X-ray.Treatment concepts such as 'mechanobiology' or the 'diamond concept' determine the applied osteosynthesis considering soft tissue, local biology and stability. Fine wire circular external fixation is considered the only form of true biologic fixation due to its ability to eliminate parasitic motions while maintaining load-dependent axial stiffness. Nailing provides intramedullary stability and biology via reaming. Plates are successful when complex fractures turn into simple nonunions demanding absolute stability. Despite available alternatives, autograft is the gold standard for providing osteoinductive and osteoconductive stimuli.The infected nonunion remains a challenge. Bacteria, especially staphylococcus species, have developed mechanisms to survive such as biofilm formation, inactive forms and internalization.

We resolved electron cryomicroscopy atomic structures of Pf4 with and without its linear single-stranded DNA genome, and studied Pf4 assembly into liquid crystalline droplets using optical microscopy and electron cryotomography.

Encapsulation by these compartments was observed even when inanimate colloidal rods were used to mimic rod-shaped bacteria, suggesting that shape and size complementarity profoundly influences the process.

Due to their increasing accretion in aquatic environments, as well as resistance towards degradation, marine litter research has focused on microplastics more recently. In the present study, a relatively new method of biodegradation was implemented for the biodegradation of three structurally different MPs i.e. polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Periphytic biofilm was used for this purpose in various backgrounds of carbon sources (glucose, peptone, and glucose and peptone). Biodegradation of MPs was estimated in terms of weight loss. It was observed that the addition of glucose enhanced the biodegradation of MPs by periphyton biofilm for all MPs (from 9.52%-18.02%, 5.95%-14.02% and 13.24-19.72% for PP, PE and PET respectively) after 60 days compared to natural biofilm alone. To the contrary, peptone, and glucose and peptone together, were inhibitory. Biodegradation was further confirmed by morphological changes observed using SEM, FTIR spectra and GPC lent further support to the results whereby new peaks appeared along with reduction in old peaks and decrease in peak intensities. MiSeq sequencing shows that Deinococcus-thermus > Proteobacteria > Cyanobacteria are the dominant phyla in natural biofilms, and their relative abundances increase after the addition of glucose.

This is the first study that has harvested bacteria from diabetic foot infections and recreated similar polymicrobial biofilms to those present in vivo for individual subjects.

The fabrication process included surface modification of MPDA with l-Arg and further adsorption of ICG via π-π stacking. Under near-infrared (NIR) exposure, AI-MPDA not only generated heat but also produced reactive oxygen species, causing a cascade catalysis of l-Arg to release nitric oxide (NO). Under NIR irradiation, biofilm elimination was attributed to the NO-enhanced photodynamic therapy and low-temperature PTT (≤45 °C). Notably, the NIR-triggered all-in-one strategy resulted in severe destruction of bacterial membranes. The phototherapeutic AI-MPDA also displayed good cytocompatibility. NIR-irradiated AI-MPDA nanoparticles not only prevented bacterial colonization but also realized a rapid recovery of infected wounds. More importantly, the all-in-one phototherapeutic platform displayed effective biofilm elimination with an efficiency of around 100% in a abscess formation model.

To shed light on the precise relationships across the respective type strains and the novel fungiphiles, we here compare their genomic and ecophysiological features. To reach this goal, the genomes of the three type strains, with sizes ranging from 9.0 to 11.5 Mb, were de novo sequenced and the high-quality genomes analyzed. Using whole-genome, ribosomal RNA and marker-gene-concatenate analyses, close relationships between P. hospita DSM 17164T and P. terrae DSM 17804T, versus more remote relationships to P. caribensis DSM 13236T were found. All four fungiphilic strains clustered closely to the two-species cluster. Analyses of average nucleotide identities (ANIm) and tetranucleotide frequencies (TETRA) confirmed the close relationships between P. hospita DSM 17164T and P. terrae DSM 17804T (ANIm = 95.42; TETRA = 0.99784), as compared to the similarities of each one of these strains to P. caribensis DSM 13236T. A species cluster was thus proposed. Furthermore, high similarities of the fungiphilic strains BS001, BS007, BS110 and BS437 with this cluster were found, indicating that these strains also make part of it, being closely linked to P. hospita DSM 17164T (ANIm = 99%; TETRA = 0.99).

Structural features and morphology of the synthesized nanomaterials were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy techniques respectively.

Presence of water and possible impurity molecules on the materials surface was examined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Effective antibacterial activity of the NCs was observed (within a range of 25-150 μg/mL of NCs) against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The potential anti-biofilm effect of as synthesized NCs was tested against S. aureus. Experimental results suggest that the antibacterial action of the NCs could be due to the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). DNA degradation and change in the bacterial cell membrane has further indicated the complete disinfection of the target bacterial system. The cytotoxicity evaluation has confirmed that the formation of NCs has maintained the antibacterial efficacy of Ag NPs but reduced its toxicity towards mammalian cells.","authors":[{"name":"Md Imran Khan"},{"name":"Ankit Mazumdar"},{"name":"Soumitra Pathak"},{"name":"Prajita Paul"},{"name":"Susanta Kumar Behera"},{"name":"Ashok J Tamhankar"},{"name":"Suraj K Tripathy"},{"name":"Cecilia Stålsby Lundborg"},{"name":"Amrita Mishra"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Calcium oxide"},{"word":"Cytotoxicity"},{"word":"Silver"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"}]},"article112":{"pmid":"32066059","title":"Propagation of antibiotic resistance genes in an industrial recirculating aquaculture system located at northern China.","abs":"The increasing prevalence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in intensive aquaculture environments are of great concern to food safety and public health.

Samples were collected from four pipes during a repeated flushing operation three months after an initial visit that used hydraulic forces to mobilise regenerating biofilms yet without impacting the upstream network. To minimise confounding factors, test sections were chosen with comparable daily hydraulic regimes, physical dimensions, and all connected straight of a common trunk main and within close proximity, hence similar water chemistry, pressure and age. Taxonomical results showed differences in colonising communities between pipe materials, with several genera, including the bacteria Pseudomonas and the fungi Cladosporium, present in every sample. Diverse bacterial communities dominated compared to more homogeneous fungal, or mycobiome, community distribution. The analysis of bacterial/fungal networks based on relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) indicated microbial communities from cast iron pipes were more stable than communities from the non-ferrous pipe materials. Novel analysis of functional traits between all samples were found to be mainly associated to mobile genetic elements that play roles in determining links between cells, including phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids.

The complex process of MC development and progression seems to involve interplay between mechanical, infective, inflammatory, and degenerative processes that cannot be clearly differentiated. Based on signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans, MCs can be divided three types: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Predominantly Type 1 MCs are commonly associated with chronic low back pain that is unresponsive to classic treatment options. Infection with low-virulent anaerobic microorganisms, most commonly Propionibacterium acnes, has been implicated in MC development following a disc herniation when a tear enables bacteria to enter the disc. Recent studies in patients with chronic low back pain following a lumbar disc herniation associated with Type 1 MCs have reported promising results following prolonged systemic antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, as primary or adjuvant treatment in association combination with systemic antibiotics or anti-inflammatory therapy, could offer important advantages in treating patients with suspected low-virulent disc infections due to anaerobic microorganisms associated with Type 1 MCs. We believe that hyperbaric oxygenation could contribute to faster resolution of Type 1 MCs and associated pain through multiple effects-including direct antimicrobial effects through formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), altering the favorable low oxygen tension milieu such that it becomes unfavorable for bacterial growth and survival, and anti-biofilm effects. Additionally, hyperbaric oxygenation could contribute to faster pain resolution via direct and indirect anti-inflammatory effects. As an adjuvant treatment administered in combination with systemic antibiotics, HBOT could increase the sensitivity of Propionibacterium acnes to antimicrobial drugs under hyperoxic conditions, resulting in faster MC resolution. Overall, the faster infection resolution, diminished bacterial load, and anti-inflammatory effects due to reduced cytokine expression and levels of infectious by-products could lead to faster pain resolution following HBOT, and a significant improvement of quality of life in these patients.","authors":[{"name":"Tanja Batinac"},{"name":"Vlatka Sotošek"},{"name":"Toni Valković"},{"name":"Lari Gorup"},{"name":"Mario Franolić"},{"name":"Igor Barković"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial infection"},{"word":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy"},{"word":"Modic changes"},{"word":"Propionibacterium acnes"}]},"article116":{"pmid":"32065887","title":"Alpine headwaters emerging from glaciers and rock glaciers host different bacterial communities: Ecological implications for the future.","abs":"Mountain glacier shrinkage represents a major effect of the current global warming and 80-100% of the Alpine glaciers are predicted to vanish within the next few decades.

Despite the growing literature on the impacts of deglaciation on Alpine hydrology and ecosystems, chemical and biological features of waters emerging from Alpine rock glaciers (i.e. permafrost landforms composed by a mixture of ice and debris) have been poorly investigated so far, and knowledge on microbial biodiversity of headwaters is still sparse. A set of glacier-, rock glacier- and groundwater/precipitation-fed streams was investigated in the Italian Central Alps in late summer 2016, aiming at exploring bacterial community composition and diversity in epilithic and surface sediment biofilm and at verifying the hypothesis that rock glacier-fed headwaters represent peculiar ecosystems from both a chemical and biological point of view. Rock glacier-fed waters showed high values of electrical conductivity and trace elements related to their bedrock lithology, and their highly diverse bacterial assemblages significantly differed from those detected in glacier-fed streams. Bacterial taxonomic composition appeared to be mainly related to water and substrate type, as well as to water chemistry, the latter including concentrations of nutrients and trace metals.

When used correctly, the technique allows for the rapid assessment of extracellular pH in different areas of a biofilm and thus the monitoring of both horizontal and vertical pH gradients over time.

Most techniques used for estimating the c-di-GMP concentration lack single-cell resolution and do not provide information about any heterogeneous distribution of c-di-GMP inside cells. In this review, we briefly discuss how the activity of c-di-GMP metabolising enzymes, particularly bifunctional proteins, is modulated to maintain c-di-GMP homeostasis. We further highlight how fluorescence-based methods aid in understanding the spatiotemporal regulation of c-di-GMP signalling. Finally, we discuss the blind spots in our understanding of second messenger signalling and outline how they can be addressed in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Anushya Petchiappan"},{"name":"Sujay Y Naik"},{"name":"Dipankar Chatterji"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biosensor"},{"word":"C-di-GMP"},{"word":"FRET"},{"word":"Riboswitch"},{"word":"Second messenger"}]},"article133":{"pmid":"32060424","title":"Network analysis infers the wilt pathogen invasion associated with non-detrimental bacteria.","abs":"The microbiota colonizing the root endophytic compartment and surrounding rhizosphere soils contribute to plant growth and health. However, the key members of plant soil and endophytic microbial communities involved in inhibiting or assisting pathogen invasion remain elusive. By utilizing 16S high-throughput sequencing and a molecular ecological network (MEN) approach, we systematically studied the interactions within bacterial communities in plant endophytic compartments (stem and root) and the surrounding soil (bulk and rhizosphere) during bacterial wilt invasion. The endophytic communities were found to be strongly influenced by pathogen invasion according to analysis of microbial diversity and community structure and composition. Endophytic communities of the infected plants were primarily derived from soil communities, as assessed by the SourceTracker program, but with rare migration from soil communities to endophytic communities observed in healthy plants. Soil and endophytic microbiomes from infected plants showed modular topology and greater complexity in network analysis, and a higher number of interactions than those in healthy plants. Furthermore, interactions among microbial members revealed that pathogenic Ralstonia members were positively correlated with several bacterial genera, including Delftia, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus, Clostridium XlVa, Fontibacillus, Acidovorax, Herminiimonas, and three unclassified bacterial genera, in infected plant roots. Our findings indicated that the pathogen invasion in the rhizosphere and endophytic compartments may be highly associated with bacteria that are normally not detrimental, and sometimes even beneficial, to plants.","authors":[{"name":"Qiulong Hu"},{"name":"Lin Tan"},{"name":"Songsong Gu"},{"name":"Yansong Xiao"},{"name":"Xingyao Xiong"},{"name":"Wei-Ai Zeng"},{"name":"Kai Feng"},{"name":"Zhong Wei"},{"name":"Ye Deng"}],"keywords":[]},"article134":{"pmid":"32059594","title":"Changes in Microbial Community Structures under Reclaimed Water Replenishment Conditions.","abs":"Using reclaimed water as a resource for landscape water replenishment may alleviate the major problems of water resource shortages and water environment pollution.

Attempts to optimize biofilm eradication protocols for four alkaline, two acidic, and one enzymatic cleaning agent, in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations, were evaluated. Increased concentrations, the number of subsequent treatments, the exposure times, and the temperatures of the C&D agents provided between 4.0 and >5.5 log reductions in colony forming units (CFU) for seven-day-old L. monocytogenes biofilms.

Compared with that of PAO1, the extracellular polymeric substance of RSCV PAO1ΔwspF biofilms presented unique ultrastructural characteristics. Unlike PAO1, PAO1ΔwspF released fragmented extracellular DNA (eDNA) from live cells. Fragmented eDNA, thus released, was responsible for resistance of PAO1ΔwspF biofilm to disruption by DNaseI. When added to PAO1, such fragmented eDNA enhanced biofilm formation. Disruption of PAO1ΔwspF biofilm was achieved by aurine tricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of DNA-protein interaction.

To explore this aspect, herein we report a series of membrane-active small molecules by varying the spatial distribution of hydrophobic groups. The two terminal amino groups of linear triamines such as diethylene triamine, bis(trimethylene)triamine and bis(hexamethylene)triamine were conjugated with cationic amino acids bearing variable side chain hydrophobicity (such as diaminobutyric acid, ornithine and lysine). The hydrophobicity was also modulated through conjugation of different long chain fatty acids with the central secondary amino group of the triamine. Molecules with constant backbone hydrophobicity displayed an enhanced antibacterial activity and decreased hemolytic activity upon increasing the side chain hydrophobicity of amino acids. On the other hand, increased hydrophobicity in the backbone introduced a slight hemolytic activity but a higher increment in antibacterial activity resulting in better selective antibacterial compounds. The optimized lead compound derived from structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies was the dodecanoyl analogue of lysine series of compounds consisting of bis(hexamethylene)triamine as the backbone. This compound was active against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at a low concentration (MIC ranged between 3.1-6.3 µg/mL) and displayed low toxicity towards mammalian cells (HC50 = 890 µg/mL and EC50 against HEK = 85 µg/mL). Additionally, it was able to kill metabolically inactive bacterial cells and eradicate preformed biofilms of MRSA. This compound showed excellent activity in a mouse model of skin-infection with reduction of ~4 log MRSA burden at 40 mg/kg dose without any sign of skin-toxicity even at 200 mg/kg.

We found that inactivation of luxS caused a marked decrease in biofilm formation, hemolytic activity, antiphagocytosis and intracellular survival of S. agalactiae.

However, there is growing evidence of its potential pathogenicity, leading to fungemia and invasive infections. The medical impact of yeast pathogens depends on formation of biofilms: multicellular structures, protected from the environment. Cell adhesion is a prerequisite of biofilm formation. We investigated the adherence of wild and genetically modified S. cerevisiae strains, formation of solid-liquid interface biofilms and associated regulation. Planktonic and static cells of wild strain BRF adhered and formed biofilms in glucose-free medium. Tup1p and Cyc8p were key positive and negative regulators, respectively. Glucose caused increased Cyc8p levels and blocked cell adhesion. Even low glucose levels, comparable with levels in the blood, allowed biofilm dispersal and release of planktonic cells. Cyc8p could thus modulate cell adhesion in different niches, dependently on environmental glucose level, e.g., high-glucose blood versus low-glucose tissues in host organisms.","authors":[{"name":"Phu Van Nguyen"},{"name":"Vítězslav Plocek"},{"name":"Libuše Váchová"},{"name":"Zdena Palková"}],"keywords":[]},"article156":{"pmid":"32054068","title":"Antimicrobial Activity of Host-Derived Lipids.","abs":"Host-derived lipids are increasingly recognized as antimicrobial molecules that function in innate immune activities along with antimicrobial peptides. Sphingoid bases and fatty acids found on the skin, in saliva and other body fluids, and on all mucosal surfaces, including oral mucosa, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and reduce inflammation in animal models. Multiple studies demonstrate that the antimicrobial activity of lipids is both specific and selective. There are indications that the site of action of antimicrobial fatty acids is the bacterial membrane, while the long-chain bases may inhibit cell wall synthesis as well as interacting with bacterial membranes. Research in this area, although still sporadic, has slowly increased in the last few decades; however, we still have much to learn about antimicrobial lipid mechanisms of activity and their potential use in novel drugs or topical treatments. One important potential benefit for the use of innate antimicrobial lipids (AMLs) as antimicrobial agents is the decreased likelihood side effects with treatment. Multiple studies report that endogenous AML treatments do not induce damage to cells or tissues, often decrease inflammation, and are active against biofilms. The present review summarizes the history of antimicrobial lipids from the skin surface, including both fatty acids and sphingoid bases, in multiple human body systems and summarizes their relative activity against various microorganisms. The range of antibacterial activities of lipids present at the skin surface and in saliva is presented. Some observations relevant to mechanisms of actions are discussed, but are largely still unknown. Multiple recent studies examine the therapeutic and prophylactic uses of AMLs. Although these lipids have been repeatedly demonstrated to act as innate effector molecules, they are not yet widely accepted as such. These compiled data further support fatty acid and sphingoid base inclusion as innate effector molecules.","authors":[{"name":"Carol L Fischer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antimicrobial lipids"},{"word":"fatty acids"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"sphingoid bases"}]},"article157":{"pmid":"32054067","title":"Gram-Negative Bacterial Lysins.","abs":"Antibiotics have had a profound impact on human society by enabling the eradication of otherwise deadly infections. Unfortunately, antibiotic use and overuse has led to the rapid spread of acquired antibiotic resistance, creating a major threat to public health. Novel therapeutic agents called bacteriophage endolysins (lysins) provide a solution to the worldwide epidemic of antibiotic resistance. Lysins are a class of enzymes produced by bacteriophages during the lytic cycle, which are capable of cleaving bonds in the bacterial cell wall, resulting in the death of the bacteria within seconds after contact. Through evolutionary selection of the phage progeny to be released and spread, these lysins target different critical components in the cell wall, making resistance to these molecules orders of magnitude less likely than conventional antibiotics. Such properties make lysins uniquely suitable for the treatment of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. Lysins, either naturally occurring or engineered, have the potential of being developed into fast-acting, narrow-spectrum, biofilm-disrupting antimicrobials that act synergistically with standard of care antibiotics. This review focuses on newly discovered classes of Gram-negative lysins with emphasis on prototypical enzymes that have been evaluated for efficacy against the major antibiotic resistant organisms causing nosocomial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Chandrabali Ghose"},{"name":"Chad W Euler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acinetobacter"},{"word":"E.coli"},{"word":"ESKAPE"},{"word":"Gram-negative"},{"word":"Klebsiella"},{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"endolysins"},{"word":"lysins"}]},"article158":{"pmid":"32053733","title":"The anti-biofilm and collagen-stabilizing effects of proanthocyanidin as an auxiliary endodontic irrigant.","abs":"To evaluate the anti-biofilm effect of Proanthocyanidin (PA) solution as an irrigant against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and its influence on the mechanical properties and biodegradation resistance of demineralized root dentine.","authors":[{"name":"S Y Yang"},{"name":"Yan Liu"},{"name":"J Mao"},{"name":"Y B Wu"},{"name":"Y L Deng"},{"name":"S C Qi"},{"name":"Y C Zhou"},{"name":"S Q Gong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"Antibacterial activity"},{"word":"Dentine"},{"word":"Endodontic Irrigant"},{"word":"Proanthocyanidin"}]},"article159":{"pmid":"32053506","title":"Antibiotic resistance, virulence factors and genotyping of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in public hospitals of northeastern Mexico.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the second most prevalent opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections in Mexico.

Vancomycin gradually degraded from dual carrier-v and PMMA-v up to about 8 and 6 weeks, respectively. At different elution time points, the inhibition zones of the dual carrier-v were larger than the inhibition zones of the PMMA-v (p<0.05). The colony inhibition rate of the dual carrier-v was 95.57%, while it was 77.87% for PMMA-v. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to demonstrate biofilm formation on the surface of plates treated with vancomycin-unloaded PMMA (PMMA-n), while there was no biofilm formation on the surface of plates treated with dual carrier-v or PMMA-v. The dual carrier-v was more effective at antibacterial adhesion at each time point after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF), as compared with PMMA-v (p＜0.05).

An ex vivo hair model was used to investigate the efficiency of BBLP against M. canis biofilm, in a scenario close to the in vivo conditions. M. canisex vivo biofilm eradication was confirmed in stereo, scanning electron, and fluorescent images. Also, the ex vivo biofilm was less susceptible to BBLP treatment compared to its in vitro counterpart.

Some of their chlorinated congeners are among the most hazardous pollutants that persist in the environment. This persistence is due in part to the limited number of bacteria capable of metabolizing these compounds, but also to their limited bioavailability in soil. We used Sphingomonas wittichii strain RW1 (RW1), one of the few strains able to grow on dioxin, to characterize its ability to respond to and degrade clay-bound dioxin. We found that RW1 grew on and completely degraded dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD) intercalated into the smectite clay saponite (SAP). To characterize the effects of DD sorption on RW1 gene expression, we compared transcriptomes of RW1 grown with either free crystalline DD or DD intercalated clay, i.e. sandwiched between the clay interlayers (DDSAP). Free crystalline DD appeared to cause greater expression of toxicity and stress related functions. Genes coding for heat shock proteins, chaperones, as well as genes involved in DNA repair, and efflux were up-regulated during growth on crystalline dioxin compared to growth on intercalated dioxin. In contrast, growth on intercalated dioxin up-regulated genes that might be important in recognition and uptake mechanisms, as well as surface interaction/attachment/biofilm formation such as extracellular solute-binding protein and LuxR. These differences in gene expression may reflect the underlying adaptive mechanisms by which RW1 cells sense and deploy pathways to access dioxin intercalated into clay. These data show that intercalated DD remains bioavailable to the degrading bacterium with implications for bioremediation alternatives.","authors":[{"name":"Benli Chai"},{"name":"Tamara Tsoi"},{"name":"J Brett Sallach"},{"name":"Cun Liu"},{"name":"Jeff Landgraf"},{"name":"Mark Bezdek"},{"name":"Gerben Zylstra"},{"name":"Hui Li"},{"name":"Cliff T Johnston"},{"name":"Brian J Teppen"},{"name":"James R Cole"},{"name":"Stephen A Boyd"},{"name":"James M Tiedje"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bioavailability"},{"word":"Clay-adsorbed"},{"word":"Dioxin"},{"word":"Sphingomonas wittichii"},{"word":"Toxicity"},{"word":"Transcriptome"}]},"article176":{"pmid":"32050387","title":"The effect of supporting matrix on sludge granulation under low hydraulic shear force: Performance, microbial community dynamics and microorganisms migration.","abs":"Granular sludge usually takes extracellular polymers (EPS) as matrices for colonizing microorganisms and maintaining structural stability.

We find that the very abrupt activation of lrgA at stationary phase is tightly synchronized across the population. This activation is controlled by a small number of inputs that are sensitive to growth phase: extracellular pyruvate, glucose, and molecular oxygen. Activation of lrgA appears to be self-limiting, so that strong expression of lrgA is confined to a short interval of time. lrgA is programmed to switch on briefly at the end of exponential growth, as glucose and molecular oxygen are exhausted and extracellular pyruvate is available.

Bacterial biofilm has been mediated to non-malignant pathologies like inflammatory bowel disease but has not been fully documented in the setting of colorectal cancer. The investigation has currently found that bacterial biofilm is mediated to colon cancer in the human and linked to the location of human cancer, with almost all right-sided adenomas of colon cancers possessing bacterial biofilm, whilst left-sided cancer is rarely biofilm positive.

In the present study, the isolate KTMA4 showed the highest inhibition against major phytopathogens of tomato; Fusarium oxysporum (66%) and Alternaria solani (54%) after seven days of incubation. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the isolate KTMA4 is Bacillus cereus (MG547975). The isolate produced in vitro plants growth-promoting factors such as Indole-3-acetic acid, ammonia, catalase, siderophore and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase and it has nitrogen fixation ability. The bacterial strain has also produced lytic enzymes such as amylase, cellulase, xylanase, lipase, and protease. Moreover, the bacterium Bacillus cereus KTMA4 effectively produced biofilm, biosurfactants and salt-tolerant (5% NaCl). The bacterium exhibited intrinsic antibiotic resistance. The in vivo studies using tomato plants grown from seeds treated with the bacterial strain KTMA4 demonstrated an enhancement in seed germination percentage (86.66 ± 2.88) and vigour index (637.5 ± 21.65) over the uninoculated control (germination percentage- 28.33 ± 2.88 and vigour index- 42.5 ± 4.33). 60 days of greenhouse study revealed that the bacterial isolate enhanced the plant growth significantly (P ≤ 0.05) compared to the uninoculated control and the treated plants.

The definition is subjective and operational: not every biofilm causes biofouling - only if a given a subjective threshold of interference is exceeded, biofilms cause technical or medical problems. These range from the formation of slime layers on ship hulls or in pipelines, which increase friction resistance, to separation membranes, on which biofilms increase hydraulic resistance, to heat exchangers where they interfere with heat transport to contamination of treated water by eroded biofilm cells which may comprise hygienically relevant microorganisms, and, most dangerous, to biofilms on implants and catheters which can cause persistent infections. The largest fraction of anti-fouling research, usually in short-term experiments, is focused on prevention or limiting primary microbial adhesion. Intuitively, this appears only logical, but turns out mostly hopeless. This is because in technical systems with open access for microorganisms, all surfaces are colonized sooner or later which explains the very limited success of that research. As a result, the use of biocides remains the major tool to fight persistent biofilms. However, this is costly in terms of biocides, it stresses working materials, causes off-time and environmental damage and it usually leaves large parts of biofilms in place, ready for regrowth. In order to really solve biofouling problems, it is necessary to learn how to live with biofilms and mitigate their detrimental effects. This requires rather an integrated strategy than aiming to invent one-shot solutions. In this context, it helps to understand the biofilm way of life as a natural phenomenon. Biofilms are the oldest, most successful and most widely distributed form of life on earth, existing even in extreme environments and being highly resilient. Microorganisms in biofilms live in a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which allows them to develop emerging properties such as enhanced nutrient acquisition, synergistic microconsortia, enhanced tolerance to biocides and antibiotics, intense intercellular communication and cooperation. Transiently immobilized, biofilm organisms turn their matrix into an external digestion system by retaining complexed exoenzymes in the matrix. Biofilms grow even on traces of any biodegradable material, therefore, an effective anti-fouling strategy comprises to keep the system low in nutrients (good housekeeping), employing low-fouling, easy-to-clean surfaces, monitoring of biofilm development, allowing for early intervention, and acknowledging that cleaning can be more important than trying to kill biofilms, because cleaning does not cut the nutrient supply of survivors and dead biomass serves as an additional carbon source for cannibalizing survivors, supporting rapid after growth. An integrated concept is presented as the result of a long journey of the author through biofouling problems.","authors":[{"name":"Hans-Curt Flemming"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-fouling"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Holistic approach"}]},"article206":{"pmid":"32044595","title":"Electromagnetic fields for biofouling mitigation in reclaimed water distribution systems.","abs":"Biofouling is ubiquitous in reclaimed water distribution systems and causes various industrial, economic, and health issues.

The obtained results revealed that EMF treatment significantly changed the bacterial communities and reduced their diversities in biofilm by affecting water quality parameters. Network analysis results indicated that EMFs were detrimental to the co-occurrence patterns of mutualistic relationships among bacterial species, destroyed the connectivity and complexity of the networks, and inhibited biofilm formation [decreased total biomass and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content]. EMF treatment could also decrease the deposition of mineral precipitates, reducing the carbonate and silicate content in biofilm. The decrease of EPS content appeared to reduce biofilm-induced mineral crystallization, while the ion precipitations accelerated by EMFs caused an erosive effect on biofilm. The results demonstrated that EMF treatment is an effective, chemical-free, and anti-biofouling treatment method with great potential for biofouling control in reclaimed water distribution systems.","authors":[{"name":"Yang Xiao"},{"name":"Youngwoo Seo"},{"name":"Yufei Lin"},{"name":"Lei Li"},{"name":"Tahir Muhammad"},{"name":"Changjian Ma"},{"name":"Yunkai Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biofouling control"},{"word":"Electromagnetic field"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Mineral precipitation"}]},"article207":{"pmid":"32044469","title":"Design and use of model membranes to study biomolecular interactions using complementary surface-sensitive techniques.","abs":"Cellular membranes are complex structures and simplified analogues in the form of model membranes or biomembranes are used as platforms to understand fundamental properties of the membrane itself as well as interactions with various biomolecules such as drugs, peptides and proteins.

In turn, in human biotopes there are optimal conditions for the implementation of biofilm-forming activity. Moreover, in medical practice, polymeric materials are often used for drainage or prosthetics, which can also be successfully colonized by bacteria. However, in laboratory practice, the formation of biofilms is usually evaluated on glass or polystyrene. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the methodological features of studying the biofilm-forming activity of microorganisms on the surface of synthetic polymeric materials. We used strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli K-12, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, as well as synthetic polymeric materials - DentLight Flow light-curing composite material (nano-hybrid fluid composite; Russia), glass ionomer chemical curing Fuji 1 (Japan), cement for temporary fixation of orthopedic constructions TempBond NE (USA), acrylic, polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride. The formation of biofilms in flat-bottomed ELISA plates in this study was considered as a control group. If the polymer belonged to cold curing materials, sterile flat-bottomed tablets were used, the bottom of which was filled with a thin layer of plastic. After hardening of the plastic, biofilms were formed in the tablets. In the second series of experiments, hot cured materials cut into equal parts 5×5×1 mm in size were placed in the wells of a plate and again used to determine biofilm formation with subsequent coloring. To extract the dye, the pieces were transferred to a new plate to exclude the amount of film biomass formed on the walls of the plate wells. In both cases, cultivation was carried out at 37° C for 24-48 hours. The biomass of the film was stained with fuchsin. Statistical data processing was performed using t-Student criterion. For the threshold level of significance, the value p <0.05 was taken. It is established that the proposed options for determining biofilm forming ability are available and indicative. It was revealed that the same microorganisms have individual biofilm formation indicators for each polymer material. The light curing dental composite and polyvinyl chloride exhibit the more pronounced antiadhesive properties than cements and polyurethane. Up to date, most of the studies of biofilm formation have been carried out using glass or polystyrene, which, as a rule, are not used for the manufacture of prostheses, catheters, drains, etc., which makes it difficult to assess the true film-forming activity of microorganisms. The proposed methodological approaches, especially the second option for preparing testing samples, solve this problem. In general, the proposed approaches to testing biofilm-forming activity on polymers are very simple to implement and generally available. For an adequate study of the biofilms formation, it will be advisable to use polymer materials, directly used in medicine, rather than polystyrene tablets, the material of which is found exclusively in laboratory practice.","authors":[{"name":"A P Godovalov"},{"name":"M S Stepanov"},{"name":"M V Yakovlev"},{"name":"E E Kobzarenko"},{"name":"K A Batog"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm-forming activity"},{"word":"biomass of the film"},{"word":"conditionally pathogenic microorganisms"},{"word":"polymeric materials"}]},"article227":{"pmid":"32040467","title":"Metagenomic investigation of bacteria associated with dental lesions: a cross-sectional study.","abs":"Dental caries is considered as one of the most significant global health problem over the world.

While GCS proteins have been demonstrated to regulate O2-dependent pathways, the mechanism by which the O2 binding event is transmitted from the globin domain to the cyclase domain is unknown. Using chemical cross-linking and subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, diguanylate cyclase (DGC)-containing GCS proteins from Bordetella pertussis (BpeGReg) and Pectobacterium carotovorum (PccGCS) have been demonstrated to form direct interactions between the globin domain and a middle domain π-helix. Additionally, mutation of the π-helix caused major changes in oligomerization and loss of DGC activity. Furthermore, results from assays with isolated globin and DGC domains found that DGC activity is affected by the cognate globin domain, indicating unique interactions between output domain and cognate globin sensor. Based on these studies a compact GCS structure, which depends on the middle domain π-helix for orienting the three domains, is needed for DGC activity and allows for direct sensor domain interactions with both middle and output domains to transmit the O2 binding signal. The insights from the present study improve our understanding of DGC regulation and provide insight into GCS signaling that may lead to the ability to rationally control O2-dependent GCS activity.","authors":[{"name":"Johnnie A Walker"},{"name":"Yuqi Wu"},{"name":"Jacob R Potter"},{"name":"Emily E Weinert"}],"keywords":[{"word":"diguanylate cyclase"},{"word":"globin"},{"word":"heme"},{"word":"oxygen sensing"},{"word":"signaling protein"}]},"article230":{"pmid":"32039189","title":"Effects of Low Frequency-Low Voltage Alternating Electric Current on Apoptosis Progression in Bioelectrical Reactor Biofilm.","abs":"Bioelectrochemical systems have undergone several modifications to promote the enzymes or pathways used to reduce the energy required for microbial metabolism.

Previously we developed a peptide, BAR (SspB Adherence Region), that inhibits oral P. gingivalis/S. gordonii biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo, and BAR nanoparticles that increase BAR effectiveness via multivalency and prolonged delivery. However, limited BAR loading and nanoparticle retention in the oral cavity can result in inadequate release and efficaciousness. Given this, an effective delivery platform that can release concentrations of BAR suitable for twice-daily applications, may offer an alternative that enhances loading, ease of administration, and retention in the oral cavity. With this in mind, the study objectives were to develop and characterize a rapid-release platform, composed of polymeric electrospun fibers (EFs) that encapsulate BAR, and to evaluate fiber safety and functionality against P. gingivalis/S. gordonii biofilms in vitro.

Objectives The present study compared the efficacy of oral care products and cannabinoids in reducing the bacterial content of dental plaques. Methods Sixty adults aged 18 to 45 years were categorized into six groups based on the Dutch periodontal screening index. Dental plaques of the adults were collected using paro-toothpick sticks and spread on two Petri dishes, each with four divisions. On Petri dish-A, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), and cannabigerol (CBG) were used, and on Petri dish-B, cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), Oral B, Colgate, and Cannabite F (a toothpaste formulation of pomegranate and algae) were used. The Petri dishes were sealed and incubated, followed by counting the number of colonies. Results By evaluating the colony count of the dental bacteria isolated from six groups, it was found that cannabinoids were more effective in reducing the bacterial colony count in dental plaques as compared to the well-established synthetic oral care products such as Oral B and Colgate.

It is responsible for a wide variety of infections, some of which are associated with biofilm production, such as implanted medical device infections or endocarditis. However, little is known about S. lugdunensis regulation of virulence factor expression. Two-component regulatory systems (TCS) play a critical role in bacterial adaptation, survival, and virulence. Among them, LytSR is widely conserved but has variable roles in different organisms, all connected to metabolism or cell death and lysis occurring during biofilm development. Therefore, we investigated here the functions of LytSR in S. lugdunensis pathogenesis. Deletion of lytSR in S. lugdunensis DSM 4804 strain did not alter either susceptibility to Triton X-100 induced autolysis or death induced by antibiotics targeting cell wall synthesis. Interestingly, ΔlytSR biofilm was characterized by a lower biomass, a lack of tower structures, and a higher rate of dead cells compared to the wild-type strain. Virulence toward Caenorhabditis elegans using a slow-killing assay was significantly reduced for the mutant compared to the wild-type strain. By contrast, the deletion of lytSR had no effect on the cytotoxicity of S. lugdunensis toward the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Transcriptional analyses conducted at mid- and late-exponential phases showed that lytSR deletion affected the expression of 286 genes. Most of them were involved in basic functions such as the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. Furthermore, LytSR appeared to be involved in the regulation of genes encoding known or putative virulence and colonization factors, including the fibrinogen-binding protein Fbl, the major autolysin AtlL, and the type VII secretion system. Overall, our data suggest that the LytSR TCS is implicated in S. lugdunensis pathogenesis, through its involvement in biofilm formation and potentially by the control of genes encoding putative virulence factors.","authors":[{"name":"Sandrine Dahyot"},{"name":"Virginie Oxaran"},{"name":"Maïté Niepceron"},{"name":"Eddy Dupart"},{"name":"Stéphanie Legris"},{"name":"Laurie Destruel"},{"name":"Jennifer Didi"},{"name":"Thomas Clamens"},{"name":"Olivier Lesouhaitier"},{"name":"Yasmine Zerdoumi"},{"name":"Jean-Michel Flaman"},{"name":"Martine Pestel-Caron"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"word":"LytSR"},{"word":"S. lugdunensis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"micro-array"},{"word":"two-component system"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article235":{"pmid":"32038588","title":"Structural Insights Into the Transcriptional Regulation of HigBA Toxin-Antitoxin System by Antitoxin HigA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","abs":"HigB-HigA is a bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) system in which the antitoxin HigA can mask the endoribonuclease activity of toxin HigB and repress the transcription of the TA operon by binding to its own promoter region. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa HigBA (PaHigBA) is closely associated with the pathogenicity by reducing the production of multiple virulence factors and biofilm formation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying HigBA TA operon transcription by PaHigA remains elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of PaHigA binding to the promoter region of higBA operon containing two identical palindromic sequences at 3.14 Å resolution. The promoter DNA is bound by two cooperative dimers to essentially encircle the intact palindrome region. The helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs from the two dimers insert into the major grooves of the DNA at the opposite sides. The DNA adopts a canonical B-DNA conformation and all the hydrogen bonds between protein and DNA are mediated by the DNA phosphate backbone. A higher resolution structure of PaHigA-DNA complex at 2.50 Å further revealed three water molecules bridged the DNA-binding interface and mediated the interactions between the bases of palindromic sequences and PaHigA (Thr40, Asp43, and Arg49).

A combinatory, broad spectrum biocidal antiseptic has been developed (ASP) as a topically applied solution to potential resistant and polymicrobial infected wounds that may be encountered in this context. The ASP-105 designate was evaluated in vitro by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), against different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), resulting estimates of which approximated the positive control (bacitracin). To evaluate in vivo microbicide efficacy, we utilized a murine full thickness wound model to study bacterial infection and wound healing kinetics. Mice were experimentally wounded dorsally and infected with bioluminescent MRSA. The infected wound was splinted, dressed and treated topically with either ASP-105, vehicle (-control), or bacitracin. Bacterial burden and wound healing was monitored using an in vivo imaging system and evaluation of biofilm formation using scanning electron microscopy of wound dressing. Treatment with ASP-105 significantly reduced bacterial burdens in the first 3 days of infection and inhibited MRSA biofilm formation on the surgical dressing. Notably, treatment with ASP-105 resulted in a sterilizing effect of any detectable MRSA in nearly all (80%; 4/5) of treatment group. All mice receiving vehicle control developed highly MRSA-luminescent and purulent wound beds as a result of experimental infection. The ASP-105 therapy facilitated natural healing in the absence of MRSA infection. Results of this study suggests that that the novel ASP combinatory topical antiseptic can be used directly in wounds as a potent, broad-spectrum microbicide against drug resistant S. aureus without injury to the wound bed and impediment of natural restorative processes associated with wound healing.

The existence of bacterial persistence and their possible mechanisms have been widely reported. However, the following regrowth of persister cells is not clear although the awakening of dormant surviving persisters is the key to reinitialize bacterial infection. In this study, we investigated the growth character and cariogenic virulence during the recovery of Streptococcus mutans drug-tolerant persister cells induced by a novel quaternary ammonium: dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM). A remarkable lag phase was observed in S. mutans persisters when regrew at the first 24 h compared to normal cells. During the entire recovery state, persisters are metabolically active to increase the production of both water-soluble and water-insoluble glucan. The shortage of cell number in persisters resulted in the decrease of lactic acid production, but persisters gradually recovered the normal acid production ability after 72 h. The up-regulated expression of gtf and vicR was in line with comDE circuit and consistent with the virulence change during the regrowth stage. Our findings proved that lethal dosages of DMADDM induced drug-tolerant S. mutans persisters in biofilm, which had a prolonged lag phase and elevated cariogenic virulence during regrowth. The recovery and elevated virulence of persisters were regulated by quorum-sensing and VicRK pathway. This alarmed the elevated cariogenicity of persisters and highlighted the critical requirement for the drug-tolerance evaluation when developing new oral antimicrobial agents. To the best of our knowledge, we characterized the regrowth and cariogenic virulence variation of S. mutans persisters induced by quaternary ammonium for the first time. Our findings suggest that S. mutans persisters with the elevated cariogenic virulence during their regrowth stage highlighted the need of new strategy to overcome bacterial persistence. Meanwhile, the prolonged lag phase and the involvement of quorum-sensing system in the regrowth of S. mutans persisters may provide the potential targets.","authors":[{"name":"Junzhuo Lu"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"},{"name":"Yuyao Huang"},{"name":"Yaling Jiang"},{"name":"Chun-Hung Chu"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Mingyun Li"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"},{"name":"Xuedong Zhou"},{"name":"Biao Ren"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-bacterial material"},{"word":"cariogenic virulence"},{"word":"dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate"},{"word":"drug tolerance"},{"word":"persister cells"}]},"article238":{"pmid":"32038544","title":"Computer-Aided Design of Antimicrobial Peptides: Are We Generating Effective Drug Candidates?","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), especially antibacterial peptides, have been widely investigated as potential alternatives to antibiotic-based therapies.

Using comparative genomics and literature mining, 115 M. tuberculosis proteins were shortlisted for their likely association with biofilm formation or quorum sensing. These include essential genes such as secA2, lpqY-sugABC, Rv1176c, and Rv0195, many of which are also known virulence factors. Furthermore, the functional relationship among these proteins was established by considering known protein-protein interactions, regulatory interactions, and gene expression correlation data/information. Graph centrality and motif analyses predicted the importance of proteins, such as Rv0081, DevR, RegX3, Rv0097, and Rv1996 in M. tuberculosis biofilm formation. Analysis of conservation across other biofilm-forming bacteria suggests that most of these genes are conserved in mycobacteria. As the processes, such as quorum sensing, leading to biofilm formation involve diverse pathways and interactions between proteins, these system-wide studies provide a novel perspective toward understanding mycobacterial persistence.","authors":[{"name":"Shubhada R Hegde"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"evolution"},{"word":"protein interactions"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"tuberculosis"}]},"article241":{"pmid":"32037950","title":"Oral antibiotic use and chronic disease: long-term health impact beyond antimicrobial resistance and Clostridioides difficile.","abs":"We recently reported an increased colon cancer risk associated with oral antibiotic use in a large United Kingdom population.

Understanding organismal input and uptake in this layer is key to interpreting the role UNPOs play in lichen biology. Here we review both polysaccharide composition determined from whole, pulverized lichens and UNPOs reported from lichens to date. Most reported polysaccharides are thought to be structural cell wall components. The composition of the extracellular matrix is not definitively known. Several lines of evidence suggest some polysaccharides have evaded detection in routine analysis of neutral sugars and may be involved in the extracellular matrix. UNPOs reported from lichens include diverse bacteria and yeasts for which secreted polysaccharides play important biological roles.

The genes that lack three-dimensional structures were predicted and validated. Carbon nano-fullerene selected as lead molecule and their drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetics properties were computationally predicted. The binding potential of carbon nano-fullerene toward selected drug targets was modeled and compared with the binding of conventional drugs, doripenem, and polymyxin-B with their usual targets. The stabilities of four best-docked complexes were confirmed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. This study suggested that selected genes demonstrated relevant interactions in the constructed metabolic pathways. Carbon fullerene exhibited significant binding abilities to most of the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of last-resort antibiotics and their usual target.

The presence of a halo surrounding the AZ78 colony on RMA was a first visible effect related to differences in growth medium composition and it corresponded to the formation of a large outer ring. The lower quantity of nutrients available in RMA as compared with LBA was associated to a higher expression of a gene encoding cAMP-receptor-like protein (Clp), responsible for cell motility and biofilm formation regulation. AZ78 cells on RMA were motile, equipped with cell surface appendages and organised in small groups embedded in a dense layer of fibrils. Metabolic profiling by mass spectrometry imaging revealed increased diversity of analytes produced by AZ78 on RMA as compared with LBA. In particular, putative cyclic lipodepsipeptides, polycyclic tetramate macrolactams, cyclic macrolactams and other putative secondary metabolites with antibiotic activity were identified.

In this study, a 1D biofilm model embedding the n-DAMO and anammox reactions was developed to facilitate further understanding of the process and its optimization. The model was calibrated and validated using comprehensive data sets from two independent MBfRs, treating sidestream- and mainstream-strength wastewater, respectively. Modelling results revealed a unique biofilm stratification. While anammox bacteria dominated throughout the biofilm, n-DAMO archaea (coupling nitrate reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation) only occurred at the inner layer and n-DAMO bacteria (coupling nitrite reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation) spread more evenly with a slightly higher fraction in the outer layer. The established MBfRs were robust against dynamic influent flowrates and nitrite/ammonium ratios. Thicker biofilms were beneficial for not only the total nitrogen (TN) removal but also the system robustness. Additionally, a positive correlation between the nitrogen removal efficiency and the residual methane emission was observed, as a result of higher methane partial pressure required. However, there was a threshold of methane partial pressure, above which the residual methane increased but nitrogen removal efficiency was stable. Meanwhile, thicker biofilms were also favorable to achieve less residual methane emission.

LB trough and atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis indicated the propensity of the amphiphiles to form a monolayer as well as spherical aggregates, with the critical micelle concentration (CMC) for C2 (7.0 μM) being lower than C1 (18.5 μM) in water. Formation of an amphiphile-metal complex was evidenced by ESI-MS, FTIR, FETEM-EDX, and ITC analysis. Growth of S. aureus MRSA 100 cells was remarkably impaired in the presence of 5.0 μM C1 or 20 μM C2 as compared to free cells or cells grown in the presence of equivalent levels of amphiphile-metal complexes, suggesting that the amphiphiles perhaps sequester metal and induce metal starvation in MRSA. C1 and C2 rendered superior membrane damage in MRSA and were less toxic to human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells as compared to their metal complexes. C1 and C2 rendered a dose-dependent inhibition of S. aureus biofilm formation, while revival of biofilm upon Zn(II) addition suggested that zinc starvation rendered by the amphiphiles may induce biofilm inhibition. C1 imposed a concentration-dependent metal starvation response in MRSA as there was an upregulation of the cntL gene and downregulation of cntA gene, which are involved in synthesis of the zincophore staphylopine (Stp) and transport of the Stp-Zn complex, respectively. ITC analysis revealed that binding of C1 and C2 to staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was stronger than the corresponding Zn(II) complexes, which perhaps accounted for the higher bactericidal potency of the amphiphiles. The study provides a fundamental understanding on how the chemistry-driven multimodal interaction of the amphiphile translates into growth inhibition and metal starvation in MRSA and advances the idea of combating drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria through amphiphiles, which are pluri-active.","authors":[{"name":"Poulomi Dey"},{"name":"Gopal Das"},{"name":"Aiyagari Ramesh"}],"keywords":[]},"article274":{"pmid":"32031543","title":"Chelate chemistry governs ion-specific stiffening of Bacillus subtilis B-1 and Azotobacter vinelandii biofilms.","abs":"Unwanted formation of bacterial biofilms can cause problems in both the medical sector and industrial settings.

Bioinformatic analysis revealed eleven candidate genes for c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins (GGDEF/EAL domain proteins) in the genome of A. baumannii strain 17978. Enzymatic activity of the encoded proteins was assessed by molecular cloning and expression in the model organisms Salmonella typhimurium and Vibrio cholerae. Ten of the eleven GGDEF/EAL proteins altered the rdar morphotype of S. typhimurium and the rugose morphotype of V. cholerae. The over expression of three GGDEF proteins exerted a pronounced effect on colony formation of A. baumannii on Congo Red agar plates. Distinct panels of GGDEF/EAL proteins were found to alter biofilm formation and surface associated motility of A. baumannii upon over expression. The GGDEF protein A1S_3296 appeared as a major diguanylate cyclase regulating macro-colony formation, biofilm formation and the surface associated motility.

While the function of PPAD in P. gingivalis physiology is not clear, human peptidylarginine deiminases are known to convert positively charged arginine residues within proteins to neutral citrulline and, thereby, impact protein conformation and function. Here, we report that the lack of citrullination in a PPAD deletion mutant (Δ8820) enhances biofilm formation. More Δ8820 cells attached to the surface than the parent strain during the early stages of biofilm development and, ultimately, mature Δ8820 biofilms were comprised of significantly more cell-cell aggregates and extracellular matrix. Imaging by electron microscopy discovered that Δ8820 biofilm cells secrete copious amounts of protein aggregates. Furthermore, gingipain-derived adhesin proteins, which are also secreted by the T9SS were predicted by mass spectrometry to be citrullinated and citrullination of these targets by wild-type strain 381 in vitro was confirmed. Lastly, Δ8820 biofilms contained more gingipain-derived adhesin proteins and more gingipain activity than 381 biofilms. Overall, our findings support the model that citrullination of T9SS cargo proteins known to play a key role in colonization, such as gingipain-derived adhesin proteins, is an underlying mechanism that modulates P. gingivalis biofilm development.","authors":[{"name":"Danielle M Vermilyea"},{"name":"Gregory K Ottenberg"},{"name":"Mary E Davey"}],"keywords":[]},"article279":{"pmid":"32029309","title":"Un-steady state modeling for free cyanide removal and biofilm growth in a RBC batch process.","abs":"Biofilm growth and free cyanide biological removal from gold mine wastewater were modeled and simulated using a bench-scale rotating biological contactor (RBC).

However, our knowledge of plasmid-bacteria coevolution is solely based on studies done in well-mixed liquid cultures, even though biofilms represent the main way of bacterial life on Earth and are responsible for most infections. The spatial structure and heterogeneity provided by biofilms is known to lead to increased genetic diversity as compared to well-mixed liquids. Therefore we expect that growth in this complex environment could affect the evolutionary trajectories of plasmid-host dyads. We experimentally evolved Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with plasmid pBP136Gm in biofilms and chemostats and sequenced the genomes of clones and populations. Biofilm populations not only maintained a higher diversity of mutations than chemostat populations, but contained a few clones with markedly more persistent plasmids that evolved via multiple distinct trajectories. These included the acquisition of a putative toxin-antitoxin transposon by the plasmid and chromosomal mutations. Some of these genetic changes resulted in loss of plasmid transferability or decrease in plasmid cost. Growth in chemostats led to a higher proportion of variants with decreased plasmid persistence, a phenomenon not detected in biofilms.

Accurate mechanistic models of these interactions require an understanding of the heterogeneity in which the deterioration processes proceed. Here, unsaturated biofilms (i.e., at air/solid interfaces) of the yeast Papiliotrema laurentii were prepared on polyether polyurethane (PEUR) and polyester-polyether polyurethane (PEST-PEUR) coatings and incubated for up to 33 days at controlled temperature and humidity with no additional nutrients. Transmission micro-Fourier transform infrared microscopy (μFTIR) confirmed preferential hydrolysis of the ester component by the biofilm. Atomic force microscopy combined with infrared nanospectroscopy (AFM-IR) was used to analyze initial PEST-PEUR coating deterioration processes at the single-cell level, including underlying surfaces that became exposed following cell translocation. The results revealed distinct deterioration features that remained localized within ∼10 μm or less of the edges of individual cells and cell clusters. These features comprised depressions of up to ∼300 nm with locally reduced ester/urethane ratios. They are consistent with a formation process initiated by enzymatic ester hydrolysis followed by erosion from water condensation cycles. Further observations included particle accumulation in the broader biofilm vicinity. AFM-IR spectroscopy indicated these to be secondary microplastics consisting of urethane-rich oligomeric aggregates. Overall, multiple contributing factors have been identified that can facilitate differential deterioration rates across the PEST-PEUR surface. Effects of the imposed nutrient conditions on Papiliotrema laurentii physiology were also apparent, with cells developing the characteristics of starvation response, despite the availability of polyester metabolites as a carbon source. The combined results provide new laboratory insights into field-relevant microbiological polymer deterioration mechanisms and biofilm physiology at polymer coating interfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel E Barlow"},{"name":"Justin C Biffinger"},{"name":"Luis Estrella"},{"name":"Qin Lu"},{"name":"Chia-Suei Hung"},{"name":"Lloyd J Nadeau"},{"name":"Audra L Crouch"},{"name":"John N Russell"},{"name":"Wendy J Crookes-Goodson"}],"keywords":[]},"article290":{"pmid":"32025329","title":"Virulence and biofilms as promising targets in developing antipathogenic drugs against candidiasis.","abs":"Candida albicans has remained the main etiological agent of candidiasis, challenges clinicians with high mortality and morbidity.

The alginate of the biofilm was believed to be the key factor disabling immune therapy and antibiotic treatments. A silver nanocomposite consisting of silver nanoparticles and a mesoporous organosilica layer was created to deliver two pharmaceutical compounds (alginate lyase and ceftazidime) to degrade the alginate and eradicate P. aeruginosa from the lungs. The introduction of thioether-bridged mesoporous organosilica into the nanocomposites greatly benefited the conjunction of foreign functional molecules such as alginate lyase and increased their hemocompatibility and drug-loading capacity. Silver nanocomposites with a uniform diameter (∼39 nm) exhibited a high dispersity, good biocompatibility, and high ceftazidime-loading capacity (380.96 mg/g). Notably, the silver nanocomposites displayed a low pH-dependent drug release and degradation profiles (pH 6.4), guaranteeing the targeted release of the drugs in the acidic niches of the P. aeruginosa biofilm. Indeed, particles loaded with alginate lyase and ceftazidime exhibited high inhibitory and degradation effects on the biofilm of P. aeruginosa PAO1 based on the specific catalytic activity of the enzyme to the alginate and antibacterial function of their loaded ceftazidime and silver ions. It should be noted that the enzyme-decorated nanocomposites succeeded in eradicating P. aeruginosa PAO1 from the mouse lungs and decreasing the lung injuries. No deaths or serious side effects were observed during the experiments. We believe that the silver nanocomposites with high biocompatibility and organic group-incorporated framework have the potential to be used to deliver multiple functional molecules for antibacterial therapy in clinical application.","authors":[{"name":"Bing Wan"},{"name":"Ying Zhu"},{"name":"Jun Tao"},{"name":"Feipeng Zhu"},{"name":"Jianquan Chen"},{"name":"Li Li"},{"name":"Jianfeng Zhao"},{"name":"Li Wang"},{"name":"Shuangshuang Sun"},{"name":"Yang Yang"},{"name":"Xiuwei Zhang"},{"name":"Yunlei Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"alginate"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"mesoporous organosilica"},{"word":"silver nanocomposites"}]},"article293":{"pmid":"32024347","title":"The Efficiency and Acceptance of a Suction Tongue-Cleaning Device in Adults","abs":"Halitosis is often caused by a change in the oral biofilm, primarily located on the surface of the tongue. A suction tongue cleaner enables professional cleaning of the tongue. The aim of this study was to investigate the acceptance and efficiency of a suction tongue-cleaning device in adults in comparison to a conventional manual tongue cleaner in an office (professional) setting. Both were tested simultaneously on 100 individuals with a split-mouth (i. e. half-tongue) design, between the ages of 19 to 31, at the University Center for Dental Medicine Basel UZB. To evaluate the efficiency of the cleaning, photos were taken before and after the cleaning and later assessed by using a modified coating tongue index by Winkel (WTCI). Both cleaning devices significantly reduced the coating on the tongue (p < 0.001). In 58 cases, the side cleaned with the suction tongue cleaner resulted to be cleaner in comparison to the side which was cleaned manually. There were no significant differences in acceptance on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-10 cm) between the devices (p = 0.259). However, 53 subjects favored the manual method in comparison to 36 who favored the suction device. The remaining 11 did not convey any preference for either. Both devices triggered an equally frequent gag stimulus. With 95%, the majority of the patients who had this treatment would undergo it a second time. In conclusion, both cleaning devices resulted in a significant reduction of tongue coating, and the usage in general can be highly recommended. While it does not matter which one is used, the suction tongue-cleaning device offers a good alternative to manual tongue-cleaning devices in dental clinics and can be considered a viable adjunct for in-office use.","authors":[{"name":"Sandro Rhyn"},{"name":"Andrea Zürcher"},{"name":"Virginia Ortiz"},{"name":"Andreas Filippi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"TS1 suction tongue cleaner"},{"word":"Tongue cleaning"},{"word":"Tongue sanitizer"}]},"article294":{"pmid":"32024254","title":"Increasing Susceptibility of Drug-Resistant Candida albicans to Fluconazole and Terbinafine by 2(5H)-Furanone Derivative.","abs":"The frequency of mycoses caused by drug-resistant fungal pathogen Candida albicans has increased drastically over the last two decades.

IMIs are often caused by staphylococci, which are Gram-positive bacteria that become pathogenic by forming biofilms and producing toxins. As a model for a teat dip (DIP), the BacStop iodine-based teat dip (DIP) was used.

We found that the minimal inhibitory or bactericidal concentrations of DIP against planktonic S. epidermidis cells increased up to 160fold in the presence of WH, and that DIP was 10-fold less effective against biofilm cells. While both DIP and WH are effective in inhibiting the growth of S. aureus, only WH inhibits toxin production (tested for enterotoxin-A). Importantly, WH also significantly enhances the antibacterial effect of DIP against Gram-negative bacteria that can cause IMIs, like Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Modulating pathogenicity and virulence by manipulating microbial communication is a promising strategy.

To establish the existence of this biochemical process in B. cinerea, we prepared extracts at different growth times (D1-D12), which were applied to fresh cultures of the same fungi. The chemical analysis of the extracts obtained from several fermentations showed different compositions and biological activities. We confirmed the presence of several phytotoxins, as well as compounds 1-phenylethanol and 3-phenylpropanol. Day five extract (0.1%) inhibited conidia germination and elongation of germ tubes, day seven extract (1%) produced the greatest phytotoxic effect in tomato leaves, and day nine extract (0.1%) was a sporulation inhibitor. In contrast, the extracts from days 7, 9, and 12 of fermentation (0.1% and 0.01%) promoted pellet and biofilm formation. Sporulation was slightly induced at 0.01%, while at 0.1% there was a great inhibition. At the highest extract concentrations, a biocidal effect was detected, but at the lowest, we observed a QS-like effect, regulating processes such as filamentation, morphogenesis, and pathogenesis.

We also observed a higher physical robustness of F. novicida biofilm as compared to F. philomiragia one, a feature likely promoted by specific polysaccharides. Further, F. novicida biofilms resisted significantly better to ciprofloxacin than their planktonic counterparts. Importantly, when grown in biofilms, both Francisella species survived longer in cold water as compared to free-living bacteria, a trait possibly associated with a gain in fitness in the natural aquatic environment.

In clinical and medical settings, these persistent pathogens predominantly grow as complex heterogeneous structures enmeshed in a self-produced exopolysaccharide matrix, termed as biofilms. Since biofilms can rapidly form by adapting new environmental surroundings and have potential effect on human health, it is critical to study them promptly and consistently. Biofilm infections are challenging in the contamination of medical devices and implantations, food processing and pharmaceutical industrial settings, and in dental area caries, periodontitis and so on. The persistence of infections associated with biofilms has been mainly attributed to the increased antibiotic resistance offered by the cells growing in biofilms. In fact, it is well known that this recalcitrance of bacterial biofilms is multifactorial, and there are several resistance mechanisms that may act in parallel in order to provide an enhanced level of resistance to the biofilm. In combination, distinct resistance mechanisms significantly decrease our ability to control and eradicate biofilm-associated infections with current antimicrobial arsenal. In addition, various factors are known to influence the process of biofilm formation, growth dynamics, and their heterogeneous response towards antibiotic therapy. The current review discusses the contribution of cellular and physiochemical factors on the growth dynamics of biofilm, especially their role in antibiotic resistance mechanisms of bacterial population living in surface attached growth mode. A systematic investigation on the effects and treatment of biofilms may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat biofilms in healthcare and industrial settings.","authors":[{"name":"Lakshmi Machineni"}],"keywords":[]},"article311":{"pmid":"32020464","title":"Curtailing Quorum Sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Sitagliptin.","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa coordinates the secretion of virulence factors through quorum sensing. Quorum sensing inhibitors can attenuate the pathogenesis of bacteria and help the immune system to eradicate them without targeting the bacterial growth. This study aimed to explore the anti-quorum sensing and anti-virulence activities of sitagliptin against P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain. Sub-inhibitory concentration of sitagliptin significantly inhibited the virulence factors pyocyanin, hemolysin, protease and elastase in addition to blocking swimming, swarming and twitching motilities and biofilm formation. In silico analysis showed that sitagliptin interacted with LasR receptors by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction, mainly with the amino acids leucine present at positions 40 and 125, tyrosine at position 56, serine at position 129, tryptophan at position 60, alanine at position 50 and phenyl alanine at position 101. qRT-PCR confirmed the anti-quorum sensing activity by reducing the expression level of QS genes lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, pqsA and pqsR. In conclusion, sitagliptin is a novel anti-quorum sensing agent that can be used for treating P. aeruginosa infections.","authors":[{"name":"Hisham A Abbas"},{"name":"Moutaz A Shaldam"},{"name":"Dalia Eldamasi"}],"keywords":[]},"article312":{"pmid":"32020424","title":"Evaluation of the biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on human umbilical cord CD146+ stem cells and stem cell-based decellularized matrix.","abs":"This study aims to evaluate the CD146+ stem cells obtained from the human umbilical cord and their extracellular matrix proteins on in vitro Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms to understand their possible antimicrobial activity.

Furthermore, S. sanguinis responds to C. durum lipids by decreasing the expression of key FASII genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Several of these genes are also essential for the chain elongation phenotype, which implicates a regulatory connection between lipid metabolism and chain elongation. In addition, C. durum was found to affect the growth, cell aggregation, and phagocytosis of S. sanguinis, revealing a complex association of these species that likely supports oral commensal colonization and survival.","authors":[{"name":"Puthayalai Treerat"},{"name":"Ulrike Redanz"},{"name":"Sylvio Redanz"},{"name":"Rodrigo A Giacaman"},{"name":"Justin Merritt"},{"name":"Jens Kreth"}],"keywords":[]},"article315":{"pmid":"32019109","title":"Lipidated Analogs of the LL-37-Derived Peptide Fragment KR12-Structural Analysis, Surface-Active Properties and Antimicrobial Activity.","abs":"An increasing number of multidrug-resistant pathogens is a serious problem of modern medicine and new antibiotics are highly demanded.

The genomic composition of total (DNA) and active (RNA) diversity, and the community level physiological profiles (CLPP) were considered as proxies for functional diversity to describe both prokaryotes and eukaryotes inhabiting the surface and hyporheic streambeds. Comparisons between the genomic and potential functional responses helped to understand how and whether the microbial diversity was sensitive to the environmental conditions and resource acquisition, such as water stress and extracellular enzyme activities, respectively. RNA expression showed the strongest relationship with the environmental conditions and resource acquisition, being more responsive to changing conditions compared to DNA diversity, especially in the case of prokaryotes. The DNA results presumably reflected the legacy of the treatments because inactive, dormant, or dead cells were included, suggesting a slow microbial biomass turnover or responses of the microbial communities to changes mainly through physiological acclimation. On the other hand, microbial functional diversity was largely explained by resources acquisition, such as metrics of extracellular enzymes, and appeared vulnerable to the hydrological changes and duration of desiccation.

The entry of nanoparticles into bacterial cells was validated through both atomic force microscopy and fluorescent microscopy. The adhesive properties of this coating material and its stability in various pH, i.e., pH 3, pH 7 and pH 10 conditions, could make them a good candidate in the prevention of biofilm formation.

The P(PEGMA-b-DEAEMA) di-block polymer micelles demonstrated a particle size of 55 ± 6 nm and high ICZ loads (12.0 ± 0.5% w/w). Within the biofilm's acidic microenvironment, tertiary amines of the pH-sensitive DEAEMA block are protonated, altering their conformation and enhancing the release of the micellar contents.

Biochemical analysis of the clinical isolate SA564, which aggregates when deficient for CodY, revealed these features are sensitive to nuclease treatment and are resistant to protease exposure. Genetic analyses revealed that disrupting lgt (diacylglycerol transferase) in codY mutant cells severely weakened aggregation, indicating a role for lipoproteins in the attachment of the biofilm matrix to the cell surface. An additional and critical role of IcaB for producing functional poly N-acetylglucosamine (PIA) polysaccharide in eDNA-dependent biofilm formation is shown. Moreover, overproducing PIA is sufficient to promote aggregation in a DNA-dependent manner regardless of source of nucleic acids. Taken together, our results point to PIA synthesis as the primary determinant of biofilm formation when CodY activity is reduced, and suggest a modified electrostatic net model for matrix attachment whereby PIA associates with eDNA, which interacts with the cell surface via covalently attached membrane lipoproteins. This work counters the prevailing view that polysaccharide- and eDNA/protein-based biofilms are mutually exclusive.

However, few studies have described the development of methods for the removal and remediation of MPs. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the recent literature regarding the microbial-mediated degradation of MPs and discuss the associated degradation characteristics and mechanisms. Different types and combinations of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, bacterial consortia, and biofilms, that can degrade different MPs are categorized. This article summarizes approximately 50 recent papers. Twelve and 6 papers reported that bacteria and fungi, respectively, can degrade MPs. Nine articles indicated that bacterial consortia have the ability to degrade MPs, and 6 articles found that biofilms can also utilize MPs. Furthermore, to evaluate their associated degradation effects, the corresponding structural changes (i.e., macro size, surface morphology, and functional groups) in MPs after microbial degradation are examined. In addition, MP biodegradation is affected by microbial characteristics and environmental factors; therefore, the environmental factors (i.e., temperature, pH and strain activity) influencing MP degradation and the associated degradation effects (i.e., weight loss, degradation rate, and molecular weight change) are generalized. Furthermore, the mechanisms associated with the microbial-mediated degradation of MPs are briefly discussed. Finally, prospects for the degradation of MPs using microbes and future research directions are envisioned. This review provides the first systematic summary of the microbial-mediated degradation of MPs and provides a reference for future studies investigating effective means of MP pollution control.","authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Yuan"},{"name":"Jie Ma"},{"name":"Yiran Sun"},{"name":"Tao Zhou"},{"name":"Youcai Zhao"},{"name":"Fei Yu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Degradation behavior"},{"word":"Degradation mechanism"},{"word":"Microorganism"},{"word":"Microplastics"}]},"article338":{"pmid":"32014762","title":"Biodiversity of organisms inhabiting the water supply network of Wroclaw.

Results showed no changes in GONPs transport and retention at high ionic strength in the presence of MS2 or E. coli, which was attributed to the effect of high concentration of divalent cation on aggregation of nanoparticles and microorganisms. Furthermore, simultaneous enhanced transport and decreased retention of GONPs in column was observed in the co-presence of microorganisms at low ionic strength. Results revealed that the main mechanism governing increasing GONPs transport in porous media was occupation of reactive surface sites of collectors by microorganisms, which prevented attachment of nanoparticles. The pre-saturation of columns with MS2 and E. coli caused increasing transport of GONPs in the columns, due to the occupation of surface reactive sites. Moreover, conditioning limestone collectors with natural biofilm resulted in the same rates of nanoparticle elution and retention (i.e., in the presence or absence of microorganisms) by straining of GONPs in the inlet end of columns which shows that the biofilm acts as a bio-filter against discharging nanoparticles into the effluents.

Our study aims to delineate the role of ClpB, a heat shock protein of Hsp100 family, in the general stress response and persistence mechanisms of Mtb. We demonstrate that Mtb requires ClpB to survive under stressful conditions. Additionally, we show that ClpB is necessary for the bacteria to persist in latency-like conditions such as prolonged hypoxia and nutrient-starvation. The disruption of ClpB results in aberrant cellular morphology, impaired biofilm formation and reduced infectivity of Mtb ex vivo. Our study also reports an alternative role of ClpB as a chaperokine which elicits inflammatory response in host.

Here, we cloned 16 genes from P. aeruginosa PAO1 that are predicted to encode diguanylate cyclases (DGCs, responsible for c-di-GMP biosynthesis) and constructed their corresponding in-frame deletion mutants. We evaluated the methods to measure the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration by using deletion mutants and PAO1 strains containing a plasmid expressing one of the 16 genes, respectively. Functional outputs of all PAO1-derived stains were also detected and evaluated, including biofilm formation, production of exopolysaccharide, swimming and swarming motilities.

Exogenous AI-2 had a concentration-dependent effect on the Enterococcus faecium 8-3 cell density.

Allicin is a characteristic sulfur-containing compound found in raw garlic produced from alliin and exhibits antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Herbal extracts and polyphenols are produced from herbs that contain a variety of ingredients, most of which exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-microbial actions. Gingivitis is triggered by the infection of the periodontal tissues with periodontal disease-causing pathogens present in the dental biofilm. This is accompanied by weak inflammatory immune reactions in the gingiva. In periodontitis, prolonged and excessive inflammation results in the destruction of gingival connective tissue and in the resorption of alveolar bone, leading to tooth loss. There are a number of clinical reports showing the effectiveness of both herbal extracts and polyphenols on periodontal diseases when applied as a mouthwash or dentifrice into the oral cavity. However, to date, at least to the best of our knowledge, there is no clinical report available on the therapeutic effects of garlic or its extract on periodontal diseases, apart from a recent study, which reported that the intake of aged garlic extract (AGE) containing various pharmacologically active sulfur compounds, alleviated the symptoms of gingivitis clinically. The finding suggests that AGE may be a promising candidate for use in the treatment of periodontal diseases, although additional clinical trials are warranted to confirm this. In addition, further studies are required for the clarification of the basic molecular mechanisms through which AGE attenuates gingivitis.

They display a complex life cycle: vegetatively growing cells coordinate their motility to form multicellular swarms, which upon starvation aggregate into large fruiting bodies where cells differentiate into spores. In addition to growing as saprophytes, Myxobacteria are predators that actively kill bacteria of other species to consume their biomass. In this review, we summarize research on the predation behavior of the model myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus, which can access nutrients from a broad spectrum of microorganisms. M. xanthus displays an epibiotic predation strategy, i.e., it induces prey lysis from the outside and feeds on the released biomass. This predatory behavior encompasses various processes: Gliding motility and induced cell reversals allow M. xanthus to encounter prey and to remain within the area to sweep up its biomass, which causes the characteristic rippling of preying populations. Antibiotics and secreted bacteriolytic enzymes appear to be important predation factors, which are possibly targeted to prey cells with the aid of outer membrane vesicles. However, certain bacteria protect themselves from M. xanthus predation by forming mechanical barriers, such as biofilms and mucoid colonies, or by secreting antibiotics. Further understanding the molecular mechanisms that mediate myxobacterial predation will offer fascinating insight into the reciprocal relationships of bacteria in complex communities, and might spur application-oriented research on the development of novel antibacterial strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Susanne Thiery"},{"name":"Christine Kaimer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial soil communities"},{"word":"gliding motility"},{"word":"myxovirescin"},{"word":"outer membrane vesicle"},{"word":"protein secretion system"}]},"article364":{"pmid":"32010117","title":"Quorum Sensing-Independent Cellulase-Sensitive Pellicle Formation Is Critical for Colonization of Burkholderia glumae in Rice Plants.","abs":"Bacteria form biofilms as a means to adapt to environmental changes for survival. Pellicle is a floating biofilm formed at the air-liquid interface in static culture conditions; however, its functional roles have received relatively little attention compared to solid surface-associated biofilms in gram-negative bacteria. Here we show that the rice pathogen Burkholderia glumae BGR1 forms cellulase-sensitive pellicles in a bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP)- and flagellum-dependent, but quorum sensing (QS)-independent, manner. Pellicle formation was more favorable at 28°C than at the optimum growth temperature (37°C), and was facilitated by constitutive expression of pelI, a diguanylate cyclase gene from B. glumae, or pleD, the GGDEF response regulator from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Constitutive expression of pelI or pleD raised the levels of c-di-GMP, facilitated pellicle formation, and suppressed swarming motility in B. glumae. QS-defective mutants of B. glumae formed pellicles, while flagellum-defective mutants did not. Pellicles of B. glumae were sensitive to cellulase but not to proteinase K or DNase I. A gene cluster containing seven genes involved in bacterial cellulose biosynthesis, bcsD, bcsR, bcsQ, bcsA, bcsB, bcsZ, and bcsC, homologous to known genes involved in cellulose biosynthesis in other bacteria, was identified in B. glumae. Mutations in each gene abolished pellicle formation. These results revealed a positive correlation between cellulase-sensitive pellicles and putative cellulose biosynthetic genes. Pellicle-defective mutants did not colonize as successfully as the wild-type strain BGR1 in rice plants, which resulted in a significant reduction in virulence.

The cabABC operon encodes an extracellular matrix protein CabA and the corresponding type I secretion system, which are essential for biofilm and rugose colony development of V. vulnificus. In this study, molecular biological analyses revealed the roles of three transcriptional regulators BrpR, BrpT, and BrpS in the regulatory pathway for the cabABC operon. BrpR induces brpT and BrpT in turn activates the cabABC operon in a sequential cascade, contributing to development of robust biofilm structures. BrpT also activates brpS, but BrpS represses brpT, constituting a negative feedback loop that stabilizes brpT expression. BrpT and BrpS directly bind to specific sequences upstream of cabA, and they constitute a feedforward loop in which BrpT induces brpS and together with BrpS activates cabABC, leading to precise regulation of cabABC expression. Accordingly, BrpS as well as BrpT plays a crucial role in complete development of rugose colonies. This elaborate network of three transcriptional regulators BrpR, BrpT, and BrpS thus tightly controls cabABC regulation, and contributes to successful development of robust biofilms and rugose colonies in V. vulnificus.","authors":[{"name":"Seung-Ho Hwang"},{"name":"Jin Hwan Park"},{"name":"Byungho Lee"},{"name":"Sang Ho Choi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio vulnificus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"colony morphology"},{"word":"extracellular matrix protein"},{"word":"transcriptional regulator"}]},"article367":{"pmid":"32010108","title":"Oxidative Stress Induced by Metal Ions in Bioleaching of LiCoO","abs":"An acidophilic microbial consortium (AMC) was used to investigate the fundamental mechanism behind the adverse effects of pulp density increase in the bioleaching of waste lithium ion batteries (WLIBs).

Here, we investigated the functional signatures of the prokaryotic communities of the soil and the episphere, that includes the rhizosphere and phyllosphere, associated with the cultivated Agave tequilana and the native and sympatric Agave salmiana, Opuntia robusta and Myrtillocactus geometrizans by mining shotgun metagenomic data. Consistent with previous phylogenetic profiling, we found that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the main represented phyla in the episphere of agaves and cacti, and that clustering of metagenomes correlated with the plant compartment. In native plants, genes related to aerobic anoxygenic phototrophy and photosynthesis were enriched in the phyllosphere and soil, while genes coding for biofilm formation and quorum sensing were enriched in both epiphytic communities. In the episphere of cultivated A. tequilana fewer genes were identified, but they belonged to similar pathways than those found in native plants. A. tequilana showed a depletion in several genes belonging to carbon metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation suggesting that its lower microbial diversity might be linked to functional losses. However, this species also showed an enrichment in biofilm and quorum sensing in the epiphytic compartments, and evidence for nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere. Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic markers were represented by Rhizobiales (Methylobacterium) and Rhodospirillales (Belnapia) in the phyllosphere, while photosystem genes were widespread in Bacillales and Cyanobacteria. Nitrogen fixation and biofilm formation genes were mostly related to Proteobacteria. These analyses support the idea of niche differentiation in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere of agaves and cacti and shed light on the potential mechanisms by which epiphytic microbial communities survive and colonize plants of arid and semiarid ecosystems.

The colonization of dairy cows and subsequent contamination of raw milk by S. aureus, especially strains exhibiting multidrug resistance and biofilm-forming and toxin-producing abilities, remains an important issue for both dairy farmers and public health. In this study, we investigated the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility, biofilm formation, and genetic diversity of S. aureus from subclinical bovine mastitis in dairy farms located in southern Xinjiang, China. Sixty-five isolates from 84 subclinical mastitic milk samples were identified as S. aureus. The resistance rates to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, linezolid, rifampicin, quinupudin-dafupudin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and chloramphenicol were 58.5, 44.6, 40.0, 18.5, 12.3, 10.8, 9.2, 6.2, 4.6, 4.6, and 1.5%, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. Isolates from farm A showed a significantly higher resistance rate to tetracycline (16.9%) than those from farm B (1.5%). The most frequently detected virulence factors were hla (96.9%, 63/65) and hlb (100.0%, 65/65). The percentage rates of the staphylococcal enterotoxin genes sea, sec, sed, seg, seh, sei, and sej in S. aureus isolates were 4.6, 33.8, 27.7, 3.1, 41.5, 41.5, and 7.7%, respectively. The percentage rate of the sec gene in isolates from farm B (30.8%) was significantly higher than that of farm A (3.1%). The percentage rates of the tsst and pvl genes in S. aureus isolates were 26.2 and 40.0%. The percentage rate of the pvl gene in isolates from farm B (32.3%) was significantly higher than that of farm A (7.7%). The adhesion molecules fnbA, fnbB, clfA, clfB, and cna were detected in 21 (32.3%), 23 (35.4%), 65 (100.0%), 65 (100.0%), and 65 (100.0%) isolates, respectively. The percentage rates of the icaA, sarA, tcaR, ccp, luxS, and sigB genes in S. aureus isolates were 69.2, 100.0, 86.2, 95.4, 84.6, and 100.0%, respectively. The fnbB and icaA genes were more frequently detected in isolates from farm A (29.2 and 40.0%, respectively) than those from farm B (6.2 and 29.2%, respectively). The luxS gene was more often found in isolates from farm B (50.8%) than those from farm A (33.8%). Using the microplate method, 61.5, 26.2, and 10.8% of the isolates showed weak, moderate, and strong biofilm-forming abilities, respectively. Different clonal complex (CC) and spa-types were identified, including CC81, CC398, CC88, CC5405, and CC5406. Importantly, in this study we report for the first time 41 new sequence types (ST) among 44 distinct ST. These results indicated high genetic diversity of S. aureus involved in subclinical bovine mastitis in southern Xinjiang, China. The results also showed that S. aureus from subclinical bovine mastitis cases in southern Xinjiang, China, were mainly resistant to β-lactams, erythromycin, and clindamycin. Also, biofilm- and adhesion-related genes, which are increasingly known as important virulence factors in the pathogenesis of S. aureus infections, were detected at a high rate. This study could help identify predominant clones and provide surveillance measures to decrease or eliminate S. aureus contamination in raw milk of dairy cows with subclinical mastitis.","authors":[{"name":"Qiang Ren"},{"name":"Guanghua Liao"},{"name":"Zihao Wu"},{"name":"Junfan Lv"},{"name":"Wei Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"mastitis"},{"word":"molecular typing"},{"word":"raw milk"}]},"article380":{"pmid":"32008118","title":"Hybrid Model of Bacterial Biofilm Growth.","abs":"Bacterial biofilms play a critical role in environmental processes, water treatment, human health, and food processing.

We present a hybrid computational model in which the dynamics of discrete bacterial cells are simulated within a multiphase continuum, consisting of EPS and water as separate interacting phases, through which nutrients and minerals diffuse. Bacterial cells in our model consume water and nutrients in order to grow, divide, and produce EPS. Consequently, EPS flows outward from the bacterial colony, while water flows inward. The model predicts bacterial colony formation as a treelike structure. The distribution of bacterial growth and EPS production is found to be sensitive to the pore spacing between bacteria and the consumption of nutrients within the bacterial colony. Forces that are sometimes neglected in biofilm simulations, such as lubrication force between nearby bacterial cells and osmotic (swelling) pressure force resulting from gradients in EPS concentration, are observed to have an important effect on biofilm growth via their influence on bacteria pore spacing and associated water/nutrient percolation into the bacterial colony.","authors":[{"name":"Xing Jin"},{"name":"Jeffrey S Marshall"},{"name":"Matthew J Wargo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Agent-based model"},{"word":"Bacterial modeling"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Individual-based model"}]},"article381":{"pmid":"32008087","title":"Endosymbiosis before eukaryotes: mitochondrial establishment in protoeukaryotes.","abs":"Endosymbiosis and organellogenesis are virtually unknown among prokaryotes. The single presumed example is the endosymbiogenetic origin of mitochondria, which is hidden behind the event horizon of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. While eukaryotes are monophyletic, it is unlikely that during billions of years, there were no other prokaryote-prokaryote endosymbioses as symbiosis is extremely common among prokaryotes, e.g., in biofilms. Therefore, it is even more precarious to draw conclusions about potentially existing (or once existing) prokaryotic endosymbioses based on a single example. It is yet unknown if the bacterial endosymbiont was captured by a prokaryote or by a (proto-)eukaryote, and if the process of internalization was parasitic infection, slow engulfment, or phagocytosis. In this review, we accordingly explore multiple mechanisms and processes that could drive the evolution of unicellular microbial symbioses with a special attention to prokaryote-prokaryote interactions and to the mitochondrion, possibly the single prokaryotic endosymbiosis that turned out to be a major evolutionary transition. We investigate the ecology and evolutionary stability of inter-species microbial interactions based on dependence, physical proximity, cost-benefit budget, and the types of benefits, investments, and controls. We identify challenges that had to be conquered for the mitochondrial host to establish a stable eukaryotic lineage. Any assumption about the initial interaction of the mitochondrial ancestor and its contemporary host based solely on their modern relationship is rather perilous. As a result, we warn against assuming an initial mutually beneficial interaction based on modern mitochondria-host cooperation. This assumption is twice fallacious: (i) endosymbioses are known to evolve from exploitative interactions and (ii) cooperativity does not necessarily lead to stable mutualism. We point out that the lack of evidence so far on the evolution of endosymbiosis from mutual syntrophy supports the idea that mitochondria emerged from an exploitative (parasitic or phagotrophic) interaction rather than from syntrophy.","authors":[{"name":"István Zachar"},{"name":"Gergely Boza"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Endosymbiosis"},{"word":"Eukaryogenesis"},{"word":"Mitochondria"},{"word":"Mutualism"},{"word":"Prokaryotes"}]},"article382":{"pmid":"32007899","title":"Characterization and co-occurrence of microbial community in epiphytic biofilms and surface sediments of wetlands with submersed macrophytes.","abs":"Microbes in epiphytic biofilms and surface sediments play crucial roles in the biogeochemical cycles in wetlands.

C12AHL is known to inhibit C. albicans' morphological transition and biofilm formation. Four different formulations of liposomes with fluconazole (L-F), with C12AHL (L-H), with fluconazole and C12AHL (L-HF), and a drug-free control (L-C) were prepared using a thin-film hydration followed by extrusion method, and characterised. The effect of liposomes on colonising (90 min-24 h) and preformed (24 h) C. albicans biofilms were assessed using a standard biofilm assay. Biofilm viability (XTT reduction assay), biomass (Safranin-O staining) and architecture (confocal laser scanning microscopy, CLSM) were determined. Similar efficiencies of fluconazole entrapment were noticed in L-HF and L-F (11.74% vs 10.2%), however, L-HF released greater quantities of fluconazole compared to L-F during 24 h (4.27% vs 0.97%, P < 0.05). The entrapment and release of C12AHL was similar for L-H and L-HF liposomes (33.3% vs 33% and 88.9% vs 92.3% respectively). L-HF treated colonising, and preformed biofilms exhibited >80%, and 60% reduction in their respective viabilities at a fluconazole concentration as low as 5.5 µg/mL compared to 12% and 36%, respective reductions observed in L-F treated biofilms (P < 0.05). CLSM confirmed biofilm disruption, lack of hyphae, and reduction in biomass when treated with L-HF compared to other liposomal preparations. Liposomal co-delivery of C12AHL and fluconazole appears to suppress C. albicans biofilms through efficacious disruption of the biofilm, killing of constituent yeasts, and diminishing their virulence at a significantly lower antifungal dose. Therefore, liposomal co-formulation of C12AHL and fluconazole appears to be a promising approach to improve the efficacy of this common triazole against biofilm-mediated candidal infections.","authors":[{"name":"H M H N Bandara"},{"name":"A K Hewavitharana"},{"name":"P N Shaw"},{"name":"H D C Smyth"},{"name":"L P Samaranayake"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungal resistance"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Fluconazole"},{"word":"Liposomes"},{"word":"N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone"}]},"article395":{"pmid":"32006577","title":"Structural elucidation and biological aptitude of modified hydroxyethylcellulose-polydimethyl siloxane based polyurethanes.","abs":"The main aim of this research work was to incorporate modified hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) into PDMS based polyurethanes.

External stimuli are often referred to as stressors. The stringent response, mediated by the alarmone (p)ppGpp, is central to the stress response in many bacteria; yet, there is limited knowledge regarding the role of (p)ppGpp signaling in bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. Like its counterparts in the gut (e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides fragilis), Porphyromonas gingivalis persists in close association with its human host. Given the potential for numerous perturbations in the oral cavity, and the fact that P. gingivalis can enter and replicate within host cells, we hypothesized that (p)ppGpp is a key signaling molecule for stress adaptation and persistence. Here, we show that accumulation of ppGpp in P. gingivalis is governed by two homologous enzymes, designated Rel, and RshB, and that ppGpp signaling affects growth rate, survival, biofilm formation, production of outer membrane vesicles, and expression of genes encoding type IX secretion structural and cargo proteins. Overall, our findings provide a potential mechanism by which biofilm formation and virulence of P. gingivalis are integrated via ppGpp signaling, a regulatory mechanism central to bacterial survival in dynamic environments.","authors":[{"name":"Hey-Min Kim"},{"name":"Mary E Davey"}],"keywords":[]},"article399":{"pmid":"32005134","title":"Dissecting the factors shaping fish skin microbiomes in a heterogeneous inland water system.","abs":"Fish skin microbiomes are rarely studied in inland water systems, in spite of their importance for fish health and ecology.

These interactions can give rise to novel community-intrinsic properties, through e.g. activation of so-called silent genetic pathways or synergistic interplay between microbial activities and functions. Here we studied the microbial community-based degradation of keratin, a recalcitrant biological material, by four soil isolates, which have previously been shown to display synergistic interactions during biofilm formation; Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Xanthomonas retroflexus, Microbacterium oxydans and Paenibacillus amylolyticus. We observed enhanced keratin weight loss in cultures with X. retroflexus, both in dual and four-species co-cultures, as compared to expected keratin degradation by X. retroflexus alone. Additional community intrinsic properties included accelerated keratin degradation rates and increased biofilm formation on keratin particles. Comparison of secretome profiles of X. retroflexus mono-cultures to co-cultures revealed that certain proteases (e.g. serine protease S08) were significantly more abundant in mono-cultures, whereas co-cultures had an increased abundance of proteins related to maintaining the redox environment, e.g. glutathione peroxidase. Hence, one of the mechanisms related to the community intrinsic properties, leading to enhanced degradation from co-cultures, might be related to a switch from sulfitolytic to proteolytic functions between mono- and co-cultures, respectively.","authors":[{"name":"Poonam Nasipuri"},{"name":"Jakob Herschend"},{"name":"Asker D Brejnrod"},{"name":"Jonas S Madsen"},{"name":"Roall Espersen"},{"name":"Birte Svensson"},{"name":"Mette Burmølle"},{"name":"Samuel Jacquiod"},{"name":"Søren J Sørensen"}],"keywords":[]},"article405":{"pmid":"32003349","title":"Determination of Biofilm-Forming Capacity of Otopathogens Isolated from Discharging Ears in Children with Chronic Otitis Media.","abs":"Chronic otitis media is a common disease of the developing world with persistent ear discharge, leading to major complications.

Biofilms can become thick enough to be even observed by the naked eye, and biofilm formation is a tightly regulated process. Paracoccus denitrificans is a non-motile, Gram-negative bacterium that forms a very thin, unique biofilm. A key factor in the biofilm formed by this bacterium is a large surface protein named biofilm-associated protein A (BapA), which was recently reported to be regulated by cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (cyclic-di-GMP or c-di-GMP). Cyclic-di-GMP is a major second messenger involved in biofilm formation in many bacteria. Though cyclic-di-GMP is generally reported as a positive regulatory factor in biofilm formation, it represses biofilm formation in P. denitrificans. Furthermore, quorum sensing (QS) represses biofilm formation in this bacterium, which is also reported as a positive regulator of biofilm formation in most bacteria. The QS signal used in P. denitrificans is hydrophobic and is delivered through membrane vesicles. Studies on QS show that P. denitrificans can potentially form a thick biofilm but maintains a thin biofilm under normal growth conditions. In this review, we discuss the peculiarities of biofilm formation by P. denitrificans with the aim of deepening the overall understanding of bacterial biofilm formation and functions.","authors":[{"name":"Kana Morinaga"},{"name":"Keitaro Yoshida"},{"name":"Kohei Takahashi"},{"name":"Nobuhiko Nomura"},{"name":"Masanori Toyofuku"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BapA"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cyclic-di GMP"},{"word":"Membrane vesicle"},{"word":"Paracoccus denitrificans"},{"word":"Quorum-sensing"}]},"article407":{"pmid":"32002130","title":"Inhibitory and preventive effects of Lactobacillus plantarum FB-T9 on dental caries in rats.","abs":"Streptococcus mutans is recognized as the main cause of dental caries, and the formation of a plaque biofilm is required for caries development.

Antimicrobials can be loaded into nanocarriers to protect them against de-activation, and to reduce their toxicity and potential, harmful side-effects. Moreover, antimicrobial nanocarriers such as micelles, can be equipped with stealth and pH-responsive features that allow self-targeting and accumulation in infectious-biofilms at high concentrations. Micellar and liposomal nanocarriers differ in hydrophilicity of their outer-surface and inner-core. Micelles are self-assembled, spherical core-shell structures composed of single layers of surfactants, with hydrophilic head-groups and hydrophobic tail-groups pointing to the micellar core. Liposomes are composed of lipids, self-assembled into bilayers. The hydrophilic head of the lipids determines the surface properties of liposomes, while the hydrophobic tail, internal to the bilayer, determines the fluidity of liposomal-membranes. Therefore, whereas micelles can only be loaded with hydrophobic antimicrobials, hydrophilic antimicrobials can be encapsulated in the hydrophilic, aqueous core of liposomes and hydrophobic or amphiphilic antimicrobials can be inserted in the phospholipid bilayer. Nanotechnology-derived liposomes can be prepared with diameters <100-200 nm, required to prevent reticulo-endothelial rejection and allow penetration into infectious-biofilms. However, surface-functionalization of liposomes is considerably more difficult than of micelles, which explains while self-targeting, pH-responsive liposomes that find their way through the blood circulation toward infectious-biofilms are still challenging to prepare. Equally, development of liposomes that penetrate over the entire thickness of biofilms to provide deep killing of biofilm inhabitants still provides a challenge. The liposomal phospholipid bilayer easily fuses with bacterial cell membranes to release high antimicrobial-doses directly inside bacteria. Arguably, protection against de-activation of antibiotics in liposomal nanocarriers and their fusogenicity constitute the biggest advantage of liposomal antimicrobial carriers over antimicrobials free in solution. Many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains, resistant to specific antibiotics, have been demonstrated to be susceptible to these antibiotics when encapsulated in liposomal nanocarriers. Recently, also progress has been made concerning large-scale production and long-term storage of liposomes. Therewith, the remaining challenges to develop self-targeting liposomes that penetrate, accumulate and kill deeply in infectious-biofilms remain worthwhile to pursue.","authors":[{"name":"Da-Yuan Wang"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Yijin Ren"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"},{"name":"Linqi Shi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"fusogenicity"},{"word":"hydrophobicity"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"lipids"},{"word":"liposomes"},{"word":"micelles"},{"word":"zeta potentials"}]},"article420":{"pmid":"31998665","title":"Comparative Analysis of the Host Response in a Rat Model of Deep-Partial and Full-Thickness Burn Wounds With Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection.","abs":"Burn wound injury affects soldiers and civilians alike, often resulting in a dynamic, but un-orchestrated, host response that can lead to infection, scarring, and potentially death. To mitigate these factors, it is important to have a clinically relevant model of burn wound infection that can be utilized for advancing burn wound treatments. Our previous reports have demonstrated the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to generate a biofilm infection within a modified Walker-Mason rat burn model of deep-partial (DPT) and full-thickness (FT) burn wounds (10% total body surface area) in male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-450 g). Here, we further define this model with respect to the host response when challenged with P. aeruginosa infection between the two burn types. Following burn injury and immediate surface exposure to P. aeruginosa, inflammation at the local and systemic levels were monitored for an 11 days period. Compared to burn-only groups, infection with P. aeruginosa further promoted local inflammation in both DPT and FT burn wounds, which was evident by enhanced cellular influx (including neutrophils and monocytes), increased levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, GRO/KC, andMIP-1α), and reduced IL-10. Systemically, only minor changes were seen in circulating white blood cells and cytokines; however, increases in high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) and hyaluronan, as well as decreases in fibronectin were noted particularly in FT burns. Compared to the burn-only group, P. aeruginosa infection resulted in sustained and/or higher levels of HMGB-1 and hyaluronan. Combined with our previous work that defined the burn depth and development of P. aeruginosa biofilms within the wound, this study further establishes this model by defining the host response to the burn and biofilm-infection. Furthermore, this characterization shows several similarities to what is clinically seen and establishes this model for future use in the development and testing of novel therapeutics for burn wound treatment at home and on the battlefield.","authors":[{"name":"Alan J Weaver"},{"name":"Kenneth S Brandenburg"},{"name":"Brian W Smith"},{"name":"Kai P Leung"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DAMPs"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"burn"},{"word":"cytokine"},{"word":"infection"}]},"article421":{"pmid":"31998658","title":"Corrigendum: Transcriptome, Phenotypic, and Virulence Analysis of Streptococcus sanguinis SK36 Wild Type and Its CcpA-Null Derivative (ΔCcpA).","abs":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2019.00411.].","authors":[{"name":"Yibo Bai"},{"name":"Mengmeng Shang"},{"name":"Mengya Xu"},{"name":"Anyi Wu"},{"name":"Luning Sun"},{"name":"Lanyan Zheng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CcpA"},{"word":"DEGs"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"RNA-seq"},{"word":"Streptococcus sanguinis"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article422":{"pmid":"31998561","title":"Organic acids and 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol: major compounds of Weissella confusa WM36 cell-free supernatant against growth, survival and virulence of Salmonella Typhi.","abs":"Salmonella Typhi (S.

To acclimate to new environments, the expression of genes in bacteria is controlled directly or indirectly by diverse transcriptional factors.

In a previous study, comparative proteomic analysis revealed that LysR type carbohydrate-related transcriptional regulator in Xag (LcrX) was more abundant in XVM2, which is a minimal medium, compared with a rich medium. However, the functions of LcrX in Xag have not been characterized. In this study, we generated an LcrX-overexpressing strain, Xag(LcrX), and the knockout mutant strain, XagΔlcrX(EV), to elucidate the functions of LcrX. Bacterial multiplication of Xag(LcrX) in soybean was significantly impaired, indicating that LcrX is related to virulence. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed that LcrX is mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism/transport and inorganic ion transport/metabolism. Based on the results of proteomics analysis, diverse phenotypic assays were carried out. A gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay demonstrated that LcrX specifically bound to the putative promoter regions of genes encoding putative fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and protease. Through a 96-well plate assay under various conditions, we confirmed that the growth of Xag(LcrX) was dramatically affected in the presence of various carbon sources, while the growth of XagΔlcrX(EV) was only slightly changed. Biofilm formation activity was reduced in Xag(LcrX) but enhanced in XagΔlcrX(EV). The production of siderophores was also decreased in Xag(LcrX) but not altered in XagΔlcrX(EV).

There was a strong source-dependence of biofilm development formed by the monocultures, that is, a higher biofilm formation potential for strains from attached aggregates than for those from sludge flocs at both substrate concentrations. Interestingly, the results showed that total biofilm reduction was dominant in the dual-species biofilm sourced from flocs in both LB broth (67.37%) and 0.1× LB broth (64.21%), indicating high interspecific competition in mobile aggregates and the independence of substrate concentrations. However, biofilm reduction was higher (33.68%) than induction (19.37%) for the biofilms formed by surface-attached aggregates in LB broth, while the opposite trend was apparent in 0.1× LB broth, suggesting the occurrence of indeterministic processes for biofilm formation and important roles of substrate concentrations. In addition, the more closely related phylogenetic relationships of cocultures from mobile aggregates were consistent with higher competition compared with those from surface-attached aggregates.
