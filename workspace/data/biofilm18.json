The selected amino acids were assessed for their ability to inhibit QS activity via such mechanisms as exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, biofilm formation, pigment production in Chromobacterium violaceum and swarming motility. At 0.684 mM concentration, lysine inhibited the biofilm formation by 16% at 24 h, chitinolytic activity by 88.3% at 24 h and EPS production by 12.5% at 24 h. It also exhibited inhibition of swarming motility in C. violaceum. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a decrease in the average thickness of the biofilms when treated with lysine. Modulation in the expression of cvi I and cvi A was observed when treated with all the amino acids, with the greatest reduction observed with lysine. Our results conclude that the amino acid lysine showed anti-QS and significant anti-biofilm activities; it could be further exploited as a main constituent in the synthesis of peptide/protein, and testing the same for treatment of bacterial infections, eventually reducing the utilization of conventional antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Leena Champalal"},{"name":"Udhaya Santhosh Kumar"},{"name":"Nagasathiya Krishnan"},{"name":"Baskaralingam Vaseeharan"},{"name":"Vairamani Mariappanadar"},{"name":"Pachaiappan Raman"}],"keywords":[]},"article2":{"pmid":"30304271","title":"Distribution of clinical isolates of Candida spp. and antifungal susceptibility of high biofilm-forming Candida isolates.","abs":"The increase in the incidence of fungal infections, especially those caused by Candida albicans and other Candida species, necessitates the understanding and treatment of Candida-associated infections.

Desulfovibrio vulgaris is the representative sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) which causes metal corrosion in oil wells and drilling equipment, and the corrosion is related to its biofilm formation. Biofilms are extremely difficult to remove since the cells are cemented in a polymer matrix. In an effort to eliminate SRB biofilms, we examined the ability of supernatants from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 to disperse SRB biofilms. We found that the P. aeruginosa supernatants dispersed more than 98% of the biofilm. To determine the biochemical basis of this SRB biofilm dispersal, we examined a series of P. aeruginosa mutants and found that mutants rhlA, rhlB, rhlI, and rhlR, defective in rhamnolipids production, had significantly reduced levels of SRB biofilm dispersal. Corroborating these results, purified rhamnolipids dispersed SRB biofilms, and rhamnolipids were detected in the P. aeruginosa supernatants. Hence, P. aeruginosa supernatants disperse SRB biofilms via rhamnolipids. To determine the genetic basis of how the P. aeruginosa supernatants disperse SRB biofilms, a whole transcriptomic analysis was conducted (RNA-seq); based on this analysis, we identified four proteins (DVUA0018, DVUA0034, DVUA0066, and DVUA0084) of the D. vulgaris megaplasmid that influence biofilm formation, with production of DVUA0066 (a putative phospholipase) reducing biofilm formation 5.6-fold. In addition, the supernatants of P. aeruginosa dispersed the SRB biofilms more readily than protease in M9 glucose minimum medium and were also effective against biofilms of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.","authors":[{"name":"Thammajun L Wood"},{"name":"Ting Gong"},{"name":"Lei Zhu"},{"name":"James Miller"},{"name":"Daniel S Miller"},{"name":"Bei Yin"},{"name":"Thomas K Wood"}],"keywords":[]},"article11":{"pmid":"30302161","title":"Morphology of Helicobacter pylori as a result of peptidoglycan and cytoskeleton rearrangements.","abs":"Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium colonising the gastric mucosa.

In an era of antibiotic stewardship, with a widespread prevalence of bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotic agents, there has emerged an interest in using intra-operative antiseptic irrigation to reduce microbial contamination in the surgical site before closure and possibly reduce the need for antibiotic agents. This approach has gained added appeal in an era of biomedical device implantation, especially with the recognition that most, if not all, device-related infections are associated with biofilm formation.

Indeed, the deletion of hnoX resulted in early biofilm formation in vitro, an effect that was dependent on HahK and its putative phosphotransfer residues. An allele of hnoX that encodes a protein with increased activity severely delayed wrinkled colony formation. Control occurred at the level of transcription of the syp genes, which produce the polysaccharide matrix component. The addition of NO abrogated biofilm formation and diminished syp transcription, effects that required HnoX. Finally, an hnoX mutant formed larger symbiotic biofilms.

The integration of health-promoting probiotics into naturally fermented milk products could make a profound impact on human health. Here, we characterize the bacterial community composition of a naturally fermented milk product (lait caillé) from northern Senegal, prepared in wooden bowls (lahals) with a bacterial biofilm to steer the fermentation process. We incorporated a probiotic starter culture containing the most documented probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (generic strain name yoba 2012) into the local fermentation process. Bar-coded 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of lait caillé samples indicated that the bacterial community of lait caillé has high species richness with over 100 bacterial genera; however, few have high abundance. In contrast to the diverse bacterial compositions of other characterized naturally fermented milk products, the composition of lait caillé predominantly consists of the lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus and Lactobacillus, resembling the bacterial composition in regular yogurt. The bacterial community composition of lait caillé varies geographically based on the presence of some genera, including Lactoccoccus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacillus, but this trend is not consistent within production communities. The diversity of bacterial communities is much higher in the lahal biofilm than in the naturally fermented milk products, which is in turn greater than in commercial yogurts. Addition of a starter culture with L. rhamnosus yoba 2012 to milk in lahals led to substantial growth of this probiotic bacterium during the fermentation process. Two independent quantitative PCR-analyses specific for L. rhamnosus yoba 2012 indicated a 20- to 60-fold increase in the total number of probiotic bacteria in the first batch after inoculation. A similar increase of the probiotic was observed in a variation of lait caillé prepared with carbohydrate-rich millet granules (thiakry) added prior to fermentation.

Here, we track the evolution of pellicle biofilms formed through genetic division of labour and ask whether partially deficient partners can evolve autonomy. Pellicles of Bacillus subtilis rely on an extracellular matrix composed of exopolysaccharide (EPS) and the fibre protein TasA. In monocultures, ∆eps and ∆tasA mutants fail to form pellicles, but, facilitated by cooperation, they succeed in co-culture. Interestingly, cooperation collapses on an evolutionary timescale and ∆tasA gradually outcompetes its partner ∆eps. Pellicle formation can evolve independently from division of labour in ∆eps and ∆tasA monocultures, by selection acting on the residual matrix component, TasA or EPS, respectively. Using a set of interdisciplinary tools, we unravel that the TasA producer (∆eps) evolves via an unconventional but reproducible substitution in TasA that modulates the biochemical properties of the protein. Conversely, the EPS producer (ΔtasA) undergoes genetically variable adaptations, all leading to enhanced EPS secretion and biofilms with different biomechanical properties. Finally, we revisit the collapse of division of labour between Δeps and ΔtasA in light of a strong frequency versus exploitability trade-off that manifested in the solitarily evolving partners. We propose that such trade-off differences may represent an additional barrier to evolution of division of labour between genetically distinct microorganisms.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Dragoš"},{"name":"Marivic Martin"},{"name":"Carolina Falcón García"},{"name":"Lara Kricks"},{"name":"Patrick Pausch"},{"name":"Thomas Heimerl"},{"name":"Balázs Bálint"},{"name":"Gergely Maróti"},{"name":"Gert Bange"},{"name":"Daniel López"},{"name":"Oliver Lieleg"},{"name":"Ákos T Kovács"}],"keywords":[]},"article33":{"pmid":"30297525","title":"A Nonfimbrial Adhesin of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Mediates Biofilm Biogenesis.","abs":"Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by polymicrobial biofilms.

Fimbriae participate in biofilm biogenesis and the EmaA adhesins mediate collagen binding. However, in the absence of fimbriae, A. actinomycetemcomitans still retains the potential to form robust biofilms, suggesting that other surface macromolecules participate in biofilm development. Here, isogenic mutant strains lacking EmaA structures, but still expressing fimbriae, were observed to have reduced biofilm potential. In strains lacking both EmaA and fimbriae, biofilm mass was reduced by 80%. EmaA enhanced biofilm formation in different strains, independent of the fimbriation state or serotype. Confocal microscopy revealed differences in cell density within microcolonies between the EmaA positive and mutant strains. EmaA-mediated biofilm formation was found to be independent of the glycosylation state and the precise three-dimensional conformation of the protein, and thus this function is uncorrelated with collagen binding activity.

In the present study, we applied automated confocal microscopy on Pseudomonas aeruginosa to monitor dynamic killing of biofilm-grown bacteria by tobramycin and colistin in real time. We revealed that the time required for surviving bacteria to repopulate the biofilm could be taken as a measure for effectiveness of the antimicrobial treatment. It depends on the (i) nature and concentration of the antibiotic, (ii) duration of antibiotic treatment, (iii) application as monotherapy or combination therapy, and (iv) interval of drug administration. The vicious cycle of killing and repopulation of biofilm bacteria could also be broken in an in vivo model system by applying successive antibiotic dosages at intervals that do not allow full reconstitution of the biofilm communities.

Here, we have investigated the production and functional activities of EVs in a surface-associated microbial community or biofilm of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Crowded communities like biofilms are a context in which EVs are likely to function. Biofilms are noteworthy because they are encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix and because biofilm cells exhibit extreme tolerance to antimicrobial compounds. We found that biofilm EVs are distinct from those produced by free-living planktonic cells and display strong parallels in composition to biofilm matrix material. The functions of biofilm EVs were delineated with a panel of mutants defective in orthologs of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) subunits, which are required for normal EV production in diverse eukaryotes. Most ESCRT-defective mutations caused reduced biofilm EV production, reduced matrix polysaccharide levels, and greatly increased sensitivity to the antifungal drug fluconazole. Matrix accumulation and drug hypersensitivity of ESCRT mutants were reversed by addition of wild-type (WT) biofilm EVs. Vesicle complementation showed that biofilm EV function derives from specific cargo proteins. Our studies indicate that C. albicans biofilm EVs have a pivotal role in matrix production and biofilm drug resistance. Biofilm matrix synthesis is a community enterprise; prior studies of mixed cell biofilms have demonstrated extracellular complementation.

This bacterial genus has not been extensively studied, although its cosmopolitan location indicates that it has high levels of plasticity and adaptive capacity.

SH31 strain and describe its phenotypical and genotypical response to osmotic stress. In this context, as a first step to characterize the response to the SH31 strain to salinity and to establish the bases for a molecular study, we proposed to compare its response under three salt conditions (0, 25, and 50 g/l NaCl). Using different physiology, genomic, and transcriptomic approaches, we determined that the bacterium is able to grow properly in a NaCl concentration of up to 50 g/l; however, the best growth rate was observed at 25 g/l. Although the presence of flagella is not affected by salinity, motility was diminished at 25 g/l NaCl and abolished at 50 g/l. Biofilm formation was induced proportionally with increases in salinity, which was expected.

Distinct microbial assemblages between microplastics and surrounding waters have been well documented; however, there is insufficient knowledge regarding biofilm colonization of plastic and non-plastic substrates, despite the fact that microbial communities generally aggregate on natural solid surfaces. In this study, the effects of substrate type on microbial communities were evaluated by incubation of biofilms on microplastic substrates (polyethylene and polypropylene) and natural substrates (cobblestone and wood) for 21 days under controlled conditions. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that the alpha diversity (richness, evenness, and diversity) was lower in the microplastic-associated communities than in those on the natural substrates, indicating substrate-type-coupled species sorting. Distinct community structure and biofilm composition were observed between these two substrate types. Significantly higher abundances of Pirellulaceae, Phycisphaerales, Cyclobacteriaceae, and Roseococcus were observed on the microplastic substrates compared with the natural substrates. Simultaneously, the functional profiles (KEGG) predicted by Tax4Fun showed that the pathways of amino acid metabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were increased in biofilms on the microplastic substrates. The findings illustrate that microplastic acts as a distinct microbial habitat (compared with natural substrates) that could not only change the community structure but also affect microbial functions, potentially impacting the ecological functions of microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Lingzhan Miao"},{"name":"Peifang Wang"},{"name":"Jun Hou"},{"name":"Yu Yao"},{"name":"Zhilin Liu"},{"name":"Songqi Liu"},{"name":"Tengfei Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Metabolic pathways"},{"word":"Microplastic"},{"word":"Species sorting"},{"word":"Substrate type"}]},"article50":{"pmid":"30292933","title":"Towards biomimics of cell membranes: Structural effect of phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP","abs":"Phosphoinositide (PIP) lipids are anionic phospholipids playing a fundamental role for the activity of several transmembrane and soluble proteins.

Moreover, biofilms represent a medical challenge since the inherent antibiotic resistance of their producers demands the use of high doses of antibiotics over prolonged periods. Frequently, these therapeutic measures fail, contributing to bacterial persistence, therefore demanding the development of novel antimicrobials. Esters of bicyclic amines (EBAs), which are strong inhibitors of Streptococcus pneumoniae growth, were initially designed as inhibitors of pneumococcal choline-binding proteins on the basis of their structural analogy to the choline residues in the cell wall. However, instead of mimicking the characteristic cell chaining phenotype caused by exogenously added choline on planktonic cultures of pneumococcal cells, EBAs showed an unexpected lytic activity. In this work we demonstrate that EBAs display a second, and even more important, function as cell membrane destabilizers. We then assayed the inhibitory and disintegrating activity of these molecules on pneumococcal biofilms. The selected compound (EBA 31) produced the highest effect on S. pneumoniae (encapsulated and non-encapsulated) biofilms at very low concentrations. EBA 31 was also effective on mixed biofilms of non-encapsulated S. pneumoniae plus non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, two pathogens frequently forming a self-produced biofilm in the human nasopharynx.

This suggests that a relatively small fraction of c-Cyt residing closest to the biofilm/electrode interface is involved in EET while the majority store electrons.

Our data show that mucus activates in vitro biofilm formation. The analysis of F. columnare transcriptomes after the addition of mucus revealed significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the planktonic and biofilm states. DEGs common among all biofilms were enriched for gene ontology groups including signal transduction, ligand binding and cellular homeostasis and are likely necessary for biofilm formation. Iron acquisition systems included TonB-dependent receptor and ferroxidase genes were expressed among all biofilms, while siderophore synthesis genes were only expressed in mucus-stimulated biofilms. The current analysis of F. columnare transcriptomes adds valuable information about the basic biological processes that occur during the planktonic and biofilm states.

We addressed this question in experimentally evolved populations founded from a clone of the bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia. These populations evolved for 90 days (approximately 600 generations) under all combinations of high or low carbon availability and selection for either planktonic or biofilm modes of growth. Populations that evolved in environments with shared selection pressures (either level of carbon availability or mode of growth) were more genetically similar to each other than populations from environments that shared neither characteristic. However, not all shared selection pressures led to parallel evolution. Genetic parallelism between low-carbon biofilm and low-carbon planktonic populations was very low despite shared selection for growth under low-carbon conditions, suggesting that evolution in low-carbon environments may generate stronger trade-offs between biofilm and planktonic modes of growth. For all environments, a population's fitness in a particular environment was positively correlated with the genetic similarity between that population and the populations that evolved in that particular environment. Although genetic similarity was low between low-carbon environments, overall, evolution in similar environments led to higher levels of genetic parallelism and that genetic parallelism, in turn, was correlated with fitness in a particular environment.","authors":[{"name":"Caroline B Turner"},{"name":"Christopher W Marshall"},{"name":"Vaughn S Cooper"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Burkholderia"},{"word":"experimental evolution"},{"word":"nutrient limitation"},{"word":"parallel evolution"},{"word":"whole‐population sequencing"}]},"article78":{"pmid":"30283433","title":"Bicarbonate Inhibits Bacterial Growth and Biofilm Formation of Prevalent Cystic Fibrosis Pathogens.","abs":"We investigated the effects of bicarbonate on the growth of several different bacteria as well as its effects on biofilm formation and intracellular cAMP concentration in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Yet, the disinfection step using antibiotic-based pastes leads to cytotoxic, warranting a biocompatible strategy to promote root canal disinfection with no or minimal side-effects to maximize the regenerative outcomes. The purpose of this investigation was to develop a tubular three-dimensional (3D) triple antibiotic-eluting construct for intracanal drug delivery. Morphological (scanning electron microscopy), chemical (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), and mechanical (tensile testing) characteristics of the polydioxanone-based triple antibiotic-eluting fibers were assessed. The antimicrobial properties of the tubular 3D constructs were determined in vitro and in vivo using an infected (Actinomyces naeslundii) dentin tooth slice model and a canine method of periapical disease, respectively. The in vitro data indicated significant antimicrobial activity and the ability to eliminate bacterial biofilm inside dentinal tubules. In vivo histological findings demonstrated that, using the EB procedure, the tubular 3D triple antibiotic-eluting construct allowed the formation of an appropriate environment that led to apex closure and the ingrowth of a thin layer of osteodentin-like tissue into the root canal.

Bacterial resistance to phage infection, however, limits the usefulness of phage therapies and could destabilise community structures, especially if individual resistance mutations provide cross-resistance against multiple phages. We currently understand very little about the evolution of cross-resistance in bacteria-phage interactions. Here we show that the network structure of cross-resistance among spontaneous resistance mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa evolved against each of 27 phages is highly modular. The cross-resistance network contained both symmetric (reciprocal) and asymmetric (nonreciprocal) cross-resistance, forming two cross-resistance modules defined by high within- but low between-module cross-resistance. Mutations conferring cross-resistance within modules targeted either lipopolysaccharide or type IV pilus biosynthesis, suggesting that the modularity of cross-resistance was structured by distinct phage receptors. In contrast, between-module cross-resistance was provided by mutations affecting the alternative sigma factor, RpoN, which controls many lifestyle-associated functions, including motility, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing. Broader cross-resistance range was not associated with higher fitness costs or weaker resistance against the focal phage used to select resistance. However, mutations in rpoN, providing between-module cross-resistance, were associated with higher fitness costs than mutations associated with within-module cross-resistance, i.e., in genes encoding either lipopolysaccharide or type IV pilus biosynthesis. The observed structure of cross-resistance predicted both the frequency of resistance mutations and the ability of phage combinations to suppress bacterial growth. These findings suggest that the evolution of cross-resistance is common, is likely to play an important role in the dynamic structure of bacteria-phage communities, and could inform the design principles for phage therapy treatments.","authors":[{"name":"Rosanna C T Wright"},{"name":"Ville-Petri Friman"},{"name":"Margaret C M Smith"},{"name":"Michael A Brockhurst"}],"keywords":[]},"article88":{"pmid":"30281429","title":"Flexible Platform for In Situ Impedimetric Detection and Bioelectric Effect Treatment of Escherichia Coli Biofilms.","abs":"This paper reports a platform for real-time monitoring and treatment of biofilm formation on three-dimensional biomedical device surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Ryan C Huiszoon"},{"name":"Sowmya Subramanian"},{"name":"Pradeep Ramiah Rajasekaran"},{"name":"Luke A Beardslee"},{"name":"William E Bentley"},{"name":"Reza Ghodssi"}],"keywords":[]},"article89":{"pmid":"30281074","title":"Locking Hemodialysis Catheters With Trimethoprim-Ethanol-Ca-EDTA to Prevent Bloodstream Infections: A Randomized, Evaluator-blinded Clinical Trial.","abs":"Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) often result from intraluminal microbial colonization and are associated with morbidity, mortality, and substantial costs.

Mycobacterial species possess a unique cell-wall structure; however, the underlying regulation mechanism for their biofilm formation remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized a hypothetical mannitol metabolism and transportation gene cluster (Ms5571-Ms5576), designated as mmt operon, whose expression significantly contributes to the biofilm formation in Mycobacterium smegmatis. We showed that in the operon the Ms5575 gene encodes a GntR-like transcriptional repressor and the Ms5576 gene encodes a mannitol 2-dehydrogenase which can produce D-mannitol from D-mannose. Strikingly, the D-mannitol molecule can derepress the negative regulation of Ms5575 on the mmt operon to stimulate the operon's expression. Consistently, addition of D-mannitol into the medium can obviously induce mycobacterial biofilm formation. Furthermore, we found that Ms0179 positively regulates the mmt operon through its downstream regulator Ms0180. Ms0180 directly binds the mmt operon to positively regulate its expression. Both Ms0179 and Ms0180 significantly affect the mycobacterial biofilm formation.

A promising strategy to reduce E. coli O157 is using antimicrobials to reduce the pathogen levels and/or virulence within the animal gastrointestinal tract and thus foodborne disease. The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of a commercial mixture of natural antimicrobials against E. coli O157. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of the antimicrobial were quantitatively determined and found to be 0.5% and 0.75% (v/v) of the natural antimicrobial, respectively. Microbial growth kinetics was also used to determine the effect of the antimicrobial on the pathogen. The natural antimicrobial affected the cell membrane of E. coli O157, as demonstrated by the increase in relative electric conductivity and increase in protein and nucleic acid release. The antimicrobial was also able to significantly reduce the concentration on E. coli O157 in a model rumen system.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a mucolytic agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may exhibit antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against these pathogens. The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of high NAC concentrations, potentially achievable by topical administration, was tested against a collection of S. maltophilia (n = 19) and Bcc (n = 19) strains, including strains from CF patients with acquired resistance traits. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBCs) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/ml and from 32 to >32 mg/ml, respectively. Sub-MIC concentrations (i.e., 0.25 × MIC) slowed down the growth kinetics of most strains. In time-kill assays, 2-day-old biofilms were more affected than planktonic cultures, suggesting a specific antibiofilm activity of NAC against these pathogens. Indeed, a dose- and time-dependent antibiofilm activity of NAC against most of the S. maltophilia and Bcc strains tested was observed, with a sizable antibiofilm activity observed also at 0.5 and 1 × MIC NAC concentrations.

The analysis of A. baumanni clinical isolates revealed a strain-specific AHL profile that was also affected by nutrient availability. The concentration of OHC12-HSL, the major AHL found in A. baumannii ATCC17978, peaked upon stationary-phase establishment and decreases steeply afterwards. Quorum quenching (QQ) activity was found in the cell extracts of A. baumannii ATCC17978, correlating with the disappearance of the AHLs from the culture media, indicating that AHL concentration may be self-regulated in this pathogen.

In this study, a spontaneously healing defect model in a rat was used to investigate the impact rifampin powder has on endogenous bone healing in both a sterile and contaminated wound. No significant differences were identified in bone volume fraction via microcomputed tomography, radiological scoring, or histology between an empty defect and animals that received vancomycin or rifampin powder in a sterile wound. When applied to a contaminated musculoskeletal wound, the rifampin powder had significantly greater bone formation compared to the control, as measured by microcomputed tomography, plain radiology, and histology. In addition, the animals treated with rifampin powder had reduced bacteria, reduced white blood cell count and reduced number of clinical indications of infection. Interestingly, while the vancomycin group still displayed signs of infection via quantitative microbiology, plain radiology, and histology, there was significant bone formation within the defect and reduction of systemic signs of infection.

This study further found that A. baumannii also has IAA productive capability, primarily involving the ipdC gene, and transcriptome and spent media analysis of wild-type and mutant cultures grown in minimal media revealed that A. baumannii likely produces IAA through the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway. Exogenously applied IAA improved tolerance against oxidative stress in wild-type A. baumannii and iacA mutants unable to degrade IAA, but not in ipdC mutants incapable of producing IAA, suggesting that endogenous IAA is important for stress tolerance.

Objective of present work was to study subclinical mastitis in sheep, caused specifically by slime-producing staphylococci: to investigate its frequency and to identify potential factors playing a role therein. Slime production was evaluated in 708 staphylococcal isolates recovered from cases of subclinical mastitis in a field study in 2198 ewes performed in an extensive countrywide field investigation across Greece. Isolates were studied by means of microbiological and molecular methods. Of these strains, 262 were characterised as slime-producing, 227 as weak slime-producing and 219 as non slime-producing. Most frequently detected genes were eno and icaB; Staphylococcus aureus possessed more genes than coagulase-negative strains; greater number of genes was detected in slime-producing than in weak slime-producing or non-slime-producing strains. Subclinical mastitis caused specifically by slime-producing staphylococci was detected in 337 ewes: prevalence in population sampled was 0.153. A multivariable mixed-effects model revealed that milking mode (highest prevalence in hand-milked flocks) and flock management system (highest prevalence in semi-intensive flocks) were the two factors associated with increased prevalence of mastitis in flocks. The results confirmed the significance of slime producing staphylococcal strains of importance in the aetiology of subclinical mastitis of sheep.

However, the detailed biogenesis and function of Tfp in A. pleuropneumoniae remained unclear.

Sequencing analysis revealed that the apf and pil operons are highly conserved among different serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae. Our data demonstrate that the transcription of the pil operon was greatly upregulated upon bacterial contact with host cells. Mutants with single deletions of each gene in the pil and apf operons had defective adherence when they were in contact with host cells and, additionally, these mutants were also deficient in biofilm formation in vitro.

Moreover, C. acnes, in addition to other skin-colonizing bacteria such as S. epidermidis and S. aureus, is an emerging pathogen of implant-associated infections. Notably, C. acnes isolates exhibit marked heterogeneity and can be divided into at least 6 phylotypes by multilocus sequence typing. It is becoming increasingly evident that biofilm formation is a relevant factor for C. acnes virulence, but information on biofilm formation by diverse C. acnes isolates is limited. In this study we performed a first comparative analysis of 58 diverse skin- or implant-isolates covering all six C. acnes phylotypes to investigate biofilm formation dynamics, biofilm morphology and attachment properties to abiotic surfaces. The results presented herein suggest that biofilm formation correlates with the phylotype, rather than the anatomical isolation site. IA1 isolates, particularly SLST sub-types A1 and A2, showed highest biofilm amounts in the microtiter plate assays, followed by isolates of the IC, IA2 and II phylotypes. Microscopic evaluation revealed well-structured three-dimensional biofilms and relatively high adhesive properties to abiotic surfaces for phylotypes IA1, IA2 and IC. Representatives of phylotype III formed biofilms with comparable biomass, but with less defined structures, whereas IB as well as II isolates showed the least complex three-dimensional morphology. Proteinase K- and DNase I-treatment reduced attachment rates of all phylotypes, therefore, indicating that extracellular DNA and proteins are critical for adhesion to abiotic surfaces.

Eradicating mature biofilms is especially challenging because of the protection of the extracellular matrix and slow growth of biofilm cells. Recently, we reported that established biofilms can be effectively removed (e.g. 99.9% dispersion of 48 h Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms) by shape memory polymer-based dynamic changes in surface topography. Here, we demonstrate that such biofilm dispersion also sensitizes biofilm cells to conventional antibiotics. For example, shape recovery in the presence of 50 µg/mL tobramycin reduced biofilm cell counts by more than 3 logs (2,479-fold) compared to the static flat control. The observed effects were attributed to the disruption of biofilm structure and increase in cellular activities as evidenced by an 11.8-fold increase in intracellular level of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and 4.1-fold increase in expression of the rrnB gene in detached cells. These results can help guide the design of new control methods to better combat biofilm associated antibiotic-resistant infections. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Microbial infections are challenging due to high-level antibiotic resistance of biofilm cells. The protection of an extracellular matrix and slow growth of biofilm cells render conventional antibiotics ineffective. Thus, it is important to develop new technologies that can remove mature biofilms and sensitize biofilm cells to antibiotics. Recently, we demonstrated that dynamic change in surface topography can remove 48 h Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms by 99.9%. In this study, we investigated how shape recovery triggered dispersion affect the physiology of biofilm cells and associated antibiotic susceptibility.

A number of genome-wide characterizations of lysine-acetylated proteins, or acetylomes, in bacteria have demonstrated that lysine acetylation occurs on proteins with a wide diversity of functions, including central metabolism, transcription, chemotaxis, and cell size regulation. Bacillus subtilis is a model organism for studies of sporulation, motility, cell signaling, and multicellular development (or biofilm formation). In this work, we investigated the role of global protein lysine acetylation in multicellular development in B. subtilis. We analyzed the B. subtilis acetylome under biofilm-inducing conditions and identified acetylated proteins involved in multicellularity, specifically, swarming and biofilm formation. We constructed various single and double mutants of genes known to encode enzymes involved in global protein lysine acetylation in B. subtilis. Some of those mutants showed a defect in swarming motility while others demonstrated altered biofilm phenotypes. Lastly, we picked two acetylated proteins known to be important for biofilm formation, YmcA (also known as RicA), a regulatory protein critical for biofilm induction, and GtaB, an UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase that synthesizes a nucleotide sugar precursor for biosynthesis of exopolysaccharide, a key biofilm matrix component. We performed site-directed mutagenesis on the acetylated lysine codons in ymcA and gtaB, respectively, and assayed cells bearing those point mutants for biofilm formation. The mutant alleles of ymcA(K64R), gtaB(K89R), and gtaB(K191R) all demonstrated a severe biofilm defect. These results indicate the importance of acetylated lysine residues in both YmcA and GtaB. In summary, we propose that protein lysine acetylation plays a global regulatory role in B. subtilis multicellularity.","authors":[{"name":"Alicyn Reverdy"},{"name":"Yun Chen"},{"name":"Evan Hunter"},{"name":"Kevin Gozzi"},{"name":"Yunrong Chai"}],"keywords":[]},"article168":{"pmid":"30265315","title":"Impact of hydrologic boundaries on microbial planktonic and biofilm communities in shallow terrestrial subsurface environments.","abs":"Subsurface environments contain a large proportion of planetary microbial biomass and harbor diverse communities responsible for mediating biogeochemical cycles important to groundwater used by human society for consumption, irrigation, agriculture and industry. Within the saturated zone, capillary fringe and vadose zones, microorganisms can reside in two distinct phases (planktonic or biofilm), and significant differences in community composition, structure and activity between free-living and attached communities are commonly accepted. However, largely due to sampling constraints and the challenges of working with solid substrata, the contribution of each phase to subsurface processes is largely unresolved. Here, we synthesize current information on the diversity and activity of shallow freshwater subsurface habitats, discuss the challenges associated with sampling planktonic and biofilm communities across spatial, temporal and geological gradients, and discuss how biofilms may be constrained within shallow terrestrial subsurface aquifers. We suggest that merging traditional activity measurements and sequencing/-omics technologies with hydrological parameters important to sediment biofilm assembly and stability will help delineate key system parameters. Ultimately, integration will enhance our understanding of shallow subsurface ecophysiology in terms of bulk-flow through porous media and distinguish the respective activities of sessile microbial communities from more transient planktonic communities to ecosystem service and maintenance.","authors":[{"name":"H J Smith"},{"name":"A J Zelaya"},{"name":"K B De León"},{"name":"R Chakraborty"},{"name":"D A Elias"},{"name":"T C Hazen"},{"name":"A P Arkin"},{"name":"A B Cunningham"},{"name":"M W Fields"}],"keywords":[]},"article169":{"pmid":"30265307","title":"Hyperencapsulated mucoid pneumococcal isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis have increased biofilm density and persistence in vivo.","abs":"Mucoid bacteria, predominately Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are commonly associated with decline in pulmonary function in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), and are thought to persist at least in part due to a greater propensity toward forming biofilms.

We compared biofilm formation and maturation by mucoid and non-mucoid isolates of Sp collected from children with and without CF. Non-mucoid Sp serotype 19A and 19F isolates had significantly higher levels of biofilm initiation and adherence to CF epithelial cells than did serotype 3 isolates. However, strains expressing high levels of capsule had significantly greater biofilm maturation, as evidenced by increased density and thickness in static and continuous flow assays via confocal microscopy. Finally, using a serotype 3 Sp strain, we showed that highly encapsulated mucoid phase variants predominate during late adherence and better colonize CFTR-/- as compared to wild-type mice in respiratory infection studies. These findings indicate that overexpression of capsule can enhance the development of mature pneumococcal biofilms in vitro, and may contribute to pneumococcal colonization in CF lung disease.","authors":[{"name":"Evida A Dennis"},{"name":"Mamie T Coats"},{"name":"Sarah Griffin"},{"name":"Bing Pang"},{"name":"David E Briles"},{"name":"Marilyn J Crain"},{"name":"W Edward Swords"}],"keywords":[]},"article170":{"pmid":"30265121","title":"Molecular Motors Govern Liquidlike Ordering and Fusion Dynamics of Bacterial Colonies.","abs":"Bacteria can adjust the structure of colonies and biofilms to enhance their survival rate under external stress.

Consequently, these communities are excellent model systems for studying the metabolic activity of individual populations and key microbial interactions. The primary goals of the current study were to integrate data collected in situ with in silico calculations across process-scales encompassing enzymatic activity, cellular metabolism, community interactions, and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as well as to predict and quantify the functional limits of autotroph-heterotroph interactions. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data were used to reconstruct carbon and energy metabolisms of an important autotroph (Metallosphaera yellowstonensis) and heterotroph (Geoarchaeum sp.

Standard and hybrid elementary flux mode and flux balance analyses of metabolic models predicted cellular- and community-level metabolic acclimations to simulated environmental stresses, respectively. In situ geochemical analyses, including oxygen depth-profiles, Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates, stable carbon isotopes and mat biomass concentrations, were combined with cellular models to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions important to community structure-function. Integration of metabolic modeling with in situ measurements, including the relative population abundance of autotrophs to heterotrophs, demonstrated that Fe(III)-oxide mat communities operate at their maximum total community growth rate (i.e. sum of autotroph and heterotroph growth rates), as opposed to net community growth rate (i.e. total community growth rate subtracting autotroph consumed by heterotroph), as predicted from the maximum power principle.

However, greater stomatal closure was seen during NHR than during HDR, together with different patterns of accumulation of reactive oxygen species and phenolic compounds and the expression of secondary metabolites. Overall, these differences, independent of Xcc type III effector proteins, could contribute to the higher protection elicited against canker development.

In environmental and clinical settings, most bacteria form biofilms as a way to protect themselves against extracellular stress. However, much remains to be known about ICE transfer in biofilms. Using ICEBs1 from Bacillus subtilis, we show that the natural conjugation efficiency of this ICE is greatly affected by the ability of the donor and recipient to form a biofilm. ICEBs1 transfer considerably increases in biofilm, even at low donor/recipient ratios. Also, while there is a clear temporal correlation between biofilm formation and ICEBs1 transfer, biofilms do not alter the level of ICEBs1 excision in donor cells. Conjugative transfer appears to be favored by the biophysical context of biofilms. Indeed, extracellular matrix production, particularly from the recipient cells, is essential for biofilms to promote ICEBs1 transfer. Our study provides basic new knowledge on the high rate of conjugative transfer of ICEs in biofilms, a widely preponderant bacterial lifestyle in the environment, which could have a major impact on our understanding of horizontal gene transfer in natural and clinical environments.","authors":[{"name":"Frédéric Lécuyer"},{"name":"Jean-Sébastien Bourassa"},{"name":"Martin Gélinas"},{"name":"Vincent Charron-Lamoureux"},{"name":"Vincent Burrus"},{"name":"Pascale B Beauregard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"ICEBs1"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"horizontal gene transfer"}]},"article195":{"pmid":"30257807","title":"Essential role of the ESX-3 associated eccD3 locus in maintaining the cell wall integrity of Mycobacterium smegmatis.","abs":"Mycobacterial pathogens have evolved a unique secretory apparatus called the Type VII secretion system (T7SS) which comprises of five gene clusters designated as ESX1, ESX2, ESX3, ESX4, and ESX5.

Here, we demonstrate the antibacterial activity of chlorate against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a representative pathogen that can inhabit hypoxic or anoxic host microenvironments during infection. Aerobically grown P. aeruginosa cells are tobramycin sensitive but chlorate tolerant. In the absence of oxygen or an alternative electron acceptor, cells are tobramycin tolerant but chlorate sensitive via Nar-dependent reduction. The fact that chlorite, the product of chlorate reduction, is not detected in culture supernatants suggests that it may react rapidly and be retained intracellularly. Tobramycin and chlorate target distinct populations within metabolically stratified aggregate biofilms; tobramycin kills cells on the oxic periphery, whereas chlorate kills hypoxic and anoxic cells in the interior. In a matrix populated by multiple aggregates, tobramycin-mediated death of surface aggregates enables deeper oxygen penetration into the matrix, benefiting select aggregate populations by increasing survival and removing chlorate sensitivity. Finally, lasR mutants, which commonly arise in P. aeruginosa infections and are known to withstand conventional antibiotic treatment, are hypersensitive to chlorate. A lasR mutant shows a propensity to respire nitrate and reduce chlorate more rapidly than the wild type does, consistent with its heightened chlorate sensitivity. These findings illustrate chlorate's potential to selectively target oxidant-starved pathogens, including physiological states and genotypes of P. aeruginosa that represent antibiotic-tolerant populations during infections.","authors":[{"name":"Melanie A Spero"},{"name":"Dianne K Newman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Nar"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chlorate"},{"word":"nitrate reduction"},{"word":"prodrug"}]},"article207":{"pmid":"30254118","title":"CdrA Interactions within the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Matrix Safeguard It from Proteolysis and Promote Cellular Packing.","abs":"Biofilms are robust multicellular aggregates of bacteria that are encased in an extracellular matrix.

This represents a novel function for CdrA. Similar observations have been made for other species such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, which can utilize protein-dominant biofilm matrices.

We previously reported that CdrA directly binds the biofilm matrix exopolysaccharide Psl. Now we have found that when CdrA bound to Psl, it was protected from proteolysis. Together, these results support the idea of the importance of multibiomolecular components in matrix stability and led us to propose a model in which CdrA-CdrA interactions can enhance cell-cell packing in an aggregate that is resistant to physical shear, while Psl-CdrA interactions enhance aggregate integrity in the presence of self-produced and exogenous proteases.","authors":[{"name":"Courtney Reichhardt"},{"name":"Cynthis Wong"},{"name":"Daniel Passos da Silva"},{"name":"Daniel J Wozniak"},{"name":"Matthew R Parsek"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CdrA"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Psl"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"elastase"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"30254117","title":"Antagonistic Pleiotropy in the Bifunctional Surface Protein FadL (OmpP1) during Adaptation of Haemophilus influenzae to Chronic Lung Infection Associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.","abs":"Tracking bacterial evolution during chronic infection provides insights into how host selection pressures shape bacterial genomes. The human-restricted opportunistic pathogen nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) infects the lower airways of patients suffering chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes to disease progression. To identify bacterial genetic variation associated with bacterial adaptation to the COPD lung, we sequenced the genomes of 92 isolates collected from the sputum of 13 COPD patients over 1 to 9 years. Individuals were colonized by distinct clonal types (CTs) over time, but the same CT was often reisolated at a later time or found in different patients. Although genomes from the same CT were nearly identical, intra-CT variation due to mutation and recombination occurred. Recurrent mutations in several genes were likely involved in COPD lung adaptation. Notably, nearly a third of CTs were polymorphic for null alleles of ompP1 (also called fadL), which encodes a bifunctional membrane protein that both binds the human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (hCEACAM1) receptor and imports long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Our computational studies provide plausible three-dimensional models for FadL's interaction with hCEACAM1 and LCFA binding. We show that recurrent fadL mutations are likely a case of antagonistic pleiotropy, since loss of FadL reduces NTHi's ability to infect epithelia but also increases its resistance to bactericidal LCFAs enriched within the COPD lung. Supporting this interpretation, truncated fadL alleles are common in publicly available NTHi genomes isolated from the lower airway tract but rare in others.

To systematically characterize such systems, we study semi-penetrable self-propelled rods in two dimensions, with a propulsion force that decreases with increasing local rod density, by employing Brownian dynamics simulations. Volume exclusion and quorum sensing both lead to phase separation; however, the structure of the systems and the rod dynamics vastly differ. Quorum sensing enhances the polarity of the clusters, induces perpendicularity of rods at the cluster borders, and enhances cluster formation. For systems where the rods essentially become passive at high densities, formation of asters and stripes is observed. Systems of rods with larger aspect ratios show more ordered structures compared to those with smaller aspect ratios, due to their stronger alignment, with almost circular asters for strongly density-dependent propulsion force.

Batch sorption experiments were conducted to prepare clay samples with a wide range of sorbed tetracycline concentration. The bioreporter was incubated with tetracycline-sorbed clay at different clay/solution ratios and water contents, as well as using dialysis tubings to prevent the direct contact between bacterial cells and clay particles. The expression of antibiotic resistance genes from the bioreporter was measured using a flow cytometer as a measurement of bioavailability/selective pressure. The direct contact of bioreporter cells to clay surfaces represented an important pathway facilitating bacterial access to clay-sorbed tetracycline. In clay-water suspensions, reducing solution volume rendered more bacteria to attach to clay surfaces enhancing the bioavailability of clay-sorbed tetracycline. The strong fluorescence emission from bioreporter cells on clay surfaces indicated that clay-sorbed tetracycline was still bioavailable to bacteria. The formation of biofilms on clay surfaces could increase bacterial access to clay-sorbed tetracycline. In addition, desorption of loosely sorbed tetracycline into bulk solution contributed to bacterial exposure and activation of the antibiotic resistance genes.

However, very little is known about these microcolonies, particularly genomic differences between these specialized biofilm structures and the traditional in vitro biofilms. In this study, we used a novel flow system, in which C. albicans spontaneously forms microcolonies, to further characterize the architecture of fungal microcolonies and their genomics compared to non-microcolony conditions. Fungal microcolonies arose from radially branching filamentous hyphae that increasingly intertwined with one another to form extremely dense biofilms, and closely resembled the architecture of in vivo oropharyngeal candidiasis. We identified 20 core microcolony genes that were differentially regulated in flow-induced microcolonies using RNA-seq. These genes included HWP1, ECE1, IHD1, PLB1, HYR1, PGA10, and SAP5. A predictive algorithm was utilized to identify ten transcriptional regulators potentially involved in microcolony formation. Of these transcription factors, we found that Rob1, Ndt80, Sfl1 and Sfl2, played a key role in microcolony formation under both flow and static conditions and to epithelial surfaces. Expression of core microcolony genes were highly up-regulated in Δsfl1 cells and down-regulated in both Δsfl2 and Δrob1 strains. Microcolonies formed on oral epithelium using C. albicans Δsfl1, Δsfl2 and Δrob1 deletion strains all had altered adhesion, invasion and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, epithelial cells infected with deletion mutants had reduced (SFL2, NDT80, and ROB1) or enhanced (SFL2) immune responses, evidenced by phosphorylation of MKP1 and c-Fos activation, key signal transducers in the hyphal invasion response. This profile of microcolony transcriptional regulators more closely reflects Sfl1 and Sfl2 hyphal regulatory networks than static biofilm regulatory networks, suggesting that microcolonies are a specialized pathogenic form of biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Andrew D McCall"},{"name":"Rohitashw Kumar"},{"name":"Mira Edgerton"}],"keywords":[]},"article215":{"pmid":"30252837","title":"Formation of phenotypic lineages in Salmonella enterica by a pleiotropic fimbrial switch.","abs":"The std locus of Salmonella enterica, an operon acquired by horizontal transfer, encodes fimbriae that permit adhesion to epithelial cells in the large intestine.

While strain differences may plausibly explain virulence differentials, an alternative hypothesis posits that the pathogenic potential of this species may depend on altered ecosystem conditions in the inflamed gut. One potential difference is oxygen availability, which is frequently increased under conditions of inflammation and is known to regulate bacterial virulence. Hence, we hypothesized that oxygen influences C. concisus physiology. We therefore characterized the effect of microaerophilic or anaerobic environments on C. concisus motility and biofilm formation, two important determinants of host colonization and dissemination. C. concisus isolates (n = 46) sourced from saliva, gut mucosal biopsies and feces of patients with IBD (n = 23), gastroenteritis (n = 8) and healthy subjects (n = 13), were used for this study. Capacity to form biofilms was determined using crystal violet assay, while assessment of dispersion through soft agar permitted motility to be assessed. No association existed between GI disease and either motility or biofilm forming capacity. Oral isolates exhibited significantly greater capacity for biofilm formation compared to fecal isolates (p<0.03), and showed a strong negative correlation between motility and biofilm formation (r = -0.7; p = 0.01). Motility significantly increased when strains were cultured under microaerophilic compared to anaerobic conditions (p<0.001). Increased biofilm formation under microaerophillic conditions was also observed for a subset of isolates.

Five researchers presented their results related to infection and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prof. Itzhaki presented her work on the role of viruses, specifically HSV-1, in the pathogenesis of AD. She maintains that although it is true that most people harbor HSV-1 infection, either latent or active, nonetheless aspects of herpes infection can play a role in the pathogenesis of AD, based on extensive experimental evidence from AD brains and infected cell cultures. Dr. Miklossy presented research on the high prevalence of bacterial infections that correlate with AD, specifically spirochete infections, which have been known for a century to be a significant cause of dementia (e.g., in syphilis). She demonstrated how spirochetes drive senile plaque formation, which are in fact biofilms. Prof. Balin then described the involvement of brain tissue infection by the Chlamydia pneumoniae bacterium, with its potential to use the innate immune system in its spread, and its initiation of tissue damage characteristic of AD. Prof. Fülöp described the role of AD-associated amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide as an antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral innate immune effector produced in reaction to microorganisms that attack the brain. Prof. Barron put forward the novel hypothesis that, according to her experiments, there is strong sequence-specific binding between the AD-associated Aβ and another ubiquitous and important human innate immune effector, the cathelicidin peptide LL-37. Given this binding, LL-37 expression in the brain will decrease Aβ deposition via formation of non-toxic, soluble Aβ/LL-37 complexes. Therefore, a chronic underexpression of LL-37 could be the factor that simultaneously permits chronic infections in brain tissue and allows for pathological accumulation of Aβ. This first-of-its-kind symposium opened the way for a paradigm shift in studying the pathogenesis of AD, from the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which so far has been quite unsuccessful, to a new infection hypothesis, or perhaps more broadly, innate immune system dysregulation hypothesis, which may well permit and lead to the discovery of new treatments for AD patients.","authors":[{"name":"Tamàs Fülöp"},{"name":"Ruth F Itzhaki"},{"name":"Brian J Balin"},{"name":"Judith Miklossy"},{"name":"Annelise E Barron"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alzheimer’s disease"},{"word":"Chlamydia pneumoniae"},{"word":"HSV-1"},{"word":"LL-37"},{"word":"amyloid beta"},{"word":"infections"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"spirochetes"}]},"article225":{"pmid":"30250246","title":"Strain-level diversity drives alternative community types in millimetre-scale granular biofilms.","abs":"Microbial communities are often highly diverse in their composition, both at a coarse-grained taxonomic level, such as genus, and at a highly resolved level, such as strains, within species. This variability can be driven by either extrinsic factors such as temperature and or by intrinsic ones, for example demographic fluctuations or ecological interactions. The relative contributions of these factors and the taxonomic level at which they influence community composition remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulty in identifying true community replicates assembled under the same environmental parameters. Here, we address this problem using an activated granular sludge reactor in which millimetre-scale biofilm granules represent true community replicates. Differences in composition are then expected to be driven primarily by biotic factors. Using 142 shotgun metagenomes of single biofilm granules we found that, at the commonly used genus-level resolution, community replicates varied much more in their composition than would be expected from neutral assembly processes. This variation did not translate into any clear partitioning into discrete community types, that is, distinct compositional states, such as enterotypes in the human gut. However, a strong partition into community types did emerge at the strain level for the dominant organism: genotypes of Candidatus Accumulibacter that coexisted in the metacommunity (the reactor) excluded each other within community replicates (granules). Individual granule communities maintained a significant lineage structure, whereby the strain phylogeny of Accumulibacter correlated with the overall composition of the community, indicating a high potential for co-diversification among species and communities. Our results suggest that due to the high functional redundancy and competition between close relatives, alternative community types are most probably observed at the level of recently differentiated genotypes but not at higher orders of genetic resolution.","authors":[{"name":"Gabriel E Leventhal"},{"name":"Carles Boix"},{"name":"Urs Kuechler"},{"name":"Tim N Enke"},{"name":"Elzbieta Sliwerska"},{"name":"Christof Holliger"},{"name":"Otto X Cordero"}],"keywords":[]},"article226":{"pmid":"30249968","title":"Antibacterial Properties of Silicone Membranes after a Simple Two-Step Immersion Process in Iodine and Silver Nitrate Solutions.","abs":"　Silicone is widely used in packing materials, medical equipment, and separation membranes.

Comparison of biofilms under inducing and noninducing conditions revealed a biofilm defect in the absence of xylose, whereas biofilm maturation increased following xylose induction. The removal of xylose resulted in the interruption of luxS expression and biofilm dispersal. Measurement of luxS transcript levels by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) showed that luxS expression peaked as biofilms matured and waned before dispersal. Transcript profiling revealed significant changes following the induction of luxS, including increased transcript levels for a predicted family 8 glycosyltransferase (NTHI1750; designated gstA); this result was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.

During degradation, c-di-GMP is first linearized to 5'-phosphoguanylyl-(3',5')-guanosine (pGpG) and subsequently hydrolyzed to two GMPs by a previously unknown enzyme, which was recently identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease oligoribonuclease (Orn). Mutants of orn accumulated pGpG, which inhibited the linearization of c-di-GMP. This product inhibition led to elevated c-di-GMP levels, resulting in increased aggregate and biofilm formation. Thus, the hydrolysis of pGpG is crucial to the maintenance of c-di-GMP homeostasis. How species that utilize c-di-GMP signaling but lack an orn ortholog hydrolyze pGpG remains unknown. Because Orn is an exoribonuclease, we asked whether pGpG hydrolysis can be carried out by genes that encode protein domains found in exoribonucleases. From a screen of these genes from Vibrio cholerae and Bacillus anthracis, we found that only enzymes known to cleave oligoribonucleotides (orn and nrnA) rescued the P. aeruginosa Δorn mutant phenotypes to the wild type. Thus, we tested additional RNases with demonstrated activity against short oligoribonucleotides. These experiments show that only exoribonucleases previously reported to degrade short RNAs (nrnA, nrnB, nrnC, and orn) can also hydrolyze pGpG. A B. subtilisnrnA nrnB mutant had elevated c-di-GMP, suggesting that these two genes serve as the primary enzymes to degrade pGpG. These results indicate that the requirement for pGpG hydrolysis to complete c-di-GMP signaling is conserved across species.

We found that while Ebp are only expressed on a subset of cells, when Ebp and AS are expressed on the same cells, pili interfere with AS-mediated clumping and impede AS-mediated conjugative plasmid transfer during planktonic growth. However, when the population density increases, horizontal gene transfer rates normalize and are no longer affected by pilus expression.

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) formation in yeast cells resulted one of the mechanisms of ZNGs to induce mortality. Finally, the toxicity of this nanomaterial was tested also on human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Our data indicated that ZNGs resulted not toxic when their aggregation state decreased by adding glycerol as emulsifier to ZNGs suspensions or when HaCaT cells were grown on ZNGs-coated glasses. Overall, the results that were obtained indicated that ZNGs could be exploited as an antifungal nanomaterial with a high degree of biocompatibility on human cells.","authors":[{"name":"Graziella Ficociello"},{"name":"Maria Giovanna De Caris"},{"name":"Giusy Trillò"},{"name":"Domenico Cavallini"},{"name":"Maria Sabrina Sarto"},{"name":"Daniela Uccelletti"},{"name":"Patrizia Mancini"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"HaCaT cells"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"graphene"},{"word":"nanorods"},{"word":"zinc oxide"}]},"article237":{"pmid":"30248937","title":"Hanks-Type Serine/Threonine Protein Kinases and Phosphatases in Bacteria: Roles in Signaling and Adaptation to Various Environments.","abs":"Reversible phosphorylation is a key mechanism that regulates many cellular processes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, signal transduction includes two-component signaling systems, which involve a membrane sensor histidine kinase and a cognate DNA-binding response regulator. Several recent studies indicate that alternative regulatory pathways controlled by Hanks-type serine/threonine kinases (STKs) and serine/threonine phosphatases (STPs) also play an essential role in regulation of many different processes in bacteria, such as growth and cell division, cell wall biosynthesis, sporulation, biofilm formation, stress response, metabolic and developmental processes, as well as interactions (either pathogenic or symbiotic) with higher host organisms. Since these enzymes are not DNA-binding proteins, they exert the regulatory role via post-translational modifications of their protein targets. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of STKs and STPs, and discuss how these enzymes mediate gene expression in prokaryotes. Many studies indicate that regulatory systems based on Hanks-type STKs and STPs play an essential role in the regulation of various cellular processes, by reversibly phosphorylating many protein targets, among them several regulatory proteins of other signaling cascades. These data show high complexity of bacterial regulatory network, in which the crosstalk between STK/STP signaling enzymes, components of TCSs, and the translational machinery occurs. In this regulation, the STK/STP systems have been proved to play important roles.","authors":[{"name":"Monika Janczarek"},{"name":"José-María Vinardell"},{"name":"Paulina Lipa"},{"name":"Magdalena Karaś"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial gene expression"},{"word":"regulatory network"},{"word":"reversible protein phosphorylation"},{"word":"serine/threonine protein kinase"},{"word":"serine/threonine protein phosphatase"},{"word":"signal transduction"}]},"article238":{"pmid":"30248936","title":"Disubstituted 4-Chloro-3-nitrophenylthiourea Derivatives: Antimicrobial and Cytotoxic Studies.","abs":"4-Chloro-3-nitrophenylthioureas ","authors":[{"name":"Anna Bielenica"},{"name":"Giuseppina Sanna"},{"name":"Silvia Madeddu"},{"name":"Gabriele Giliberti"},{"name":"Joanna Stefańska"},{"name":"Anna E Kozioł"},{"name":"Oleksandra Savchenko"},{"name":"Paulina Strzyga-Łach"},{"name":"Alicja Chrzanowska"},{"name":"Grażyna Kubiak-Tomaszewska"},{"name":"Marta Struga"}],"keywords":[{"word":"X-ray crystallography"},{"word":"antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cytotoxicity"},{"word":"thiourea derivatives"}]},"article239":{"pmid":"30248888","title":"Revisiting Current Photoactive Materials for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy.","abs":"Microbial infection is a severe concern, requiring the use of significant amounts of antimicrobials/biocides, not only in the hospital setting, but also in other environments.

It is obvious that the development of new strategies to combat planktonic and biofilm-embedded microorganisms is required. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is being recognized as an effective method to inactivate a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including those resistant to conventional antimicrobials. In the last few years, the development and biological assessment of new photosensitizers for PDI were accompanied by their immobilization in different supports having in mind the extension of the photodynamic principle to new applications, such as the disinfection of blood, water, and surfaces. In this review, we intended to cover a significant amount of recent work considering a diversity of photosensitizers and supports to achieve an effective photoinactivation.

Few studies have examined bacteria, invertebrates and nutrient-rich contaminants in concert, with none yet to examine the effects of nutrient-rich contaminants on both biofilms and the recruitment of sessile invertebrate communities in-situ to ascertain the mechanistic basis behind observed impacts. Biofilm treatments were allowed to develop under manipulated environmental conditions of either ambient or enriched nutrient levels. Enrichment conditions were elevated via slow-release fertiliser and invertebrate recruitment was prevented during initial biofilm development. Biofilm treatments (including a no film control) were then subject to either ambient or enriched water-borne nutrients (in a fully-factorial design) during a period of invertebrate colonisation in the field. Effects of nutrient-rich contaminants on invertebrate recruitment were observed as changes to community composition and the abundances of taxonomic groups. Communities on no biofilm control treatments differed from those with pre-developed biofilms. Naturally developed biofilms promoted recruitment by all organisms, except barnacles, which preferred nutrient-enriched biofilms. Water-borne nutrients increased the recruitment of ascidians and barnacles, but suppressed bryozoan, serpulid polychaete and sponge recruitment. The direct and indirect impacts observed on biofilm and invertebrate communities suggest that increasing nutrient levels via nutrient-rich contaminants will result in structural community shifts that may ultimately impact ecosystem functioning within estuaries.","authors":[{"name":"Jasmin C Lawes"},{"name":"Graeme F Clark"},{"name":"Emma L Johnston"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial biofilms"},{"word":"Elevated nutrients"},{"word":"Recruitment mechanisms"},{"word":"Sub-tidal invertebrate communities"}]},"article241":{"pmid":"30248650","title":"System performance and microbial community succession in a partial nitrification biofilm reactor in response to salinity stress.","abs":"The system performance and microbial community succession in a partial nitrification biofilm reactor in response to salinity stress was conducted.

In the article we explored how the above-presented C. albicans fitness and virulence attributes provided a robust response to the environmental stress exerted by sulfones upon C. albicans; C. albicans fitness and virulence attributes are fungal properties whose inactivation attenuates virulence.

For flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge, this rate-limiting effect of diffusion is often lumped in model parameters, like the half-saturation coefficients of Monod kinetics in activated sludge models (ASM). Yet, an explicit description of the reaction-diffusion process with biofilm models is more common for aerobic granular sludge. This work investigates whether apparent half-saturation coefficients could have applications for aerobic granular sludge as well and examines the implications of this simplification. To this end, the macroscopic reaction rates predicted with a one-dimensional biofilm (1D) model were fitted with Monod kinetics. The results showed that the macroscale rates could indeed be described using apparent kinetics, at the very least over a time scale where the microbial population distribution stays fixed. However, the coefficients were sensitive to changes in the microbial population distribution, which can be affected by long-term changes in operating conditions. Also the activity of organisms that compete for the same substrates affect the parameter value. Be that as it may, apparent kinetics also depend on the operating conditions for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge, but they have still been used successfully for design and optimization. Therefore, the last section of this work illustrates that they may also have applications for aerobic granular sludge. A simple model for ammonium removal using apparent half-saturation coefficients for oxygen and ammonium is applied to a full-scale reactor, taking advantage of the batch-wise operation and on-line monitoring data for regular recalibration.","authors":[{"name":"Janis E Baeten"},{"name":"Mark C M van Loosdrecht"},{"name":"Eveline I P Volcke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ASM"},{"word":"Biofilm modelling"},{"word":"Diffusion"},{"word":"Granular sludge"},{"word":"Half-saturation coefficient"},{"word":"Monod"}]},"article266":{"pmid":"30242260","title":"In-vivo shift of the microbiota in oral biofilm in response to frequent sucrose consumption.","abs":"Caries is associated with shifts of microbiota in dental biofilms and primarily driven by frequent sucrose consumption.

Significant data have been generated to demonstrate the effectiveness of SeNPs alone or in combination with other reagents. Their activities are demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo experimentation; yet, the levels of efficacy need to be improved, particularly when compared with those of pharmaceutical drugs (such as antibiotics and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs). However, promising evidence suggests decreased toxicity when using SeNPs, and more importantly their ability to perform as an interfacing biomaterial with cells and tissues.

Therefore, as with other nanomaterials, SeNPs warrant further study as part of the biomaterial-based therapeutic toolkit as an alternative to traditional pharmaceutical agents. This paper will provide a succinct review of recent studies on SeNPs to critically assess the findings in the light of effectiveness, particularly highlighting the roles of the cellular interface. Finally, an outlook of the potential of SeNPs will be presented to highlight the need for more intensive studies of material stability, mechanistic understanding at subcellular levels, and investigations into their combinational and/or synergistic effects with other bioactive reagents including pharmaceutical drugs.","authors":[{"name":"Victoria le Ching Tan"},{"name":"Angelica Hinchman"},{"name":"Richard Williams"},{"name":"Phong A Tran"},{"name":"Kate Fox"}],"keywords":[]},"article273":{"pmid":"30241381","title":"Influence of Eugenia uniflora Extract on Adhesion to Human Buccal Epithelial Cells, Biofilm Formation, and Cell Surface Hydrophobicity of Candida spp. from the Oral Cavity of Kidney Transplant Recipients.","abs":"This study evaluated the influence of the extract of Eugenia uniflora in adhesion to human buccal epithelial cells (HBEC) biofilm formation and cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) of Candida spp. isolated from the oral cavity of kidney transplant patients.

The nanocomposites also showed satisfying antibacterial capacities against planktonic Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Intriguingly, with magnetic field navigation (NdFeB, 2000 gauss), the nanocomposites could be guided to handily penetrate into S. aureus biofilm and performed dual-responsive release, showing significantly enhanced biofilm disruption.

We studied these aspects using PPAD-competent and PPAD-incompetent strains of P. gingivalis, and demonstrated that neither biofilm formation nor its composition was affected by PPAD activity. Similarly, flow cytometry revealed that PPAD did not impact the ability of P. gingivalis to adhere to and, subsequently, invade keratinocytes. Network analyses of gene expression patterns, however, revealed a group of host genes that were sensitive to PPAD activity (CXCL8, IL36G, CCL20, and IL1B). These genes can be categorized as potent immune modulators belonging to the interleukin 1 system, or chemoattractants of lymphocytes and neutrophils.

Thus, we aimed to determine the condition of orthopaedic loaned sets when delivered to the hospital, assess the quality of complex-design RSIs reprocessed by manual cleaning, and evaluate the effect of multiple reprocessing on single-use implant (screw).","authors":[{"name":"Dayane de Melo Costa"},{"name":"Lillian Kelly de Oliveira Lopes"},{"name":"Karen Vickery"},{"name":"Evandro Watanabe"},{"name":"Lara Stefania Netto de Oliveira Leão Vasconcelos"},{"name":"Milena Cristina de Paula"},{"name":"Dulcelene Sousa Melo"},{"name":"Honghua Hu"},{"name":"Anand Kumar Deva"},{"name":"Anaclara Ferreira Veiga Tipple"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Cleaning"},{"word":"Implants"},{"word":"Loaner instrumentation"},{"word":"Sterilisation"},{"word":"Surgical instruments"}]},"article285":{"pmid":"30236668","title":"The effects of EGCG on the mechanical, bioactivities, cross-linking and release properties of gelatin film.","abs":"The effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the mechanical, antioxidative, antimicrobial, cross-linking and release properties of gelatin film were evaluated.

The occurrence of Salmonella strains in this study was 210/1440 (14.58%) of the ready-to-eat shrimp's samples. The identified strains comprise of Salmonella Enteritidis 11, Salmonella Typhimurium 14 and other Salmonella spp. 20. The 45 identified Salmonella strains revealed the following virulence properties: swimming and swarming motility 45(100%); S-layer 39(86.67%); haemolytic activity 40(88.89%); lipase activity 43(95.56%); protease activity 43(95.56%); gelatinase production 43(95.56%); and DNA degrading activity 41(91.11%).

For surface hydrophobicity using bacterial adherence to hydrocarbons, 25(55.56%) were hydrophilic while 20(44.44%) were moderately hydrophobic from the 45 Salmonella isolates. Using salting aggregation test for surface hydrophobicity, all selected isolates 45(100%) was hydrophilic. Autoaggregation index for the 12 selected Salmonella isolates ranged from 15.2-47.2%, while the autoaggragation index for the 12 selected test bacteria ranged from 26.2-71.3%.

To overcome this nutrient restriction, bacteria utilize high-affinity transporters that allow them to compete with host metal-binding proteins. Despite the established role of Mn in bacterial pathogenesis, little is known about the relevance of Mn in the pathophysiology of E. faecalis. Here, we identified and characterized the major Mn acquisition systems of E. faecalis. We discovered that the ABC-type permease EfaCBA and two Nramp-type transporters, named MntH1 and MntH2, work collectively to promote cell growth under Mn-restricted conditions. The simultaneous inactivation of EfaCBA, MntH1 and MntH2 (ΔefaΔmntH1ΔmntH2 strain) led to drastic reductions (>95%) in cellular Mn content, severe growth defects in body fluids (serum and urine) ex vivo, significant loss of virulence in Galleria mellonella, and virtually complete loss of virulence in rabbit endocarditis and murine catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) models. Despite the functional redundancy of EfaCBA, MntH1 and MntH2 under in vitro or ex vivo conditions and in the invertebrate model, dual inactivation of efaCBA and mntH2 (ΔefaΔmntH2 strain) was sufficient to prompt maximal sensitivity to calprotectin, a Mn- and Zn-chelating host antimicrobial protein, and for the loss of virulence in mammalian models. Interestingly, EfaCBA appears to play a prominent role during systemic infection, whereas MntH2 was more important during CAUTI. The different roles of EfaCBA and MntH2 in these sites could be attributed, at least in part, to the differential expression of efaA and mntH2 in cells isolated from hearts or from bladders. Collectively, this study demonstrates that Mn acquisition is essential for the pathogenesis of E. faecalis and validates Mn uptake systems as promising targets for the development of new antimicrobials.","authors":[{"name":"Cristina Colomer-Winter"},{"name":"Ana L Flores-Mireles"},{"name":"Shannon P Baker"},{"name":"Kristi L Frank"},{"name":"Aaron J L Lynch"},{"name":"Scott J Hultgren"},{"name":"Todd Kitten"},{"name":"José A Lemos"}],"keywords":[]},"article288":{"pmid":"30235145","title":"Molecular Communications Pulse-Based Jamming Model for Bacterial Biofilm Suppression.","abs":"Studies have recently shown that the bacteria survivability within biofilms is responsible for the emergence of superbugs.

A previous study of our research group had demonstrated the effectiveness of the bacteriocin nisin to inhibit the growth of enological LAB, and its activity had been tested in culture broths. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of controlling the growth of bacteria in wine by the use of nisin in combination with sulfur dioxide, and to study nisin production by the natural producer Lactococcus lactis LM29 under enological conditions. Our results showed that L. lactis LM29 produced nisin in the presence of 2 and 4% ethanol (v/v), while higher concentrations of ethanol fully inhibited the production of nisin. We obtained a nisin enriched active extract (NAE) from the cell-free supernatant of a culture of L. lactis LM29 in MRS broth containing 60% (v/v) sterile grape juice, and the extract was fully active in inhibiting the growth of the enological LAB tested by the microtiter method. Moreover, the nisin concentration of the obtained NAE could actually prevent the formation of an undesirable biofilm of LAB strains.

The diverse nature of EAEC is such that not all strains cause disease. Conversely, certain strains of EAEC possess additional virulence determinants associated with the ability to cause severe diarrhoea and other symptoms, which might be life-threatening in vulnerable patients. The EAEC virulence factors described to date are either encoded on the large virulence plasmid of EAEC (plasmid of aggregative adherence) or on pathogenicity islands on the chromosome. Testing of food and faecal samples involves the detection of EAEC-associated traits in the matrix followed by isolation of the organism and confirmation of the presence of EAEC-associated genes using PCR. The variability of the plasmid structure and virulence gene sequences and the possibility that this mobile genetic element may be lost has necessitated the inclusion of chromosomal markers in the molecular screening assays. There is evidence in the literature of foodborne transmission of EAEC, but currently no evidence of a zoonotic reservoir. Fimbriae-mediated adhesion and biofilm formation are likely to be involved in both clinical manifestations of infection and attachment to foodstuffs. Multidrug resistance appears to be common in EAEC and geographically widespread. Whole-genome sequencing has revealed the mosaic genomic structure of EAEC and provided evidence that horizontal gene transfer and recombination are the driving force for acquisition of novel genome features and potentially novel pathogenic mechanisms.

The isolates were identified as Aeromonas veronii biovar veronii (n = 26), A. veronii biovar sobria (n = 3), Aeromonas hydrophila (n = 8), A. caviae (n = 3), Aeromonas enteropelogenes (n = 2) and Aeromonas dhakensis (n = 1) by gyrB gene sequencing. The sequence divergence within and between the species ranged from 0-5·80% and 4·90-8·00%. Each species formed a distinct group in a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree. The lipase production, biofilm formation, DNase activity, gelatinase production, caseinase production and β-hemolysis were phenotypically observed in 34 (79·07%), 33 (74·74%), 30 (69·77%), 25 (58·14%), 22 (51·18%) and 21 (48·84%) isolates. The virulence genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in following frequencies- aer (86·05%), hlyA (83·72%), gcaT (83·72%), lip (72·09%), act (67·44%), fla (65·12%), ascV (58·14%), ast (55·81%), ser (41·86%), ahyB (39·53%) and alt (25·58%). Every isolate was resistant to at least four antibiotics in disk diffusion test. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index values ranged from 0·22-0·50 among the isolates.

Virulence properties and antibiotic resistance of ornamental fish-borne Aeromonas spp. are poorly understood. The virulence factors as well as multiple antibiotic resistance profiles of zebrafish-borne Aeromonas spp. were characterized for the first time in Korea. Most of the isolates were positive for phenotypic virulence traits and harboured several virulence genes revealing the virulence potential of zebrafish-borne Aeromonas spp. Additionally, the high multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index values displayed by the isolates highlight the necessity of responsible use of antibiotics in the ornamental fish industry.","authors":[{"name":"S Hossain"},{"name":"B C J De Silva"},{"name":"P S Dahanayake"},{"name":"G-J Heo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aeromonas spp."},{"word":"multi-drug resistance"},{"word":"phylogenetic tree"},{"word":"virulence properties"},{"word":"zebrafish"}]},"article307":{"pmid":"30229793","title":"Sialylated variants of lacto-N-tetraose exhibit antimicrobial activity against Group B Streptococcus.","abs":"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) possess antimicrobial activity against a number of bacterial pathogens.

The results showed that the settleability of process Ⅰ was the best, followed by process Ⅲ and Ⅱ. Under the different operating conditions, the dominant bacteria and microbial community structure of the system changed significantly. The relative amount of Thiothrix was the dominant bacteria affecting the sludge settleability. The abundances of Thiothrix were only 0.08% and 1.51% with fresh sludge and in process Ⅰ; this abundance increased to 9.41% in process Ⅱ and decreased to 4.29% in process Ⅲ. The anaerobic zone of process I had an inhibitory effect on the growth of the bacterium, while the anoxic zone of process Ⅱ stimulated its dominant growth. At the same time, comparison showed that the microbial population diversity was highest in process Ⅰ. followed by processes Ⅱ and Ⅲ. The introduction of anoxic and anaerobic zones led to the increase of system function and environmental complexity, and increased microbial community diversity. Analyses of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and fluorescence characteristics showed that the changes in microbial community structure had a significant effect on the composition and content of EPS, which aggravated the process of improving or deteriorating settleability. The sludge settleability was found to be positively correlated with the ratio of protein and polysaccharide in loosely bound EPS.","authors":[{"name":"Dan-Dan Wen"},{"name":"Lin-Jiang Yuan"},{"name":"Xi Chen"},{"name":"Yang Wang"},{"name":"Tong-Tong Shen"},{"name":"Xiao-Bo Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biological treatment"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"fluorescence characteristics"},{"word":"microbial community structure"},{"word":"sludge settleability"}]},"article310":{"pmid":"30229610","title":"[Characteristics of Denitrifying Phosphorus Removal by A","abs":"Low C/N domestic sewage was treated by an A","authors":[{"name":"Jian-Ming Huang"},{"name":"Zhi-Chao Zhao"},{"name":"Long-Ju Zheng"},{"name":"Zhao-Wei Shao"},{"name":"Fang-Jiao An"},{"name":"Yong-Zhi Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"aeration flow"},{"word":"biological aerated filter (BAF)"},{"word":"effective packing height"},{"word":"low C/N"},{"word":"low temperature"},{"word":"ratio of denitrifying phosphorus to nitrogen (ΔPO43-/ΔNO3--N)"}]},"article311":{"pmid":"30229238","title":"Preoperative Skin-Surface Cultures Can Help to Predict the Presence of Propionibacterium in Shoulder Arthroplasty Wounds.","abs":"Propionibacterium species are commonly cultured from specimens harvested at the time of revision shoulder arthroplasty.

Multiple mucosa-associated pathogens have evolved a mechanism of rapid adaptation, termed the phasevarion, which facilitates a coordinated regulation of numerous genes throughout the bacterial genome. This epigenetic regulation occurs via phase variation of a DNA methyltransferase, Mod. The phasevarion of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) significantly affects the severity of experimental otitis media and regulates several disease-related processes. However, the role of the NTHI phasevarion in biofilm formation is unclear. The present study shows that the phasevarions of multiple NTHI clinical isolates regulate in vitro biofilm formation under disease-specific microenvironmental conditions. The impact of phasevarion regulation was greatest under alkaline conditions that mimic those known to occur in the middle ear during disease. Under alkaline conditions, NTHI strains that express the ModA2 methyltransferase formed biofilms with significantly greater biomass and less distinct architecture than those formed by a ModA2-deficient population. The biofilms formed by NTHI strains that express ModA2 also contained less extracellular DNA (eDNA) and significantly less extracellular HU, a DNABII DNA-binding protein critical for biofilm structural stability. Stable biofilm structure is critical for bacterial pathogenesis and persistence in multiple experimental models of disease. These results identify a role for the phasevarion in regulation of biofilm formation, a process integral to the chronic nature of many infections. Understanding the role of the phasevarion in biofilm formation is critical to the development of prevention and treatment strategies for these chronic diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Kenneth L Brockman"},{"name":"Patrick N Azzari"},{"name":"M Taylor Branstool"},{"name":"John M Atack"},{"name":"Benjamin L Schulz"},{"name":"Freda E-C Jen"},{"name":"Michael P Jennings"},{"name":"Lauren O Bakaletz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNABII"},{"word":"HU"},{"word":"NTHI"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"otitis media"},{"word":"phasevarion"}]},"article315":{"pmid":"30228191","title":"Archaic and alternative chaperones preserve pilin folding energy by providing incomplete structural information.","abs":"Adhesive pili are external component of fibrous adhesive organelles and help bacteria attach to biotic or abiotic surfaces. The biogenesis of adhesive pili via the chaperone-usher pathway (CUP) is independent of external energy sources. In the classical CUP, chaperones transport assembly-competent pilins in a folded but expanded conformation. During donor-strand exchange, pilins subsequently collapse, producing a tightly packed hydrophobic core and releasing the necessary free energy to drive fiber formation. Here, we show that pilus biogenesis in non-classical, archaic, and alternative CUPs uses a different source of conformational energy. High-resolution structures of the archaic Csu-pili system from Acinetobacter baumannii revealed that non-classical chaperones employ a short donor strand motif that is insufficient to fully complement the pilin fold. This results in chaperone-bound pilins being trapped in a substantially unfolded intermediate. The exchange of this short motif with the longer donor strand from adjacent pilin provides the full steric information essential for folding, and thereby induces a large unfolded-to-folded conformational transition to drive assembly.

These novel compositions substantially inhibit biofilm growth, greatly reduce acid production and polysaccharide synthesis of biofilms, and reduce biofilm colony-forming units by three to four orders of magnitude.

In this study, we report on this intrinsic antibacterial effect exhibited by two distinct CP phases: an amorphous CP (ACP) and hydroxyapatite (HAp). The effect is prominent against a number of regular bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but also their multidrug-resistant (MDR) analogues. Although ACP and HAp displayed similar levels of activity against Gram-negative organisms, ACP proved to be more effective against the Gram-positive ones, with respect to which HAp was mostly inert, yet this trend became reversed for the MDR strains. In addition to the intrinsic antimicrobial effect of CP nanoparticles, we have also observed a synergistic effect between the nanoparticles and certain antibiotics. Both forms of CP were engaged in a synergistic relationship with a variety of concomitantly delivered antibiotics, including ampicillin, kanamycin, oxacillin, vancomycin, minocycline, erythromycin, linezolid, and clindamycin, and enabled even antibiotics completely ineffective against particular bacterial strains to significantly suppress their growth. This relationship was complex; depending on a particular CP phase, bacterial strain and antibiotic, the antibacterial activity (i) intensified proportionally to the nanoparticle concentration, (ii) plateaued immediately after the introduction of nanoparticles in minute amounts, or (iii) exhibited concentration-dependent minima due to stress-induced biofilm formation.

As proof of principle of the usefulness of this arrayed transposon library, we created a minimal input pool containing 6,829 mutants chosen for maximal genomic coverage and used an approach that we term SMarT (sequence-defined mariner technology) transposon sequencing (TnSeq) to identify numerous genetic determinants of bile resistance in E. faecalis OG1RF. These included several genes previously associated with bile acid resistance as well as new loci. Our arrayed library allows functional screening of a large percentage of the genome with a relatively small number of mutants, reducing potential effects of bottlenecking, and enables immediate recovery of mutants following competitions.

The incidences of infection have become more problematic attributable to emerging drug resistance and biofilm formation. These challenges suggest the need for new antimicrobial agents against S. aureus. In present work, we purified a fungal xenobiotic (FI3) which elicits a potent antimicrobial activity against a list of tested microbes including methicillin sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin resistance (MRSA) S. aureus. The cell growth of MSSA and MRSA were completely ceased with the 1× minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); 32 µg/mL and 128 µg/mL, respectively. The cell viability severely decreased within 90 min, due to disturbance of membrane homeostasis. This bactericidal effect was enhanced at lower pH (pH 4) with a speculation to retain positive charge. The FI3 potently disrupts biofilm adherence at 64 µg/mL and found to be a safe with no toxic effect on mammalian tissue. FI3 also leads to increase the potency of tested antibiotics. Taken together, we established that FI3 has a potent antimicrobial activity against tested microbes and safer to human tissue.

Extracellular matrices (ECM) and slanted glass coverslips are (SGC) used as biofilm substrates and biofilms have been investigated by SEM, confocal and crystal violet staining. ECM has shown enhanced biofilm formation under dynamic conditions rather than static conditions. SGC biofilm yield assay has shown higher levels of continuous layers and packed thicker biofilm formation with glass coverslip inserts, up to 1.7 to 3 times higher biofilm formation, than when compared with no glass coverslip inserts. A media immersed ECM study revealed that biofilm grown on extracellular matrixes formed thread-like pili structures, and that these structures had contact with the ECM and also showed excellent cell-to-cell interaction. In summary, A. baumannii showed higher biofilm formation capacities with ECM, while the prominent results were directly related with the biofilm formation capacity of A. baumannii. For the initial step of biofilm formation, adherence is an important factor and, consequently, strains with a comparatively high capability to adhere to extracellular matrices and slanted glass coverslips provide a new method of enhanced biofilm growth for in vitro assays.

Many virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa are controlled by the cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing (QS). QS depends on the synthesis, release, and groupwide response to extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. P. aeruginosa possesses two canonical LuxI/R-type QS systems, LasI/R and RhlI/R, that produce and detect 3OC12-homoserine lactone and C4-homoserine lactone, respectively. Previously, we discovered that RhlR regulates both RhlI-dependent and RhlI-independent regulons, and we proposed that an alternative ligand functions together with RhlR to control the target genes in the absence of RhlI. Here, we report the identification of an enzyme, PqsE, which is the alternative-ligand synthase. Using biofilm analyses, reporter assays, site-directed mutagenesis, protein biochemistry, and animal infection studies, we show that the PqsE-produced alternative ligand is the key autoinducer that promotes virulence gene expression. Thus, PqsE can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.

In addition to the control of potassium homeostasis, c-di-AMP has been implicated in many cellular activities, including DNA repair, cell wall homeostasis, osmotic adaptation, biofilm formation, central metabolism, and virulence. c-di-AMP is synthesized and degraded by diadenylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases, respectively. In the diadenylate cyclases, one type of catalytic domain, the diadenylate cyclase (DAC) domain, is coupled to various other domains that control the localization, the protein-protein interactions, and the regulation of the enzymes.

In addition to the flagellar-dependent swimming and swarming motility, pilus-dependent twitching mediates bacterial locomotion. Furthermore, filament independent modes of motility, namely gliding and sliding, have been described for various microorganisms. However, no mode of motility other than swimming has so far been described for roseobacters. In the present study, we investigated motility, distribution of flagellar systems and the phylogeny of 120 genome-sequenced Rhodobacteraceae. The phylogenetically broad taxon sampling that included 114 type strains revealed the presence of at least ten distinct clades that were statistically well supported. The investigation of the actual physiological capacity for swimming motility on soft agar plates showed that only about half of the 120 tested strains were motile under the tested conditions. Seven strains developed a conspicuous dendritic motility phenotype that was reminiscent of the swarming motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The observed dendritic motility in two strains (i.e. Sulfitobacter pseudonitzschiae DSM 26842 and Roseovarius pacificus DSM 29589) was particularly surprising because they did not harbor any genes of the FGC. Accordingly, it was concluded that this form of dendritic motility was independent of a flagellum.

The present work adopted powdered activated carbon (PAC) as ballasting agent to achieve robust separation effect and efficiency of bio-refractory DOM from the bio-chemically treated cassava distillery wastewater (BTDWW). More than 90% of DOC could be removed at the PAC and Fe(III)-coagulant dosage of 1.40 g/L and 0.84 g/L as Fe when the BTDWW was neutral. PAC should be dosed before coagulant in order to mix well with the DOM in the BTDWW. The analyses of DOM in effluent reveal that PAC facilitated the removal of lignin breakdown products which could not be well eliminated by regular coagulation; the removal of DOM with MW < 5 kDa was mostly enhanced. The characteristics of flocs demonstrate that PAC reinforced the interaction between Fe(III) species and DOM by providing more reaction sites. The sedimentation could be completed within the initial 5 min, and the highest settling velocity was almost 8 times higher than that of the only Fe(III)-involved flocs. The large size and favorable robustness of PAC-involved flocs enabled decent sedimentation even though their stretched structure might not be desirable in regular coagulation.

Native NAC inhibited growth of planktonic cells for the tested bacteria at concentration 0.25% w/v. Inhibition with equivalent solutions of the polymer derivatives was less effective due to the lack of SH groups. However, the tested polymers proved to be quite effective in eradication of mature biofilms. Treatment with 1% w/v emulsions of the hybrid polymers resulted in a significant reduction of viable cells in biofilm matrix despite the absence of thiol moieties.

In our previous work, the high phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of a clogging biofilm, developed in a simple aromatic hydrocarbon (BTEX)-contaminated groundwater well was uncovered. The determination of relationships between different groups of biofilm bacteria and certain metabolic traits has been omitted so far. Therefore, by setting up new biofilm-based enrichment microcosms, the research goal of the present study was to identify the aerobic/hypoxic BTEX-degrading and/or prolific biofilm-forming bacteria. The initial bacterial community composition as well as temporal dynamics due to the selective enrichment has been determined. The obtained results indicated that the concentration of dissolved oxygen may be a strong selective force on the evolution and final structure of microbial communities, developed in hydrocarbon-contaminated environments. Accordingly, members of the genus Malikia proved to be the most dominant community members of the aerobic BTEX-degrading enrichments. Acidovorax spp. dominated the oxygen-limited/hypoxic setup. During the study, a strain collection of 23 different bacterial species was obtained.

In the intracellular model, environment-driven gene expression and metabolism were captured using statistical regression and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, respectively.

We implemented the extracellular model as a three-dimensional diffusion model used to describe glucose, oxygen, and autoinducer 2 gradients within the biofilm and bulk fluid. We validated the model by comparing simulation results to empirical quantitative biofilm profiles, gene expression, and metabolic concentrations. Using the model, we characterized and compared the temporal metabolic and gene expression profiles of sessile versus planktonic bacterial populations during biofilm formation and investigated correlations between gene expression and biofilm-associated metabolites and cellular scale phenotypes. Based on our in silico studies, planktonic bacteria had higher metabolite concentrations in the glycolysis and citric acid cycle pathways, with higher gene expression levels in flagella and lipopolysaccharide-associated genes. Conversely, sessile bacteria had higher metabolite concentrations in the autoinducer 2 pathway, with type IV pili, autoinducer 2 export, and cellular respiration genes upregulated in comparison with planktonic bacteria.

Three to five functionalized graphene oxide materials exhibited improved inhibitory activity against planktonic strains as compared with the respective amines. In exchange, the amines alone proved generally more efficient against biofilm-embedded cells. (4) Conclusions: Such hybrid materials may have a wide range of potential use in biomedical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Irina Zarafu"},{"name":"Ioana Turcu"},{"name":"Daniela C Culiță"},{"name":"Simona Petrescu"},{"name":"Marcela Popa"},{"name":"Mariana C Chifiriuc"},{"name":"Carmen Limban"},{"name":"Alexandra Telehoiu"},{"name":"Petre Ioniță"}],"keywords":[{"word":"amines"},{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"functionalization"},{"word":"graphene oxide"},{"word":"synthesis"}]},"article372":{"pmid":"30216921","title":"Coal chemical reverse osmosis concentrate treatment by membrane-aerated biofilm reactor system.","abs":"Coal chemical reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC), which is characterized by high salinity and high organics, remains as a serious environmental problem.

The goal of this study was to determine whether (1) the antibiofilm property is broad (including S. aureus, another prevalent organism in cystic fibrosis); (2) the α4 region is responsible for such activity; and (3), if so, this motif could be structurally optimized as an antimicrobial peptide with enhanced activities. We used S. aureus biofilm-prevention assays to determine bacterial biomass in the presence of SPLUNC1 and SPLUNC1Δα4 recombinant proteins, or SPLUNC1-derived peptides (α4 and α4M1), using the well-established crystal-violet biofilm detection assay. The SPLUNC1Δα4 showed markedly reduced biofilm prevention compared to the parent protein. Surprisingly, the 30-residue long α4 motif alone demonstrated minimal biofilm prevention activities. However, structural optimization of the α4 motif resulted in a modified peptide (α4M1) with significantly enhanced antibiofilm properties against methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus, including six different clinical strains of MRSA and the well-known USA300. Hemolytic activity was undetectable at up to 100μM for the peptides.

The pyrophosphorylase encoded by galU plays a role in the UDP-glucose metabolism of prokaryotes and is required for the biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharides. In this paper, the effect of a galU mutation leading to a dysfunctional UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDPG:PP) on in vitro biofilm biomass, adherence to lung epithelial cells and macrophage phagocytosis is studied. Last, in vivo virulence using a Galleria mellonella model has been studied. We show that the mutation improves streptococcal adherence to epithelial cells and macrophage phagocytosis in vitro, while there is no definitive correlation on biofilm formation between parent and mutant strains. Moreover, in vivo virulence is attenuated for all mutated strains. Together, these results demonstrate that a galU mutation in S. pneumoniae influences host cell interactions in vitro and in vivo and can strongly influence the outcome of a streptococcal infection.

Quorum sensing (QS) enables bacteria to communicate with one another and by doing so they can modulate their behavior in a cell-density dependent manner. In bacteria, quorum sensing molecules (QSMs) are known to control several factors such as virulence factor production, antibiotic production, biofilm formation, and gene regulation. Herein, we demonstrate the applicability of whole cell biosensing systems for the early identification of food contamination via detection of QSMs. Additionally, we have developed a portable system for detection of bacterial contamination using microdots of immobilized whole cell-based biosensors on paper that boast nanomolar level detection of QSMs in two different food matrices, namely beef and milk.

These communities can build up in a variety of different environments from industrial equipment to medical devices resulting in damage, loss of productivity and disease. They also have great potential for economic and societal benefits as bioremediation agents and renewable energy sources. The great potential benefits and threats of biofilms has encouraged researchers across disciplines to study biofilm characteristics and antibiofilm strategies resulting in chemists, physicists, material scientists, and engineers, to develop beneficial biofilm applications and prevention methods. The ultimate outcome is a wealth of knowledge and innovative technology. However, without extensive formal training in microbes and biofilm research, these scientists find a daunting array of established techniques for growing, quantifying and characterizing biofilms while trying to design experiments and develop innovative laboratory protocols. This mini-review focuses on enriching interdisciplinary efforts and understanding by overviewing a variety of quantitative and qualitative biofilm characterization methods to assist the novice researcher in assay selection. This review consists of four parts. Part 1 is a brief overview of biofilms and the unique properties that demand a highly interdisciplinary approach. Part 2 describes the classical quantification techniques including colony forming unit (CFU) counting and crystal violet staining, but also introduces some modern methods including ATP bioluminescence and quartz crystal microbalance. Part 3 focuses on the characterization of biofilm morphology and chemistry including scanning electron microscopy and spectroscopic methods.

The objective of this study is to understand how marine bacteria isolated from biofilms in the Mediterranean Sea interact and compete with each other when cultivated in multispecies biofilms. Four strains (Persicivirga mediterranea TC4, Polaribacter sp. TC5, Shewanella sp.

Here, the results show that these strains displayed a different capacity to form a biofilm in static versus dynamic conditions where one strain, TC11, was highly susceptible to the flux. These bacteria appeared to be specialized in the secretion of one or two exopolymers. Only TC5 seemed to secrete inhibitory molecule(s) in its supernatant, with a significant effect on TC10. Most of the strains negatively impacted each other, except TC4 and TC10, which presented a synergetic effect in the two and three species biofilms. Interestingly, these two strains produced a newly secreted compound when grown in dual-species versus mono-species biofilms. TC5, which induced a strong inhibition on two of its partners in dual-species biofilms, outfitted the other bacteria in a four-species biofilm. Therefore, understanding how bacteria respond to interspecific interactions should help comprehending the dynamics of bacterial populations in their ecological niches.","authors":[{"name":"Richard Guillonneau"},{"name":"Claudine Baraquet"},{"name":"Alexis Bazire"},{"name":"Maëlle Molmeret"}],"keywords":[{"word":"competition"},{"word":"marine bacteria"},{"word":"matrix components"},{"word":"multispecies biofilm"},{"word":"synergy"}]},"article383":{"pmid":"30214202","title":"Chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol nanoscale liquid film-forming system facilitates MRSA-infected wound healing by enhancing antibacterial and antibiofilm properties.","abs":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most predominant and fatal pathogens at wound infection sites.

The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of ultrasonic scaling and LTD on the surface properties of 3Y-TZP in relation to bacterial adhesion on the treated surface. 3Y-TZP specimens (4 × 4 × 2 mm) were polished and then subjected to autoclaving at 134°C for 100 h to induce LTD, followed by 10 rounds of ultrasonic scaling using a steel scaler tip for 1 min each. Surface roughness, crystalline structure, wettability, and hardness were analyzed by optical interferometry, X-ray diffraction analysis, contact angle measurement, and nano-indentation technique, respectively. Subsequently, bacterial adhesion onto the treated 3Y-TZP surface was evaluated using Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis. The results demonstrated that the combination of ultrasonic scaling and LTD significantly increased the Sa value (surface roughness parameter) of the polished 3Y-TZP surface from 1.6 nm to 117 nm. LTD affected the crystalline structure, causing phase transformation from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase, and decreased both the contact angle and surface hardness. However, bacterial adhesion was not influenced by these changes in surface properties.

A detailed understanding of how flexibility and constraint shape bacterial two component signaling systems is emerging, but how new signal transduction architectures arise remains unclear. Here, we investigate pathway remodeling using the Firmicute sporulation initiation (Spo0) pathway as a model. The present-day Spo0 pathways in Bacilli and Clostridia share common ancestry, but possess different architectures. In Clostridium acetobutylicum, sensor kinases directly phosphorylate Spo0A, the master regulator of sporulation. In Bacillus subtilis, Spo0A is activated via a four-protein phosphorelay. The current view favors an ancestral direct phosphorylation architecture, with the phosphorelay emerging in the Bacillar lineage. Our results reject this hypothesis. Our analysis of 84 broadly distributed Firmicute genomes predicts phosphorelays in numerous Clostridia, contrary to the expectation that the Spo0 phosphorelay is unique to Bacilli. Our experimental verification of a functional Spo0 phosphorelay encoded by Desulfotomaculum acetoxidans (Class Clostridia) further supports functional phosphorelays in Clostridia, which strongly suggests that the ancestral Spo0 pathway was a phosphorelay. Cross complementation assays between Bacillar and Clostridial phosphorelays demonstrate conservation of interaction specificity since their divergence over 2.7 BYA. Further, the distribution of direct phosphorylation Spo0 pathways is patchy, suggesting multiple, independent instances of remodeling from phosphorelay to direct phosphorylation.

We conclude that flexible encoding of interaction specificity, a phenotype that is only intermittently essential, and the recruitment of kinases to recognize novel environmental signals resulted in a consistent and repeated pattern of remodeling of the Spo0 pathway.","authors":[{"name":"Philip Davidson"},{"name":"Rory Eutsey"},{"name":"Brendan Redler"},{"name":"N Luisa Hiller"},{"name":"Michael T Laub"},{"name":"Dannie Durand"}],"keywords":[]},"article394":{"pmid":"30212364","title":"Is PASH Syndrome a Biofilm Disease?: A Case Series and Review of the Literature.","abs":"When occurring together, pyoderma gangrenosum, severe acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa have been described as PASH syndrome.

C. albicans readily forms biofilms on various biotic and abiotic surfaces, and these biofilms can cause local and systemic infections. C. albicans biofilms are more resistant than its free yeast to antifungal agents and less affected by host immune responses. Transition of yeast cells to hyphal cells is required for biofilm formation and is believed to be a crucial virulence factor. In this study, six components of ginger were investigated for antibiofilm and antivirulence activities against a fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strain. It was found 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, and 6-shogaol effectively inhibited biofilm formation. In particular, 6-shogaol at 10 μg/ml significantly reduced C. albicans biofilm formation but had no effect on planktonic cell growth. Also, 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol inhibited hyphal growth in embedded colonies and free-living planktonic cells, and prevented cell aggregation. Furthermore, 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol reduced C. albicans virulence in a nematode infection model without causing toxicity at the tested concentrations. Transcriptomic analysis using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR showed 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol induced several transporters (CDR1, CDR2, and RTA3), but repressed the expressions of several hypha/biofilm related genes (ECE1 and HWP1), which supported observed phenotypic changes.

Here we demonstrate a straightforward and efficient approach to form a macroporous bacterial cellulose foam by foaming a mannitol-based media with a bacterial suspension of Gluconoacetobacter xylinus. The bacterial suspension foam is stabilized with Cremodan as a surfactant and viscosified with Xanthan preventing water drainage. Further foam stabilization occurs through cellulose formation across the foam network. As bacterial cellulose formation is influenced by the viscosity of the growth media, we fine-tuned the concentration of Xanthan to allow for bacterial cellulose formation while avoiding water drainage caused by gravity. With this simple approach, we were able to design 3D bacterial cellulose foams without any additional processing steps. We argue that this templating approach can further be used to design foamy biofilms for biotechnological approaches, increasing the surface area and therefore the yield by improving the exchange of nutrients and metabolic products.","authors":[{"name":"Patrick A Rühs"},{"name":"Flavian Storz"},{"name":"Yuly A López Gómez"},{"name":"Matthias Haug"},{"name":"Peter Fischer"}],"keywords":[]},"article400":{"pmid":"30210803","title":"GePMI: A statistical model for personal intestinal microbiome identification.","abs":"Human gut microbiomes consist of a large number of microbial genomes, which vary by diet and health conditions and from individual to individual.

The mechanisms of biofilm formation and stress resistance, however, remain ambiguous. By analyzing biofilm and planktonic cell transcriptomes, this study observed that MIG1 (encoding a transcription factor) expression in cells increases during the biofilm formation process. To identify the role of MIG1 in yeast biofilm formation and the ethanol resistance of these cells, MIG1 was deleted and complemented in S. cerevisiae 1308. Results showed the MIG1 deletion mutant strain demonstrated weaker biofilm formation ability both on fibers and plastic than the wild-type and these could be restored by expressing MIG1 in deletion mutant. To verify the ability of MIG1 to regulate the expression of FLO genes, which encode adhesions responsible for yeast biofilm formation, FLO gene transcription levels were measured via qRT-PCR. Relative to wild-type S. cerevisiae, the adhesion genes FLO1, 5, and 9 which also demonstrate increased expression in the transcriptome of yeast cells during biofilm formation, but not FLO11, were down-regulated in the MIG1 mutant strain. Additionally, the MIG1 mutant lost a majority of its flocculation ability, which depended on cell-cell adhesions and its slightly invasive growth ability, dependent on cell-substrate adhesion. Deleting FLO1, 5, and 9 decreased biofilm formation on plastics, suggesting these FLO genes contribute to the biofilm formation process alongside FLO11. Moreover, the ethanol tolerance of yeast decreased in the MIG1 deletion mutant as well as the FLO11 deletion mutant, resulting in reduced biofilm formation during fermentation. It remains possible that in the later period of fermentation, when ethanol has accumulated, an over-expression of the FLO1, 5, and 9 genes regulated by MIG1 would enhanced cell-cell adhesions and thus protect cells in the outer layer of biofilms from ethanol, a function primarily dependent on cell-cell adhesions. This work offers a possible explanation for how biofilm formation is regulated during the immobilized fermentation process, and can enhance environmental tolerance in industrial production.","authors":[{"name":"Leyun Yang"},{"name":"Cheng Zheng"},{"name":"Yong Chen"},{"name":"Hanjie Ying"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"ethanol resistance"},{"word":"flocculation genes"},{"word":"transcription factor MIG1"}]},"article405":{"pmid":"30209945","title":"Label-Free Proteomic Approach to Characterize Protease-Dependent and -Independent Effects of sarA Inactivation on the Staphylococcus aureus Exoproteome.","abs":"The staphylococcal accessory regulator A ( sarA) impacts the extracellular accumulation of Staphylococcus aureus virulence factors at the level of intracellular production and extracellular protease-mediated degradation.

Our previous approach was limited as it did not take into account that large, stable proteolytic products from a given protein could result in false negatives when quantified by total proteoforms. Here, our goal was to use an expanded proteomics approach utilizing a dual quantitative method for measuring abundance at both the total proteoform and full-length exoprotein levels to alleviate these false negatives and thereby provide for characterization of protease-dependent and -independent effects of sarA mutation on the S. aureus exoproteome.

However, the bacterial responses to nutrient restriction that impact intracellular fate and survival of NTHI are unknown. In this work, we provide evidence for the role of transient heme-iron restriction in promoting the formation of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) of NTHI both in vitro and in vivo in a preclinical model of OM. We show that transient heme-iron restriction of NTHI results in significantly increased invasion and intracellular populations that escape or evade the endolysosomal pathway for increased intracellular survival. In contrast, NTHI continuously exposed to heme-iron traffics through the endolysosomal pathway for degradation. The use of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that prior heme-iron status does not appear to influence NTHI internalization through endocytic pathways. However, inhibition of macropinocytosis altered the intracellular fate of transiently restricted NTHI for degradation in the endolysosomal pathway. Furthermore, prevention of macropinocytosis significantly reduced the number of IBCs in cultured middle ear epithelial cells, providing evidence for the feasibility of this approach to reduce OM persistence.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses showed successful attachment of both nisin and lysozyme onto the SNCC. The efficacy of the conjugated nanocellulose against the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus was tested in terms of bacterial growth, cell viability, and biofilm formation/removal. The results show that the minimum inhibitory concentration of the conjugated nanocellulose is higher than that of lysozyme and nisin in free form, which was expected given that immobilization reduces the possible spatial orientations of these proteins. We observed that free nisin is not active against S. aureus after 24 h of exposure due to either deactivation of free nisin or development of resistance in S. aureus against free nisin. Interestingly, we did not observe this phenomenon when the bacteria were exposed to antibacterials immobilized on nanocellulose, suggesting that immobilization of antibacterial agents onto SNCC effectively retains their activity over long time periods.

Recently, biofilms and quorum sensing (QS) have been suggested as important factors in the deterioration of milk, which opens new avenues for investigation of the processes and challenges. Production and heat stability of enzymes are enhanced in biofilms, mainly because of inherent differences in physiological states and protective shielding by extracellular polymeric substances. QS plays a key role in modulating expression of hydrolytic enzymes and biofilm formation.

Sputum from patients with CF has been shown to contain oxic and hypoxic subzones as well as millimolar concentrations of lactate. Here, we describe the physiological roles and expression patterns of P. aeruginosa lactate dehydrogenases in the contexts of different growth regimes. P. aeruginosa produces four enzymes annotated as lactate dehydrogenases, three of which are known to contribute to anaerobic or aerobic metabolism in liquid cultures. These three are LdhA, which reduces pyruvate to d-lactate during anaerobic survival, and LldE and LldD, which oxidize d-lactate and l-lactate, respectively, during aerobic growth. We demonstrate that the fourth enzyme, LldA, performs redundant l-lactate oxidation during growth in aerobic cultures in both a defined MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid)-based medium and synthetic CF sputum media. However, LldA differs from LldD in that its expression is induced specifically by the l-enantiomer of lactate. We also show that the P. aeruginosa lactate dehydrogenases perform functions in colony biofilms that are similar to their functions in liquid cultures. Finally, we provide evidence that the enzymes LdhA and LldE have the potential to support metabolic cross-feeding in biofilms, where LdhA can catalyze the production of d-lactate in the anaerobic zone, which is then used as a substrate in the aerobic zone. Together, these observations further our understanding of the metabolic pathways that can contribute to P. aeruginosa growth and survival during CF lung infection.","authors":[{"name":"Yu-Cheng Lin"},{"name":"William Cole Cornell"},{"name":"Jeanyoung Jo"},{"name":"Alexa Price-Whelan"},{"name":"Lars E P Dietrich"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"lactate isomers"},{"word":"pyruvate"},{"word":"pyruvate fermentation"}]},"article425":{"pmid":"30205468","title":"Antimicrobial Photodynamic Inactivation Mediated by Rose Bengal and Erythrosine Is Effective in the Control of Food-Related Bacteria in Planktonic and Biofilm States.","abs":"The thermal and chemical-based methods applied for microbial control in the food industry are not always environmentally friendly and may change the nutritional and organoleptic characteristics of the final products.

Both photosensitizing agents were able to control planktonic cells of all bacteria tested.

Although higher concentrations of the photosensitizing agents (ranging from 0.01 to 50.0 μmol/L) were needed to be applied, the culturability of biofilm cells was reduced to undetectable levels. This finding was confirmed by the live/dead staining, where propidium iodide-labeled bacteria numbers reached up to 100%.

Its transition between host-associated and environmental lifestyles involves the tight regulation of niche-specific phenotypes such as motility, biofilm formation, and virulence. V. cholerae's transition from the host to environmental dispersal usually involves suppression of virulence and dispersion of biofilm communities. In contrast to this naturally occurring transition, bacterial aggregation by cationic polymers triggers a unique response, which is to suppress virulence gene expression while also triggering biofilm formation by V. cholerae, an artificial combination of traits that is potentially very useful to bind and neutralize the pathogen from contaminated water. Here, we set out to uncover the mechanistic basis of this polymer-triggered bacterial behavior. We found that bacteria-polymer aggregates undergo rapid autoinduction and achieve quorum sensing at bacterial densities far below those required for autoinduction in the absence of polymers. We demonstrate this induction of quorum sensing is due both to a rapid formation of autoinducer gradients and local enhancement of autoinducer concentrations within bacterial clusters as well as the stimulation of CAI-1 and AI-2 production by aggregated bacteria. We further found that polymers cause an induction of the biofilm-specific regulator VpsR and the biofilm structural protein RbmA, bypassing the usual suppression of biofilm during autoinduction. Overall, this study highlights that synthetic materials can be used to cross-wire natural bacterial responses to achieve a combination of phenotypes with potentially useful applications.","authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Perez-Soto"},{"name":"Oliver Creese"},{"name":"Francisco Fernandez-Trillo"},{"name":"Anne-Marie Krachler"}],"keywords":[]},"article429":{"pmid":"30204158","title":"CDy14: a novel biofilm probe targeting exopolysaccharide Psl.","abs":"Detection of biofilm bacteria would be an ideal method for the physicians to diagnose chronic bacterial infections directly, but there are few imaging probes available so far.

Antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) respiratory pathogens were analysed and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined. Furthermore, the time-killing assay illustrated that the metabolite eliminates 50% of the vegetative cells within few hours of the treatment. From the spectral data, the major functional groups present in the compound were determined as carbonyl group and phenolic hydroxyl group which contribute towards its bioactivity.

In this study, the structuring of bacterial communities in black and red epilithic biofilm in the Acquarossa river has been investigated with both culture dependent and independent approaches.

The chemical characterization of both river water and biofilms revealed a substantial heavy metals pollution of the environment; heavy metals were also differentially accumulated in red and black epilithons. Overall, our data revealed that the structuring of red and black epilithons might be affected mainly by the antagonistic interactions exhibited by bacterial genera dominating the two biofilms.

Phenotypic characterization of ad hoc engineered strains and in silico molecular docking demonstrated that the antifungal drugs clotrimazole and miconazole, as well as an antibacterial compound active against Gram-positive pathogens, clofoctol, inhibit the pqs system, probably by targeting the transcriptional regulator PqsR. The most active inhibitor, clofoctol, specifically inhibited the expression of pqs-controlled virulence traits in P. aeruginosa, such as pyocyanin production, swarming motility, biofilm formation, and expression of genes involved in siderophore production. Moreover, clofoctol protected Galleria mellonella larvae from P. aeruginosa infection and inhibited the pqs QS system in P. aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients.
