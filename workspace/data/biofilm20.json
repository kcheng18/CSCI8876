Previous studies have shown that the genes encoding the two-component system PhoPR, which regulates several genes involved in the virulence of M. tuberculosis, are polymorphic in M. bovis, when compared to M. tuberculosis, which results in a dysfunctional two-component system. In this study we investigated the role of PhoPR in two M. bovis strains with differing degrees of virulence. We found that the deletion of phoP in an M. bovis isolate reduced its capacity of inducing phagosomal arrest in bovine macrophages. By gene expression analysis, we demonstrated that, in both M. bovis strains, PhoP regulates the expression of a putative lipid desaturase Mb1404-Mb1405, a protein involved in redox stress AhpC, the sulfolipid transporter Mmpl8 and the secreted antigen ESAT-6. Furthermore, the lack of PhoP increased the sensitivity to acidic stress and alteration of the biofilm/pellicle formation of M. bovis. Both these phenotypes are connected to bacterial redox homeostasis. Therefore, the results of this study suggest a role of PhoPR in M. bovis to be linked to the mechanisms that mycobacteria display to maintain their redox balance.","authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth A García"},{"name":"Federico C Blanco"},{"name":"María M Bigi"},{"name":"Cristina L Vazquez"},{"name":"Marina A Forrellad"},{"name":"Rosana V Rocha"},{"name":"Paul Golby"},{"name":"Marcelo A Soria"},{"name":"Fabiana Bigi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Gene expression"},{"word":"Mycobacterium bovis"},{"word":"PhoPR"},{"word":"Two-component system"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"30080666","title":"Biofilm formation and avian immune response following experimental acute and chronic avian cholera due to Pasteurella multocida.","abs":"Pasteurella multocida is the causative agent of avian cholera, an important economic and ecological disease that can present as a peracute, acute, chronic, or asymptomatic infection. Acute avian cholera is associated with encapsulated P. multocida, while chronic and asymptomatic cases of avian cholera may be associated with capsule-deficient P. multocida isolates. We hypothesize that biofilm formation is also associated with chronic and asymptomatic avian cholera. Experimental infections of chickens with encapsulated, biofilm-deficient P. multocida strain X73, proficient biofilm forming P. multocida strain X73ΔhyaD, and proficient biofilm forming clinical strains 775 and 756 showed that virulence was inversely correlated with biofilm formation. Biofilm-proficient isolates induced chronic avian cholera in the chicken host. Histopathological analysis was used to show that biofilm-proficient isolates induced little inflammation in the lungs, heart, and liver, while biofilm-deficient isolates induced greater inflammation and induced the recruitment of heterophil granulocytes. Putative biofilm matrix material and exopolysaccharide was detected in pulmonary tissue of chickens diagnosed with chronic avian cholera using scanning electron microscopy and a fluorescently-tagged lectin, respectively, supporting a role for biofilm in chronic avian cholera. P. multocida induced Th1 and Th17 immune responses during acute and chronic avian cholera, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR of splenic cytokine genes. Chickens that succumbed to acute avian cholera after experimental challenge with strain X73 had high levels of INF-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12A, IL-22, IL-17A, and IL-17RA expressed in the spleen compared to all other experimental groups. Birds infected with capsule-deficient strains had chronic infections lasting 7 days or longer, and had increased levels of IL-17RA, CCR6, and IL-16 compared to non-infected control chickens. However, specific antibody titers increased only transiently to capsule-deficient strains and were low, indicating that antibodies are less important in managing and clearing P. multocida infections.","authors":[{"name":"Briana Petruzzi"},{"name":"Rami A Dalloul"},{"name":"Tanya LeRoith"},{"name":"Nicholas P Evans"},{"name":"F William Pierson"},{"name":"Thomas J Inzana"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Avian cholera"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Immune response"},{"word":"Pasteurella multocida"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"30080659","title":"Acute toxicity and antimicrobial activity of leaf tincture Baccharis trimera (Less).","abs":"The present study aimed to evaluate the possible acute oral toxicity of Baccharistrimera leaf dye as well as its antimicrobial activity.","authors":[{"name":"Andreia Regina Haas da Silva"},{"name":"Leonardo Quintana Soares Lopes"},{"name":"Gabriela Buzatti Cassanego"},{"name":"Patrícia Romualdo de Jesus"},{"name":"Kássia Caroline Figueredo"},{"name":"Roberto Christ Vianna Santos"},{"name":"Gilberti Helena Hübscher Lopes"},{"name":"Liliane de Freitas Bauermann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"Carqueja"},{"word":"Medicinal plants"},{"word":"Toxicity"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"30080406","title":"Membrane Distillation Biofouling: Impact of Feedwater Temperature on Biofilm Characteristics and Membrane Performance.","abs":"Membrane distillation (MD) is a temperature driven membrane separation technology that holds great potential for decentralized and sustainable wastewater treatment systems. Yet, similarly to all membrane based systems, microbial fouling (biofouling) might be a critical hurdle for MD wastewater treatment applications. In this study we determined the impact of increasing feedwater temperatures (47 °C, 55 °C, and 65 °C) on biofilm growth and MD performance via dynamic biofouling experiments with Anoxybacillus sp. as a model bacterium. Our results indicated that cell growth was reduced at 47 °C, resulting in moderate distillate water flux decline (30%). Differently, extensive growth of Anoxybacillus sp. at feedwater temperature of 55 °C caused severe distillate water flux decline (78%). Additionally, biofouling induced membrane wetting, which facilitated the passage of bacteria cells and endospores through the membrane structure into the distillate. Although bacterial growth was impaired at feedwater temperatures of 65 °C, excessive production of EPS (compared to bacterial abundance) crippled membrane separation due to severe pore wetting. These results underline the importance of optimized operating conditions and development of antibiofouling and antiwetting membranes for successful implementation of MD in wastewater treatment with high biofouling propensity.","authors":[{"name":"Anne Bogler"},{"name":"Edo Bar-Zeev"}],"keywords":[]},"article4":{"pmid":"30079982","title":"Feedback regulation of Caulobacter crescentus holdfast synthesis by flagellum assembly via the holdfast inhibitor HfiA.","abs":"To permanently attach to surfaces, Caulobacter crescentusproduces a strong adhesive, the holdfast. The timing of holdfast synthesis is developmentally regulated by cell cycle cues. When C. crescentusis grown in a complex medium, holdfast synthesis can also be stimulated by surface sensing, in which swarmer cells rapidly synthesize holdfast in direct response to surface contact. In contrast to growth in complex medium, here we show that when cells are grown in a defined medium, surface contact does not trigger holdfast synthesis. Moreover, we show that in a defined medium, flagellum synthesis and regulation of holdfast production are linked. In these conditions, mutants lacking a flagellum attach to surfaces over time more efficiently than either wild-type strains or strains harboring a paralyzed flagellum. Enhanced adhesion in mutants lacking flagellar components is due to premature holdfast synthesis during the cell cycle and is regulated by the holdfast synthesis inhibitor HfiA. hfiA transcription is reduced in flagellar mutants and this reduction is modulated by the diguanylate cyclase developmental regulator PleD. We also show that, in contrast to previous predictions, flagella are not necessarily required for C. crescentus surface sensing in the absence of flow, and that arrest of flagellar rotation does not stimulate holdfast synthesis. Rather, our data support a model in which flagellum assembly feeds back to control holdfast synthesis via HfiA expression in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner under defined nutrient conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Cécile Berne"},{"name":"Courtney K Ellison"},{"name":"Radhika Agarwal"},{"name":"Geoffrey B Severin"},{"name":"Aretha Fiebig"},{"name":"Robert I Morton"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"Yves V Brun"}],"keywords":[]},"article5":{"pmid":"30079549","title":"A two-way road: novel roles for fungal extracellular vesicles.","abs":"The biological functions of fungal extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes have been mostly determined on the basis of the assumption that they are vehicles of trans-cell wall transport and molecular export.

To illustrate this novel view, we discuss (i) the uptake of plant EVs by phytopathogenic fungi culminating in growth defects and virulence attenuation, (ii) the influence of EV internalization in prion transmission and biofilm formation in yeast cells, and (iii) the EV-mediated transfer of virulence in isolates of Cryptococcus gattii.

Using elevated specific conductance (SC) in stream water as an indicator of mining influence, we evaluated relationships between SC and Se concentrations in macroinvertebrates and examined dynamics of Se bioaccumulation in headwater streams. Twenty-three Appalachian streams were categorized into 3 stream types based on SC measurements: 1) reference streams with no coal-mining history; 2) mining-influenced, high-SC streams; and 3) mining-influenced, low-SC streams. Selenium concentrations in macroinvertebrates exhibited strong positive associations with both SC and dissolved Se concentrations in stream water. At 3 streams of each type, we further collected water, particulate matter (sediment, biofilm, leaf detritus), and macroinvertebrates and analyzed them for Se during 2 seasons. Enrichment, trophic transfer, and bioaccumulation factors were calculated and compared among stream types. Particulate matter and macroinvertebrates in mining-influenced streams accumulated high Se concentrations relative to reference streams. Concentrations were found at levels indicating Se to be a potential environmental stressor to aquatic life. Most Se enrichment, trophic transfer, and bioaccumulation factors were independent of season. Enrichment factors for biofilm and sediments and bioaccumulation factors for macroinvertebrate predators varied negatively with water-column Se.

Our aim was to determine if S. epidermidis remains susceptible to antibiotics when adhering to udPEG, and if udPEG coatings can improve the treatment outcome for implant-associated infections. We tested the in vitro efficacy of vancomycin treatment on recently adhered S. epidermidis AUH4567 on udPEG, conventional PEG or titanium surfaces using live/dead staining and microscopy. udPEG was then applied to titanium implants and inserted subcutaneously in mice and inoculated with S. epidermidis to induce infection. Mice were given antibiotic prophylaxis or a short antibiotic treatment. One group was given immunosuppressive therapy. After five days, implants and surrounding tissue were harvested for CFU enumeration. Only few S. epidermidis cells adhered to udPEG compared to conventional PEG and uncoated titanium, and a much lower fraction of cells on udPEG survived antibiotic treatment in vitro. In vivo, the bacterial load on implants in mice receiving vancomycin treatment was significantly lower on udPEG-coated compared to uncoated implants, also in neutropenic mice. Our results suggest that the improved outcome results from the coating's anti-adhesive properties that leads to less biofilm and increased efficacy of antibiotic treatment.

A comprehensive understanding of different strategies and mechanisms has fundamental significance for the antifouling membrane development. In this study, thin-film composite (TFC) FO membranes were modified with polydopamine (PDA) coating as a passive antibacterial moiety and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as an active antibacterial moiety. Their anti-biofouling performances were investigated both in static and dynamic conditions. In static exposure, the PDA-coated membranes exhibited great passive anti-adhesive property, and the Ag-NP-generated membranes presented both of excellent passive anti-adhesive properties and active antibacterial performance. While in dynamic cross-flow running conditions, Ag NPs effectively mitigated the membrane water flux decline due to their inhibition of biofilm growth, the PDA coating failed because of its inability to inactivate the attached bacteria growth. Moreover, Ag NPs were stable and active on membrane surfaces after 24 h of cross-flow operation. These findings provide new insights into the performances and mechanisms of passive and active moieties in the FO process.","authors":[{"name":"Longbin Qi"},{"name":"Yunxia Hu"},{"name":"Zhongyun Liu"},{"name":"Xiaochan An"},{"name":"Edo Bar-Zeev"}],"keywords":[]},"article28":{"pmid":"30074210","title":"Alternative Oxidase Promotes Biofilm Formation of Candida albicans.","abs":"This study was designed to analyze the effect of the mitochondrial respiratory pathways of Candida albicans (C. albicans) on the biofilm formation.

The expression of adhesion-related genes BCR1, ALS1, ALS3, ECE1 and HWP1 in the biofilms formed by the above five C. albicans strains was detected by real time polymerase chain reaction. It was found that the metabolic activity of biofilms formed by C. albicans was decreased in the presence of alternative oxidase inhibitor whereas it was increased in the presence of classical mitochondrial respiratory pathway complex HI or complex IV inhibitor.

In the United States, prevalence of MRSA in CF is around 27%, but is much lower (3-18%) in most other countries. Methicillin is typically genetically encoded by the mecA gene, which encodes for an alternative penicillin binding protein (PRBa). This PRBa has low affinity to β-lactams, thereby enabling growth of S. aureus in the presence of penicillinase resistant penicillins and most other β-lactams. Non-mecA positive strains of MRSA, so-called borderline resistant (BORSA) have also been described. In addition to production of toxins, the virulence of S. aureus is conferred by its adaptability allowing persistence in face of antibiotic therapies and host defense. These adaptive growth mechanisms include small colony variants, biofilms, and growth under anaerobic conditions. Several reports have described successful eradication of MRSA, yet only two randomized trials of eradication during early infection have been conducted. A list of MRSA specific antibiotics with dosing relevant to CF patients is presented here. Many of these require special dosing in people with CF. Novel antibiotics are in trials for skin and soft tissue infections and it is unclear if and when those might be available for lung infections. Thus the best strategies for MRSA would be primary prevention.","authors":[{"name":"Nour Akil"},{"name":"Marianne S Muhlebach"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BORSA"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"outcomes"},{"word":"treatment"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article31":{"pmid":"30073749","title":"Deciphering the functions of the outer membrane porin OprBXo involved in virulence, motility, exopolysaccharide production, biofilm formation and stress tolerance in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.","abs":"Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a Gram-negative bacterium causing bacterial leaf blight disease in rice.

OprBXo shows high homology with OprB, which has been well characterized as a carbohydrate-selective porin in X. citri ssp. citri and Pseudomonas species. However, the functions of OprBXo in Xoo have not yet been documented.

We found that the virulence and migration of Xoo(OprBXo), but not XooΔoprBXo(EV), were markedly reduced in rice. To postulate the mechanisms affected by OprBXo, comparative proteomic analysis was performed. Based on the results of proteomics, we employed diverse phenotypic assays to characterize the functions of OprBXo. Abnormal twitching motility and reduction in swarming motility were observed in Xoo(OprBXo). Moreover, Xoo(OprBXo) decreased, but XooΔoprBXo(EV) enhanced, exopolysaccharide production and biofilm formation. The chemotactic ability of XooΔoprBXo(EV) was dramatically lower than that of Xoo(EV) in the presence of glucose and xylose. Xoo(OprBXo) was resistant to sodium dodecylsulphate and hydrogen peroxide, but XooΔoprBXo(EV) was highly sensitive compared with Xoo(EV).

Recent studies have shown that microbial biofilms can serve as an important biotic component for partitioning and perhaps storage of ENPs released into aqueous systems. Considering that biofilms can be one of the major sinks for ENPs in the environment, and that the field of biofilms itself is only three to four decades old, there is a recent and growing body of literature investigating the ENP-biofilm interactions. While looking at biofilms, it is imperative to consider the interactions of ENPs with the planktonic microbial cells inhabiting the bulk systems in the vicinity of surface-attached biofilms.

The effects of supplementation of broiler chicken diets with pea meal, carbohydrase enzymes and a probiotic were investigated for potential performance improvement. 2. Raw or extruded pea meal (cv Model, grown in Poland) was included in a wheat-soybean meal-based diet at 250 g/kg. The diets were unsupplemented (control) or supplemented with either carbohydrase enzymes (200 U/kg xylanase and 10 U/kg β-glucanase in feed) or a probiotic (Bacillus subtilis), or both. The diets were fed to Ross 308 broilers aged 9-28 days. 3. After two additional days, chick gastrointestinal tracts were excised and analysed for the presence of Bacillus subtilis biofilm; and the ileal and caecal digesta were analysed for bacterial enzyme activities and to determine the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). 4. Feeding the pea-based diet supplemented with the probiotic compromised feed utilisation, due to higher feed intake. The addition of enzymes to the raw, but not the extruded, pea containing diet partially ameliorated this effect (pea form × additives; P < 0.002). 5. In the ileal digesta, interactions between the dietary treatments were observed for the activities of all bacterial glycolytic enzymes and for SCFA concentrations. β-glucosidase, α-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase were highest in birds fed the diet containing extruded pea supplemented with the probiotic and enzymes (pea form x additives; P = 0.018 to P < 0.006). In the caecal digesta, interactions were observed for bacterial enzyme activities, but not for total SCFA concentration.

The purpose of this study was to explore the spoilage potential of psychrotrophic bacteria from Chinese raw milk samples at both room temperature (28 °C) and refrigerated temperature (7 °C). Species of Yersinia, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Chryseobacterium showed high proteolytic activity. The highest proteolytic activity was shown by Yersinia intermedia followed by Pseudomonas fluorescens (d). Lipolytic activity was high in isolates of Acinetobacter, and the highest in Acinetobacter guillouiae. Certain isolates showed positive β-galactosidase and phospholipase activity. Strains belonging to the same species sometimes showed markedly different phenotypic characteristics. Proteases and lipases produced by psychrotrophic bacteria retained activity after heat treatment at 70, 80, or 90 °C, and proteases appeared to be more heat-stable than lipases. For these reasons, thermo-stable spoilage enzymes produced by a high number of psychrotrophic bacterial isolates from raw milk are of major concern to the dairy industry.

We used the Nd:YAP laser in an in vitro experiment to evaluate the bactericidal effect of three parameters of Nd:YAP laser-activated irrigation on biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis in root canals. The canals of 45 extracted human single-root teeth were prepared on a #35 Mtwo instrument and contaminated with E. faecalis for 14 days. Forty infected single-root teeth were then randomly divided into four groups according to the irrigation agitation protocols as follows: 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), Nd:YAP laser (180 mJ) + NaOCl, Nd:YAP laser (280 mJ) + NaOCl, and Nd:YAP laser (360 mJ) + NaOCl.

Surgical site infection (SSI) is a devastating complication of spine surgery. Unlike the gold-standard two-stage revision in North American hip and knee arthroplasty, there exists no standardized, accepted protocol for the management of deep SSI with instrumentation. Because removal of hardware in an unstable, instrumented spine can result in serious neurologic sequelae, retention of instrumentation with elimination of bacterial colonization on implants is the goal. Using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, institutional medical records were queried to identify all posterior spinal procedures performed by the senior surgeon from 2008 through 2014. Thirty-four patients were identified as having an implant-associated SSI. Exclusion criteria included: (I) superficial SSI, and (II) those with less than 36 months of follow-up. The study population consisted of ten patients with deep implant-associated SSI who underwent our novel protocol of operative debridement and permanent coating of exposed implants with high-dose antibiotic cement. Postoperative infection presented after an average of 41.4±57.5 days (range, 6.0-207.0 days) from the index procedure. The mean follow-up was 64.4±18.1 months (range, 44.0-98.0 months). At final follow-up, none of the ten patients (0%) in our series had evidence of continued deep infection and none required removal of hardware. Ten of the ten patients (100%) were able to clear infection with a single stage debridement and coating with antibiotic cement. Only 1 of the 10 patients (10%) developed a pseudarthrosis. In conclusion, permanent implantation of antibiotic cement over exposed instrumentation is effective in preserving spinal instrumentation during infection eradication, preventing infection recurrence, and minimizing operative debridements.","authors":[{"name":"Joseph L Laratta"},{"name":"Joseph M Lombardi"},{"name":"Jamal N Shillingford"},{"name":"Hemant P Reddy"},{"name":"Borys V Gvozdyev"},{"name":"Yong J Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Spine infection"},{"word":"antibiotic cement"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"instrumentation"},{"word":"polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)"}]},"article54":{"pmid":"30069474","title":"Effects of Fine Particulate Matter on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Adhesion and Biofilm Formation In Vitro.","abs":"Respiratory infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major cause of mortality and morbidity for hospitalized patients.

In this work, we fully characterized the capacity of Fur to reconfigure the global transcriptional network and influence iron homeostasis in Enterococcus faecalis. The characterization of the Fur regulon from E. faecalis indicated that this protein (Fur) regulated the expression of genes involved in iron uptake systems, conferring to the system a high level of efficiency and specificity to respond under different iron exposure conditions. An RNAseq assay coupled with a systems biology approach allowed us to identify the first global transcriptional network activated by different iron treatments (excess and limited), with and without the presence of Fur. The results showed that changes in iron availability activated a complex network of transcriptional factors in E. faecalis, among them global regulators such as LysR, ArgR, GalRS, and local regulators, LexA and CopY, which were also stimulated by copper and zinc treatments.

Certain bacteria can degrade AHL molecules by a process called quorum quenching (QQ); therefore, QQ can be used to control bacterial infections and biofilm formation. In this study, we aimed to identify new species of bacteria with QQ activity. Red Sea sediments were collected either from the close vicinity of seagrass or from areas with no vegetation. We isolated 72 bacterial strains, which were tested for their ability to degrade/inactivate AHL molecules. Chromobacterium violaceum CV026-based bioassay was used for the initial screening of isolates with QQ activity. QQ activity was further quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We found that these isolates could degrade AHL molecules of different acyl chain lengths as well as modifications. 16S-rRNA sequencing of positive QQ isolates showed that they belonged to three different genera. Specifically, two isolates belonged to the genus Erythrobacter; four, Labrenzia; and one, Bacterioplanes. The genome of one representative isolate from each genus was sequenced, and potential QQ enzymes, namely, lactonases and acylases, were identified. The ability of these isolates to degrade the 3OXOC12-AHLs produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and hence inhibit biofilm formation was investigated. Our results showed that the isolate VG12 (genus Labrenzia) is better than other isolates at controlling biofilm formation by PAO1 and degradation of different AHL molecules. Time-course experiments to study AHL degradation showed that VG1 (genus Erythrobacter) could degrade AHLs faster than other isolates. Thus, QQ bacteria or enzymes can be used in combination with an antibacterial to overcome antibiotic resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Zahid Ur Rehman"},{"name":"TorOve Leiknes"}],"keywords":[{"word":"N-acylhomoserine lactone degradation"},{"word":"Red Sea sediments"},{"word":"biofilm inhibition"},{"word":"marine bacteria"},{"word":"quorum quenching"}]},"article66":{"pmid":"30065411","title":"Quorum sensing system and influence on food spoilage in Pseudomonas fluorescens from turbot.","abs":"The spoilage of aquatic products is mainly caused by the bacterial growth, and the specific spoilage organism (SSO) plays an important role. Quorum sensing (QS) is a microbial cell-cell communication system which is coordinated with the population density, and is controlled by N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHLs) as the Gram-negative bacteria communication signals. In this study, the SSO was Pseudomonas fluorescens (PF-04), isolated from the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.) during aerobically refrigerated storage. The supernatant extract of PF-04 tested the AHLs activities utilizing biosensor Chromobacterium violaceum CV026. AHL production was influenced by the environment temperature, and AHL production reduced obviously at 10 °C compare with 25 °C. In Luria-Bertani (LB) supplemented with 0.5-1.0% NaCl, AHL production reached the maximum. The AHL production was also regulated by pH of culture medium, acidic condition was conducive to persistent existence of the AHL molecules, but the alkaline environment would cause chemically unstable of AHL molecules. QS system in P. flurosecens played an imperative role in biofilm formation, protease and siderophore production. AHLs could regulate above three factors in PF-04.

The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of NTHi has evolved a complex structure that can be attributed to a multiplicity of glycosyltransferases, the random switching of glycosyltransferase gene expression via phase variation, and the complex structure of its core region with multiple glycoform branch points. This article adds to that complexity by describing a multifunctional enzyme (LsgB) which optimally functions when the species is grown on a solid surface and which can add either a ketodeoxyoctanoate (KDO) or an N-acetylneuramic acid (Neu5Ac) moiety to a terminal N-acetyllactosamine structure of LOS. Our studies show that expression of lsgB is reduced four- to sixfold when NTHi is grown in broth. The substrate that the enzyme utilizes is dependent upon the concentration of free Neu5Ac (between 1 and 10 µg/ml) in the environment. In environments in which Neu5Ac is below that level, the enzyme utilizes endogenous CMP-KDO as the substrate. Our studies show that during in vivo growth in an NTHi biofilm, the KDO moiety is expressed by the organism. Monoclonal antibody 6E4, which binds KDO, is bactericidal for NTHi strains that express the KDO epitope at high levels. In a survey of 33 NTHi strains isolated from healthy and diseased individuals, the antibody was bactericidal (>90% kill) for 12 strains (36%).

In this study, the formation of VBNC V. cholerae induced by cold seawater exposure was investigated using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The analysis revealed that the expression of 1420 genes was changed on VBNC state formation. In the VBNC cells, genes related to biofilm formation, chitin utilization and stress responses were upregulated, whereas those related to cell division, morphology and ribosomal activity were mainly downregulated. The concurrent acquisition of a carbon source and the arrest of cell division in cells with low metabolic activity help bacteria increase their resistance to unfavourable environments. Moreover, two transcriptional regulators, SlmA and MetJ, were found to play roles in both VBNC formation and intestinal colonization, suggesting that some genes may function in both processes. This acquired knowledge will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance and may help control future cholera infections and outbreaks.","authors":[{"name":"Tingting Xu"},{"name":"Hengchun Cao"},{"name":"Wei Zhu"},{"name":"Min Wang"},{"name":"Yuhui Du"},{"name":"Zhiqiu Yin"},{"name":"Min Chen"},{"name":"Yutao Liu"},{"name":"Bin Yang"},{"name":"Bin Liu"}],"keywords":[]},"article94":{"pmid":"30057783","title":"A phenylthiazole derivative demonstrates efficacy on treatment of the cryptococcosis & candidiasis in animal models.","abs":"In this work we test 2-(2-(cyclohexylmethylene)hydrazinyl)-4-phenylthiazole (CHT) against Cryptococcus spp. and Candida albicans.","authors":[{"name":"Nívea P Sá"},{"name":"Caroline M Lima"},{"name":"Julliana R A Dos Santos"},{"name":"Marliete C Costa"},{"name":"Patrícia P de Barros"},{"name":"Juliana C Junqueira"},{"name":"Jéssica A Vaz"},{"name":"Renata B Oliveira"},{"name":"Beth B Fuchs"},{"name":"Eleftherios Mylonakis"},{"name":"Carlos A Rosa"},{"name":"Daniel A Santos"},{"name":"Susana Johann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Cryptococcus spp."},{"word":"Galleria mellonella"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"mice"},{"word":"thiazole"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article95":{"pmid":"30057719","title":"Ex vivo anti-inflammatory effects of probiotics for periodontal health.","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Tim Schmitter"},{"name":"Bernd L Fiebich"},{"name":"Joerg T Fischer"},{"name":"Max Gajfulin"},{"name":"Niklas Larsson"},{"name":"Thorsten Rose"},{"name":"Marcus R Goetz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Gingivitis"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"oral hygiene"},{"word":"probiotics"}]},"article96":{"pmid":"30057704","title":"Effects of Terminalia catappa Linn.

Our model predicts that signal transmission becomes possible when the community is organized near a critical phase transition between a disconnected and a fully connected conduit of signaling cells. By measuring population-level signal transmission with single-cell resolution in wild-type and genetically modified communities, we confirm that the spatial distribution of signaling cells is organized at the predicted phase transition.

A large portion (97%) of bacterial taxa on the surface Mastocarpus was also present in samples from the environment, indicating that macroalgal surface communities are largely assembled from the surrounding seawater. Still, changes in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa result in significantly different communities on alternate Mastocarpus life history phases, rocky substrate and seawater at all intertidal elevations. For microeukaryote assemblages, only high intertidal samples had significant differences between life history phases although sporophytes were not different from the rocky substrate at this elevation; gametophytes and sporophytes did not differ in microeukaryote communities in the mid and low zones. By sequencing three host genes, we identified three cryptic species of Mastocarpus in our data set, which co-occur in the mid-to-low intertidal zone.

Unlike Upc2, Zcf32 is poorly studied in C. albicans. Here, we examined roles played by these two related transcription factors in biofilm development and virulence of C. albicans. Our data show that the null mutants of each of Zcf32 or Upc2 form better biofilms than the wild-type suggesting that both of them negatively regulate the biofilm development. While acting as negative regulators of biofilm formation, these two transcription factors target a different set of biofilm genes. A mouse model of candidiasis reveals that zcf32/zcf32 was hypervirulent, while upc2/upc2 shows compromised virulence compared to the wild-type. Notably, the absence of Zcf32 enhances detrimental inflammation brought about by TNFα, IFNβ and IFNγ. upc2/upc2 failed to generate a similar feedback, instead demonstrated an elevated anti-inflammatory (IL4 and IL10) host response.

Here, we report on a new phenanthrene-degrading, sulfate-reducing enrichment culture, TRIP1. Genome-resolved metagenomics and strain specific cell counting with FISH and flow cytometry indicated that the culture is dominated by a microorganism belonging to the Desulfobacteraceae family (60% of the community) and sharing 93% 16S rRNA sequence similarity to the naphthalene-degrading, sulfate-reducing strain NaphS2. The anaerobic degradation pathway was studied by metabolite analyses and revealed phenanthroic acid as the major intermediate consistent with carboxylation as the initial activation reaction. Further reduced metabolites were indicative of a stepwise reduction of the ring system. We were able to measure the presumed second enzyme reaction in the pathway, phenanthroate-CoA ligase, in crude cell extracts. The reaction was specific for 2-phenanthroic acid and did not transform other isomers. The present study provides first insights into the anaerobic degradation pathways of three-ringed PAHs. The biochemical strategy follows principles known from anaerobic naphthalene degradation, including carboxylation and reduction of the aromatic ring system.","authors":[{"name":"Anne M Himmelberg"},{"name":"Thomas Brüls"},{"name":"Zahra Farmani"},{"name":"Philip Weyrauch"},{"name":"Gabriele Barthel"},{"name":"Wolfgang Schrader"},{"name":"Rainer U Meckenstock"}],"keywords":[]},"article122":{"pmid":"30051149","title":"Insulation of thin-film parylene-C/platinum probes in saline solution through encapsulation in multilayer ALD ceramic films.","abs":"The long-term electrical leakage performance of parylene-C/platinum/parylene-C (Px/Pt/Px) interconnect in saline is evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

However, further research is essential for understanding its precise biocontrol mechanisms. In this paper, we report the complete genome sequence of HY96-2 and the results of a comparative genomic analysis between different P. polymyxa strains. The complete genome size of HY96-2 was found to be 5.75 Mb and 5207 coding sequences were predicted. HY96-2 was compared with seven other P. polymyxa strains for which complete genome sequences have been published, using phylogenetic tree, pan-genome, and nucleic acid co-linearity analysis. In addition, the genes and gene clusters involved in biofilm formation, antibiotic synthesis, and systemic resistance inducer production were compared between strain HY96-2 and two other strains, namely, SC2 and E681. The results revealed that all three of the P. polymyxa strains have the ability to control plant diseases via the mechanisms of colonization (biofilm formation), antagonism (antibiotic production), and induced resistance (systemic resistance inducer production). However, the variation of the corresponding genes or gene clusters between the three strains may lead to different antimicrobial spectra and biocontrol efficacies. Two possible pathways of biofilm formation in P. polymyxa were reported for the first time after searching the KEGG database. This study provides a scientific basis for the further optimization of the field applications and quality standards of industrial microbial biopesticides based on HY96-2.

Entering the body via surgical sites and colonizing the medical devices through formation of multi-layered biofilms leads to refractory and persistent device-related infections (DRIs). Staphylococci organized in biofilms are more tolerant to antibiotics and immune responses, and thus are difficult-to-treat. The consequent morbidity and mortality, and economic losses in health care systems has strongly necessitated the need for development of new anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm-based therapeutics. In this study, we describe the biological activity of a marine sponge-derived Streptomyces sp. SBT348 extract in restraining staphylococcal growth and biofilm formation on polystyrene, glass, medically relevant titan metal, and silicone surfaces. A bioassay-guided fractionation was performed to isolate the active compound (SKC3) from the crude SBT348 extract. Our results demonstrated that SKC3 effectively inhibits the growth (MIC: 31.25 μg/ml) and biofilm formation (sub-MIC range: 1.95-<31.25 μg/ml) of S. epidermidis RP62A in vitro. Chemical characterization of SKC3 by heat and enzyme treatments, and mass spectrometry (HRMS) revealed its heat-stable and non-proteinaceous nature, and high molecular weight (1258.3 Da). Cytotoxicity profiling of SKC3 in vitro on mouse fibroblast (NIH/3T3) and macrophage (J774.1) cell lines, and in vivo on the greater wax moth larvae Galleria mellonella revealed its non-toxic nature at the effective dose. Transcriptome analysis of SKC3 treated S. epidermidis RP62A has further unmasked its negative effect on central metabolism such as carbon flux as well as, amino acid, lipid, and energy metabolism.

Development of an appropriate in vitro model to assess prevention of biofilm formation by antimicrobial coatings and biomaterials requires a profound understanding of the biofilm composition, including the involved microbiota. This work describes an analytical pipeline for the extraction of native biofilms from ureteral stents for both cultivation-dependent and -independent analysis, involving a novel mechanical abrasion method of passing stent samples through a tapered pinhole. The efficiency of this novel method was evaluated by quantifying the removed biofilm mass, numbers of cultivable bacteria, calcium content, and microscopic stent analysis after biofilm removal using 30 clinical stent samples. Furthermore, the extraction of in vitro formed Escherichia coli biofilms was evaluated by universal 16S quantitative PCR, a cultivation-independent method to demonstrate efficient biofilm removal by the new approach.

Biofilms often contain proteins, and an 18-kDa protein called small basic protein (Sbp) recently was discovered in the S. epidermidis biofilm matrix and may serve as a scaffolding protein in both polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA)-dependent and accumulation-associated protein (Aap)-dependent biofilm formations. In Aap-mediated biofilm formation, Sbp colocalizes with Domain-B of Aap, implying that Sbp directly interacts with Aap's Domain-B. However, the structure of Sbp and its interaction with Aap, as well as the molecular mechanism underlying Sbp's roles in biofilm formation, are incompletely understood. In this work, we used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), NMR, analytical size-exclusion chromatography, and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses to determine the Sbp structure and characterize its interaction with Aap's Domain-B. We found that Sbp is monomeric and partially folded in solution, and, unexpectedly, we observed no direct interactions between Sbp and Aap Domain-B. Instead, we noted that Sbp forms amyloid fibrils both in vitro and in vivo Atomic force, transmission electron, and confocal fluorescence microscopy methods confirmed the formation of Sbp amyloid fibrils and revealed their morphology. Taken together, the Sbp amyloid fibril structures identified here may account for Sbp's role as a scaffolding protein in the S. epidermidis biofilm matrix.","authors":[{"name":"Yan Wang"},{"name":"Jingbo Jiang"},{"name":"Yachao Gao"},{"name":"Yang Sun"},{"name":"Jianfeng Dai"},{"name":"Yang Wu"},{"name":"Di Qu"},{"name":"Gang Ma"},{"name":"Xianyang Fang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"accumulated associated protein"},{"word":"amyloid"},{"word":"atomic force microscopy (AFM)"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"confocal microscopy"},{"word":"electron microscopy (EM)"},{"word":"extracellular matrix protein"},{"word":"small basic protein"},{"word":"small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)"}]},"article129":{"pmid":"30049528","title":"Accelerating the start-up of the cathodic biofilm by adding acyl-homoserine lactone signaling molecules.","abs":"Electroactive biofilms (EABs) are essential for bioelectrochemical systems, however, the formation of cathodic EABs is more time-consuming than anodic EABs.

S. desiccabilis is a desiccation-resistant, biofilm-forming microbe found in desert crusts. The viability of cells in both planktonic and biofilm forms was measured after exposure to simulated martian brines. Planktonic cells showed a loss of viability over the course of several hours in almost all of the seven brines tested. Biofilms conferred greater resistance to all the brines, including those with low water activity and pH, but even cells in biofilms showed a complete loss of viability in <6 h in the harsher brines and in <2 days in the less harsh brines. One brine, however, allowed the microbes to maintain viability over several days, despite having a water activity and pH lower and ionic strength higher than brines that reduced viability over the same timescales, suggesting important ion-specific effects.

Bacterial cell death was independent of biofilm matrix polysaccharide Psl, while biofilm disruption was due to the degradation of Psl matrix by dead-bacteria-released glycosyl hydrolase PslG, thereby leading to biofilm dispersion. PaAP functioned extracellularly and aminopeptidase catalytic activity was essential for its effect on biofilm development. Our data reveal an important role of extracellular aminopeptidase in biofilm development, suggesting PaAP as a therapeutic target for preventing P. aeruginosa infection and combating biofilm-related complications.","authors":[{"name":"Tianhu Zhao"},{"name":"Yuhuan Zhang"},{"name":"Huijun Wu"},{"name":"Di Wang"},{"name":"Yihua Chen"},{"name":"Mei-Jun Zhu"},{"name":"Luyan Z Ma"}],"keywords":[]},"article140":{"pmid":"30047153","title":"Attachment and colonization of Salmonella on 'Rayada', 'Golden Delicious', and 'Red Delicious' apples.","abs":"Fruits and vegetables have been associated with outbreaks of disease in different countries.

Therefore, hisB expression was studied by real-time PCR, and the interactions between azithromycin and IGPD were predicted by molecular docking analysis. hisB was found to be significantly down-regulated, and six bond interactions were observed between azithromycin and IGPD. Many active atoms of azithromycin did not interact with the biologically active site of IGPD. Surface plasmon resonance analysis used to further study the relationship between IGPD and azithromycin showed minimum interaction between them.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the PilS-PilR two-component system (TCS) regulates expression of the type IV pilus (T4P) major subunit PilA, while biosynthesis of the single polar flagellum is regulated by a hierarchical system that includes the FleSR TCS. Previous studies of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Dichelobacter nodosus implicated PilR in regulation of non-T4P-related genes, including some involved in flagellar biosynthesis. Here we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to identify genes in addition to pilA with changes in expression in the absence of pilR Among the genes identified were 10 genes whose transcription increased in the pilA mutant but decreased in the pilR mutant, despite both mutants lacking T4P and pilus-related phenotypes. The products of these inversely dysregulated genes, many of which were hypothetical, may be important for virulence and surface-associated behaviors, as mutants had altered swarming motility, biofilm formation, type VI secretion system expression, and pathogenicity in a nematode model. Further, the PilSR TCS positively regulated transcription of fleSR, and thus many genes in the FleSR regulon. As a result, pilSR deletion mutants had defects in swimming motility that were independent of the loss of PilA. Together, these data suggest that in addition to controlling T4P expression, PilSR could have a broader role in the regulation of P. aeruginosa motility and surface sensing behaviors.","authors":[{"name":"Sara L N Kilmury"},{"name":"Lori L Burrows"}],"keywords":[{"word":"cell surface"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"flagellar gene regulation"},{"word":"two-component regulatory systems"},{"word":"type IV pili"}]},"article160":{"pmid":"30041870","title":"Androgen exposure potentiates formation of intratubular communities and renal abscesses by Escherichia coli.","abs":"Females across their lifespan and certain male populations are susceptible to urinary tract infections (UTI).

Susceptibility to UPEC UTI in both male and female hosts was potentiated with 5α-dihydrotestosterone, while males with androgen receptor deficiency and androgenized females treated with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide were protected from severe pyelonephritis. In androgenized females and in males, UPEC formed dense intratubular, biofilm-like communities, some of which were sheltered from infiltrating leukocytes by the tubular epithelium and by peritubular fibrosis. Abscesses were nucleated by small intratubular collections of UPEC first visualized at five days postinfection and briskly expanded over the subsequent 24 hours. Male mice deficient in Toll-like receptor 4, which fail to contain UPEC within abscesses, were susceptible to lethal dissemination. Thus, androgen receptor activation imparts susceptibility to severe upper-tract UTI in both female and male murine hosts.

Recent research has suggested a potential association between certain infectious diseases and dementia, either directly due to bacterial brain invasion and toxin production, or indirectly by modulating the immune response. Therefore, in the present review we focus on the emerging issues of bacterial infection and AD, including the existence of antimicrobial peptides having pore-forming properties that act in a similar way to pores formed by Aβ in a variety of cell membranes. Special focus is placed on oral bacteria and biofilms, and on the potential mechanisms associating bacterial infection and toxin production in AD. The role of bacterial outer membrane vesicles on the transport and delivery of toxins as well as porins to the brain is also discussed. Aβ has shown to possess antimicrobial activity against several bacteria, and therefore could be upregulated as a response to bacteria and bacterial toxins in the brain.

Agents inhibiting microbial biofilm formation could be considered as a potential tool to weaken the extent of microbial pathogenesis. Tryptophan has already been reported as a promising agent against the biofilm development by P. aeruginosa. In the current study, we had focused on the underlying mechanism of microbial biofilm inhibition of P. aeruginosa under the influence of tryptophan. The expression level of the mRNA of the genes (lasR, lasB and lasI) associated with quorum sensing was compared between tryptophan treated and untreated cells under similar conditions using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that the tested concentrations of tryptophan considerably reduced the expression of those genes (lasR, lasB and lasI) that are required during the occurrence of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa. Molecular docking also revealed that tryptophan can interact with the proteins responsible for the occurrence of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa. The cytotoxicity assay was carried out wherein we observed that the tested concentration of tryptophan did not show any considerable cytotoxicity against the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. From this study, it may be concluded that the tryptophan-mediated inhibition of biofilm formation is associated with interference of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa.

The activity against diatom biofilm formation by the tested strain was confirmed mostly in the culture supernatant and could be extracted using organic solvents. Treatment with its supernatant crude extract significantly reduced the cells of Stauroneis sp. forming biofilm and slightly increased the cells floating in the culture medium, which results in the ratio of biofilm cell/floating cell altering from 0.736 in control to 0.414 in treatment. Use of the supernatant crude extract led to increased production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) by diatom Stauroneis sp. from 16.66 to 41.59 (g/g cell dry weight). The increase in EPS production was mainly contributed by soluble EPS (SL-EPS) and followed by the EPS that was tightly bound to biofilm cells (BF-TB-EPS). In addition, the supernatant crude extract caused significant changes in the monosaccharides composition of the EPS of Stauroneis sp. Specifically, glucuronic acid (Glc-A) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (Glc-NAc) in BF-TB-EPS were 55% fold decreased and 1219% fold increased, respectively. Based on our findings, we proposed that these changes in monosaccharides composition might lead to a decreased biofilm formation efficiency of diatom.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaojian Zhou"},{"name":"Jie Meng"},{"name":"Zhaowei Yu"},{"name":"Li Miao"},{"name":"Cuili Jin"}],"keywords":[]},"article189":{"pmid":"30034798","title":"Outbreak report: a nosocomial outbreak of vancomycin resistant enterococci in a solid organ transplant unit.","abs":"Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) are an emerging problem in health care settings.

The cationic resource on the NLC surface was soyaethyl morpholinium ethosulfate (SME). NLC loaded with oxacillin was produced to assess the antibacterial activity and the effectiveness of topical application for treating cutaneous infection. The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of oxacillin-loaded NLC were 177 nm and 19 mV, respectively. When combined with NLC, oxacillin exhibited synergistic MRSA eradication. After NLC encapsulation, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of oxacillin decreased from 250 to 62.5 μg/ml. The combined NLC and oxacillin reduced the MRSA biofilm thickness from 31.2 to 13.0 μm, which was lower than the effect of NLC (18.2 μm) and antibiotic (25.2 μm) alone. The oxacillin-loaded NLC showed significant reduction in the burden of intracellular MRSA in differentiated THP-1 cells. This reduction was greater than that achieved with individual treatment. The mechanistic study demonstrated the ability of cationic NLC to disrupt the bacterial membrane, leading to protein leakage. The cell surface disintegration also increased oxacillin delivery into the cytoplasm, activating the bactericidal process. Topical NLC treatment of MRSA abscess in the skin decreased the bacterial load by log 4 and improved the skin's architecture and barrier function.

Here we investigated the effect of tunicamycin, a cell wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis inhibiting antibiotic at the subinhibitory dosage on Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes physiology, antibiotic cross-resistance, biofilm-formation, and virulence. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tunicamycin to S. aureus and L. monocytogenes was 20-40 μg/ml and 2.5-5 μg/ml, respectively, and the subinhibitory concentration was 2.5-5 μg/ml and 0.31-0.62 μg/ml, respectively. Tunicamycin pre-exposure reduced cellular WTA levels by 18-20% and affected bacterial cell wall ultrastructure, cell membrane permeability, morphology, laser-induced colony scatter signature, and bacterial ability to form biofilms. It also induced a moderate level of cross-resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, erythromycin, and meropenem for S. aureus, and ampicillin, erythromycin, vancomycin, and meropenem for L. monocytogenes. Pre-treatment of bacterial cells with subinhibitory concentrations of tunicamycin also significantly reduced bacterial adhesion to and invasion into an enterocyte-like Caco-2 cell line, which is supported by reduced expression of key virulence factors, Internalin B (InlB) and Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) in L. monocytogenes, and a S. aureus surface protein A (SasA) in S. aureus. Tunicamycin-treated bacteria or the bacterial WTA preparation suppressed NF-κB and inflammatory cytokine production (TNFα, and IL-6) from murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) indicating the reduced WTA level possibly attenuates an inflammatory response.

Here, we show that the behavioral response of diatoms is more complex and selective as cells are also responding to gradients of dissolved phosphate (dP) when starved in this nutrient. In contrast, neither nitrate nor ammonium (dN) triggers an attractive response under nitrogen limitation. Video monitoring and movement pattern analysis of the model diatom Seminavis robusta revealed that dP attraction is mediated by a combined chemokinetic and chemotactic response. After locating nutrient hotspots, the microalgae slow down and recover from the limitation. The fastest recovery in terms of growth was observed after dSi limitation. In agreement with the lack of directional response, recovery from dN limitation was slowest, indicating that no short-term benefit would be drawn by the algae from the location of transient hotspots of this resource.

In this work, we design different experiments to evaluate the potential of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in preventing the formation of biofilms on in-house manufactured mercury-specific DGTs. Laboratory tests were carried out by a microcosm system in independent glass containers, where biofilms obtained from field inocula were grown for weeks. Afterward, several experiments were performed with Hg-spiked river water, biofilms and DGTs treated and untreated with AgNPs to better understand biofilm colonization, inhibition and Hg uptake. The results showed that the treatment is very useful, since the mass of the biofilm accumulated at the surface of the treated DGT is significantly (p < 0.05) lower than in control (untreated) devices. Tests in colonized environments and Hg-spiked river water showed that the Hg uptake by the treated DGT matched the theoretical values and prevented biofilm formation up to 24 days post-deployment. Conversely, in deployments longer than two weeks using the untreated DGT, measurements could be underestimated by 35%. The results in the field reveal that in sampling stations with high levels of suspended matter, the filter becomes clogged despite there being no biofilm, thereby explaining its low efficiency for the uptake of Hg. In summary, the use of AgNPs inhibits biofilm formation and their use is especially recommended in eutrophic freshwaters with low amounts of suspended particulate matter.","authors":[{"name":"Sergi Díez"},{"name":"Riccardo Giaggio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algal growth"},{"word":"Diffusive gradients in thin films"},{"word":"Freshwater"},{"word":"Hg"},{"word":"Silver nanoparticles"}]},"article207":{"pmid":"30031912","title":"Antimicrobial polymers as therapeutics for treatment of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection.","abs":"Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is one of the most common pathogens in hospital-acquired infections.

These regulators control biofilm formation by dictating the production of the symbiosis polysaccharide (Syp-PS), the major component of the biofilm matrix. Control occurs both at and below the level of transcription of the syp genes, which are responsible for Syp-PS production. Here, we probed the roles of the two known negative regulators of biofilm formation, BinK and SypE, by generating double mutants. We also mapped and evaluated a point mutation using natural transformation and linkage analysis. We examined traditional biofilm formation phenotypes and established a new assay for evaluating the start of biofilm formation in the form of microscopic aggregates in shaking liquid cultures, in the absence of the known biofilm-inducing signal calcium. We found that wrinkled colony formation is negatively controlled not only by BinK and SypE but also by SypF. SypF is both required for and inhibitory to biofilm formation. Together, these data reveal that these three regulators are sufficient to prevent wild-type V. fischeri from forming biofilms under these conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Cecilia M Thompson"},{"name":"Anne E Marsden"},{"name":"Alice H Tischler"},{"name":"Jovanka Koo"},{"name":"Karen L Visick"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio fischeri"},{"word":"binK"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"response regulator"},{"word":"sensor kinase"},{"word":"syp"},{"word":"two-component regulatory systems"}]},"article211":{"pmid":"30030124","title":"In vitro biofilm formation on resin-based composites cured under different surface conditions.","abs":"The interfacial conditions occurring during light-curing procedures of resin-based composites (RBCs) influence their surface properties and therefore the biological behavior of the material.

The more virulent pathogen C. albicans has 15 copies of the gene whereas the less pathogenic species C. dubliniensis has only two. To investigate if expansion of the TLO repertoire in C. dubliniensis has an effect on phenotype and virulence we expressed three representative C. albicans TLO genes (TLOβ2, TLOγ11 and TLOα12) in a wild type C. dubliniensis background, under the control of either their native or the ACT1 promoter. Expression of TLOβ2 resulted in a hyperfilamentous phenotype, while overexpression of TLOγ11 and TLOα12 resulted in enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. Expression of all three TLO genes from the ACT1 promoter resulted in increased virulence in the Galleria infection model. In order to further investigate if individual TLO genes exhibit differences in function we expressed six representative C. albicans TLO genes in a C. dubliniensis Δtlo1/Δtlo2 double mutant. Differences were observed in the ability of the expressed CaTLOs to complement the various phenotypes of the mutant. All TLO genes with the exception of TLOγ7 could restore filamentation, however only TLOα9, γ11 and α12 could restore chlamydospore formation. Differences in the ability of CaTLO genes to restore growth in the presence of H2O2, calcofluor white, Congo red and at 42°C were observed. Only TLOα3 restored wild-type levels of virulence in the Galleria infection model. These data show that expansion of the TLO gene family in C. dubliniensis results in gain of function and that there is functional diversity amongst members of the gene family. We propose that this expansion of the TLO family contributes to the success of C. albicans as a commensal and opportunistic pathogen.","authors":[{"name":"Peter R Flanagan"},{"name":"Jessica Fletcher"},{"name":"Hannah Boyle"},{"name":"Razvan Sulea"},{"name":"Gary P Moran"},{"name":"Derek J Sullivan"}],"keywords":[]},"article214":{"pmid":"30028508","title":"The Different Physical and Chemical Composition of Grape Juice and Marc Influence Saccharomyces cerevisiae Strains Distribution During Fermentation.","abs":"During white-grape winemaking, grape marc is separated from juice immediately after crushing.

P. melaninogenica also possesses all known orthologs of T9SS. In this study, a P. melaninogenica GAI 07411 mutant deficient in the orthologue of the T9SS-encoding gene, porK, was constructed. Hemagglutination and biofilm formation were decreased in the porK mutant. Furthermore, following growth on skim milk-containing medium, the diameters of the halos surrounding the porK mutant were smaller than those of the wild-type strain, suggesting a decrease in secretion of proteases outside the bacterium. To investigate this in detail, culture supernatants of wild-type and porK mutant strains were purified and compared by two-dimensional electrophoresis. In the mutant strain, fewer spots were detected, indicating fewer secreted proteins. In infection experiments, the mortality rate of mice inoculated with the porK mutant strain was significantly lower than in the wild-type strain.

In the present work, the mechanism of action of a cyclic (colistin) and a linear (catestatin) AMP on a young E. coli biofilm was deciphered from the molecular to the cellular scale. To this end, infrared spectroscopy (attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared) assisted by chemometric analysis was combined with fluorescence and atomic force microscopies to address the very different behaviors of both AMPs. Indeed, the colistin dramatically damaged the bacterial cell wall and the metabolism even though its action was not homogeneous over the whole bacterial population and repopulation can be observed after peptide removal. Conversely, catestatin did not lead to major damages in the bacterial morphology but its action was homogeneous over the whole bacterial population and the cells were unable to regrow after the peptide treatment. Our results strongly suggested that contrary to the cyclic molecule, the linear one is able to cause irreversible damages in the bacterial membrane concomitantly to a strong impact on the bacterial metabolism.","authors":[{"name":"Oona Freudenthal"},{"name":"Fabienne Quilès"},{"name":"Grégory Francius"}],"keywords":[]},"article236":{"pmid":"30023683","title":"Graphene Oxide-Coated Surface: Inhibition of Bacterial Biofilm Formation due to Specific Surface-Interface Interactions.","abs":"Graphene oxide (GO) is a promising and remarkable nanomaterial that exhibits antimicrobial activity due to its specific surface-interface interactions.

However, S006-830 is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, one of which could possess a better pharmacological profile than the other. We purified both the enantiomers on a chiral column and observed that S-enantiomer has a significantly higher inhibitory and cidal activity against Mtb than the R-enantiomer.

In a chemical proteomics approach using matrix-bound compound to pull down its target protein(s) from Mtb membrane, FabG4 (β-ketoacyl CoA reductase, EC 1.1.1.100) emerged as the most likely target for S-S006-830. In target validation assays, the compound exhibited 2-fold higher inhibitory concentration for an Mtb construct overexpressing FabG4.

The number of people succumbing to drug-resistant infections is increasing every day, but the rate of drug discovery has failed to match the requisite demands. Most of the currently known antibiotics target the three essential pathways of central dogma. However, bacteria have evolved multiple mechanisms to survive these antibiotics. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to target auxiliary pathways for the discovery of new drugs. Metabolism-related and stress-associated pathways are ideal in this regard. The stringent response pathway regulated by the signaling nucleotides (p)ppGpp is an attractive target as inhibition of the pathway would in turn decrease the persistence and long-term survival of pathogenic bacteria. In this perspective, we focus on the recent design of small molecule analogues of (p)ppGpp that have yielded promising results in terms of growth and biofilm inhibition.

A causal relationship between biofilm formation and emergence of stress resistance is not known. Here, we report that activation of a nitrogen starvation response regulator, GlnR, during the development of Mycobacterium smegmatis biofilms leads to peroxide resistance. The resistance arises from induction of a GlnR-dependent peroxide resistance (gpr) gene cluster comprising of 8 ORFs (MSMEG_0565-0572). Expression of gpr increases the NADPH to NADP ratio, suggesting that a reduced cytosolic environment of nitrogen-starved cells in biofilms contributes to peroxide resistance. Increased NADPH levels from gpr activity likely support the activity of enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation, as suggested by a higher threshold of nitrogen supplement required by a gpr mutant to form biofilms. Together, our study uniquely interlinks a nutrient sensing mechanism with emergence of stress resistance during mycobacterial biofilm development. The gpr gene cluster is conserved in several mycobacteria that can cause nosocomial infections, offering a possible explanation for their resistance to peroxide-based sterilization of medical equipment.","authors":[{"name":"Yong Yang"},{"name":"Jacob P Richards"},{"name":"Jennifer Gundrum"},{"name":"Anil K Ojha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"GlnR"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"mycobacteria"},{"word":"peroxide"},{"word":"starvation"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"30022542","title":"Biofilm production and antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from Hidradenitis Suppurativa lesions.","abs":"An aberrant interaction between commensal skin bacteria and the host skin immune system is considered important in the pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).","authors":[{"name":"C B Ardon"},{"name":"E P Prens"},{"name":"K Fuursted"},{"name":"R N Ejaz"},{"name":"J Shailes"},{"name":"H Jenssen"},{"name":"G B E Jemec"}],"keywords":[]},"article241":{"pmid":"30022302","title":"Environmental proteomic studies: closer step to understand bacterial biofilms.","abs":"Advancement in proteome analytical techniques and the development of protein databases have been helping to understand the physiology and subtle molecular mechanisms behind biofilm formation in bacteria.

The stiffness of the bacteria-hydrogel artificial biofilm cannot be simply attributed by the summation of the contribution from the bacteria and hydrogel based on the mathematical models and computational models.

V. cholerae can produce an exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix that plays a role in adhesion and biofilm formation. In this work, we investigated the effect of EPS production on T6SS activity between cells. We found that EPS produced by V. cholerae cells functions as a unidirectional protective armor that blocks exogenous T6SS attacks without interfering with its own T6SS functionality. This EPS armor is effective against both same-species and heterologous attackers. Mutations modulating the level of EPS biosynthesis gene expression result in corresponding modulation in V. cholerae resistance to exogenous T6SS attack.

Factorial and principal component analysis revealed microbial structures in the media were significantly affected by the operation conditions, including media type (GAC versus dual media anthracite sand), EBCT (10 versus 18 min), and pre-ozonation. Detrended correspondence analysis demonstrated media materials predominantly governed the structures of the acclimated biofilm in BAFs as they provide direct attachment surface. This is in line with the higher microbial activity and better treatment performance exhibited by GAC BAFs compared to the dual media BAFs, corroborating the importance of filter media selection to promote the acclimation of active and robust biofilm for efficient CEC removal. Principal component analysis revealed the significant influence from ozonation, which does not only break down CECs, but also stimulates microbes that grow on the ozonation products. Partial canonical correlation analysis further proved the shaping of biofilm communities on the BAF media is more associated with media type and ozonation compared to EBCT. Putative CEC degraders are predicted based on their dominance in the media and degradation capabilities reported in previous literature.

The capacity of pathogens to adhere to bovine mammary epithelial cells is associated with biofilm production which leads to antibiotic resistance.

Minthostachys verticillata is an autochthonous medicinal plant of Argentina with multiple ethnobotanical properties. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the essential oil (EO) of this species and limonene, one of its compounds, inhibited the growth of mastitis pathogens. The objective of the present work was to determine the inhibitory effect of the essential oil of M. verticillata and limonene, on biofilm formation and on mature biofilm produced by pathogens isolated from bovine mastitis. Time kill assay and bacterial lysis were also determined. Furthermore, RAPD-PCR assays were performed to determine changes in bacterial DNA after EO and limonene exposition. Bacterial isolates were identified as Escherichia coli (EC3 and EC9), Bacillus pumilus (BP5, BP6, and BP7) and Enterococcus faecium (EF1) by rRNA 16S sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS.

However, the presence in its genome of many others iron acquisition genes suggests that serobactins are not the only strategy used by H. seropedicae to overcome metal deficiency. The aim of this work was to identify genes and proteins differentially expressed by cells growing in low iron conditions in order to describe H. seropedicae response to iron limitation stress. For this purpose, and by using a transcriptomic approach, we searched and identified a set of genes up-regulated when iron was scarce. One of them, Hsero_2337, codes for a TonB-dependent transporter/transducer present in the serobactins biosynthesis genomic locus, with an unknown function. Another TonB-dependent receptor, the one encoded by Hsero_1277, and an inner membrane ferrous iron permease, coded by Hsero_2720, were also detected. By using a proteomic approach focused in membrane proteins, we identified the specific receptor for iron-serobactin internalization SbtR and two non-characterized TonB-dependent receptors (coded by genes Hsero_1277 and Hsero_3255). We constructed mutants on some of the identified genes and characterized them by in vitro growth, biofilm formation, and interaction with rice plants. Characterization of mutants in gene Hsero_2337 showed that the TonB-dependent receptor coded by this gene has a regulatory role in the biosynthesis of serobactins, probably by interacting with the alternative sigma factor PfrI, coded by gene Hsero_2338. Plant colonization of the mutant strains was not affected, since the mutant strain normally colonize the root and aerial part of rice plants. These results suggest that the strategies used by H. seropedicae to acquire iron inside plants are far more diverse than the ones characterized in this work.

We elucidated a series of finely tuned nonpolar and charge-charge interactions that facilitate the oligomerization of CsgE and its ability to transport unfolded CsgA to CsgG for translocation. CsgE oligomerization in vitro is temperature dependent and is disrupted by mutations in the W48 and F79 residues. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we identified two regions of CsgE involved in the CsgE-CsgA interaction: a head comprising a positively charged patch centered around R47 and a stem comprising a negatively charged patch containing E31 and E85. Negatively charged residues in the intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal tails were not implicated in this interaction.

Mutation of the E31 and E85 stem residues to positively charged side chains decreased CsgE-mediated curli fiber formation but increased CsgE-mediated stabilization of CsgA. No single-amino-acid substitutions in the head, stem, or tail regions affected the ability of CsgE to cap the CsgG pore as determined by a bile salt sensitivity assay.

Considering the global threat posed by the antibiotic resistance, the mechanisms involved in both the formation of such reservoirs and their remobilization are a concern of prime importance. Antibiotic resistance genes are strongly associated with mobile genetic elements that are directly involved in their dissemination. Most mobile genetic element-mediated gene transfers involve replicative mechanisms and, as such, localized gene transfers should participate in the local increase in resistance gene abundance. Additionally, the carriage of conjugative mobile elements encoding cell appendages acting as adhesins has already been demonstrated to increase biofilm-forming capability of bacteria and, therefore, should also contribute to their selective enrichment on surfaces. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence of two families of mobile genetic elements, IncP-1 plasmids and class 1 integrons, in the water column and bank sediments of the Orne River, in France. We show that these mobile elements, especially IncP-1 plasmids, are enriched in the bacteria attached on the suspended matters in the river waters, and that a similar abundance is found in freshly deposited sediments. Using the IncP-1 plasmid pB10 as a model, in vitro experiments demonstrated that local enrichment of plasmid-bearing bacteria on artificial surfaces mainly resulted from an increase in bacterial adhesion properties conferred by the plasmid rather than an improved dissemination frequency of the plasmid between surface-attached bacteria. We propose plasmid-mediated adhesion to particles to be one of the main contributors in the formation of mobile genetic element-reservoirs in sediments, with adhesion to suspended matter working as a selective enrichment process of antibiotic resistant genes and bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Magali De la Cruz Barrón"},{"name":"Christophe Merlin"},{"name":"Hélène Guilloteau"},{"name":"Emmanuelle Montargès-Pelletier"},{"name":"Xavier Bellanger"}],"keywords":[{"word":"IncP-1 plasmids"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"class 1 integrons"},{"word":"environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes"},{"word":"horizontal gene transfer"},{"word":"river water column"},{"word":"sediments"},{"word":"suspended matter"}]},"article280":{"pmid":"30013539","title":"Nano-Strategies to Fight Multidrug Resistant Bacteria-A Battle of the Titans.","abs":"Infectious diseases remain one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The WHO and CDC have expressed serious concern regarding the continued increase in the development of multidrug resistance among bacteria. Therefore, the antibiotic resistance crisis is one of the most pressing issues in global public health. Associated with the rise in antibiotic resistance is the lack of new antimicrobials. This has triggered initiatives worldwide to develop novel and more effective antimicrobial compounds as well as to develop novel delivery and targeting strategies. Bacteria have developed many ways by which they become resistant to antimicrobials. Among those are enzyme inactivation, decreased cell permeability, target protection, target overproduction, altered target site/enzyme, increased efflux due to over-expression of efflux pumps, among others. Other more complex phenotypes, such as biofilm formation and quorum sensing do not appear as a result of the exposure of bacteria to antibiotics although, it is known that biofilm formation can be induced by antibiotics. These phenotypes are related to tolerance to antibiotics in bacteria. Different strategies, such as the use of nanostructured materials, are being developed to overcome these and other types of resistance. Nanostructured materials can be used to convey antimicrobials, to assist in the delivery of novel drugs or ultimately, possess antimicrobial activity by themselves. Additionally, nanoparticles (e.g., metallic, organic, carbon nanotubes, etc.) may circumvent drug resistance mechanisms in bacteria and, associated with their antimicrobial potential, inhibit biofilm formation or other important processes. Other strategies, including the combined use of plant-based antimicrobials and nanoparticles to overcome toxicity issues, are also being investigated. Coupling nanoparticles and natural-based antimicrobials (or other repurposed compounds) to inhibit the activity of bacterial efflux pumps; formation of biofilms; interference of quorum sensing; and possibly plasmid curing, are just some of the strategies to combat multidrug resistant bacteria. However, the use of nanoparticles still presents a challenge to therapy and much more research is needed in order to overcome this.

However, the intraperitoneal, intranasal, and intravenous routes of infection are not suitable for studying the roles of S. suis surface components in meningitis directly in the brain, such as the extracellular matrix from biofilms. Although intracisternal inoculation has been used for S. suis infection, the precise injection site has not been described.

S. suis planktonic cells or biofilm state cells were directly injected into the subarachnoid space of mice through the injection site located 3.5 mm rostral from the bregma. Histopathological analysis and increased mRNA expression of TLR2 and cytokines of the brain tissue from mice injected with biofilm state cells clearly indicated that S. suis biofilm plays definitive roles in S. suis meningitis. This route of infection has obvious advantages over other routes of infection, allowing the study of the host-bacterium interaction. Furthermore, it permits the effect of bacterial components on host immune responses directly in the brain to be assessed, and mimics bacterial entrance into the central nervous system.

This protocol provides a rapid and robust method of measuring virulence and avoids many of the complexities associated with the growth and maintenance of mammalian cell lines. Virulence phenotypes measured here using amoebae have also been validated using mouse macrophages. In particular, this assay was used to establish that surface attachment upregulates virulence in P. aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Kumar Perinbam"},{"name":"Albert Siryaporn"}],"keywords":[]},"article306":{"pmid":"30010397","title":"Survival of Tomato Outbreak Associated Salmonella Serotypes in Soil and Water and the Role of Biofilms in Abiotic Surface Attachment.","abs":"Salmonella serotypes linked to tomato-associated outbreaks were evaluated for survival in soil and water over a 40-day period. Salmonella enterica serotypes Anatum, Baildon, Braenderup, Montevideo, Newport, and Javiana were inoculated separately into sterile soil and water, followed by plating onto TSAYE and XLT4 at 10-day intervals. Biofilm production by Salmonella serotypes was measured on both quartz particles (soil surrogate) and glass coverslips, and was evaluated using a crystal violet dye assay. Salmonella populations in soil and water over 40 days indicated no significant differences between Salmonella serotypes tested (p > 0.05). Over a 40-day period, there was a 1.84 ± 0.22 log CFU/g and 1.56 ± 0.54 CFU/mL decrease in populations of Salmonella in soil and water, respectively. Enumeration indicated that Salmonella population fluctuated in water but decreased linearly in soil. All serotypes tested produced the red dry and rough morphotype on Congo Red agar. Biofilm produced by all the Salmonella serotypes tested was significantly different on quartz particles than on glass coverslips (p < 0.0001), indicating that material and surface characteristics could affect biofilm development. The ability of Salmonella serotypes to persist in soil or water and attach to abiotic surfaces through biofilm formation affirms that contact surfaces, soil, water, and sediment should be considered as possible sources of cross-contamination in the farm environment.","authors":[{"name":"Govindaraj Dev Kumar"},{"name":"Robert C Williams"},{"name":"Nammalwar Sriranganathan"},{"name":"Renee R Boyer"},{"name":"Joseph D Eifert"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella serotypes"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cell injury"},{"word":"soil"},{"word":"survival"},{"word":"water"}]},"article307":{"pmid":"30009970","title":"Bio-inspired nanomaterials in agriculture and food: Current status, foreseen applications and challenges.","abs":"Nanotechnology is a potential area that revolutionizes almost every sector of life and is predicted to become a major economic force in the near future.

Impaired streams showed significantly lower pH and increased specific conductance. Biofilm samples from the AMD impaired streams had lower fatty acid content with a decreased proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fatty acid profiles easily and rapidly separated biofilm communities into their respective categories, either as being impaired by AMD or unimpaired by AMD, using multivariate statistical approaches.

In Vibrio cholerae in vivo, the presence of c-di-GMP together with the response regulator VpsR results in transcription from PvpsL, a promoter of biofilm biosynthesis genes. VpsR shares homology with enhancer binding proteins that activate σ54-RNA polymerase (RNAP), but it lacks conserved residues needed to bind to σ54-RNAP and to hydrolyze adenosine triphosphate, and PvpsL transcription does not require σ54 in vivo. Consequently, the mechanism of this activation has not been clear. Using an in vitro transcription system, we demonstrate activation of PvspL in the presence of VpsR, c-di-GMP and σ70-RNAP. c-di-GMP does not significantly change the affinity of VpsR for PvpsL DNA or the DNase I footprint of VpsR on the DNA, and it is not required for VpsR to dimerize. However, DNase I and KMnO4 footprints reveal that the σ70-RNAP/VpsR/c-di-GMP complex on PvpsL adopts a different conformation from that formed by σ70-RNAP alone, with c-di-GMP or with VpsR.

Recent evidence suggests that S. mutans biofilms contain amyloid fibrils. Amyloids are insoluble fibrillar protein aggregates, and bacteria use functional amyloids to improve robustness of their biofilms. While the functional amyloids in bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus have been heavily investigated, little is known about the mechanism of S. mutans amyloid formation. Previous results from our laboratory with the amyloidogenic proteins and peptides from the aforementioned bacteria and other mammalian amyloid systems suggest that amyloid formation progresses via an intermediate that adopts a unique secondary structure-α-sheet. De novo designed peptides with alternating l- and d-amino acid also adopt an α-sheet secondary structure and inhibit amyloid formation by binding to soluble oligomeric species during amyloidogenesis. Inhibition of fibrillization by α-sheet peptides suggests the presence of α-sheet during amyloid formation. To investigate the mechanism of functional amyloid formation in S. mutans, α-sheet peptides were compared to epigallocatechin gallate for their ability to inhibit fibril formation in S. mutans. Inhibition was demonstrated in a biofilm plate assay and on hydroxyapatite surfaces both in S. mutans alone and in bacteria from human saliva.

The design strategy depended on modifying the amino acid sequence of AamAP1 in order to alter its net positive charge, percentage helicity and modify other parameters that are involved theoretically in HDPs activity. Accordingly, A3 was evaluated for its in vitro antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity individually and in combination with four different types of conventional antibiotics against clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-positive bacteria. A3 was also evaluated for its cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. A3 managed to selectively inhibit the growth of a wide range of resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria. Our results also showed that combining A3 with conventional antibiotics caused a synergistic antimicrobial behavior that resulted in decreasing the MIC value for A3 peptide as low as 0.125 µM. At the concentrations needed to inhibit bacterial growth, A3 displayed minimal mammalian cell toxicity. In conclusion, A3 exhibits enhanced activity and selectivity when compared with the parent natural scorpion venom peptide. The combination of A3 with conventional antibiotics could provide researchers in the antimicrobial drug development field with a potential alternative for conventional antibiotics against MDR bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Ammar Almaaytah"},{"name":"Ahmad Farajallah"},{"name":"Ahmad Abualhaijaa"},{"name":"Qosay Al-Balas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"bacterial resistance"},{"word":"host defense peptides"},{"word":"scorpion venoms"},{"word":"synergism"}]},"article330":{"pmid":"30004292","title":"Reversing Antimicrobial Resistance in Multidrug-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae of Clinical Origin Using 1-(1-Naphthylmethyl)-Piperazine.","abs":"Eleven clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were tested to access the potential of adjuvant therapies to reduce antimicrobial resistance using fixed concentrations of the chemosensitizers chlorpromazine (CPZ), thioridazine (TZ), phenylalanine-arginine-β-naphthylamide (PAβN), and 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine-(NMP) with varying concentrations of antimicrobial agents nalidixic acid (NAL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), moxifloxacin (MXF), tetracycline (TET), and chloramphenicol (CHL).

A key example of such a behavior is biofilm formation, in which groups of bacteria invest in synthesizing a protective, joint extracellular matrix. Quorum sensing involves the production, release, and subsequent detection of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. The architecture of quorum-sensing signal transduction pathways is highly variable among different species of bacteria, but frequently involves posttranscriptional regulation carried out by small regulatory RNA molecules. This review illustrates the diverse roles small trans-acting regulatory RNAs can play, from constituting a network's core to auxiliary roles in adjusting the rate of autoinducer synthesis, mediating cross talk among different parts of a network, or integrating different regulatory inputs to trigger appropriate changes in gene expression. The emphasis is on describing how the study of small RNA-based regulation in quorum sensing and biofilm formation has uncovered new general properties or expanded our understanding of bacterial riboregulation.","authors":[{"name":"Sine Lo Svenningsen"}],"keywords":[]},"article332":{"pmid":"30003536","title":"The role of the microbiome in nonhealing diabetic wounds.","abs":"Wound healing is a highly coordinated and complex process, and there can be devastating consequences if it is interrupted. It is believed that, in combination with host factors, microorganisms in a wound bed can not only impair wound healing but can lead to stalled, chronic wounds. It is hypothesized that the wound microbiota persists in chronic wounds as a biofilm, recalcitrant to antibiotic and mechanical intervention. Cultivation-based methods are the gold standard for identification of pathogens residing in wounds. However, these methods are biased against fastidious organisms, and do not capture the full extent of microbial diversity in chronic wounds. Thus, the link between specific microbes and impaired healing remains tenuous. This is partially because local infection and, more specifically, the formation of a biofilm, is difficult to diagnose. This has led to research efforts aimed at understanding if biofilm formation delays healing and leads to persistent and chronic infection. Circumventing challenges associated with culture-based estimations, advances in high-throughput sequencing analysis has revealed that chronic wounds are host to complex, diverse microbiomes comprising multiple species of bacteria and fungi.

The ability to produce a functional surface mucosa was an important evolutionary step, which evolved first in the Cnidaria, which includes corals, and the Ctenophora. This allowed the exclusion of non-commensal microbes and the subsequent development of the mucus-lined digestive cavity seen in higher metazoans. The fundamental architecture of the constituent glycoprotein mucins is also evolutionarily conserved. Although an understanding of the biochemical interactions between bacteria and the mucus layer are important to the goal of developing new antimicrobial strategies, they remain relatively poorly understood.

Statistical classification analysis (random forests algorithm) showed that G. vaginalis clades could be best defined by the profiles of two phenotypic characteristics: sialidase activity and vaginolysin production. The results of principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering suggested that all isolates can be subgrouped into three clusters, the structures of which are determined based on phenotypic characteristics of the isolates.

Often overlooked are the biotic interactions among biofilm components that can affect ecosystem-scale processes such as primary production and nutrient cycling. These interactions are likely to be especially important under resource limitation. Light is a primary resource mediating algal photosynthesis and both phototrophic and heterotrophic production due to bacterial reliance on C-rich algal exudates (Cole, ). However, current understanding of function-structure linkages in streams has yet to unravel the relative degree of these microbial feedbacks under resource availability gradients.

By integrating biogeochemical rate estimation and metatranscriptomics within a microcosm experiment, they were able to link primary production and nutrient uptake rates to algal and bacterial metabolic processes and specify what taxa contributed to gene expression. Under low light, diatoms and cyanobacteria upregulated photosynthetic machinery and diatom-specific chloroplast rRNA suggesting heightened transcriptional activity under light limitation to maintain phototrophic energy demands. Under high light, heterotrophic bacteria upregulated mRNAs related to phosphorous (P) metabolism while biofilm P uptake increased indicating high bacterial-specific P demand when algal biomass was high.

During pathogenesis, physical attachment to the site of infection is a prerequisite to infection and horizontal gene transfer to the plant. Virulent and avirulent strains may also attach to plant tissue in more benign plant associations, and as with other soil microbes, to soil surfaces in the terrestrial environment. Although most A. tumefaciens virulence functions are encoded on the tumor-inducing plasmid, genes that direct general surface attachment are chromosomally encoded, and thus this process is not obligatorily tied to virulence, but is a more fundamental capacity. Several different cellular structures are known or suspected to contribute to the attachment process. The flagella influence surface attachment primarily via their propulsive activity, but control of their rotation during the transition to the attached state may be quite complex. A. tumefaciens produces several pili, including the Tad-type Ctp pili, and several plasmid-borne conjugal pili encoded by the Ti and At plasmids, as well as the so-called T-pilus, involved in interkingdom horizontal gene transfer. The Ctp pili promote reversible interactions with surfaces, whereas the conjugal and T-pili drive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) interactions with other cells and tissues. The T-pilus is likely to contribute to physical association with plant tissues during DNA transfer to plants. A. tumefaciens can synthesize a variety of polysaccharides including cellulose, curdlan (β-1,3 glucan), β-1,2 glucan (cyclic and linear), succinoglycan, and a localized polysaccharide(s) that is confined to a single cellular pole and is called the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP). Lipopolysaccharides are also in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. Cellulose and curdlan production can influence attachment under certain conditions. The UPP is required for stable attachment under a range of conditions and on abiotic and biotic surfaces. Other factors that have been reported to play a role in attachment include the elusive protein called rhicadhesin. The process of surface attachment is under extensive regulatory control and can be modulated by environmental conditions, as well as by direct responses to surface contact. Complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional control circuitry underlies much of the production and deployment of these attachment functions.","authors":[{"name":"Melene A Thompson"},{"name":"Maureen C Onyeziri"},{"name":"Clay Fuqua"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Attachment"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Cell surface structures"},{"word":"Regulation"}]},"article345":{"pmid":"29998093","title":"Microbial Interaction as a Determinant of the Quality of Supply Drinking Water: A Conceptual Analysis.","abs":"This conceptual analysis elucidates the microbial interaction inside municipal distribution pipes, subsequent deterioration in the quality of the supply water, and its impacts on public health.

Antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy (aPDT) had been recently proposed to combat clinically relevant biofilms such as dental biofilms, ventilator associated pneumonia, chronic wound infections, oral candidiasis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. aPDT uses non-toxic dyes called photosensitizers (PS), which can be excited by harmless visible light to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). aPDT is a multi-stage process including topical PS administration, light irradiation, and interaction of the excited state with ambient oxygen. Numerous in vitro and in vivo aPDT studies have demonstrated biofilm-eradication or substantial reduction. ROS are produced upon photo-activation and attack adjacent targets, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids present within the biofilm matrix, on the cell surface and inside the microbial cells. Damage to non-specific targets leads to the destruction of both planktonic cells and biofilms. The review aims to summarize the progress of aPDT in destroying biofilms and the mechanisms mediated by ROS. Finally, a brief section provides suggestions for future research.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Hu"},{"name":"Ying-Ying Huang"},{"name":"Yuguang Wang"},{"name":"Xiaoyuan Wang"},{"name":"Michael R Hamblin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm-related infections"},{"word":"microbial biofilms"},{"word":"photochemical mechanisms"},{"word":"photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"photosensitizer structure"},{"word":"reactive oxygen species"}]},"article351":{"pmid":"29997121","title":"Transcriptome Assembly and Profiling of Candida auris Reveals Novel Insights into Biofilm-Mediated Resistance.","abs":"Candida auris has emerged as a significant global nosocomial pathogen. This is primarily due to its antifungal resistance profile but also its capacity to form adherent biofilm communities on a range of clinically important substrates. While we have a comprehensive understanding of how other Candida species resist and respond to antifungal challenge within the sessile phenotype, our current understanding of C. auris biofilm-mediated resistance is lacking. In this study, we are the first to perform transcriptomic analysis of temporally developing C. auris biofilms, which were shown to exhibit phase- and antifungal class-dependent resistance profiles. A de novo transcriptome assembly was performed, where sequenced sample reads were assembled into an ~11.5-Mb transcriptome consisting of 5,848 genes. Differential expression (DE) analysis demonstrated that 791 and 464 genes were upregulated in biofilm formation and planktonic cells, respectively, with a minimum 2-fold change. Adhesin-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell wall genes were upregulated at all time points of biofilm formation. As the biofilm developed into intermediate and mature stages, a number of genes encoding efflux pumps were upregulated, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters. When we assessed efflux pump activity biochemically, biofilm efflux was greater than that of planktonic cells at 12 and 24 h. When these were inhibited, fluconazole sensitivity was enhanced 4- to 16-fold. This study demonstrates the importance of efflux-mediated resistance within complex C. auris communities and may explain the resistance of C. auris to a range of antimicrobial agents within the hospital environment.","authors":[{"name":"Ryan Kean"},{"name":"Christopher Delaney"},{"name":"Leighann Sherry"},{"name":"Andrew Borman"},{"name":"Elizabeth M Johnson"},{"name":"Malcolm D Richardson"},{"name":"Riina Rautemaa-Richardson"},{"name":"Craig Williams"},{"name":"Gordon Ramage"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"antifungal resistance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"efflux pumps"},{"word":"gene expression"}]},"article352":{"pmid":"29996764","title":"Consistent and reproducible long-term in vitro growth of health and disease-associated oral subgingival biofilms.","abs":"Several in vitro oral biofilm growth systems can reliably construct oral microbiome communities in culture, yet their stability and reproducibility through time has not been well characterized.

In particular, biofilm treatment in clinical settings is challenging, as biofilms are very resistant to conventional antibiotic therapy and may spread infecting other tissues. To address this problem, biosensing technologies are emerging as a powerful solution to detect and identify bacterial pathogens at the very early stages of the infection, thus allowing rapid and effective treatments before biofilms are formed. Biosensors typically consist of two main parts, a biorecognition moiety that interacts with the target (i.e., bacteria) and a platform that transduces such interaction into a measurable signal. This review will focus on the development of impedimetric biosensors using antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as biorecognition elements. AMPs belong to the innate immune system of living organisms and are very effective in interacting with bacterial membranes. They offer unique advantages compared to other classical bioreceptor molecules such as enzymes or antibodies. Moreover, impedance-based sensors allow the development of label-free, rapid, sensitive, specific and cost-effective sensing platforms. In summary, AMPs and impedimetric transducers combine excellent properties to produce robust biosensors for the early detection of bacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Mireia Hoyos-Nogués"},{"name":"F J Gil"},{"name":"Carlos Mas-Moruno"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"bacterial detection"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biosensors"},{"word":"impedance"}]},"article355":{"pmid":"29996523","title":"Light Activated Disinfection in Root Canal Treatment-A Focused Review.","abs":"Light activated disinfection (LAD) is a strategy for optimizing root canal disinfection by using a highly-selective, targeted killing of bacteria using a combination of photosensitizers and light.

While most studies offer an important understanding of the effectiveness of LAD on monospecies biofilms, few have offered credence to the fact that infections of the root canal system are mediated by polymicrobial biofilms. Hence, it is imperative to understand the effect of LAD on polymicrobial biofilms both in terms of microbial killing and the changes in the biofilm architecture. The aim of this review was to systematically review the literature to evaluate the effect of LAD on dual and multispecies biofilms and demonstrate the antibiofilm effect of LAD. Two databases (PubMed and Scopus) were searched to identify eligible studies using a combination of key words. These studies were reviewed to draw conclusions on the effect of LAD on dual and multi species biofilm and the antibiofilm effect of LAD. It was found that LAD alone may be unable to eradicate dual and multispecies biofilms, but it may enhance the effect of conventional canal debridement strategies.

Decreasing the HRT to 8 h significantly deteriorated the reactor's pollutant removal efficiencies and increasing the HRT to 24 h did not improve these efficiencies. Illumination, which was light source for algae, was provided by a LED light. Activity tests showed that organic matter and ammonium removal rates resulting from illumination were 70% and 50%, respectively, of the rates when dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained at 2 mg/L. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates resulted from illumination and aeration were 18.63 and 25.38 mg COD/L.h, respectively. The phosphate removal rate was 0.26 and 0.43 mg/L.h when illumination and aeration were applied, respectively.

Their negative impact on the growth of C. albicans and other Candida spp. is shown in vitro and with the hepatic S9 system, which is preliminary to any in-vivo test. This study found that the antidepressants considered can inhibit not only hyphae and biofilm formation, but also kill cells in a mature biofilm.

A Salmonella enterica serotype Agona isolate from poultry (S24) was grown at 37°C in biofilms for up to 144 hours (H144) in attachment to polystyrene surfaces. Biofilm structures were examined at different stages in their development (H3, H24, H48, H72, H96 and H144) using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in conjunction with fluorescent dyes for live cells (SYTO 9), dead cells (propidium iodide), proteins (fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I), lipids (DiD'oil), α-polysaccharides (concanavalin A, tetramethylrhodamine conjugate), and β-polysaccharides (calcofluor white M2R). Strain S24 developed a robust biofilm at H72 (biovolume of 166,852.5 ± 13,681.8 μm3 in the observation field of 16,078.2 μm2). The largest biovolume of live cells was also detected at H72 (128,110.3 ± 4,969.1 μm3), decreasing thereafter, which was probably owing to the detachment of cells prior to a new phase of colonization. The percentage of dead cells with regard to total cells in the biofilms increased throughout the incubation, ranging from 2.3 ± 1.1% (H24) to 44.2 ± 11.0% (H144). Proteins showed the greatest biovolume among the extracellular components within the biofilms, with values ranging from 1,295.1 ± 1,294.9 μm3 (H3) to 19,186.2 ± 8,536.0 μm3 (H96).

The scattering is interpreted as originating from PGM fiber-like structures that adopt rod-like bottle-brush conformation in dilute solutions. On the basis of the knowledge about molecular structure of mucins and SAXS data for dilute solutions, we propose a theoretical model for predicting mucin conformation in solution and calculate the corresponding scattering profile. This bottle-brush model comprises a protein backbone with carbohydrate side chains and corresponding structural parameters, such as grafting distance and lengths of the backbone and side chains. It describes the experimental PGM data from dilute solutions in the full q range very well. It furthermore suggests that the carbohydrate side chains are grafted with a regular separation of around 5 nm and a length of 14 nm. The cross-section size with a radius of about 1 nm is also in accordance with the size of the carbohydrate units. Structuring of PGM solutions at higher concentrations was investigated by analyzing semidilute and concentrated PGM samples. Starting at about 20 wt %, Bragg peaks become clearly visible indicating a more ordered mucin system. In very dehydrated and fully dry mucin samples these peaks are not present indicating lack of long-range order. The SAXS data show that the structural change occurring at about 80 wt % mucin and 25 °C corresponds to a glass transition in agreement with our previous calorimetric results. Temperature also has an effect on the phase behavior of mucin. At intermediate levels of hydration, a phase transition is observed at about 60-70 °C. The main Bragg peak appears to split in two, indicating formation of a different structure at elevated temperatures. These findings are used to improve the PGM-water phase diagram.","authors":[{"name":"Yana Znamenskaya Falk"},{"name":"Johan Engblom"},{"name":"Jan Skov Pedersen"},{"name":"Thomas Arnebrant"},{"name":"Vitaly Kocherbitov"}],"keywords":[]},"article383":{"pmid":"29989414","title":"Programming a Biofilm-Mediated Multienzyme-Assembly-Cascade System for the Biocatalytic Production of Glucosamine from Chitin.","abs":"Chitin is used as an essential raw material for the production of glucosamine (GlcN).

Our analyses show that microbial community structure differences between mats are explained by environmental NH4+, NO3-, DIN, soluble reactive silicon and conductivity. Microbial mats living under ultraoligotrophic meltwater conditions did not exhibit a dominance of cyanobacterial photoautotrophs, as has been documented for other Antarctic limnetic microbial mats. Instead, ultraoligotrophic mat communities were characterized by the presence of microbes recognized as heterotrophs and photoheterotrophs.

Although fish disease caused by P. plecoglossicida has led to significant economic losses, the mechanisms of the temperature-dependent virulence are unclear. Here, we identify potential pathogenicity mechanisms and demonstrate the direct regulation of several virulence factors by temperature with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), RNAi, pyoverdine (PVD) quantification, the chrome azurol S (CAS) assay, growth curve measurements, a biofilm assay, and artificial infection. The principal component analysis, the heat map generation and hierarchical clustering, together with the functional annotations of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) demonstrated that, under different growth temperatures, the animation and focus of P. plecoglossicida are quite different, which may be the key to pathogenicity. Genes involved in PVD synthesis and in the type VI secretion system (T6SS) are specifically upregulated at the virulent temperature of 18°C. Silencing of the PVD-synthesis-related genes reduces the iron acquisition, growth, biofilm formation, distribution in host organs and virulence of the bacteria. Silencing of the T6SS genes also leads to the reduction of biofilm formation, distribution in host organs and virulence. These findings reveal that temperature regulates multiple virulence mechanisms in P. plecoglossicida, especially through iron acquisition and T6SS secretion.

Peptide loading and release, as well as the consequences of these processes on the microgel and peptide properties, were studied by in situ ellipsometry, confocal microscopy, zeta potential measurements, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results show that the microgel-peptide interactions are electrostatically dominated, thus promoted at higher microgel charge density, while PEGylation suppresses peptide binding. PEGylation also enhances the α-helix induction observed for KYE28 upon microgel incorporation. Additionally, peptide release is facilitated at physiological salt concentration, particularly so for KYE28PEG, which illustrates the importance of electrostatic interactions. In vitro studies on Escherichia coli show that the microgel-modified surfaces display potent antifouling properties in both the absence and presence of the incorporated peptide.

The major cause of biofouling is the irreversible attachment of recalcitrant biofilms formed by bacteria and their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on membrane surfaces. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and protobiofilms are recently identified as important precursors of membrane fouling. Despite considerable amount of research on SWRO biofouling, the control of biofouling still remains a challenge. While adoption of better pretreatment methods may help in preventing membrane biofouling in new desalination setups, it is also crucial to effectively disperse old, recalcitrant biofilms and prolong membrane life in operational plants. Most current practices employ the use of broad spectrum biocides and chemicals that target bacterial cells to disperse mature biofilms, which are evidently inefficient. EPS, being known as the strongest structural framework of biofilms, it is essential to breakdown and disintegrate the EPS components for effective biofilm removal. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand the chemical composition and key elements that constitute the EPS of major biofouling bacterial groups in multi-species, mature biofilms. However, significant gaps in understanding the complexity of EPS are evident by the failure to achieve effective prevention and mitigation of fouling in most cases. Some of the reasons may be difficulty in sampling membranes from fully operational full-scale plants, poor understanding of microbial communities and their ecological shifts under dynamic operational conditions within the desalination process, selection of inappropriate model species for laboratory-scale biofouling studies, and the laborious process of extraction and purification of EPS. This article reviews the novel findings on key aspects of SWRO membrane fouling and control measures with particular emphasis on the key sugars in EPS. As a novel strategy to alleviate biofouling, future control methods may be aimed towards specifically disintegrating and breaking down these key sugars rather than using broad spectrum chemicals such as biocides that are currently used in the industry.","authors":[{"name":"Veena Nagaraj"},{"name":"Lucy Skillman"},{"name":"Dan Li"},{"name":"Goen Ho"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Control"},{"word":"Desalination"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)"},{"word":"Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes"}]}}
