It is important in the context of the global antibiotic resistance crisis. ROS is rapidly active in vitro against all Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested. ROS also has antifungal and antiviral properties. ROS prevents the formation of biofilms caused by a range of bacterial species in wounds and respiratory epithelium. ROS has been successfully used in infection prevention, eradication of multiresistant organisms, prevention of surgical site infection, and intravascular line care. This antimicrobial mechanism has great potential for the control of bioburden and biofilm at many sites, thus providing an alternative to systemic antibiotics on epithelial/mucosal surfaces, for wound and cavity infection, chronic respiratory infections and possibly recurrent urinary infections as well as local delivery to deeper structures and prosthetic devices. Its simplicity and stability lend itself to use in developing economies as well.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Dryden"},{"name":"Jonathan Cooke"},{"name":"Rami Salib"},{"name":"Rebecca Holding"},{"name":"Sylvia L F Pender"},{"name":"Jill Brooks"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Novel antimicrobial"},{"word":"Reactive oxygen species"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"28219527","title":"Induced systemic resistance and symbiotic performance of peanut plants challenged with fungal pathogens and co-inoculated with the biocontrol agent Bacillus sp.

Therefore, evaluation of co-inoculation of bacteria that promote plant growth by different mechanisms in pathogen challenged plants would contribute to increase the knowledge about how plants manage interactions with different microorganisms. The goals of this work were a) to elucidate, in greenhouse experiments, the effect of co-inoculation of peanut with Bradyrhizobium sp. SEMIA6144 and the biocontrol agent Bacillus sp. CHEP5 on growth and symbiotic performance of Sclerotium rolfsii challenged plants, and b) to evaluate field performance of these bacteria in co-inoculated peanut plants. The capacity of Bacillus sp. CHEP5 to induce systemic resistance against S. rolfsii was not affected by the inoculation of Bradyrhizobium sp. SEMIA6144. This microsymbiont, protected peanut plants from the S. rolfsii detrimental effect, reducing the stem wilt incidence. However, disease incidence in plants inoculated with the isogenic mutant Bradyrhizobium sp. SEMIA6144 V2 (unable to produce Nod factors) was as high as in pathogen challenged plants. Therefore, Bradyrhizobium sp. SEMIA6144 Nod factors play a role in the systemic resistance against S. rolfsii. Bacillus sp. CHEP5 enhanced Bradyrhizobium sp. SEMIA6144 root surface colonization and improved its symbiotic behavior, even in S. rolfsii challenged plants. Results of field trials confirmed the Bacillus sp. CHEP5 ability to protect against fungal pathogens and to improve the yield of extra-large peanut seeds from 2.15% (in Río Cuarto) to 16.69% (in Las Vertientes), indicating that co-inoculation of beneficial rhizobacteria could be a useful strategy for the peanut production under sustainable agriculture system.","authors":[{"name":"María Soledad Figueredo"},{"name":"María Laura Tonelli"},{"name":"Fernando Ibáñez"},{"name":"Federico Morla"},{"name":"Guillermo Cerioni"},{"name":"María Del Carmen Tordable"},{"name":"Adriana Fabra"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Co-inoculation"},{"word":"Induced systemic resistance"},{"word":"Nod factors"},{"word":"Nodulation"},{"word":"Peanut"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"28219526","title":"Antifungal activity of ionic liquids based on (-)-menthol: a mechanism study.","date":"2017-05-01","abs":"The mechanism of toxicity of chiral ionic liquids with (1R,2S,5R)-(-)-menthol [C","authors":[{"name":"Jakub Suchodolski"},{"name":"Joanna Feder-Kubis"},{"name":"Anna Krasowska"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungal activity"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Cell wall destruction"},{"word":"Ionic liquids"},{"word":"Membrane permeabilisation"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"28219306","title":"Infection after fracture osteosynthesis - Part II.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"In the first part of this article, we have discussed the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and classification of infection after fracture osteosynthesis with implants, termed here as osteosynthesis-associated infection (OAI).

Candida albicans, laboratory strain SC5314, and 7 commercial mouthwashes were employed: 3 with 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate; 1 with 0.06% chlorhexidine digluconate and 250 ppm F- sodium fluoride; 3 with fluorine-containing molecules. None of the mouthwashes contained ethanol in their formulations. The anti-Candida effects of the mouthwashes were assessed by disk diffusion, crystal violet and XTT assays. By using five protocols combining different dilutions and contact times the mouthwashes were tested against: 1) C. albicans growth; 2) biofilm formation; 3) survival of fungal cells in early, developing and mature Candida biofilm. Chlorhexidine digluconate-containing mouthwashes consistently exhibited the highest anti-Candida activity, irrespective of the protocols employed. Fungal growth, biofilm formation and survival of Candida cells within biofilm were impaired, the effects strictly depending on both the dilution employed and the time of contact. These in vitro studies provide evidence that mouthwashes exert anti-Candida activity against both planktonic and biofilm fungal structures, but to a different extent depending on their composition.

E. coli strains with hybrid enteroaggregative/uropathogenic (EAEC/UPEC) genotypes have sporadically emerged causing outbreaks of extraintestinal infections, however their association with routine infections is yet underappreciated. We assessed 258 isolates of E. coli recovered from 86 consecutive cases of extraintestinal infections seeking EAEC and hybrid genotype (EAEC/UPEC) strains. Extensive virulence genotyping was carried out to detect 21 virulence genes, including molecular predictors of EAEC and UPEC strains. Phylogenetic groups and sequence types (STs) were identified, as well as it was performed phylogenetic analyses in order to evaluate whether hybrid EAEC/UPEC strains belonged to intestinal or extraintestinal lineages of E. coli. Adhesion assays were performed to evaluate the biofilm formation by hybrid strains in human urine and cell culture medium (DMEM). Molecular predictors of UPEC were detected in more than 70% of the strains (chuA in 85% and fyuA in 78%). Otherwise, molecular predictors of EAEC (aatA and aggR) were detected in only 3.4% (9/258) of the strains and always along with the UPEC predictor fyuA. Additionally, the pyelonephritis-associated pilus (pap) gene was also detected in all of the hybrid EAEC/UPEC strains. EAEC/UPEC strains were recovered from two cases of community-onset urinary tract infections (UTI) and from a case of bacteremia. Analyses revealed that hybrid EAEC/UPEC strains were phylogenetically positioned in two different clades. Two representative strains, each recovered from UTI and bacteremia, were positioned into a characteristic UPEC clade marked by strains belonging to phylogenetic group D and ST3 (Warwick ST 69). Another hybrid EAEC/UPEC strain was classified as phylogroup A-ST478 and positioned in a commensal clade. Hybrid EAEC/UPEC strains formed biofilms at modest, but perceptible levels either in DMEM or in urine samples. We showed that different lineages of E. coli, at least phylogenetic group A and D, can acquire and gather EAEC and UPEC virulence genes promoting the emergence of hybrid EAEC/UPEC strains.","authors":[{"name":"Flaviane B M Lara"},{"name":"Danielly R Nery"},{"name":"Pâmela M de Oliveira"},{"name":"Mayana L Araujo"},{"name":"Fabiana R Q Carvalho"},{"name":"Lorena C F Messias-Silva"},{"name":"Leonardo B Ferreira"},{"name":"Celio Faria-Junior"},{"name":"Alex L Pereira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"enteroaggregative Escherichia coli"},{"word":"genotyping"},{"word":"hybrid strain"},{"word":"multilocus sequence typing"},{"word":"phylogenetic group"},{"word":"uropathogenic Escherichia coli"}]},"article11":{"pmid":"28216386","title":"Serotonin disturbs colon epithelial tolerance of commensal E. coli by increasing NOX2-derived superoxide.","date":"2018-03-15","abs":"Adherent-invasive E. coli colonization and Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression are increased in the gut of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. However, the underlying mechanism of such changes has not been determined. In the current study, it was examined whether gut serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can induce adherent-invasive E. coli colonization and increase TLR expression. In a co-culture system, commensal E. coli strain (BW25113, BW) adhered minimally to colon epithelial cells, but this was significantly enhanced by 5-HT to the level of a pathogenic strain (EDL933). Without inducing bacterial virulence, such as, biofilm formation, 5-HT enhanced BW-induced signaling in colon epithelial cells, that is, NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent superoxide production, the up-regulations of IL-8, TLR2, TLR4, and ICAM-1, and the down-regulations of E-cadherin and claudin-2. In a manner commensurate with these gene modulations, BW induced an increase in NF-κB and a decrease in GATA reporter signals in colon epithelial cells. However, 5-HT-enhanced BW adhesion and colon epithelial responses were blocked by knock-down of NOX2, TLR2, or TLR4. In normal mice, 5-HT induced the invasion of BW into gut submucosa, and the observed molecular changes were similar to those observed in vitro, except for significant increases in TNFα and IL-1β, and resulted in death. In dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice (an IBD disease model), in which colonic 5-HT levels were markedly elevated, BW administration induced death in along with large amount of BW invasion into colon submucosa, and time to death was negatively related to the amount of BW injected. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 5-HT induces the invasion of commensal E. coli into gut submucosa by amplifying commensal bacteria-induced epithelial signaling (superoxide production and the inductions of NOX2 and TLR2/TLR4).

The vast spread of LAB surface-associated communities and the ability to control their occurrence hold great potentials for human health and food safety biotechnologies.","authors":[{"name":"Mattia Pia Arena"},{"name":"Vittorio Capozzi"},{"name":"Giuseppe Spano"},{"name":"Daniela Fiocco"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biotic and abiotic surfaces"},{"word":"Lactic acid bacteria"},{"word":"Probiotics"}]},"article24":{"pmid":"28213708","title":"Removal mechanisms for extremely high-level fluoroquinolone antibiotics in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) receive industrial effluents from the plant that contain extremely high levels of antibiotics and are regarded as one of the major sources of antibiotics in the environment.

PWWTP A uses activated sludge with biocarriers in a moving bed biofilm reactor in anoxic and aerobic units, and PWWTP B uses biological units under anaerobic, aerobic, and anoxic conditions. The wastewater samples and solid samples (sludge and suspended solid matter) were analyzed using solid-phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Thus, clindamycin enters wastewater via human excretion or disposal of unused medication and widespread detection of pharmaceuticals in rivers proves the insufficiency of conventional wastewater treatment plants in removing clindamycin. Recently, it has been discovered that attached biofilm reactors, e.g., moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) obtain a higher removal of pharmaceuticals than conventional sludge wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, this study investigated the capability of MBBRs applied in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove clindamycin. First, a batch experiment was executed with a high initial concentration of clindamycin to identify the transformation products. It was shown that clindamycin can be removed from wastewater by MBBR and the treatment process converts clindamycin into the, possibly persistent, products clindamycin sulfoxide and N-desmethyl clindamycin as well as 3 other mono-oxygenated products. Subsequently, the removal kinetics of clindamycin and the formation of the two identified products were investigated in batch experiments using MBBR carriers from polishing and nitrifying reactors.

Bacterial biofilms are a significant problem in clinical settings owing to their increased tolerance towards conventionally prescribed antibiotics and their propensity for selection of further antibacterial resistance. There is therefore a pressing need for the development of alternative therapeutic strategies that can improve antibiotic efficacy towards biofilms. ROS has been successful in treating chronic wounds and in clearing multidrug-resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and carbapenemase-producing isolates from wounds and vascular line sites. There is significant antifungal activity of ROS against planktonic and biofilm forms. Nebulised ROS has been evaluated in limited subjects to assess reductions in bioburden in chronically colonised respiratory tracts. The antibiofilm activity of ROS could have great implications for the treatment of a variety of persistent respiratory conditions. Use of ROS on internal prosthetic devices shows promise.

Results showed that PM1 displayed major motility and a capacity to form biofilm and was associated with an anti-inflammatory response of host cells. Conversely, PM2 exhibited lack motility and a had slower organization in biofilm but promoted an increase of proinflammatory cytokine expression in infected epithelial cells.

Permanently attached coatings of antimicrobial molecules are of particular interest because of the reduced cytoxicity and lower risk of developing resistance compared to controlled release coatings. In this study, we focus on the chemical grafting of bioactive molecules on titanium. To concentrate the molecules at the metallic implant surface, we propose electrophoretic deposition (EPD) applying alternating current (AC) signals with an asymmetrical wave shape. We show that for the model molecule bovine serum albumin (BSA), as well as for the clinically relevant antifungal lipopeptide caspofungin (CASP), the deposition yield is drastically improved by superimposing a DC offset in the direction of the high-amplitude peak of the AC signal. Additionally, in order to produce immobilized CASP coatings, this experimental AC/DC-EPD method is combined with an established surface activation protocol. Principle component analysis (PCA) of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) data confirm the immobilization of CASP with higher yield as compared to a diffusion-controlled process, and higher purity than the clinical CASP starting suspensions. Scratch testing data indicate good coating adhesion. Importantly, the coatings remain active against the fungal pathogen C. albicans as shown by in vitro biofilm experiments. In summary, this paper delivers a proof-of-concept for the application of AC-EPD as a fast grafting tool for antimicrobial molecules without compromising their activities.","authors":[{"name":"Annabel Braem"},{"name":"Katrijn De Brucker"},{"name":"Nicolas Delattin"},{"name":"Manuela S Killian"},{"name":"Maarten B J Roeffaers"},{"name":"Tomohiko Yoshioka"},{"name":"Satoshi Hayakawa"},{"name":"Patrik Schmuki"},{"name":"Bruno P A Cammue"},{"name":"Sannakaisa Virtanen"},{"name":"Karin Thevissen"},{"name":"Bram Neirinck"}],"keywords":[{"word":"alternating current"},{"word":"antifungal activity"},{"word":"biofilm prevention"},{"word":"biofunctionalization"},{"word":"caspofungin"},{"word":"electrophoretic deposition"},{"word":"titanium"}]},"article37":{"pmid":"28211844","title":"A tool named Iris for versatile high-throughput phenotyping in microorganisms.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Advances in our ability to systematically introduce and track controlled genetic variance in microorganisms have, in the past decade, fuelled high-throughput reverse genetics approaches.

Sixty samples were collected in four types of matrices (plant biofilms, water filtrate residues, plant detritus and soils) from three water bodies frequently used by the population.

The extracellular matrix represents a continuous challenge in terms of characterization and analysis. The tools applied in more detailed studies comprise extraction/chemical analysis, molecular characterization, and visualisation using various techniques. Imaging by laser microscopy became a standard tool for biofilm analysis, and, in combination with fluorescently labelled lectins, the glycoconjugates of the matrix can be assessed. By employing this approach a wide range of pure culture biofilms from different habitats were examined using the commercially available lectins. From the results, a binary barcode pattern of lectin binding can be generated. Furthermore, the results can be fine-tuned and transferred into a heat map according to signal intensity. The lectin barcode approach is suggested as a useful tool for investigating the biofilm matrix characteristics and dynamics at various levels, e.g. bacterial cell surfaces, adhesive footprints, individual microcolonies, and the gross biofilm or bio-aggregate. Hence fluorescence lectin bar-coding (FLBC) serves as a basis for a subsequent tailor-made fluorescence lectin-binding analysis (FLBA) of a particular biofilm. So far, the lectin approach represents the only tool for in situ characterization of the glycoconjugate makeup in biofilm systems.  Furthermore, lectin staining lends itself to other fluorescence techniques in order to correlate it with cellular biofilm constituents in general and glycoconjugate producers in particular.","authors":[{"name":"Thomas R Neu"},{"name":"Ute Kuhlicke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm matrix"},{"word":"confocal laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"confocal microscopy"},{"word":"extracellular matrix (ECM)"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)"},{"word":"fluorescence labelled lectin"},{"word":"glycoconjugate"},{"word":"laser microscopy"},{"word":"lectin"}]},"article47":{"pmid":"28208370","title":"Emergent pattern formation in an interstitial biofilm.","date":"2018-09-27","abs":"Collective behavior of bacterial colonies plays critical roles in adaptability, survivability, biofilm expansion and infection. We employ an individual-based model of an interstitial biofilm to study emergent pattern formation based on the assumptions that rod-shaped bacteria furrow through a viscous environment and excrete extracellular polymeric substances which bias their rate of motion. Because the bacteria furrow through their environment, the substratum stiffness is a key control parameter behind the formation of distinct morphological patterns. By systematically varying this property (which we quantify with a stiffness coefficient γ), we show that subtle changes in the substratum stiffness can give rise to a stable state characterized by a high degree of local order and long-range pattern formation. The ordered state exhibits characteristics typically associated with bacterial fitness advantages, even though it is induced by changes in environmental conditions rather than changes in biological parameters. Our findings are applicable to a broad range of biofilms and provide insights into the relationship between bacterial movement and their environment, and basic mechanisms behind self-organization of biophysical systems.","authors":[{"name":"Cameron Zachreson"},{"name":"Christian Wolff"},{"name":"Cynthia B Whitchurch"},{"name":"Milos Toth"}],"keywords":[]},"article48":{"pmid":"28208235","title":"Warmer night-time temperature promotes microbial heterotrophic activity and modifies stream sediment community.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Diel temperature patterns are changing because of global warming, with higher temperatures being predicted to be more pronounced at night. Biological reactions are temperature dependent, with some occurring only during the daylight hours (e.g., light photosynthesis) and other during the entire day (e.g., respiration). Consequently, we expect the modification of daily temperature cycles to alter microbial biological reactions in stream sediments. Here, we aimed to study the effect of warming and changes of the diel temperature patterns on stream sediment biofilm functions tied to organic carbon decomposition, as well as on biofilm meiofaunal community structure. We performed an eight-week experiment with 12 artificial streams subjected to three different diel temperature patterns: warming, warmer nights and control. Significant effects of warming on biofilm function and structure were mainly detected in the long term. Our results showed that warming altered biofilm function, especially in the warmer nights' treatment, which enhanced β-glucosidase enzyme activity. Interestingly, clear opposite diel patterns were observed for dissolved organic carbon and β-glucosidase activity, suggesting that, at night, sediment bacteria quickly consume the input of photosynthetic dissolved organic carbon labile compounds created during light-time. The biofilm structure was also altered by warming, as both warming and warmer night treatments enhanced copepod abundance and diminished abundances of turbellaria and nematodes, which, in turn, controlled bacterial, algal and ciliate communities. Overall, we conclude that warming has strong effect on sediment biofilm structure and enhanced microbial organic matter degradation which might, consequently, affect higher trophic levels and river carbon cycling.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Freixa"},{"name":"Vicenç Acuña"},{"name":"Maria Casellas"},{"name":"Stoyana Pecheva"},{"name":"Anna M Romaní"}],"keywords":[{"word":"artificial streams"},{"word":"diel cycles"},{"word":"dissolved organic carbon"},{"word":"extracellular enzyme activities"},{"word":"global warming"},{"word":"meiofauna"}]},"article49":{"pmid":"28207869","title":"Impact of wall shear stress on initial bacterial adhesion in rotating annular reactor.","date":"2019-02-08","abs":"The objective of this study was to investigate the bacterial adhesion under different wall shear stresses in turbulent flow and using a diverse bacterial consortium.

However, the role of biofilm formation in the transferability of L. monocytogenes EGDe remains controversial. We examined the growth of Listeria biofilms on stainless steel surfaces and their effect on the transferability of L. monocytogenes EGDe. The experiments were a factorial 2 × 2 design with at least three biological replicates. Through scanning electron microscopy, a mature biofilm with intensive aggregates of cells was observed on the surface of stainless steel after 3 or 5 days of incubation, depending on the initial level of inoculation. During biofilm development, L. monocytogenes EGDe carried out binary fission vigorously before a mature biofilm was formed and subsequently changed its cellular morphology from rod shaped to sphere shaped. Furthermore, static biofilm, which was formed after 3 days of incubation at 25°C, significantly inhibited the transfer rate of L. monocytogenes EGDe from stainless steel blades to 15 bologna slices. During 7 days of storage at 4°C, however, bacterial growth rate was not significantly impacted by whether bacteria were transferred from biofilm and the initial concentrations of transferred bacteria on the slice.

Mtb with lowered expression of PE11 (PE11 knock-down) displayed significant changes in colony morphology and cell wall lipid profile, confirming the role of PE11 in cell wall architecture. In addition, the levels of phthiocerol dimycocerosates, a cell wall virulence factor, were decreased. Levels of trehalose esters and free mycolic acids were increased.

We report the cultivation and complete genome sequence of Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus exaquare, a novel AOA representative from a municipal WWTP in Guelph, Ontario (Canada). In enrichment culture, Ca. N. exaquare oxidizes ammonia to nitrite stoichiometrically, is mesophilic, and tolerates at least 15 mm of ammonium chloride or sodium nitrite. Microautoradiography (MAR) for enrichment cultures demonstrates that Ca. N. exaquare assimilates bicarbonate in association with ammonia oxidation. However, despite using inorganic carbon, the ammonia-oxidizing activity of Ca. N. exaquare is greatly stimulated in enrichment culture by the addition of organic compounds, especially malate and succinate. Ca. N. exaquare cells are coccoid with a diameter of ~1-2 μm. Phylogenetically, Ca. N. exaquare belongs to the Nitrososphaera sister cluster within the Group I.1b Thaumarchaeota, a lineage which includes most other reported AOA sequences from municipal and industrial WWTPs. The 2.99 Mbp genome of Ca. N. exaquare encodes pathways for ammonia oxidation, bicarbonate fixation, and urea transport and breakdown. In addition, this genome encodes several key genes for dealing with oxidative stress, including peroxidase and catalase. Incubations of WWTP biofilm demonstrate partial inhibition of ammonia-oxidizing activity by 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), suggesting that Ca. N. exaquare-like AOA may contribute to nitrification in situ. However, CARD-FISH-MAR showed no incorporation of bicarbonate by detected Thaumarchaeaota, suggesting that detected AOA may incorporate non-bicarbonate carbon sources or rely on an alternative and yet unknown metabolism.","authors":[{"name":"Laura A Sauder"},{"name":"Mads Albertsen"},{"name":"Katja Engel"},{"name":"Jasmin Schwarz"},{"name":"Per H Nielsen"},{"name":"Michael Wagner"},{"name":"Josh D Neufeld"}],"keywords":[]},"article72":{"pmid":"28195455","title":"Hydrolytic Stability of 3-Aminopropylsilane Coupling Agent on Silica and Silicate Surfaces at Elevated Temperatures.","date":"2018-07-25","abs":"3-Aminopropylsilane (APS) coupling agent is widely used in industrial, biomaterial, and medical applications to improve adhesion of polymers to inorganic materials. However, during exposure to elevated humidity and temperature, the deposited APS layers can decompose, leading to reduction in coupling efficiency, thus decreasing the product quality and the mechanical strength of the polymer-inorganic material interface. Therefore, a better understanding of the chemical state and stability of APS on inorganic surfaces is needed. In this work, we investigated APS adhesion on silica wafers and compared its properties with those on complex silicate surfaces such as those used by industry (mineral fibers and fiber melt wafers). The APS was deposited from aqueous and organic (toluene) solutions and studied with surface sensitive techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), streaming potential, contact angle, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. APS configuration on a model silica surface at a range of coverages was simulated using density functional theory (DFT). We also studied the stability of adsorbed APS during aging at high humidity and elevated temperature. Our results demonstrated that APS layer formation depends on the choice of solvent and substrate used for deposition. On silica surfaces in toluene, APS formed unstable multilayers, while from aqueous solutions, thinner and more stable APS layers were produced. The chemical composition and substrate roughness influence the amount of deposited APS. More APS was deposited and its layers were more stable on fiber melt than on silica wafers. The changes in the amount of adsorbed APS can be successfully monitored by streaming potential. These results will aid in improving industrial- and laboratory-scale APS deposition methods and increasing adhesion and stability, thus increasing the quality and effectiveness of materials where APS is used as a coupling agent.","authors":[{"name":"Denis V Okhrimenko"},{"name":"Akin Budi"},{"name":"Marcel Ceccato"},{"name":"Marité Cárdenas"},{"name":"Dorte B Johansson"},{"name":"Dorthe Lybye"},{"name":"Klaus Bechgaard"},{"name":"Martin P Andersson"},{"name":"Susan L S Stipp"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"aminosilane"},{"word":"coatings"},{"word":"fibers"},{"word":"material stability"},{"word":"mineral wool"},{"word":"surface treatment"}]},"article73":{"pmid":"28195384","title":"Air pollution alters Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae biofilms, antibiotic tolerance and colonisation.","date":"2019-11-17","abs":"Air pollution is the world's largest single environmental health risk (WHO).

The effects of particulate matter on human health are well established however the effects on bacteria, organisms central to ecosystems in humans and in the natural environment, are poorly understood. We report here for the first time that black carbon drastically changes the development of bacterial biofilms, key aspects of bacterial colonisation and survival. Our data show that exposure to black carbon induces structural, compositional and functional changes in the biofilms of both S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. Importantly, the tolerance of the biofilms to multiple antibiotics and proteolytic degradation is significantly affected. Additionally, our results show that black carbon impacts bacterial colonisation in vivo. In a mouse nasopharyngeal colonisation model, black carbon caused S. pneumoniae to spread from the nasopharynx to the lungs, which is essential for subsequent infection. Therefore our study highlights that air pollution has a significant effect on bacteria that has been largely overlooked. Consequently these findings have important implications concerning the impact of air pollution on human health and bacterial ecosystems worldwide.","authors":[{"name":"Shane J K Hussey"},{"name":"Joanne Purves"},{"name":"Natalie Allcock"},{"name":"Vitor E Fernandes"},{"name":"Paul S Monks"},{"name":"Julian M Ketley"},{"name":"Peter W Andrew"},{"name":"Julie A Morrissey"}],"keywords":[]},"article74":{"pmid":"28195220","title":"Induction of Invertebrate Larval Settlement; Different Bacteria, Different Mechanisms?","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Recruitment via settlement of pelagic larvae is critical for the persistence of benthic marine populations. For many benthic invertebrates, larval settlement occurs in response to surface microbial films. Larvae of the serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans can be induced to settle by single bacterial species. Until now, only Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea had been subjected to detailed genetic and mechanistic studies. To determine if the complex structures, termed tailocins, derived from phage-tail gene assemblies and hypothesized to be the settlement cue in P. luteoviolacea were present in all inductive bacteria, genomic comparisons with inductive strains of Cellulophaga lytica, Bacillus aquimaris and Staphylococcus warneri were undertaken. They revealed that the gene assemblies for tailocins are lacking in these other bacteria. Negatively stained TEM images confirmed the absence of tailocins and revealed instead large numbers of extracellular vesicles in settlement-inductive fractions from all three bacteria. TEM imaging confirmed for C. lytica that the vesicles are budded from cell surfaces in a manner consistent with the production of outer membrane vesicles. Finding multiple bacteria settlement cues highlights the importance of further studies into the role of bacterial extracellular vesicles in eliciting settlement and metamorphosis of benthic marine larvae.","authors":[{"name":"Marnie L Freckelton"},{"name":"Brian T Nedved"},{"name":"Michael G Hadfield"}],"keywords":[]},"article75":{"pmid":"28194955","title":"Luminometric Label Array for Counting and Differentiation of Bacteria.","date":"2019-01-02","abs":"Methods for simple and fast detection and differentiation of bacterial species are required, for instance, in medicine, water quality monitoring, and the food industry. Here, we have developed a novel label array method for the counting and differentiation of bacterial species. This method is based on the nonspecific interactions of multiple unstable lanthanide chelates and selected chemicals within the sample leading to a luminescence signal profile that is unique to the bacterial species. It is simple, cost-effective, and/or user-friendly compared to many existing methods, such as plate counts on selective media, automatic (hemocytometer-based) cell counters, flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for identification. The performance of the method was demonstrated with nine single strains of bacteria in pure culture. The limit of detection for counting was below 1000 bacteria per mL, with an average coefficient of variation of 10% achieved with the developed label array. A predictive model was trained with the measured luminescence signals and its ability to differentiate all tested bacterial species from each other, including members of the same genus Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis, was confirmed via leave-one-out cross-validation. The suitability of the method for analysis of mixtures of bacterial species was shown with ternary mixtures of Bacillus licheniformis, Escherichia coli JM109, and Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 4659. The potential future application of the method could be monitoring for contamination in pure cultures; analysis of mixed bacterial cultures, where examining one species in the presence of another could inform industrial microbial processes; and the analysis of bacterial biofilms, where nonspecific methods based on physical and chemical characteristics are required instead of methods specific to individual bacterial species.","authors":[{"name":"Milla Högmander"},{"name":"Catherine J Paul"},{"name":"Sandy Chan"},{"name":"Elina Hokkanen"},{"name":"Ville Eskonen"},{"name":"Tapio Pahikkala"},{"name":"Sari Pihlasalo"}],"keywords":[]},"article77":{"pmid":"28194715","title":"Does Extracellular DNA Production Vary in Staphylococcal Biofilms Isolated From Infected Implants versus Controls?","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Prosthetic implant infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis are major challenges for early diagnosis and treatment owing to biofilm formation on the implant surface.

Numerous works have addressed the taxonomic composition of bacteria in communities, but little is known about trait heterogeneity in closely related bacteria that co-occur in communities. We evaluated a sample of 467 isolates from the Churince water system of the Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB), enriched for Bacillus spp. The 16S rRNA gene revealed a random distribution of taxonomic groups within this genus among 11 sampling sites. A subsample of 141 Bacillus spp. isolates from sediment, with seven well-represented species was chosen to evaluate the heterogeneity and the phylogenetic signal of phenotypic traits that are known to diverge within small clades, such as substrate utilization, and traits that are conserved deep in the lineage, such as prototrophy, swarming and biofilm formation. We were especially interested in evaluating social traits, such as swarming and biofilm formation, for which cooperation is needed to accomplish a multicellular behavior and for which there is little information from natural communities. The phylogenetic distribution of traits, evaluated by the Purvis and Fritz's D statistics approached a Brownian model of evolution. Analysis of the phylogenetic relatedness of the clusters of members sharing the trait using consenTRAIT algorithm, revealed more clustering and deeper phylogenetic signal for prototrophy, biofilm and swimming compared to the data obtained for substrate utilization. The explanation to the observed Brownian evolution of social traits could be either loss due to complete dispensability or to compensated trait loss due to the availability of public goods. Since many of the evaluated traits can be considered to be collective action traits, such as swarming, motility and biofilm formation, the observed microdiversity within taxonomic groups might be explained by distributed functions in structured communities.","authors":[{"name":"María Dolores Rodríguez-Torres"},{"name":"África Islas-Robles"},{"name":"Zulema Gómez-Lunar"},{"name":"Luis Delaye"},{"name":"Ismael Hernández-González"},{"name":"Valeria Souza"},{"name":"Michael Travisano"},{"name":"Gabriela Olmedo-Álvarez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus spp."},{"word":"collective action"},{"word":"microbial communities"},{"word":"phenotypic trait loss"},{"word":"phylogenetic signal"}]},"article80":{"pmid":"28194111","title":"Syringa oblata Lindl.

Here, we use environmental samples of wine and flor yeasts to investigate the genomic basis of yeast adaptation to contrasted anthropogenic environments. Phylogenetic inference and population structure analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed a group of flor yeasts separated from wine yeasts. A combination of methods revealed several highly differentiated regions between wine and flor yeasts, and analyses using codon-substitution models for detecting molecular adaptation identified sites under positive selection in the high-affinity transporter gene ZRT1. The cross-population composite likelihood ratio revealed selective sweeps at three regions, including in the hexose transporter gene HXT7, the yapsin gene YPS6 and the membrane protein coding gene MTS27. Our analyses also revealed that the biological ageing environment has led to the accumulation of numerous mutations in proteins from several networks, including Flo11 regulation and divalent metal transport. Together, our findings suggest that the tuning of FLO11 expression and zinc transport networks are a distinctive feature of the genetic changes underlying the domestication of flor yeasts.

While laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) is often used to analyze in situ and in vivo biofilms, this technology becomes very challenging when applied to bacterial biofilms on fungal hyphae, due to the thickness and the three dimensions of the hyphal networks.

The nutrient and iron concentrations delivered to the barrier demonstrated high temporal variability with significant iron precipitation observed across the bed. The surface of the granular activated carbon was largely free from cell attachment while natural zeolite demonstrated patchy biofilm formation after 15 months following PRB installation.

These infections involve the formation of sessile microbial communities, called biofilms. Biofilms possess unique physical and biochemical properties and are hard to treat conventionally. There is a great demand for innovative methods to functionalize surfaces antibacterially, which could be used as the basis of new implant technologies. Present, there are few test systems to evaluate bacterial growth on these surfaces under physiological flow conditions.

As a result it could be shown that biofilms of the five important oral bacteria Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, can be reproducibly formed on the surface of titanium, a frequent implant material.

Histopathologic and immunohistochemical investigation of 10 natural cases of bovine H. somni myocarditis and 1 case of ITME revealed intravascular H. somni in large biofilm-like aggregates adherent to the luminal surface of microvascular endothelium. Ultrastructurally, bacterial communities were extracellular and closely associated with degenerating or contracted endothelial cells. Histophilus somni was identified by bacterial culture and/or immunohistochemistry. Western blots of the bacterial isolates revealed that they expressed the immunodominant protective 40 kDa OMP and immunoglobulin-binding protein A (IbpA) antigens. The latter is a large surface antigen and shed fibrillar antigen with multiple domains. The cytotoxic DR2Fic domain of IbpA was conserved as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. Treatment of endothelial cells in vitro with IbpA in crude culture supernatants or purified recombinant GST-IbpA DR2Fic (rDR2) cytotoxin induced retraction of cultured bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells. By contrast, no retraction of bovine endothelium was induced by mutant rDR2H/A with an inactive Fic motif or by a GST control, indicating that the cytotoxic DR2Fic motif plays an important role in endothelial cell retraction in vasculitis.

Additionally, identifying novel drug targets is challenging because there are many similarities between fungal and human cells. The most common antifungal targets include fungal RNA synthesis and cell wall and membrane components, though new antifungal targets are being investigated. Nonetheless, fungi have developed resistance mechanisms, such as overexpression of eﬄux pump proteins and biofilm formation, emphasizing the importance of understanding these mechanisms. To address these problems, different approaches to preventing and treating fungal diseases are described in this review, with a focus on the resistance mechanisms of fungi, with the goal of developing efficient strategies to overcoming and preventing resistance as well as new advances in antifungal therapy. Due to the limited antifungal arsenal, researchers have sought to improve treatment via different approaches, and the synergistic effect obtained by the combination of antifungals contributes to reducing toxicity and could be an alternative for treatment. Another important issue is the development of new formulations for antifungal agents, and interest in nanoparticles as new types of carriers of antifungal drugs has increased. In addition, modifications to the chemical structures of traditional antifungals have improved their activity and pharmacokinetic parameters. Moreover, a different approach to preventing and treating fungal diseases is immunotherapy, which involves different mechanisms, such as vaccines, activation of the immune response and inducing the production of host antimicrobial molecules. Finally, the use of a mini-host has been encouraging for in vivo testing because these animal models demonstrate a good correlation with the mammalian model; they also increase the speediness of as well as facilitate the preliminary testing of new antifungal agents.

When twitching motility occurs at the interface of an abiotic surface and solidified nutrient media, it can lead to the emergence of extensive self-organized patterns of interconnected trails that form as a consequence of the actively migrating bacteria forging a furrow network in the substratum beneath the expanding biofilm. These furrows appear to direct bacterial movements much in the same way that roads and footpaths coordinate motor vehicle and human pedestrian traffic. Self-organizing systems such as these can be accounted for by the concept of stigmergy which describes self-organization that emerges through indirect communication via persistent signals within the environment. Many bacterial communities are able to actively migrate across solid and semi-solid surfaces through complex multicellular collective behaviors such as twitching motility and flagella-mediated swarming motility. Here, we have examined the potential of exploiting the stigmergic behavior of furrow-mediated trail following as a means of controlling bacterial biofilm expansion along abiotic surfaces. We found that incorporation of a series of parallel micro-fabricated furrows significantly impeded active biofilm expansion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris. We observed that in both cases bacterial movements tended to be directed along the furrows. We also observed that narrow furrows were most effective at disrupting biofilm expansion as they impeded the ability of cells to self-organize into multicellular assemblies required for escape from the furrows and migration into new territory. Our results suggest that the implementation of micro-fabricated furrows that exploit stigmergy may be a novel approach to impeding active biofilm expansion across abiotic surfaces such as those used in medical and industrial settings.","authors":[{"name":"Erin S Gloag"},{"name":"Christopher Elbadawi"},{"name":"Cameron J Zachreson"},{"name":"Igor Aharonovich"},{"name":"Milos Toth"},{"name":"Ian G Charles"},{"name":"Lynne Turnbull"},{"name":"Cynthia B Whitchurch"}],"keywords":[{"word":"T4P"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"collective behavior"},{"word":"self-organization"},{"word":"swarming motility"},{"word":"tfp"},{"word":"twitching motility"}]},"article139":{"pmid":"28167629","title":"IL-10 Plays Opposing Roles during Staphylococcus aureus Systemic and Localized Infections.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory mediator that plays a crucial role in limiting host immunopathology during bacterial infections by controlling effector T cell activation.

Here, we scrutinized how c-di-GMP affects molecular motor properties and adhesive behavior of T4P. By means of retraction, T4P generated forces of ∼30 pN.

For both reference and clinical strains, a significant inhibition of the hyphae formation was observed when C. albicans was incubated in the presence of C. krusei or C. glabrata compared to the control group composed only by C. albicans. In addition, the culture mixed of C. albicans-C. krusei or C. albicans-C. glabrata reduced significantly the expression of HWP1 gene of C. albicans in relation to single cultures of this specie. In both filamentation and gene expression assays, C. krusei showed the higher inhibitory activity on the morphogenesis of C. albicans compared to C. glabrata.

Using amino acid substitution, we designed and synthesized a series of FK13 analogs based on the sequence of the 13-meric short FK13 peptide (residues 17-29 of LL-37) that has been identified as the region responsible for the antimicrobial activity of LL-37.

Biofilm formation capacity, a phenotype that is lost in the majority of strains, plays a role in persistence in dairy environments, such as milk pasteurization and cheese manufacturing plants. To investigate this property, we have studied S. thermophilus UC8547, a fast-acidifying dairy starter culture selected for its high capacity to form biofilm on stainless steel under environmental conditions resembling the dairy environment. Using a dynamic flow cell apparatus, it was shown that S. thermophilus UC8547 biofilm formation on stainless steel depends on the presence of milk proteins. From this strain, which harbors the prtS gene for the cell wall protease and shows an aggregative phenotype, spontaneous mutants with impaired biofilm capacity can be isolated at high frequency. These mutants lack the PrtS expendable island, as confirmed by comparison of the genome sequence of UC8547Δ3 with that of the parent strain. The prtS island excision occurs between two 26-bp direct repeats located in the two copies of the ISSth1 flanking this genomic island. The central role of PrtS was confirmed by analyzing the derivative strain UC8547Δ16, whose prtS gene was interrupted by an insertional mutation, thereby making it incapable of biofilm formation. PrtS, acting as a binding substance between the milk proteins adhered to stainless steel and S. thermophilus cell envelopes, mediates biofilm formation in dairy environments. This feature provides S. thermophilus with an ecological benefit for its survival and persistence in this environment.","authors":[{"name":"D Bassi"},{"name":"F Cappa"},{"name":"S Gazzola"},{"name":"L Orrù"},{"name":"P S Cocconcelli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PrtS"},{"word":"Streptococcus thermophilus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"genome"},{"word":"milk"},{"word":"stainless steel"}]},"article165":{"pmid":"28159655","title":"Screening a repurposing library for potentiators of antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.","date":"2017-03-15","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus biofilms are involved in a wide range of infections that are extremely difficult to treat with conventional antibiotic therapy.

The aims of this investigation were to determine if DAAs disrupt biofilms in early and late growth stages for clinical E. faecalis strains and to test their efficacy in disrupting E. faecalis biofilms grown in sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of commonly used endodontic biocides.

Furthermore, the development of new antifungal is currently unable to keep pace with the urgent demand for safe and effective new drugs. Auranofin, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibits growth of a diverse array of clinical isolates of fungi and represents a new antifungal agent with a previously unexploited mechanism of action. In addition to auranofin's potent antifungal activity against planktonic fungi, this drug significantly reduces the metabolic activity of Candida cells encased in a biofilm. Unbiased chemogenomic profiling, using heterozygous S. cerevisiae deletion strains, combined with growth assays revealed three probable targets for auranofin's antifungal activity-mia40, acn9, and coa4. Mia40 is of particular interest given its essential role in oxidation of cysteine rich proteins imported into the mitochondria. Biochemical analysis confirmed auranofin targets the Mia40-Erv1 pathway as the drug inhibited Mia40 from interacting with its substrate, Cmc1, in a dose-dependent manner similar to the control, MB-7. Furthermore, yeast mitochondria overexpressing Erv1 were shown to exhibit resistance to auranofin as an increase in Cmc1 import was observed compared to wild-type yeast. Further in vivo antifungal activity of auranofin was examined in a Caenorhabditis elegans animal model of Cryptococcus neoformans infection. Auranofin significantly reduced the fungal load in infected C. elegans. Collectively, the present study provides valuable evidence that auranofin has significant promise to be repurposed as a novel antifungal agent and may offer a safe, effective, and quick supplement to current approaches for treating fungal infections.","authors":[{"name":"Shankar Thangamani"},{"name":"Matthew Maland"},{"name":"Haroon Mohammad"},{"name":"Pete E Pascuzzi"},{"name":"Larisa Avramova"},{"name":"Carla M Koehler"},{"name":"Tony R Hazbun"},{"name":"Mohamed N Seleem"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mia40-Erv1 pathway"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"auranofin"},{"word":"chemogenomic profiling"},{"word":"repurposing"}]},"article191":{"pmid":"28149291","title":"Sampling Modification Effects in the Subgingival Microbiome Profile of Healthy Children.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Elisabeth Santigli"},{"name":"Slave Trajanoski"},{"name":"Katharina Eberhard"},{"name":"Barbara Klug"}],"keywords":[{"word":"454-pyrosequencing"},{"word":"healthy children"},{"word":"next generation sequencing (NGS)"},{"word":"oral microbiome"},{"word":"paper point"},{"word":"subgingival biofilm"},{"word":"subgingival sampling"}]},"article192":{"pmid":"28149170","title":"Effectiveness of five antidandruff cosmetic formulations against planktonic cells and biofilms of dermatophytes.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"This study aimed to investigate the in vitro antifungal effectiveness of five different formulations against dandruff and ringworm dermatophytes.

Currently, there is no gold standard for definite diagnosis of PJI. A multi-criteria definition has been described for PJI based on microbiology cultures, serum markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid biomarkers, such as leukocyte esterase and histopathology assessment of the periprosthetic tissue. The conventional serum markers are generally nonspecific and can be elevated in inflammatory conditions. Therefore, they cannot be relied on for definite diagnosis of PJI. Hence, with the use of proteomics, synovial fluid biomarkers such as α-defensin, IL-6, and CRP have been proposed as more accurate biomarkers for PJI. Current methods to culture micro-organisms have several limitations, and can be false-negative and false-positive in a considerable number of cases. In an attempt to improve culture sensitivity, diagnostic methods to target biofilms have recently been studied. The understanding of the concept of biofilms has also allowed for the development of novel techniques for PJI diagnosis, such as visualizing biofilms with fluorescent in-situ hybridization and detection of bacteria via DNA microarray.

The complementation of TF2758 with rob from FK300, an rsbU-repaired derivative of S. aureus strain NCTC8325-4, significantly decreased biofilm elaboration, suggesting a role for rob in this process. The deletion of rob in non-biofilm-producing FK300 significantly increased biofilm elaboration and PIA/PNAG production.

Importantly, this model includes an alternate view of the processes involved in microcolony formation in S. aureus and suggests that these structures originate as a result of stochastically regulated metabolic heterogeneity and proliferation within a maturing biofilm population, rather than a subtractive process involving the release of cell clusters from a thick, unstructured biofilm.

Here, we present the design and characterization of an adhesive, osteoconductive, and antimicrobial hydrogel coating for Ti implants. To form this multifunctional hydrogel, a photo-cross-linkable gelatin-based hydrogel was modified with catechol motifs to enhance adhesion to Ti surfaces and thus promote coating stability. To induce antimicrobial and osteoconductive properties, a short cationic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and synthetic silicate nanoparticles (SNs) were introduced into the hydrogel formulation.

Here, we describe an efficient approach for hit generation, which may be called biofocussed chemoprospecting. With bio-likeness and ease of synthesis as priority criteria, libraries may be constructed with good optimization potential, physicochemical diversity, drug likeness and low cost. Following this approach, two libraries based on linear and cyclic dipeptide scaffolds were designed, first as virtual libraries comprising of more than 30000 compounds, and after subsequent filtering, as a small library of a total of 51 compounds. These provided good diversity at low cost, and were tested for bioactivities. The discovery of six active compounds demonstrates a hit rate greater than 10%. This is comparable to target-based approaches, but the chemoprospecting method described here has the additional potential to identify new targets and mechanisms.","authors":[{"name":"Balmukund Sureshkumar Thakkar"},{"name":"Marte Albrigtsen"},{"name":"John Sigurd Svendsen"},{"name":"Jeanette H Andersen"},{"name":"Richard Alan Engh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"cheminformatics"},{"word":"chemoprospecting"},{"word":"drug discovery"},{"word":"peptidomimetic"},{"word":"small molecule diversity"}]},"article210":{"pmid":"28139725","title":"Quality Control by Isoleucyl-tRNA Synthetase of Bacillus subtilis Is Required for Efficient Sporulation.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) is an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase whose essential function is to aminoacylate tRNA","authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth Kermgard"},{"name":"Zhou Yang"},{"name":"Annika-Marisa Michel"},{"name":"Rachel Simari"},{"name":"Jacqueline Wong"},{"name":"Michael Ibba"},{"name":"Beth A Lazazzera"}],"keywords":[]},"article211":{"pmid":"28139587","title":"[The use of self-adapting system files (SAF) for controlling microbial biofilms of root canals in the treatment of apical periodontitis].","date":"2018-10-23","abs":"The aim of this study was to conduct a clinical and laboratory study and evaluate the effectiveness of endodontic root canal treatment using a self-adapting files system (SAF) in the complex treatment of patients with chronic apical periodontitis. 3% sodium hypochlorite solution was used as irrigation agent in all groups which included 20 patients treated with conventional manual tools, 21 patients receiving treatment with ultrasonic activation of irrigant and 26 patients treated with SAF system.

Strategies to induce biofilm dispersal are of interest, because of their potential in preventing biofilm-related infections. Our previous work demonstrated that n-butanolic Cyclamen coum extract with ciprofloxacin could eliminate 1- and 3-day-old P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms. To gain new insights into the role of C. coum extract and its synergistic effect with ciprofloxacin in eliminating P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) in combination with mass spectrometry-based protein identification were used. Changes in the bacterial protein expression were analyzed when 3-day-old biofilm cells were exposed to the C. coum extract alone and in combination with ciprofloxacin. Proteins involved in alginate biosynthesis, quorum sensing, adaptation/protection, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism showed a weaker expression in the C. coum extract-ciprofloxacin-treated biofilm cells compared to those in the untreated cells. Interestingly, the proteome of C. coum extract-ciprofloxacin-treated biofilm revealed more resemblance to the planktonic phenotype than to the biofilm phenotype. It appears that saponin extract in combination with ciprofloxacin causes biofilm disruption due to several mechanisms such as motility induction, cell envelope integrity perturbation, stress protein expression reduction, and more importantly, signal transduction perturbation. In conclusion, exposure to a combination of biofilm dispersal such as saponin extract and antimicrobial agents may offer a novel strategy to control preestablished, persistent P. aeruginosa biofilms and biofilm-related infections.","authors":[{"name":"Morvarid Shafiei"},{"name":"Ahya Abdi-Ali"},{"name":"Fereshteh Shahcheraghi"},{"name":"Hojatollah Vali"},{"name":"Hossein Shahbani Zahiri"},{"name":"Kambiz Akbari Noghabi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Ciprofloxacin"},{"word":"Cyclamen coum"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1"},{"word":"Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)"}]},"article213":{"pmid":"28138926","title":"Why do children and adolescents neglect dental flossing?","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"To identify the variables and actual difficulties related to children and adolescents' non-compliance with dental flossing.","authors":[{"name":"J Mattos-Silveira"},{"name":"B B Matos-Lima"},{"name":"T A Oliveira"},{"name":"K Jarroug"},{"name":"R V Rego"},{"name":"A Reyes"},{"name":"F R Ferreira"},{"name":"J C Imparato"},{"name":"M M Braga"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adolescent"},{"word":"Child"},{"word":"Compliance"},{"word":"Dental floss"}]},"article214":{"pmid":"28138698","title":"Dose‑dependent effect of lysozyme upon Candida albicans biofilm.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The present study investigated the in vitro effect of lysozyme (0-1,000 µg/ml) on Candida albicans (C. albicans) biofilm development.

Yeast growth was evaluated by turbidimetry. Biofilm biomass was quantified on a polystyrene support by crystal violet staining and on acrylic surfaces by counts of colony forming units. Lysozyme affected biofilm formation to a greater extent than it affected growth. For the ATCC 10231 reference strain, lysozyme acted as a biofilm promotor on polystyrene at the highest concentration tested (1,000 µg/ml, non‑physiological). When the reference strain was investigated on acrylic resin support, lysozyme acted as a significant biofilm promotor on rough resin, but less on smooth resin. The attached biomass in the presence of physiological concentrations of lysozyme (10‑30 µg/ml) was significantly decreased compared with the hypothetical value of 100% using a one‑sample t‑test, but a comparison between the different lysozyme conditions using analysis of variance and post hoc tests did not reveal significant differences. In 10 wild strains, different patterns of biofilm formation on polystyrene were observed in the presence of lysozyme. Some strains, characterized by large amounts of biofilm formation in the presence of 1,000 µg/ml lysozyme, were poor biofilm producers at low concentrations of lysozyme. In contrast, some strains that were poor biofilm producers with a high lysozyme concentration were more inhibited by low concentrations of lysozyme.

Strong bioinspired adhesives comprising curli fibers have recently been created; however, the mechanisms curli uses to attach onto abiotic surfaces are still uncharacterized. Toward a materials-by-design approach for curli-based adhesives and multifunctional materials, we examine curli subunit adsorption onto graphene and silica surfaces through atomistic simulation. We find that both structural features and sequence influence adhesive strength, enabling the CsgA subunit to adhere strongly to both polar and nonpolar surfaces. Specifically, flexible regions facilitate adhesion to both surfaces, charged and polar residues (Arg, Lys, and Gln) enable strong interactions with silica, and six-carbon aromatic rings (Tyr and Phe) adsorb strongly to graphene. We find that adsorption not only lowers molecular mobility but also leads to loss of secondary structure, factors that must be well balanced for effective surface attachment. Both events appear to propagate through the CsgA structure as correlated motion between clusters of residues, often H-bonded between rows on adjacent β strands. To quantify this, we present a correlation analysis approach to detecting collective motion between residue groups. We find that certain clusters of residues have a higher impact on the stability of the rest of the protein structure, often polar and bulky groups within the helix core. These findings lend insight into bacterial adhesion mechanisms and reveal strategies for theory-driven design of engineered curli fibers that harness point mutations and conjugates for stronger adhesion.","authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth P DeBenedictis"},{"name":"Jenny Liu"},{"name":"Sinan Keten"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CsgA"},{"word":"Curli"},{"word":"adhesives"},{"word":"adsorption"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"graphene"},{"word":"materials design"},{"word":"molecular dynamics"},{"word":"protein binding"}]},"article216":{"pmid":"28138423","title":"Achromobacter xylosoxidans infection in cystic fibrosis siblings with different outcomes: Case reports.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The clinical relevance of Achromobacter xylosoxidans infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) remains controversial.

Antipyretics can inhibit virus replication, inhibit or promote bacterial or fungal growth, alter the expression of virulence factors, change the surface hydrophobicity of microbes, influence biofilm production, affect the motility, adherence, and metabolism of pathogens, interact with the transport and release of antibiotics by leukocytes, modify the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics, and induce or reduce the frequency of mutations leading to antimicrobial resistance. While antipyretics may compromise the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy, they can also be beneficial, for example, in the management of biofilm-associated infections, in reducing virulence factors, in therapy of resistant pathogens, and in inducing synergistic effects.

Alginate-overproducing mucA mutant bacteria growing in aggregates showed highly increased antibiotic tolerance compared to wild-type bacteria in aggregates.

The presence of C. albicans enhances S. mutans growth within biofilms, yet the chemical interactions associated with bacterial accumulation remain unclear. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate how microbial products from this cross-kingdom association modulate S. mutans build-up in biofilms. Our data revealed that bacterial-fungal derived conditioned medium (BF-CM) significantly increased the growth of S. mutans and altered biofilm 3D-architecture in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in enlarged and densely packed bacterial cell-clusters (microcolonies). Intriguingly, BF-CM induced S. mutans gtfBC expression (responsible for Gtf exoenzymes production), enhancing Gtf activity essential for microcolony development. Using a recently developed nanoculture system, the data demonstrated simultaneous microcolony growth and gtfB activation in situ by BF-CM. Further metabolites/chromatographic analyses of BF-CM revealed elevated amounts of formate and the presence of Candida-derived farnesol, which is commonly known to exhibit antibacterial activity. Unexpectedly, at the levels detected (25-50 μM), farnesol enhanced S. mutans-biofilm cell growth, microcolony development, and Gtf activity akin to BF-CM bioactivity.

To gain insights into the role that interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa in co-culture with Staphylococcus aureus, Inquilinus limosus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia may play in infection, the reciprocal effect during biofilm formation and the response of dual biofilms toward ciprofloxacin under in vitro atmospheres with different oxygen availabilities were evaluated. Biofilm formation kinetics showed that the growth of S. aureus, I. limosus, and S. maltophilia was disturbed in the presence of P. aeruginosa, under both aerobic and anaerobic environments. On the other hand, under aerobic conditions, I. limosus led to a decrease in biofilm mass production by P. aeruginosa, although biofilm-cells viability remains unaltered. The interaction between S. maltophilia and P. aeruginosa positively influenced dual biofilm development by increasing its biomass. Compared with monocultures, biomass of P. aeruginosa+ S. aureus biofilms was significantly reduced by reciprocal interference. When grown in dual biofilms with P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin was less effective against S. aureus, I. limosus, and S. maltophilia, with increasing antibiotic doses leading to drastic inhibitions of P. aeruginosa cultivability. Therefore, P. aeruginosa might be responsible for the protection of the whole dual consortia against ciprofloxacin activity. Based on the overall data, it can be speculated that reciprocal interferences occur between the different bacterial species in CF lung, regardless the level of oxygen. The findings also suggest that alterations of bacterial behavior due to species interplay may be important for disease progression in CF infection.","authors":[{"name":"Andreia P Magalhães"},{"name":"Susana P Lopes"},{"name":"Maria O Pereira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Inquilinus limosus"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"},{"word":"antibiotic therapy"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"polymicrobial interaction"}]},"article236":{"pmid":"28133370","title":"Biocorrosion of dental alloys due to Desulfotomaculum nigrificans bacteria.","date":"2017-02-06","abs":"Degradation processes of metallic biomaterials in the oral cavity limit the stability and reliability of dental materials.

Machined and sandblasted surfaces were used as control group. Several techniques for surface characterizations and monoculture on bone tissue cells were performed. A multispecies biofilm composed of Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Fusobacterium nucleatum was developed onto cpTi discs for 16.5h (early biofilm) and 64.5h (mature biofilm). The number of viable microorganisms and the composition of the extracellular matrix (proteins and carbohydrates) were determined. The biofilm organization was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In addition, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured on the Ti surfaces and cell proliferation (MTT) and morphology (SEM) were assessed. MAO treatment produced oxide films rich in calcium and phosphorus with a volcano appearance while GDP treatment produced silicon-based smooth thin-film. Plasma treatments were able to increase the wettability of cpTi (p<0.05). An increase of surface roughness (p<0.05) and formation of anatase and rutile structures was noted after MAO treatment. GDP had the greatest surface free energy (p<0.05) while maintaining the surface roughness compared to the machined control (p>0.05). Plasma treatment did not affect the viable microorganisms counts, but the counts of F. nucleatum was lower for MAO treatment at early biofilm phase. Biofilm extracellular matrix was similar among the groups, excepted for GDP that presented the lowest protein content. Moreover, cell proliferation was not significantly affected by the experimental, except for MAO at 6days that resulted in an increased cell proliferative. Together, these findings indicate that plasma treatments are a viable and promising technology to treat bone-integrated dental implants as the new surfaces displayed improved mechanical and biological properties with no increase in biofilm proliferation.","authors":[{"name":"Adaias O Matos"},{"name":"Antônio P Ricomini-Filho"},{"name":"Thamara Beline"},{"name":"Erika S Ogawa"},{"name":"Bárbara E Costa-Oliveira"},{"name":"Amanda B de Almeida"},{"name":"Francisco H Nociti Junior"},{"name":"Elidiane C Rangel"},{"name":"Nilson C da Cruz"},{"name":"Cortino Sukotjo"},{"name":"Mathew T Mathew"},{"name":"Valentim A R Barão"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Glow discharge plasma"},{"word":"Micro-arc oxidation"},{"word":"Titanium"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"28131956","title":"Evaluation of the biofilm forming ability and its associated genes in Staphylococcus species isolates from bovine mastitis in Argentinean dairy farms.","date":"2017-04-13","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are important causes of intramammary infection in dairy cattle, and their ability to produce biofilm is considered an important virulence property in the pathogenesis of mastitis.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the main Staphylococcus species involved in bovine intramammary infections possess specific characteristics that promote colonization of the udder. We evaluated the biofilm-forming ability and distribution of adhesion- and biofilm-associated genes of Staphylococcus spp. isolated from bovine mastitis infected animals in Argentinean dairy farms. For this purpose, the phenotypic biofilm formation ability of 209 Staphylococcus spp. from bovine mastitis was investigated. All isolates produced biofilm in vitro, being 35,0% and 45,0% of the 127 S. aureus or 51,0% and 29,0% of the 82 CNS strong and moderate biofilm producers respectively. All S. aureus samples were PCR-positive for icaA, icaD, clfA, clfB and fnbpA genes, 76.3% were positive for fnbpB gene and 11.0% were positive for bap gene. In CNS isolates, the positive rates for icaA and icaD were 73.2%, while for clfA, clfB, fnbpA fnbpB and bap genes the percentage were lower. The results demonstrate that in Staphylococcus spp. biofilm formation, the polysaccharide and the adhesion- and biofilm-associated genes are of overall importance on bovine mastitis in Argentina.

Individual S. mutans cells make the decision to enter the competent state by integrating chemical and physical cues received from their microenvironment along with endogenously produced peptide signals. Studies at the single-cell level, using microfluidics to control the extracellular environment, provide physical insight into how the cells process these inputs to generate complex and often heterogeneous outputs. Fine changes in environmental stimuli can dramatically alter the behavior of the competence circuit. Small shifts in pH can switch the quorum sensing response on or off, while peptide-rich media appear to switch the output from a unimodal to a bimodal behavior. Therefore, depending on environmental cues, the quorum sensing circuitry can either synchronize virulence across the population, or initiate and amplify heterogeneity in that behavior. Much of this complex behavior can be understood within the framework of a quorum sensing system that can operate both as an intercellular signaling mechanism and intracellularly as a noisy bimodal switch.","authors":[{"name":"Stephen J Hagen"},{"name":"Minjun Son"}],"keywords":[]},"article254":{"pmid":"28128893","title":"Autoclaving-Derived Surface Coating with In Vitro and In Vivo Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Efficacies.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Biomedical device-associated infections which engender severe threat to public health require feasible solutions.

Mature biofilms exhibited at least three structurally distinct strata: a high-volume, homogeneous region sandwiched between two compact sections of high heterogeneity. Cell death occurred preferentially in layers in close proximity to the substratum, resulting in increased heterogeneity in this section of the biofilm; the thickness and heterogeneity of this lowermost layer increased with time, ultimately leading to sloughing. The model predicted the formation of metabolically dormant cellular microniches embedded within faster-growing cell clusters. Biofilms utilizing quorum sensing were more heterogeneous compared to their non-quorum sensing counterparts, and resisted sloughing, featuring a cell-devoid layer of EPS atop the substratum upon which the remainder of the biofilm developed.

It is frequently found as a saprophyte in soil, water and other damp environments and is an opportunistic pathogen in patients with underlying medical disorders or with indwelling catheters. It has been reported as an uncommon cause of bacteremia, sepsis, septic arthritis, meningitis, endocarditis, and peritonitis. Thus, early and accurate identification of this rare species is important for the treatment and also to provide information about the epidemiology of P.luteola infections. This report was aimed to draw attention to the accurate identification of P.luteola in clinical samples, upon the isolation and identification in two cases in the medical microbiology laboratory of a university hospital. In February 2011, a 66-year-old man, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease and aplastic anemia, was admitted to our hospital due to progressive dyspnea. A chest tube was inserted on the 20th day of admission by the reason of recurrent pleural effusion. Staphylococcus aureus and a non-fermentative gram-negative bacillus (NFGNB) with wrinkled, sticky yellow colonies were isolated from the pleural fluid sample obtained on the 9th day following the insertion of the chest tube. In February 2012, a 7-year-old male cystic fibrosis patient who had no signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary exacerbation was admitted to the hospital for a routine control. This patient had chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S.aureus and his sputum sample obtained at this visit revealed isolation of P.aeruginosa, S.aureus, Aspergillus fumigatus and a wrinkled, sticky yellow NFGNB. Both of these NFGNB were identified as P.luteola by the Phoenix automated microbial identification system (BD Diagnostics, USA). To evaluate the microbiological characteristics of these two isolates, the strains were further analysed by VITEK MS (bioMerieux, France) and Microflex LT mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Both of the MALDI-TOF-MS systems identified the isolates as P.luteola and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (ABI PRISM 3100, Applied Biosystems, USA) also confirmed the identification. The strains had wrinkled, sticky yellow colonies which were oxidase-negative, catalase-positive and non-fermentative. The Gram stained smears of the colonies revealed clusters of gram-negative bacilli probably embedded into a biofilm matrix. Since there are no accepted standards for testing the antibiotic susceptibility of P.luteola strains, the standards determined by CLSI for other non-Enterobacteriaceae (non-fermentative bacteria excluding P.aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Burkholderia cepacia, B.mallei, B.pseudomallei and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were used for the susceptibility testing. Gradient MIC method (E-Test, bioMerieux, France) revealed that the isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, colistin and levofloxacin. Accurate and prompt identification of P.luteola which is identified as a rare pathogen in serious cases is of critical importance since it has been suggested that this organism is likely to become more frequent as a nosocomial pathogen since the interventional processes increase in current medical practice. This report supported that Phoenix automated phenotypic identification system (BD Diagnostics, USA) and the two MALDI-TOF-MS based systems (VITEK MS and Bruker Microflex LT mass spectrometer) were successfull in the accurate identification of P.luteola.","authors":[{"name":"Muharrem Çiçek"},{"name":"Gülşen Hasçelik"},{"name":"H Kaan Müştak"},{"name":"K Serdar Diker"},{"name":"Burçin Şener"}],"keywords":[]},"article269":{"pmid":"28124269","title":"Experimental coupling and modelling of wet air oxidation and packed-bed biofilm reactor as an enhanced phenol removal technology.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Experimental coupling of wet air oxidation process and aerobic packed-bed biofilm reactor is presented.

We found that V. fischeri forms colonies with more substantial wrinkling when grown on the nutrient-dense LBS medium containing NaCl relative to those formed on the more nutrient-poor, seawater-salt containing SWT medium. The presence of both tryptone and yeast extract was necessary for the production of normal wrinkled colonies; when grown on tryptone alone, the colonies displayed a divoting phenotype and were attached to the agar surface. We also found that the type and concentration of specific seawater salts influenced the timing of biofilm formation. Of the conditions assayed, wrinkled colony formation occurred earliest in LBS(-Tris) media containing 425 mM NaCl, 35 mM MgSO4, and 5 mM CaCl2. Pellicle formation, another measure of biofilm development, was also enhanced in these growth conditions. Therefore, both nutrient and salt availability contribute to V. fischeri biofilm formation. While growth was unaffected, these optimized conditions resulted in increased syp locus expression as measured by a PsypA-lacZ transcriptional reporter. We anticipate these studies will help us understand how the natural environment of V. fischeri affects its ability to form biofilms and, ultimately, colonize E. scolopes.","authors":[{"name":"Anne E Marsden"},{"name":"Kevin Grudzinski"},{"name":"Jakob M Ondrey"},{"name":"Cindy R DeLoney-Marino"},{"name":"Karen L Visick"}],"keywords":[]},"article276":{"pmid":"28121497","title":"Effect of Photodynamic Antimicrobial Chemotherapy on Mono- and Multi-Species Cariogenic Biofilms: A Literature Review.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The aim of this literature review is to study the effect of photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) on mono- and multi-species cariogenic biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Maria Tayara Marques de Freitas"},{"name":"Talyta Teixeira Soares"},{"name":"Maria Gerusa Brito Aragão"},{"name":"Ramille Araújo Lima"},{"name":"Simone Duarte"},{"name":"Iriana Carla Junqueira Zanin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"antimicrobial photodynamic chemotherapy"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"photoinactivation"}]},"article277":{"pmid":"28121436","title":"Design, Synthesis, and Antimicrobial Evaluation of a Novel Bone-Targeting Bisphosphonate-Ciprofloxacin Conjugate for the Treatment of Osteomyelitis Biofilms.","date":"2018-12-22","abs":"Osteomyelitis is a major problem worldwide and is devastating due to the potential for limb-threatening sequelae and mortality.

Quorum sensing depends on the production, detection, and group-wide response to extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. In many bacterial species, quorum sensing controls virulence factor production. Thus, disrupting quorum sensing is considered a promising strategy to combat bacterial pathogenicity. Several members of a family of naturally produced plant metabolites called flavonoids inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation by an unknown mechanism. Here, we explore this family of molecules further, and we demonstrate that flavonoids specifically inhibit quorum sensing via antagonism of the autoinducer-binding receptors, LasR and RhlR. Structure-activity relationship analyses demonstrate that the presence of two hydroxyl moieties in the flavone A-ring backbone are essential for potent inhibition of LasR/RhlR. Biochemical analyses reveal that the flavonoids function non-competitively to prevent LasR/RhlR DNA binding. Administration of the flavonoids to P. aeruginosa alters transcription of quorum sensing-controlled target promoters and suppresses virulence factor production, confirming their potential as anti-infectives that do not function by traditional bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic mechanisms.","authors":[{"name":"Jon E Paczkowski"},{"name":"Sampriti Mukherjee"},{"name":"Amelia R McCready"},{"name":"Jian-Ping Cong"},{"name":"Christopher J Aquino"},{"name":"Hahn Kim"},{"name":"Brad R Henke"},{"name":"Chari D Smith"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"flavonoid"},{"word":"inhibition mechanism"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"virulence factor"}]},"article284":{"pmid":"28119141","title":"A comparison of antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy of phenothiazinium dyes between Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial biofilm.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) is a process that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in presence of photosensitizer, visible light and oxygen which destroys the bacterial cells.

We screened 8 probiotics and assessed how SM growth or biofilm formation inhibition affects cariogenicity of probiotic-SM mixed-species biofilms in vitro. Growth inhibition was assessed by cocultivating probiotics and 2 SM strains (ATCC 20532/25175) on agar. Probiotics were either precultured before SM cultivation (exclusion), or SM precultured prior to probiotic cultivation (displacement). Inhibition of SM culture growth was assessed visually. Inhibition of SM biofilm formation on bovine enamel was assessed using a continuous-flow short-term biofilm model, again in exclusion or displacement mode. The cariogenicity of mixed-species biofilms of SM with the most promising growth and biofilm formation inhibiting probiotic strains was assessed using an artificial mouth model, and enamel mineral loss (ΔZ) was measured microradiographically. We found limited differences in SM growth inhibition in exclusion versus displacement mode, and in inhibition of SM 20532 versus 25175. Results were therefore pooled. Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 inhibited significantly more SM culture growth than most other probiotics. L. casei LC-11 inhibited SM biofilm formation similarly to other alternatives but showed the highest retention of probiotics in the biofilms (p < 0.05).

The strongest biofilm formation was observed with the addition of sodium chloride. After 3 days of incubation, the biomass volume attached to a plastic surface was 20 times higher with than without the addition of 200 mM NaCl to the medium. The addition of NaCl also resulted in biofilm formation on glass, graphite and glassy carbon, the latter two being often used electrode materials for microbial electrosynthesis. Biofilms were composed of extracellular proteins, polysaccharides, as well as DNA, while pilus-like appendages were observed with, but not without, the addition of NaCl. A transcriptome analysis comparing planktonic (no NaCl) and biofilm (NaCl addition) cells showed that C. ljungdahlii coped with the salt stress by the upregulation of the general stress response, Na+ export and osmoprotectant accumulation. A potential role for poly-N-acetylglucosamines and D-alanine in biofilm formation was found. Flagellar motility was downregulated, while putative type IV pili biosynthesis genes were not expressed. Moreover, the gene expression analysis suggested the involvement of the transcriptional regulators LexA, Spo0A and CcpA in stress response and biofilm formation.

Arabidopsis plants previously exposed to strain PsJN showed a reduction in disease severity and pathogen proliferation in leaves compared with noninoculated, infected plants.

Our laboratory synthesized novel derivatives of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), which is an organic compound typically used as a catalyst in polymerization reactions. DABCO derivatives with different aliphatic chain lengths (DC16, DC16F, DC18, and C6DC16), as well as methacrylate monomers conjugated to DABCO compounds (DC11MAF and C2DC11MAF), were synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity. All the compounds exhibited fungicidal activity against several Candida species at concentrations ranging between 2 and 4 μg/ml. Moreover, acrylic denture base resins fabricated to contain 1, 2, or 4 wt% DABCO compounds inhibited surface C. albicans biofilm formation, as well as fungal growth, in disc diffusion assays. Remarkably, discs (4 wt%) aged for 2 months also exhibited approximately 100% growth-inhibitory activity. While some DABCO compounds exerted intermediate to high cytotoxicity against mammalian oral cell types, DC11MAF and denture base resin discs containing 2 or 4 wt% C2DC11MAF exhibited relatively low cytotoxicity against periodontal ligament (PDL) cell and gingival fibroblast (GF) lines, as well as primary oral epithelial cells. These studies demonstrate that DABCO derivatives can be incorporated into denture materials and exert fungicidal activity with minimal cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. DC11MAF and C2DC11MAF are considered strong candidates as therapeutic or preventive alternatives against Candida-associated denture stomatitis.","authors":[{"name":"Jenny L Herman"},{"name":"Yapin Wang"},{"name":"Elizabeth A Lilly"},{"name":"Thomas E Lallier"},{"name":"Brian M Peters"},{"name":"Suleiman Hamdan"},{"name":"Xiaoming Xu"},{"name":"Paul L Fidel"},{"name":"Mairi C Noverr"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"antifungal agents"},{"word":"antifungal material"},{"word":"antifungal susceptibility testing"},{"word":"denture stomatitis"}]},"article298":{"pmid":"28115262","title":"Biological therapeutics of Pongamia pinnata coated zinc oxide nanoparticles against clinically important pathogenic bacteria, fungi and MCF-7 breast cancer cells.","date":"2017-04-13","abs":"The overuse of antimicrobics and drugs has led to the development of resistance in a number of pathogens and parasites, which leads to great concerns for human health and the environment.

The objective of this study was to comprehensively characterize the dynamics of microbial biomass and bacterial communities at each step of a full-scale drinking water treatment plant in Beijing, China. Both bulk water and biofilm samples on granular activated carbon (GAC) were collected over 9months. The proportion of cultivable cells decreased during the treatment processes, and this proportion was higher in warm season than cool season, suggesting that treatment processes and water temperature probably had considerable impact on the R2A cultivability of total bacteria. 16s rRNA gene based 454 pyrosequencing analysis of the bacterial community revealed that Proteobacteria predominated in all samples. The GAC biofilm harbored a distinct population with a much higher relative abundance of Acidobacteria than water samples. Principle coordinate analysis and one-way analysis of similarity indicated that the dynamics of the microbial communities in bulk water and biofilm samples were better explained by the treatment processes rather than by sampling time, and distinctive changes of the microbial communities in water occurred after GAC filtration. Furthermore, 20 distinct OTUs contributing most to the dissimilarity among samples of different sampling locations and 6 persistent OTUs present in the entire treatment process flow were identified. Overall, our findings demonstrate the significant effects that treatment processes have on the microbial biomass and community fluctuation and provide implications for further targeted investigation on particular bacteria populations.","authors":[{"name":"Cuiping Li"},{"name":"Fangqiong Ling"},{"name":"Minglu Zhang"},{"name":"Wen-Tso Liu"},{"name":"Yuxian Li"},{"name":"Wenjun Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"454 pyrosequencing"},{"word":"Bacterial community"},{"word":"Dynamics"},{"word":"Flow cytometry"},{"word":"Heterotrophic plate count"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"30970713","title":"Influence of Biodegradable Polymer Properties on Antifouling Paints Activity.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The development of new antifouling paints requires understanding the parameters involved in antifouling activity and to develop new analytical tools for their evaluation.

These macromolecular machineries inject toxins directly into prokaryotic or eukaryotic prey cells. Hcp proteins are structural components of the extracellular part of this machinery. We recently reported that MFE01, an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens, possesses at least two hcp genes, hcp1 and hcp2, encoding proteins playing important roles in interbacterial interactions. Indeed, P. fluorescens MFE01 can immobilise and kill diverse bacteria of various origins through the action of the Hcp1 or Hcp2 proteins of the T6SS. We show here that another Hcp protein, Hcp3, is involved in killing prey cells during co-culture on solid medium. Even after the mutation of hcp1, hcp2, or hcp3, MFE01 impaired biofilm formation by MFP05, a P. fluorescens strain isolated from human skin. These mutations did not reduce P. fluorescens MFE01 biofilm formation, but the three Hcp proteins were required for the completion of biofilm maturation. Moreover, a mutant with a disruption of one of the unique core component genes, MFE01ΔtssC, was unable to produce its own biofilm or inhibit MFP05 biofilm formation. Finally, MFE01 did not produce detectable N-acyl-homoserine lactones for quorum sensing, a phenomenon reported for many other P. fluorescens strains.

The microbial interplay within this infection may contribute for enhanced pathogenesis and exert impact towards antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, the high mortality/morbidity rates associated to VAP and the worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance has promoted the search for novel therapeutic strategies to fight VAP polymicrobial infections. Under this scope, this work aimed to assess the activity of mono- vs combinational antimicrobial therapy using one antibiotic (Polymyxin B; PolyB) and one antifungal (Amphotericin B; AmB) agent against polymicrobial biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The action of isolated antimicrobials was firstly evaluated in single- and polymicrobial cultures, with AmB being more effective against C. albicans and PolyB against P. aeruginosa. Mixed planktonic cultures required equal or higher antimicrobial concentrations. In biofilms, only PolyB at relatively high concentrations could reduce P. aeruginosa in both monospecies and polymicrobial populations, with C. albicans displaying only punctual disturbances. PolyB and AmB exhibited a synergistic effect against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans mixed planktonic cultures, but only high doses (256 mg L-1) of PolyB were able to eradicate polymicrobial biofilms, with P. aeruginosa showing loss of cultivability (but not viability) at 2 h post-treatment, whilst C. albicans only started to be inhibited after 14 h. In conclusion, combination therapy involving an antibiotic and an antifungal agent holds an attractive therapeutic option to treat severe bacterial-fungal polymicrobial infections. Nevertheless, optimization of antimicrobial doses and further clinical pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics studies underpinning the optimal use of these drugs are urgently required to improve therapy effectiveness and avoid reinfection.","authors":[{"name":"Maria E Rodrigues"},{"name":"Susana P Lopes"},{"name":"Cláudia R Pereira"},{"name":"Nuno F Azevedo"},{"name":"Anália Lourenço"},{"name":"Mariana Henriques"},{"name":"Maria O Pereira"}],"keywords":[]},"article305":{"pmid":"28112955","title":"Fate of Eight Different Polymers under Uncontrolled Composting Conditions: Relationships Between Deterioration, Biofilm Formation, and the Material Surface Properties.","date":"2018-09-25","abs":"With the ever-increasing volume of polymer wastes and their associated detrimental impacts on the environment, the plastic life cycle has drawn increasing attention.

After 450 days in compost, the samples were all colonized by multispecies biofilms, these latest displaying different amounts of adhered microbial biomass and significantly distinct bacterial and fungal community compositions depending on the substrate. Interestingly, colonization experiments on the eight polymers revealed a large core of shared microbial taxa, predominantly composed of microorganisms previously reported from environments contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons or plastics debris. These observations suggest that biofilms may contribute to the alteration process of all the polymers studied. Actually, four substrates, independently of their assignment to a polymer group, displayed a significant deterioration, which might be attributed to biologically mediated mechanisms. Relevantly, the deterioration appears strongly associated with the formation of a high-cell density biofilm onto the polymer surfaces. The analysis of various surface properties revealed that roughness and hydrophilicity are likely prominent parameters for driving the biological interactions with the polymers.","authors":[{"name":"Anne Mercier"},{"name":"Kevin Gravouil"},{"name":"Willy Aucher"},{"name":"Sandra Brosset-Vincent"},{"name":"Linette Kadri"},{"name":"Jenny Colas"},{"name":"Didier Bouchon"},{"name":"Thierry Ferreira"}],"keywords":[]},"article306":{"pmid":"28112760","title":"The anti-inflammatory drug mesalamine targets bacterial polyphosphate accumulation.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Mesalamine serves as the gold standard in treating ulcerative colitis.

In the previous study, we reported that SS sRNA rss04 was up-regulated in pig cerebrospinal fluid and contributes to SS virulence in a zebrafish infection model. Here, we show that rss04 facilitates SS invasion of mouse brain and lung in vivo. Label-free quantitation mass spectrometry analysis revealed that rss04 regulates transcriptional regulator CcpA and several virulence factors including LuxS. Transmission electron microscope and Dot-blot analyses indicated that rss04 represses capsular polysaccharide (CPS) production, which in turn facilitates SS adherence and invasion of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells bEnd.3 in vitro and activates the mRNA expression of TLR2, CCL2, IL-6 and TNF-α in mouse brain in vivo at 12h post-infection. In addition, rss04 positively regulates SS biofilm formation. Survival analysis of infected mice showed that biofilm state in brain contributes to SS virulence by intracranial subarachnoidal route of infection.

This study monitors the interactions between a commonly used nanosilver disinfectant (ASAP-AGX-32, an antimicrobial cleaner for dental units, 0.0032% Ag) and biofilm development in DUWL. To simulate the disinfection scenario, an in-house DUWL model was assembled and biofilm accumulation was allowed. Subsequent to biofilm development, the disinfection process was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pristine nanosilver particles in the cleaner measured between 3 and 5 nm in diameter and were surrounded by a stabilizing polymer. However, the polymeric stabilizing agent diminished over the disinfection process, initiating partial AgNPs aggregation. Furthermore, surface speciation of the pristine AgNPs were identified as primarily AgO, and after the disinfection process, transformations to AgCl were observed. The physicochemical characteristics of AgNPs are known to govern their fate, transport and environmental implications. Hence, knowledge of the AgNPs characteristics after the disinfection process (usage scenario) is of significance. This study demonstrates the adsorption of AgNPs onto biofilm surfaces and, therefore, will assist in illustration of the toxicity mechanisms of AgNPs to bacteria and biofilms. This work can be an initial step in better understanding how AgNPs transform depending on the conditions they are exposed to during their lifetime. Until this date, most research has been focused on assessing the impacts of pristine (lab synthesized) nanomaterials on various systems. However, it is our belief that nanoparticles may undergo transformations during usage, which must be taken into consideration.

We conducted chamber experiments to test for the relevance of biofilm P uptake capacity (PUC) as a tool to detect effects of pollutants on river self-depuration. PUC was calculated by measuring P temporal decay after performing controlled P-spikes in chambers with biofilm-colonized tiles. Four different experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of PUC to: (a) several river waters from increasing polluted sites; (b) the effect of the bactericide triclosan (TCS); (c) the combined effect of TCS and grazers; and (d) the effect of TCS after a drought episode that affected the biofilms. These experiments showed that biofilms decreased their PUC along the pollution gradient. The biofilm PUC was significantly reduced after receiving high TCS concentrations, though lower TCS concentrations also affected the biofilm when this was submitted to grazing pressure. PUC decrease was induced by flow interruption which further enhanced the TCS negative effects. Overall, PUC was sensitive to the effects of pollutants like TCS as well as to the action of biological (grazing) and environmental (drought) factors.

The importance of phenotypic changes seen in a biofilm, which lead to genotypic alterations, cannot be overstated. Irrespective of if the biofilm is single microbe or polymicrobial, bacteria, protected within a biofilm from the external environment, communicate through signal transduction pathways (e.g., quorum sensing or two-component systems), leading to global changes in gene expression, enhancing virulence, and expediting the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Thus, one must examine a genetic change in virulence and resistance not only in the context of the biofilm but also as inextricably linked pathologies. Observationally, it is clear that increased virulence and the advent of antibiotic resistance often arise almost simultaneously; however, their genetic connection has been relatively ignored. Although the complexities of genetic regulation in a multispecies community may obscure a causative relationship, uncovering key genetic interactions between virulence and resistance in biofilm bacteria is essential to identifying new druggable targets, ultimately providing a drug discovery and development pathway to improve treatment options for chronic and recurring infection.","authors":[{"name":"Meredith Schroeder"},{"name":"Benjamin D Brooks"},{"name":"Amanda E Brooks"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"microbial communication"},{"word":"virulence genes"}]},"article334":{"pmid":"28106774","title":"Effects of Long-Term Water-Aging on Novel Anti-Biofilm and Protein-Repellent Dental Composite.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The aims of this study were to: (1) synthesize an anti-biofilm and protein-repellent dental composite by combining 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) with quaternary ammonium dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM); and (2) evaluate the effects of water-aging for 180 days on protein resistance, bacteria-killing ability, and mechanical properties of MPC-DMAHDM composite.

Genes coding for heat shock proteins and pilins were also induced in Δsll1130 We observed that the majority of cells in a Δsll1130 mutant strain remained unicellular and viable after prolonged incubation at high temperature (50 °C). In contrast, the wild type formed large cell clumps of dead and live cells, indicating the attempt to form biofilms under harsh conditions. Furthermore, we observed that Sll1130 is a heat-stable ribonuclease whose activity was inhibited by Ssl2245 at optimal temperatures but not at high temperatures. In addition, we demonstrated that Ssl2245 is physically associated with Sll1130 by electrostatic interactions, thereby inhibiting its activity at optimal growth temperature. This association is lost upon exposure to heat, leaving Sll1130 to exhibit its ribonuclease activity.

The availability of auxiliary carbon sources can lead to surplus biomass growth, changes in biofilm structure and carbon catabolite repression (CCR) which together will affect pollutant degradation rate and efficiency of the system. To understand the interplay between these processes, continuous biofilms of the 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) degrading Comamonas testosteroni WDL7-RFP were grown in single- and dual-substrate conditions with 3,4-DCA and/or citrate and reciprocal effects on 3,4-DCA/citrate degradation, biofilm biomass and biofilm structure were examined. The main mechanism affecting 3,4-DCA degradation in biofilms in dual-substrate conditions was citrate-mediated CCR as reflected by a decrease in specific 3,4-DCA degrading activity. Growth on citrate partially compensated for the lowered specific 3,4-DCA degradation activity under dual substrate conditions but not to the extent expected from growth observed under single-substrate conditions with citrate. This was explained by higher residual 3,4-DCA concentrations in the presence of citrate that increased cell dispersal in the biofilms. Our results show hampered pollutant removal in biofilms due to a complex interplay of auxiliary organic C source utilization for growth affecting the specific pollutant degradation rate and changes in cell physiology due to increased exposure to the pollutant as a result of lowered pollutant degradation rates.","authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Horemans"},{"name":"Philip Breugelmans"},{"name":"Johan Hofkens"},{"name":"Dirk Springael"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3,4-dichloroaniline"},{"word":"Comamonadeceae"},{"word":"bacterial biofilms"},{"word":"biodegradation"},{"word":"carbon catabolite repression"}]},"article340":{"pmid":"28103165","title":"Burn wound healing: present concepts, treatment strategies and future directions.","date":"2017-05-10","abs":"Burns are the most extensive forms of soft tissue injuries occasionally resulting in extensive and deep wounds and death. Burns can lead to severe mental and emotional distress, because of excessive scarring and skin contractures. Treatment of burns has always been a difficult medical problem and many different methods have been used to treat such injuries, locally. Biofilms are a collection of microorganisms that delay wound healing. One of the new methods of prevention and treatment of burn wound infections is application of antimicrobials, which act on biofilms and prevent the wound infection. Biofilm initiates a persistent, low-grade, inflammatory response, impairing both the epithelialisation and granulation tissue formation. Skin grafts have been shown to dramatically reduce deaths from infection. However, grafting has considerable limitations. Such injuries are long-lasting and many patients suffer from chronic pain for a long time. Tissue engineering is a new approach in reducing the limitations of conventional treatments and producing a supply of immunologically tolerant artificial tissue, leading to a permanent solution for damaged tissues; such criteria make it a cost-effective and reliable treatment modality. To overcome the present limitations of burn wound healing, knowledge about the latest findings regarding healing mechanisms is important. Here the authors discuss the most important events regarding burn wound healing and review the latest treatment strategies that have been used for burn wounds from in vitro to clinical levels. Finally, we discuss the role of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine in the future of burn wound healing, modelling and remodelling.","authors":[{"name":"A Oryan"},{"name":"E Alemzadeh"},{"name":"A Moshiri"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"burn wounds"},{"word":"regenerative medicine"},{"word":"skin grafts"},{"word":"tissue engineering"}]},"article341":{"pmid":"28103163","title":"The prevalence of biofilms in chronic wounds: a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The presence of biofilms in chronic non-healing wounds, has been identified through in vitro model and in vivo animal data.

Bacterial populations in the environment are generally forming biofilms subject to some level of phage predation.

This has sparked the search for new therapeutic alternatives, including phage therapy. This study demonstrates that S. aureus biofilms formed in the presence of a non-lethal dose of phage phiIPLA-RODI exhibit a unique physiological state that could potentially benefit both the host and the predator. Thus, biofilms formed under phage pressure are thicker and have a greater DNA content. Also, the virus-infected biofilm displayed major transcriptional differences compared to an untreated control. Significantly, RNA-seq data revealed activation of the stringent response, which could slow down the advance of the bacteriophage within the biofilm. The end result would be an equilibrium that would help bacterial cells to withstand environmental challenges, while maintaining a reservoir of sensitive bacterial cells available to the phage upon reactivation of the dormant carrier population.","authors":[{"name":"Lucía Fernández"},{"name":"Silvia González"},{"name":"Ana Belén Campelo"},{"name":"Beatriz Martínez"},{"name":"Ana Rodríguez"},{"name":"Pilar García"}],"keywords":[]},"article344":{"pmid":"28102173","title":"In vitro evaluation of the antibacterial and osteogenic activity promoted by selenium-doped calcium phosphate coatings.","date":"2018-02-05","abs":"Selenium is an essential trace element present in 25 selenoenzymes, playing critical roles in a variety of physiological processes, such as anti-oxidative defense and the modulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.

The primary pneumococcal neuraminidase, NanA, which is a sialidase that catalyzes the cleavage of terminal sialic acids from host glycoconjugates, is involved in both of these processes. Coinfection with influenza A virus, which also expresses a neuraminidase, exacerbates nasal colonization and disease by S. pneumoniae, in part via the synergistic contributions of the viral neuraminidase. The specific role of its pneumococcal counterpart, NanA, in this interaction, however, is less well understood. We demonstrate in a mouse model that NanA-deficient pneumococci are impaired in their ability to cause both nasal colonization and middle ear infection. Coinfection with neuraminidase-expressing influenza virus and S. pneumoniae potentiates both colonization and infection but not to wild-type levels, suggesting an intrinsic role of NanA. Using in vitro models, we show that while NanA contributes to both epithelial adherence and biofilm viability, its effect on the latter is actually independent of its sialidase activity.

We observed positive selection of pre-LT variants and the appearance of novel mutations. Phenotypic adaptation resulted in increased biofilm formation and swimming motility capacities. Pseudomonas was replaced after 95 days by a microbiota dominated by Actinobacillus. In conclusion, mucoid Pseudomonas adapted to the CF-lung remained able to invade the allograft. Selection of both pre-existing non-mucoid subpopulations and of novel phenotypic traits suggests rapid adaptation of Pseudomonas to the non-CF allograft.","authors":[{"name":"M Beaume"},{"name":"T Köhler"},{"name":"G Greub"},{"name":"O Manuel"},{"name":"J-D Aubert"},{"name":"L Baerlocher"},{"name":"L Farinelli"},{"name":"A Buckling"},{"name":"C van Delden"},{"name":" "}],"keywords":[]},"article364":{"pmid":"28094222","title":"Recent developments in the isolation, biological function, biosynthesis, and synthesis of phenazine natural products.","date":"2017-12-08","abs":"Phenazines are natural products which are produced by bacteria or by archaeal Methanosarcina species.

Monomicrobial biofilms of Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and polymicrobial biofilms composed of C. albicans with each bacterium were formed in microplates during 48 h and exposed for 5 min to R. officinalis L. extract (200 mg/mL). Its cytotoxic effect was examined on murine macrophages (RAW 264.7), human gingival fibroblasts (FMM-1), human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7), and cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) after exposure to different concentrations of the extract, analyzed by MTT, neutral red (NR), and crystal violet (CV) assays. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated on RAW 264.7 non-stimulated or stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli and treated with different concentrations of the extract for 24 h. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were quantified by ELISA. Genotoxicity was verified by the frequency of micronuclei (MN) at 1000 cells after exposure to concentrations of the extract for 24 h. Data were analyzed by T-Test or ANOVA and Tukey Test ( P ≤ 0.05). Thus, significant reductions in colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) were observed in all biofilms. Regarding the cells, it was observed that concentrations ≤ 50 mg/mL provided cell viability of above 50%. Production of proinflammatory cytokines in the treated groups was similar or lower compared to the control group. The MN frequency in the groups exposed to extract was similar or less than the untreated group. It was shown that R. officinalis L. extract was effective on mono- and polymicrobial biofilms; it also provided cell viability of above 50% (at ≤ 50 mg/mL), showed anti-inflammatory effect, and was not genotoxic.

Their serum has been shown to have antibacterial activity beyond that of human serum, and it is believed that this activity is partially due to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs). CAMPs are produced by many organisms as part of the innate immune system. CAMPs are attractive possible therapies against multi-drug resistant bacteria, such as those found in biofilm-infected war wounds, because they seldom cause genetic resistance in bacteria and are effective against antibiotic resistant bacteria. In this work, we identified, synthesized, and characterized a cathelicidin and two shorter fragments from the American alligator. We discovered the cathelicidin using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) alignment and by comparing A. mississippiensis expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with propeptide cathelicidins of other reptiles. We analyzed the structure using bioinformatics tools and circular dichroism and predicted that the full-length cathelicidin peptide has a mixed structure, with an N-terminal α-helix and a center Pro hinge. In minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays, it was determined that the cathelicidin and the two shorter fragments have strong activity against multiple Gram-negative bacteria, including clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Using the ethidium bromide uptake assay, it was found that these peptides permeabilize the bacterial membrane and are less sensitive to salt inhibition than many other known CAMPs. The alligator cathelicidin peptides were not hemolytic against sheep red blood cells at 300 μg/ml and were not significantly cytotoxic against A549 human lung epithelial cells after 24 h exposure in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. These alligator cathelicidin peptides have activity similar to other CAMPs from reptiles such as NA-CATH. It is possible that the alligator cathelicidins play an important role in the innate immune response of A. mississippiensis, similar to LL-37 in humans. In addition, due to their activities against MDR bacteria and lack of cytotoxicity, the AM-CATH peptides could be an attractive platform for further development as a potential therapeutic.","authors":[{"name":"Stephanie M Barksdale"},{"name":"Evelyn J Hrifko"},{"name":"Monique L van Hoek"}],"keywords":[]},"article378":{"pmid":"28089324","title":"The Peculiar Functions of the Bacterial Extracellular Matrix.","date":"2018-03-21","abs":"A biofilm is a common life form where bacterial cells crowd together surrounded by an extracellular matrix (ECM).

Biofilm formation on ores is important for bioleaching because the attached microorganisms start the leaching process by concentrating ferric ions in the extracellular matrix. It has been shown that hydrogen peroxide is spontaneously generated on the surface of ores and that it negatively influences the growth and activity of microorganisms. However, the mechanism by which bioleaching microorganisms tolerate exogenous H2O2 as an adaptive trait remains elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that the gene yhjA, encoding a predicted periplasmic cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP), is important for the response to exogenously generated oxidative stress in the iron-oxidizing acidophilic bacterium Leptospirillum sp. CF-1. Our results show that yhjA is co-transcribed with the genes encoding the peroxide-responsive transcription regulator PerR and peroxiredoxin AhpC. CcP activity, but not yhjA mRNA level, significantly increased in response to hydrogen peroxide and ferric ion exposure, suggesting a post-translational regulation. In agreement with these results, challenging planktonic cells with hydrogen peroxide significantly increased their attachment to pyrite surfaces. In summation, our results suggest that CcP is important to cope with exogenous H2O2, thus favoring the early steps of attachment to mineral substrates.","authors":[{"name":"Claudia Zapata"},{"name":"Braulio Paillavil"},{"name":"Renato Chávez"},{"name":"Pamela Álamos"},{"name":"Gloria Levicán"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm, Leptospirillum spp."},{"word":"bioleaching"},{"word":"cytochrome c peroxidase"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"peroxide"}]},"article386":{"pmid":"28087619","title":"Genome-wide transcription profiling of aerobic and anaerobic Escherichia coli biofilm and planktonic cultures.","date":"2018-02-12","abs":"Many studies have described the response of the facultative anaerobe, Escherichia coli, to anaerobic conditions, yet they all investigated free-living (planktonic) cells because attempts to cultivate anaerobic E. coli biofilm were mostly unsuccessful.

We used RNA sequencing technology to compare stationary phase planktonic cells with mature biofilm, cultured with and without oxygen.

The anaerobic E. coli biofilms were slow growing and patchy compared to aerobic biofilms, yet some features were unchanged like the production of extracellular polymeric substances. A closer inspection of the mRNA data revealed that essential cell processes were attenuated in anaerobic biofilms, including protein synthesis, information transfer, cell structure, regulation and transport. Our results suggest that lack of oxygen imposes severe stress on mature biofilms thus limiting the cells' activity. We further propose that E. coli does not favor growing in anaerobic biofilms and when forced to do so, the cells prevail by attenuating their activity in order to survive.","authors":[{"name":"Bihter Bayramoglu"},{"name":"David Toubiana"},{"name":"Osnat Gillor"}],"keywords":[{"word":"flowcell"},{"word":"sessile"},{"word":"transcriptomics"}]},"article387":{"pmid":"28087617","title":"In vitro activity of the antiasthmatic drug zafirlukast against the oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans.","date":"2018-02-02","abs":"Oral infections are among the most common diseases worldwide.

The individual activities of anode-associated organisms and physiological responses resulting from coculturing are often hard to assess due to the high microbial diversity in these systems.

The experiments revealed that the organisms build a stable biofilm on an electrode surface that is rather resilient to changes in the redox potential of the anode. The community operated at maximum electron transfer rates at electrode potentials that were higher than 0.04 V versus a normal hydrogen electrode. Current densities decreased gradually with lower potentials and reached half-maximal values at -0.08 V. Transcriptomic results point toward a positive interaction among the individual strains. S. oneidensis and G. sulfurreducens upregulated their central metabolisms as a response to cultivation under mixed-species conditions.

The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant and antiproliferative potential of biosurfactants isolated from Lactobacillus casei and to assess their anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities against oral opportunistic Staphylococcus aureus strains. The antioxidant activity of biosurfactant was evaluated using the in vitro scavenging ability on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical. The antiproliferative activity was determined on epithelial cell line (HEp-2) by the Methylthiazole tetrazolium (MTT) reduction assay. The anti-adhesive and antibiofilm activity against S. aureus strains were achieved using crystal violet staining. Our results revealed that the DPPH scavenging activity of biosurfactants at 5.0 mg/mL concentration is between 74.6 and 77.3%. Furthermore, biosurfactants showed antiproliferative potency against studied epithelial cells as judged by IC50 and its value ranged from 109.1 ± 0.84 mg/mL to 129.7 ± 0.52 mg/mL. The results of the growth inhibition indicate that biosurfactant BS-LBl was more effective against oral S. aureus strains 9P and 29P with an IC50 of 1.92 ± 0.26 mg/mL and 2.16 ± 0.12 mg/mL respectively.

Integration of experiments and mathematical modeling indicates that extracellular potassium emitted from the biofilm alters the membrane potential of distant cells, thereby directing their motility. This electrically mediated attraction appears to be a generic mechanism that enables cross-species interactions, as Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells also become attracted to the electrical signal released by the B. subtilis biofilm.
