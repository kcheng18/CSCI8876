Under conditions not fully understood, Eh breaches innate host defenses and invades the intestinal mucosa-causing amebic colitis and liver abscess. In asymptomatic infection, Eh interacts with and feeds on resident microbiota that forms biofilms on the outer colonic mucus layer. Despite the close association between Eh and commensal microbiota, we still lack basic knowledge on whether microbiota and/or their metabolites influence Eh virulence traits critical in disease pathogenesis. In the pathogenesis of intestinal amebiasis, Eh overcomes the protective mucus layer using a combination of mucinase/glycosidase and potent mucus secretagogue activity. In this addendum, we discuss the interconnected role of a healthy mucus barrier and the role commensal microbiota play in shaping innate host defense against Eh-induced pro-inflammatory and secretory responses critical in disease pathogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Aralia Leon-Coria"},{"name":"Manish Kumar"},{"name":"Kris Chadee"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Entamoeba histolytica"},{"word":"Muc2 mucin"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"goblet cell"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"mucosal epithelium"},{"word":"mucus"},{"word":"pro-inflammatory cytokines"},{"word":"secretion"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"31090140","title":"Nonneoplastic diseases and disorders of the oral mucosa: A contemporary overview.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"Oral mucosal diseases encompass a diverse array of conditions and disorders arising from malignant, potentially malignant, and nonneoplastic processes. Considerable attention has been paid to the former in recent years, much less to the wide range of nonneoplastic disease processes, which constitute a sizeable proportion of the oral disease burden globally. Many nonneoplastic disease processes of the oral mucosa significantly affect the patient's quality of life. Fortunately, timely identification and intervention can reduce the associated morbidity and, sometimes, mortality. As such, it is of utmost importance that dentists are familiar with early identification and management of this wide range of oral mucosal diseases. This volume of Periodontology 2000 provides a comprehensive contemporary review of such diseases and disorders through 15 chapters. We cover all relevant disease categories: developmental anomalies, infections, white and red lesions, vesiculo-bullous diseases, oral dermatoses, oral ulcerative conditions, dysplastic lesions, and mucosal diseases as manifestations of systemic disease or oral lesions as a part of systemic diseases. Each chapter discusses epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management. Controversies and many significant gaps in knowledge are exposed, with suggestions for research to address limitations in current understandings. We take a look at the 2017 classification of the periodontal diseases and discuss the importance of close liaison between the specialties of oral medicine and of periodontology in the management of the many oral diseases, apart from the common forms primarily related to oral biofilm, affecting the gingivae and other parts of the periodontium.","authors":[{"name":"Anura Ariyawardana"},{"name":"Newell W Johnson"}],"keywords":[]},"article2":{"pmid":"31089795","title":"The OmpA Gene of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines is Involved in Pathogenesis of Pustule Disease on Soybean.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of the outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines in bacterial pustule pathogenesis of soybean.

The production of these proteins in the ompA mutant was approximately five times lower than that of the wildtype. The ompA mutant also exhibited modified biofilm development. More importantly, the mutant reduced disease severity to the soybean. Ten days after inoculation, the virulence rating of the susceptible soybean cv.

In the environment, free-living amoebae represent key hosts providing nutrients and shelter for highly efficient intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila, which eventually leads to lysis of the protist. However, the significance of other bacterial players for L. pneumophila ecology is poorly understood. In this study, we used a ubiquitous amoeba and bacterial endosymbiont to investigate the impact of this common association on L. pneumophila infection. We demonstrate that L. pneumophila proliferation was severely suppressed in Acanthamoeba castellanii harboring the chlamydial symbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila The amoebae survived the infection and were able to resume growth. Different environmental amoeba isolates containing the symbiont were equally well protected as different L. pneumophila isolates were diminished, suggesting ecological relevance of this symbiont-mediated defense. Furthermore, protection was not mediated by impaired L. pneumophila uptake. Instead, we observed reduced virulence of L. pneumophila released from symbiont-containing amoebae. Pronounced gene expression changes in the presence of the symbiont indicate that interference with the transition to the transmissive phase impedes the L. pneumophila infection. Finally, our data show that the defensive response of amoebae harboring P. amoebophila leaves the amoebae with superior fitness reminiscent of immunological memory. Given that mutualistic associations between bacteria and amoebae are widely distributed, P. amoebophila and potentially other amoeba endosymbionts could be key in shaping environmental survival, abundance, and virulence of this important pathogen, thereby affecting the frequency of human infection.","authors":[{"name":"Lena König"},{"name":"Cecilia Wentrup"},{"name":"Frederik Schulz"},{"name":"Florian Wascher"},{"name":"Sarah Escola"},{"name":"Michele S Swanson"},{"name":"Carmen Buchrieser"},{"name":"Matthias Horn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Legionella"},{"word":"amoeba"},{"word":"antimicrobial defense"},{"word":"coinfection"},{"word":"endosymbionts"},{"word":"protists"}]},"article9":{"pmid":"31088827","title":"Functional Amyloids.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"When protein/peptides aggregate, they usually form the amyloid state consisting of cross β-sheet structure built by repetitively stacked β-strands forming long fibrils. Amyloids are usually associated with disease including Alzheimer's. However, amyloid has many useful features. It efficiently transforms protein from the soluble to the insoluble state in an essentially two-state process, while its repetitive structure provides high stability and a robust prion-like replication mechanism. Accordingly, amyloid is used by nature in multifaceted and ingenious ways of life, ranging from bacteria and fungi to mammals. These include (1) Structure: Templating for small chemical molecules (Pmel17), biofilm formation in bacteria (curli), assisting aerial hyphae formation in streptomycetes (chaplins) or monolayer formation at a surface (hydrophobins). (2) Reservoirs: A storage state for peptide/proteins to protect them from their surroundings or vice versa (storage of peptide hormones in mammalian secretory granules or major basic protein in eosinophils). (3) Information carriers: The fungal immune system (HET-s prion in Podospora anserina, yeast prions) or long-term memory (e.g., mnemons in yeast, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein in aplysia). Aggregation is also used to (4) suppress the function of the soluble protein (e.g., Cdc19 in yeast stress granules), or (5) signaling through formation of oligomers (e.g., HET-s prion, necroptosis-related proteins RIP1/RIP3).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and GC-MS analysis indicated that the biofilm was essentially made of cellulose, composed of several micron-long nanofibrils of 60 nm diameter. A cellulosic biofilm was also formed when the cells grew with glucose as the carbon source. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed that the polymer was type I cellulose in both cases, although the crystallinity of the material greatly depended on the carbon source used for growth. Using genome mining and mutant analysis, we identified the genetic complements required for the transformation of naphthalene into cellulose, which seemed to have been successively acquired through horizontal gene transfer. The capacity to develop the biofilm around the crystal was found to be dispensable for growth when naphthalene was used as the carbon source, suggesting that the function of this structure is more intricate than initially thought. This is the first example of the use of toxic aromatic hydrocarbons as the carbon source for bacterial cellulose production. Application of this capacity would allow the remediation of a PAH into such a value-added polymer with multiple biotechnological usages.","authors":[{"name":"Patricia Marín"},{"name":"Sophie Marie Martirani-Von Abercron"},{"name":"Leire Urbina"},{"name":"Daniel Pacheco-Sánchez"},{"name":"Mayra Alejandra Castañeda-Cataña"},{"name":"Aloña Retegi"},{"name":"Arantxa Eceiza"},{"name":"Silvia Marqués"}],"keywords":[]},"article26":{"pmid":"31087372","title":"Analysis of the influence of low birth weight on the time of eruption of dental caries in children in early childhood.","date":"2019-12-30","abs":"To estimate the time, in days, from the beginning of the monitoring until the occurrence of dental caries and its association with low birth weight in early childhood.","authors":[{"name":"Cristiane R da Silva Castro"},{"name":"Maria B B de Sousa Cabral"},{"name":"Eduardo L A Mota"},{"name":"Maria C T Cangussu"},{"name":"Maria I P Vianna"}],"keywords":[{"word":"deciduous"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"infant"},{"word":"low-birth weight"},{"word":"oral epidemiology"},{"word":"survival analysis"},{"word":"tooth"}]},"article27":{"pmid":"31087370","title":"Characterization of beta-lactamase and biofilm producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated from organized and backyard farm ducks.","date":"2019-10-07","abs":"This study was undertaken to detect the occurrence of beta-lactamase and biofilm producing Enterobacteriaceae in healthy ducks.

Children with chronic adenoidal disease who fail to respond to traditional antibiotic therapy are usually candidates for surgery under general anaesthesia.

PrkC of C. difficile is an STK with two PASTA domains. We showed that PrkC is membrane associated and is found at the septum. We observed that deletion of prkC affects cell morphology with an increase in mean size, cell length heterogeneity, and presence of abnormal septa. A ΔprkC mutant was able to sporulate and germinate but was less motile and formed more biofilm than the wild-type strain. Moreover, a ΔprkC mutant was more sensitive to antimicrobial compounds that target the cell envelope, such as the secondary bile salt deoxycholate, cephalosporins, cationic antimicrobial peptides, and lysozyme. This increased susceptibility was not associated with differences in peptidoglycan or polysaccharide II composition. However, the ΔprkC mutant had less peptidoglycan and released more polysaccharide II into the supernatant. A proteomic analysis showed that the majority of C. difficile proteins associated with the cell wall were less abundant in the ΔprkC mutant than the wild-type strain.

Although most GAS serotypes are able to form biofilms, there is a large amount of heterogeneity between individual strains in biofilm formation, as measured by standard crystal violet assays. It is generally accepted that biofilm formation includes the initial adhesion of bacterial cells to a surface followed by microcolony formation, biofilm maturation, and extensive production of extracellular matrix that links together proliferating cells and provides a scaffold for the three-dimensional (3D) biofilm structure. However, our studies show that for GAS strain JS95, microcolony formation is not an essential step in static biofilm formation, and instead, biofilm can be effectively formed from slow-growing or nonreplicating late-exponential- or early-stationary-phase planktonic cells via sedimentation and fixation of GAS chains. In addition, we show that the GAS capsule specifically contributes to the alternative sedimentation-initiated biofilms. Microcolony-independent sedimentation biofilms are similar in morphology and 3D structure to biofilms initiated by actively dividing planktonic bacteria. We conclude that GAS can form biofilms by an alternate noncanonical mechanism that does not require transition from microcolony formation to biofilm maturation and which may be obscured by biofilm phenotypes that arise via the classical biofilm maturation processes.","authors":[{"name":"Artur Matysik"},{"name":"Kimberly A Kline"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus pyogenes"},{"word":"adherence"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"capsule"},{"word":"group A streptococcus"},{"word":"static biofilm assay"}]},"article33":{"pmid":"31085473","title":"Do transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) affect the toxicity of nanoplastics on Chaetoceros neogracile?","date":"2019-07-25","abs":"The potential presence of nanoplastics (NP) in aquatic environments represents a growing concern regarding their possible effects on aquatic organisms.

In the last decade, at least five different definitions of peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI) have been proposed, each one with intrinsic limitations. In order to move a step forward, the World Association against Infection in Orthopedics and Trauma (W.A.I.O.T.) has studied a possible alternative solution, based on three parameters: 1. the relative ability of each diagnostic test or procedure to Rule OUT and/or to Rule IN a PJI; 2. the clinical presentation; 3. the distinction between pre/intra-operative findings and post-operative confirmation. According to the WAIOT definition, any positive Rule IN test (a test with a specificity > 90%) scores +1, while a negative Rule OUT test (a test with a sensitivity > 90%) scores -1. When a minimum of two Rule IN and two Rule OUT tests are performed in a given patient, the balance between positive and negative tests, interpreted in the light of the clinical presentation and of the post-operative findings, allows to identify five different conditions: High-Grade PJI (score ≥ 1), Low-Grade PJI (≥0), Biofilm-related implant malfunction, Contamination and No infection (all scoring < 0). The proposed definition leaves the physician free to choose among different tests with similar sensitivity or specificity, on the basis of medical, logistical and economic considerations, while novel tests or diagnostic procedures can be implemented in the definition at any time, provided that they meet the required sensitivity and/or specificity thresholds. Key procedures to confirm or to exclude the diagnosis of PJI remain post-operative histological and microbiological analysis; in this regard, given the biofilm-related nature of PJI, microbiological investigations should be conducted with proper sampling, closed transport systems, antibiofilm processing of tissue samples and explanted biomaterials, and prolonged cultures. The proposed WAIOT definition is the result of an international, multidisciplinary effort.

Onychomycosis in HIV/AIDS patients showed a high prevalence of emerging yeasts, among which C. parapsilosis complex species and K. ohmeri were the most frequent. Three C. parapsilosis sensu stricto and two C. orthopsilosis isolates were resistant to amphotericin B and 83% of isolates were resistant to terbinafine. All three different species evaluated were proteinase and hemolysin producers. All isolates adhered to stainless steel and siliconized latex surfaces, and carbohydrates intensified adhesion of all isolates. Isolates adhered to keratinous nail and 50% formed biofilms with strong intensity. In multispecies or polymicrobial biofilms, C. albicans and Staphylococcus aureus regulated the biofilm formation of the analyzed species, decreasing the number of their cells in biofilms. The isolation of emerging yeast species from onychomycosis which are great producers of hydrolytic enzymes and with high adhesion and biofilm formation capacity is a result that should be considered relevant in clinical practice. In addition, half of the isolates was resistant to at least one of the tested antifungals.

In order to prevent or neutralize phagocyte attacks, pathogenic yeasts can use virulence factors to survive, as well as to colonize and infect the host.

Understanding the sequence characterization of fungal adhesins may facilitate a better understanding of its role in pathogenesis. Experimental methods for investigation and characterization of fungal adhesins are labor intensive and expensive. Therefore, there is a need for fast and efficient computational methods for the identification and characterization of fungal adhesins. The aim of the current study is twofold: (i) to develop an accurate predictor for fungal adhesins, (ii) to sieve out the prominent molecular signatures present in fungal adhesins. Of the many supervised learning algorithms implemented in the current study, voting ensembles resulted in enhanced prediction accuracy. The best voting-ensemble consisting of three support vector machines with three different kernels (PolyK, RBF, PuK) achieved an accuracy of 94.9% on leave one out cross validation and 98.0% accuracy on blind testing set. A preference/avoidance list of molecular features as well as human interpretable rules are also extracted giving insights into the general sequence features of fungal adhesins. Fungal adhesins are characterized by high Threonine and Cysteine and avoidance for Phenylalanine and Methionine. They also have avoidance for average hydrophilicity.

Globally, alpine stream diversity is under threat as meltwater sources recede and stream conditions become increasingly homogeneous. Much attention has been devoted to macroinvertebrate diversity in alpine headwaters, yet to fully understand the breadth of climate change threats, a more thorough accounting of microbial diversity is needed. We characterized microbial diversity (specifically Bacteria and Archaea) of 13 streams in two disjunct Rocky Mountain subranges through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our study encompassed the spectrum of alpine stream sources (glaciers, snowfields, subterranean ice, and groundwater) and three microhabitats (ice, biofilms, and streamwater). We observed no difference in regional (γ) diversity between subranges but substantial differences in diversity among (β) stream types and microhabitats. Within-stream (α) diversity was highest in groundwater-fed springs, lowest in glacier-fed streams, and positively correlated with water temperature for both streamwater and biofilm assemblages. We identified an underappreciated alpine stream type-the icy seep-that are fed by subterranean ice, exhibit cold temperatures (summer mean <2°C), moderate bed stability, and relatively high conductivity. Icy seeps will likely be important for combatting biodiversity losses as they contain similar microbial assemblages to streams fed by surface ice yet may be buffered against climate change by insulating debris cover. Our results show that the patterns of microbial diversity support an ominous trend for alpine stream biodiversity; as meltwater sources decline, stream communities will become more diverse locally, but regional diversity will be lost.

In this study, we observed that translucent variants were generated at a rate of ∼20% in colony biofilms of P. lipolytica cultured on HSLB agar plates for 12 days.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the IS5 insertion event inactivated CPS production, which leads to a translucent colony morphology. The CPS-deficient variants showed an increased ability to form attached biofilms but exhibited reduced resistance to sublethal concentrations of antibiotics.

These findings lead us to hypothesize that besides variability among isolates, a single isolate may generate distinct populations of persisters, where cells growing under distinct conditions may adopt different and perhaps complementary survival strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Samara Paula Mattiello Drescher"},{"name":"Stephanie Wagner Gallo"},{"name":"Pedro Maria Abreu Ferreira"},{"name":"Carlos Alexandre Sanchez Ferreira"},{"name":"Sílvia Dias de Oliveira"}],"keywords":[]},"article74":{"pmid":"31076508","title":"Functional characterization of a subtilisin-like serine protease from Vibrio cholerae.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the human diarrheal disease cholera, exports numerous enzymes that facilitate its adaptation to both intestinal and aquatic niches. These secreted enzymes can mediate nutrient acquisition, biofilm assembly, and V. cholerae interactions with its host. We recently identified a V. cholerae-secreted serine protease, IvaP, that is active in V. cholerae-infected rabbits and human choleric stool. IvaP alters the activity of several host and pathogen enzymes in the gut and, along with other secreted V. cholerae proteases, decreases binding of intelectin, an intestinal carbohydrate-binding protein, to V. cholerae in vivo IvaP bears homology to subtilisin-like enzymes, a large family of serine proteases primarily comprised of secreted endopeptidases. Following secretion, IvaP is cleaved at least three times to yield a truncated enzyme with serine hydrolase activity, yet little is known about the mechanism of extracellular maturation. Here, we show that IvaP maturation requires a series of sequential N- and C-terminal cleavage events congruent with the enzyme's mosaic protein domain structure. Using a catalytically inactive reporter protein, we determined that IvaP can be partially processed in trans, but intramolecular proteolysis is most likely required to generate the mature enzyme. Unlike many other subtilisin-like enzymes, the IvaP cleavage pattern is consistent with stepwise processing of the N-terminal propeptide, which could temporarily inhibit, and be cleaved by, the purified enzyme. Furthermore, IvaP was able to cleave purified intelectin, which inhibited intelectin binding to V. cholerae These results suggest that IvaP plays a role in modulating intelectin-V. cholerae interactions.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Howell"},{"name":"Daniel G Dumitrescu"},{"name":"Lauren R Blankenship"},{"name":"Darby Herkert"},{"name":"Stavroula K Hatzios"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"cholera"},{"word":"host-pathogen interaction"},{"word":"intelectin"},{"word":"lectin"},{"word":"pathogenesis"},{"word":"serine protease"},{"word":"subtilisin"}]},"article75":{"pmid":"31076438","title":"Motility-Independent Formation of Antibiotic-Tolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aggregates.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterial pathogen that causes severe chronic infections in immunocompromised individuals. This bacterium is highly adaptable to its environments, which frequently select for traits that promote bacterial persistence. A clinically significant temporal adaptation is the formation of surface- or cell-adhered bacterial biofilms that are associated with increased resistance to immune and antibiotic clearance. Extensive research has shown that bacterial flagellar motility promotes formation of such biofilms, whereupon the bacteria subsequently become nonmotile. However, recent evidence shows that antibiotic-tolerant nonattached bacterial aggregates, distinct from surface-adhered biofilms, can form, and these have been reported in the context of lung infections, otitis media, nonhealing wounds, and soft tissue fillers. It is unclear whether the same bacterial traits are required for aggregate formation as for biofilm formation. In this report, using isogenic mutants, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa aggregates in liquid cultures are spontaneously formed independent of bacterial flagellar motility and independent of an exogenous scaffold. This contrasts with the role of the flagellum to initiate surface-adhered biofilms. Similarly to surface-attached biofilms, these aggregates exhibit increased antibiotic tolerance compared to planktonic cultures. These findings provide key insights into the requirements for aggregate formation that contrast with those for biofilm formation and that may have relevance for the persistence and dissemination of nonmotile bacteria found within chronic clinical infections.","authors":[{"name":"Sally Demirdjian"},{"name":"Hector Sanchez"},{"name":"Daniel Hopkins"},{"name":"Brent Berwin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"aggregates"},{"word":"antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"biofilms"}]},"article76":{"pmid":"31076428","title":"Effects of Sublethal Thymol, Carvacrol, and trans-Cinnamaldehyde Adaptation on Virulence Properties of Escherichia coli O157:H7.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Essential oils (EOs) have demonstrated wide-spectrum antimicrobial activities and have been actively studied for their application in foods as alternative natural preservatives.

Children are at greater risk and suffer most frequently from OM, which can cause serious deterioration in the quality of life. OM is generally classified into two main types: acute and chronic OM (AOM and COM). AOM is characterized by tympanic membrane swelling or otorrhea and is accompanied by signs or symptoms of ear infection. In COM, there is a tympanic membrane perforation and purulent discharge. The most common pathogens that cause AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are commonly associated with COM. Innate and adaptive immune responses provide protection against OM. However, pathogens employ a wide arsenal of weapons to evade potent immune responses and these mechanisms likely contribute to AOM and COM. Immunologic evasion is multifactorial, and involves damage to host mucociliary tract, genetic polymorphisms within otopathogens, the number and variety of different otopathogens in the nasopharynx as well as the interaction between the host's innate and adaptive immune responses. Otopathogens utilize host mucin production, phase variation, biofilm production, glycans, as well as neutrophil and eosinophilic extracellular traps to induce OM. The objective of this review article is to discuss our current understanding about the mechanisms through which otopathogens escape host immunity to induce OM. A better knowledge about the molecular mechanisms leading to subversion of host immune responses will provide novel clues to develop effective treatment modalities for OM.","authors":[{"name":"James M Parrish"},{"name":"Manasi Soni"},{"name":"Rahul Mittal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Otitis media"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"chronic suppurative otitis media"},{"word":"defensins"},{"word":"immune responses"},{"word":"otopathogens"},{"word":"phase variation"}]},"article82":{"pmid":"31075124","title":"Bacterial community dynamics in lait caillé, a traditional product of spontaneous fermentation from Senegal.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Spontaneously fermented food products contain a complex, natural microbial community with potential probiotic activity.

Sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, glucose and starch served as different substrates for MEC anodic culture experiments under the same condition. The effects of different substrates on the bioactivity, biomass and hydrogen production performance of MEC anodic films were analyzed. Also, the effects of different microbial communities on hydrogen production were studied using 16S rRNA sequencing. According to the experimental results, all the five substrates here can serve as hydrogen-producing raw materials for MEC. All indicators revealed that sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate are excellent biofilm culture materials. The serious acidification of glucose and starch was identified at the same substrate concentration, and the environment of the culture medium was difficult to control, which affected the growth and metabolism of electroactive microorganisms. In comparison, sodium acetate was the best, achieving a maximum output of 23.4 mA and a maximum hydrogen content of 25.85%. The other four were ranked as sodium butyrate > sodium propionate > glucose > starch. According to the results of high-throughput sequencing, when sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, glucose and starch served as substrates, the number of operational taxonomic units reached 464, 728, 636, 784, and 1,083, respectively. Furthermore, when MEC was cultured with sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate as substrates, the electroactive microorganism Desulfuromonas in the Proteobacteria would contribute the most to producing hydrogen. The relative abundance of the five substrates was ranked as sodium acetate > sodium butyrate > sodium propionate > glucose > starch, suggesting that the MEC anodic film cultured with sodium acetate as the substrate exhibited the best hydrogen production performance, and the starch showed the worst. It is noteworthy that Desulfuromonas was the most abundant species according to sequencing results. When glucose and starch served as substrates, they exhibited high biodiversity. The anodic membranes cultured with sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium butyrate were not as good as those cultured with glucose and starch, yet the electroactive microorganisms were up-regulated.","authors":[{"name":"Qiongli Shao"},{"name":"Jianchang Li"},{"name":"Sixia Yang"},{"name":"Helin Sun"}],"keywords":[]},"article98":{"pmid":"31070474","title":"Thymoquinone Inhibits Biofilm Formation and Attachment-Invasion in Host Cells of Vibrio parahaemolyticus.","date":"2019-10-08","abs":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a halophilic Gram-negative foodborne pathogen that is widely distributed in marine environments.

There are at least 12 Psl proteins involved in the biosynthesis of this exopolysaccharide. However, it remains unclear about the function of each Psl protein and how these proteins work together during the biosynthesis of ePsl. PslG has been characterized as a degrader of ePsl in extracellular or periplasm and PslD is predicted to be a transporter. In this study, we found that PslG and its glycoside hydrolytic activity were also involved in the biosynthesis of ePsl. PslG localized mainly in the inner membrane and some in the periplasm. The inner membrane association of PslG was critical for the biosynthesis of ePsl. The expression of PslA, PslD, and PslE helped PslG remain in the inner membrane. The bacterial two-hybrid results suggested that PslE could interacted with either PslA, PslD, or PslG. The strongest interaction was found between PslE and PslD. Consistently, PslD was disabled to localize on the outer membrane in the ΔpslE strain, suggesting that the PslE-PslD interaction affected the localization of PslD.

In fact, prokaryotic genomes frequently contain several copies of the core biosynthesis genes, pilB and pilC, encoding an ATPase and membrane anchor, respectively. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that in haloarchaea, a subset of pilB-C paralogs, such as the Haloferax volcanii pilB1-C1, were gained via horizontal transfer from the crenarchaea, while the co-regulated type IV pilus subunits, the pilins, evolved by duplication, followed by diversification of the ancestral euryarchaeal pilins. Here, we report the identification of an H. volcanii pilB1 transposon mutant that exhibits an adhesion defect in defined media. A similar defect observed in an H. volcanii ∆pilB1-C1 strain can be rescued by expressing pilB1-C1 in trans. However, these proteins cannot rescue the severe adhesion defect of a previously reported ∆pilB3-C3 strain. Conversely, pilB3-C3, which are not predicted to have been laterally transferred, expressed in trans can rescue the adhesion defect of a ∆pilB1-C1 strain. This cross-complementation supports the proposed hybrid origin of the operon containing pilB1-C1 and shows that at least certain euryarchaeal PilB paralogs can work with different pilin sets. Efficient recognition of the euryarchaeal pilins by the crenarchaeal PilB1-C1 may have required some degree of pilin modification, but perhaps the modifications were minor enough that PilB3 recognition of these pilins was not precluded, resulting in modular evolution and an extensive combinatorial diversity that allows for adaptation to a variety of stress conditions and attachment to varied surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Georgio Legerme"},{"name":"Mechthild Pohlschroder"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Haloferax volcanii"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"archaea"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"pilin"},{"word":"pilus biosynthesis"},{"word":"type IV pili"}]},"article103":{"pmid":"31068825","title":"Role of Fibroblast Populations in Periodontal Wound Healing and Tissue Remodeling.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"After injury to periodontal tissues, a sequentially phased healing response is initiated that enables wound closure and partial restoration of tissue structure and function. Wound closure in periodontal tissues involves the tightly regulated coordination of resident cells in epithelial and connective tissue compartments. Multiple cell populations in these compartments synergize their metabolic activities to reestablish a mucosal seal that involves the underlying periodontal connective tissues and the attachment of these tissues to the tooth surface. The formation of an impermeable seal around the circumference of the tooth is of particular significance in oral health since colonization of tooth surfaces by pathogenic biofilms promotes inflammation, which can contribute to periodontal tissue degradation and tooth loss. The reformation of periodontal tissue structures in the healing response centrally involves fibroblasts, which synthesize and organize the collagen fibers that link alveolar bone and gingiva to the cementum covering the tooth root. The synthesis and remodeling of nascent collagen matrices are of fundamental importance for the reestablishment of a functional periodontium and are mediated by diverse, multi-functional fibroblast populations that reside within the connective tissues of gingiva and periodontal ligament. Notably, after gingival wounding, a fibroblast sub-type (myofibroblast) arises, which is centrally involved in collagen synthesis and fibrillar remodeling. While myofibroblasts are not usually seen in healthy, mature connective tissues, their formation is enhanced by wound-healing cytokines. The formation of myofibroblasts is also modulated by the stiffness of the extracellular matrix, which is mechanosensed by resident precursor cells in the gingival connective tissue microenvironment. Here, we consider the cellular origins and the factors that control the differentiation and matrix remodeling functions of periodontal fibroblasts. An improved understanding of the regulation and function of periodontal fibroblasts will be critical for the development of new therapies to optimize the restoration of periodontal structure and function after wounding.","authors":[{"name":"Patricio C Smith"},{"name":"Constanza Martínez"},{"name":"Jorge Martínez"},{"name":"Christopher A McCulloch"}],"keywords":[{"word":"connective tissue"},{"word":"fibroblast"},{"word":"gingival"},{"word":"periodontal"},{"word":"wound healing"}]},"article104":{"pmid":"31067854","title":"Removal of Pharmaceuticals and Illicit Drugs from Wastewater Due to Ferric Dosing in Sewers.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Ferric (Fe","authors":[{"name":"Jagadeeshkumar Kulandaivelu"},{"name":"Jianfa Gao"},{"name":"Yarong Song"},{"name":"Sohan Shrestha"},{"name":"Xuan Li"},{"name":"Jiaying Li"},{"name":"Katrin Doederer"},{"name":"Jurg Keller"},{"name":"Zhiguo Yuan"},{"name":"Jochen F Mueller"},{"name":"Guangming Jiang"}],"keywords":[]},"article105":{"pmid":"31067668","title":"P4VP Modified Zwitterionic Polymer for the Preparation of Antifouling Functionalized Surfaces.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Zwitterionic polymers are suitable for replacing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymers because of their better antifouling properties, but zwitterionic polymers have poor mechanical properties, strong water absorption, and their homopolymers should not be used directly.

Here we show that A. fumigatus siderophores defend against anti-fungal P. aeruginosa effects. P. aeruginosa supernatants produced in the presence of wildtype A. fumigatus planktonic supernatants (Afsup) showed less activity against A. fumigatus biofilms than P. aeruginosa supernatants without Afsup, despite higher production of pyoverdine by P. aeruginosa. Supernatants of A. fumigatus cultures lacking the sidA gene (AfΔsidA), unable to produce hydroxamate siderophores, were less capable of protecting A. fumigatus biofilms from P. aeruginosa supernatants and pyoverdine. AfΔsidA biofilm was more sensitive towards inhibitory effects of pyoverdine, the iron chelator deferiprone (DFP), or amphothericin B than wildtype A. fumigatus biofilm. Supplementation of sidA-deficient A. fumigatus biofilm with A. fumigatus siderophores restored resistance to pyoverdine. The A. fumigatus siderophore production inhibitor celastrol sensitized wildtype A. fumigatus biofilms towards the anti-fungal activity of DFP.

Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) play critical roles in transferring the reactivity from gas plasmas to solutions to induce specific biochemical responses in living targets, e.g., pathogen inactivation and biofilm removal. While this approach works well in a single-organism system at a laboratory scale, integration of plasma-enabled biofilm removal into complex real-life systems, e.g., large aquaculture tanks, is far from trivial. This is because it is difficult to deliver sufficient concentrations of the right kind of species to biofilm-covered surfaces while carefully maintaining a suitable physiochemical environment that is healthy for its inhabitants, e.g., fish. In this work, we show that underwater microplasma bubbles (generated by a microplasma-bubble reactor that forms a dielectric barrier discharge at the gas-liquid interface with the applied voltage of 4.0 kV) act as transport vehicles to efficiently deliver reactive plasma species to the target biofilm sites on artificial and living surfaces while keeping healthy water conditions in a multispecies system. The as-generated air microplasma bubbles and plasma-activated water (PAW) both can effectively reduce the existing pathogenic biofilm load by ∼83 and 60%, respectively, after 15 min of discharge at 40 W and prevent any new biofilm from forming. The generation of underwater microplasma bubbles in a custom-made fish tank for less than a minute per day (20 s per time, twice daily) can introduce sufficient quantities of RONS into PAW to reduce the biofilm-infected area by ∼80-90% and improve the health status of Cichlasoma synspilum × Cichlasoma citrinellum blood parrot cichlid fish.

C-peps produced from a model LPXTG-containing adhesin localized to the cell membrane and bound to and inhibited the intramembrane sensor histidine kinase SGO_1180, thus preventing activation of the cognate response regulator SGO_1181. The absence of SspAB C-peps induced the expression of the scaCBA operon encoding the lipoprotein adhesin ScaA, which was sufficient to preserve and even enhance biofilm formation. This C-pep-driven regulatory circuit also exists in pathogenic streptococci and is likely conserved among Gram-positive bacteria. This quality control mechanism ensures that the bacteria can form biofilms under diverse environmental conditions and may play a role in optimizing adhesion and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey W Hall"},{"name":"Bruno P Lima"},{"name":"Gaetan G Herbomel"},{"name":"Tata Gopinath"},{"name":"LeAnna McDonald"},{"name":"Michael T Shyne"},{"name":"John K Lee"},{"name":"Jens Kreth"},{"name":"Karen F Ross"},{"name":"Gianluigi Veglia"},{"name":"Mark C Herzberg"}],"keywords":[]},"article117":{"pmid":"31064827","title":"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae Has Evolved Preferential Use of N-Acetylneuraminic Acid as a Host Adaptation.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"Nontypeable Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (NTHi) is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that is adapted exclusively to human hosts. NTHi utilizes sialic acid from the host as a carbon source and as a terminal sugar on the outer membrane glycolipid lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Sialic acid expressed on LOS is critical in NTHi biofilm formation and immune evasion. There are two major forms of sialic acids in most mammals, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), the latter of which is derived from Neu5Ac. Humans lack the enzyme to convert Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc and do not express Neu5Gc in normal tissues; instead, Neu5Gc is recognized as a foreign antigen. A recent study showed that dietary Neu5Gc can be acquired by NTHi colonizing humans and then presented on LOS, which acts as an antigen for the initial induction of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Here we examined Neu5Gc uptake and presentation on NTHi LOS. We show that, although Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac are utilized equally well as sole carbon sources, Neu5Gc is not incorporated efficiently into LOS. When equal amounts of Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac are provided in culture media, there is ∼4-fold more Neu5Ac incorporated into LOS, suggesting a bias in a step of the LOS biosynthetic pathway. CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase (SiaB) was shown to have ∼4,000-fold-higher catalytic efficiency for Neu5Ac than for Neu5Gc. These data suggest that NTHi has adapted preferential utilization of Neu5Ac, thus avoiding presentation of the nonhuman Neu5Gc in the bacterial cell surface. The selective pressure for this adaptation may represent the human antibody response to the Neu5Gc xenoantigen.","authors":[{"name":"Preston S K Ng"},{"name":"Christopher J Day"},{"name":"John M Atack"},{"name":"Lauren E Hartley-Tassell"},{"name":"Linda E Winter"},{"name":"Tal Marshanski"},{"name":"Vered Padler-Karavani"},{"name":"Ajit Varki"},{"name":"Stephen J Barenkamp"},{"name":"Michael A Apicella"},{"name":"Michael P Jennings"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"bacterial metabolism"},{"word":"glycobiology"},{"word":"microbial pathogenesis"},{"word":"sialic acid"}]},"article118":{"pmid":"31064154","title":"Modifications in Vaginal Microbiota and Their Influence on Drug Release: Challenges and Opportunities.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Vaginal drug delivery represents an attractive alternative to achieve local and systemic effects due to the high contact surface exposed, the mucoadhesion of the epithelium, and the high innervation that facilitates the absorption of drugs into the bloodstream.

Identifying and elucidating the roles of genes associated with pathogenesis has aided our understanding of the molecular basis of citrus-bacteria interactions. However, the complex virulence mechanisms of X. citri subsp. citri are still not well understood. In this study, we characterized the role of PhoP in X. citri subsp. citri using a phoP deletion mutant, ΔphoP. Compared with wild-type strain XHG3, ΔphoP showed reduced motility, biofilm formation, as well as decreased production of cellulase, amylase, and polygalacturonase. In addition, the virulence of ΔphoP on citrus leaves was significantly decreased. To further understand the virulence mechanisms of X. citri subsp. citri, high-throughput RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) was used to compare the transcriptomes of the wild-type and mutant strains. Analysis revealed 1017 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs), of which 614 were up-regulated and 403 were down-regulated in ΔphoP. Gene ontology functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses suggested that the DEGs were enriched in flagellar assembly, two-component systems, histidine metabolism, bacterial chemotaxis, ABC transporters, and bacterial secretion systems. Our results showed that PhoP activates the expression of a large set of virulence genes, including 22 type III secretion system genes and 15 type III secretion system effector genes, as well as several genes involved in chemotaxis, and flagellar and histidine biosynthesis. Two-step reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis targeting 17 genes was used to validate the RNA-seq data, and confirmed that the expression of all 17 genes, except for that of virB1, decreased significantly.

A hallmark characteristic of mature biofilms is the high-level antibiotic tolerance (up to 1,000 times) compared with that of planktonic cells. Here, we report our new findings that biofilm cells are not always more tolerant to antibiotics than planktonic cells in the same culture. Specifically, Escherichia coli RP437 exhibited a dynamic change in antibiotic susceptibility during its early-stage biofilm formation. This phenomenon was not strain specific. Upon initial attachment, surface-associated cells became more sensitive to antibiotics than planktonic cells. By controlling the cell adhesion and cluster size using patterned E. coli biofilms, cells involved in the interaction between cell clusters during microcolony formation were found to be more susceptible to ampicillin than cells within clusters, suggesting a role of cell-cell interactions in biofilm-associated antibiotic tolerance. After this stage, biofilm cells became less susceptible to ampicillin and ofloxacin than planktonic cells. However, when the cells were detached by sonication, both antibiotics were more effective in killing the detached biofilm cells than the planktonic cells. Collectively, these results indicate that biofilm formation involves active cellular activities in adaption to the attached life form and interactions between cell clusters to build the complex structure of a biofilm, which can render these cells more susceptible to antibiotics. These findings shed new light on bacterial antibiotic susceptibility during biofilm formation and can guide the design of better antifouling surfaces, e.g., those with micron-scale topographic structures to interrupt cell-cell interactions.","authors":[{"name":"Huan Gu"},{"name":"Sang Won Lee"},{"name":"Joseph Carnicelli"},{"name":"Zhaowei Jiang"},{"name":"Dacheng Ren"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell-cell interaction"},{"word":"cell-surface interaction"},{"word":"patterned biofilm"}]},"article128":{"pmid":"31061167","title":"A Multiprotein Complex Anchors Adhesive Holdfast at the Outer Membrane of Caulobacter crescentus.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Adhesion allows microbes to colonize surfaces and is the first stage in biofilm formation. Stable attachment of the freshwater alphaproteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus to surfaces requires an adhesive polysaccharide called holdfast, which is synthesized at a specific cell pole and ultimately found at the tip of cylindrical extensions of the cell envelope called stalks. Secretion and anchoring of holdfast to the cell surface are governed by proteins HfsDAB and HfaABD, respectively. The arrangement and organization of these proteins with respect to each other and the cell envelope, and the mechanism by which the holdfast is anchored on cells, are unknown. In this study, we have imaged a series of C. crescentus mutants using electron cryotomography, revealing the architecture and arrangement of the molecular machinery involved in holdfast anchoring in cells. We found that the holdfast is anchored to cells by a defined complex made up of the HfaABD proteins and that the HfsDAB secretion proteins are essential for proper assembly and localization of the HfaABD anchor. Subtomogram averaging of cell stalk tips showed that the HfaABD complex spans the outer membrane. The anchor protein HfaB is the major component of the anchor complex located on the periplasmic side of the outer membrane, while HfaA and HfaD are located on the cell surface. HfaB is the critical component of the complex, without which no HfaABD complex was observed in cells.

This organism is also well-known as the main producing strain in industrial production of hyaluronic acid (HA), which is the component of its capsule polysaccharide. How its virulence and capsule polysaccharide production is regulated remains poorly understood. Intercellular chemical signaling among bacteria provides communities of microbes the opportunity to coordinate gene expression to facilitate group behavior, such as pathogenicity, capsule polysaccharide production, etc. Yet no conserved cell-to-cell signaling system has been elucidated in S. zooepidemicus. Encoded within the genome of S. zooepidemicus is one Rgg regulator encoding gene (rgg) with low similarity to both rgg2 and rgg3 from Streptococcus pyogenes. A small ORF (named as shp) encoding a novel short hydrophobic peptide (SHP) was found in the vicinity of rgg. We found that the active form of pheromone is short and hydrophobic (LLLLKLA), corresponding to the C terminal 7 amino acids of the pre-peptide Shp, which shows divergent sequence to all peptide pheromones reported in streptococci. In response to active SHP, Rgg functions as a transcriptional activator to induce the expression of shp, forming a positive feedback circuit. Bacteria social behaviors, such as capsule polysaccharide production and biofilm formation, were significantly affected when the rgg-shp pathway was inactivated. These data provide the first demonstration that Rgg/Shp signaling pathway comprises an active quorum sensing system in S. zooepidemicus.","authors":[{"name":"Zhoujie Xie"},{"name":"Kai Meng"},{"name":"Xiaoli Yang"},{"name":"Jie Liu"},{"name":"Jie Yu"},{"name":"Chunyang Zheng"},{"name":"Wei Cao"},{"name":"Hao Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus zooepidemicus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"capsule polysaccharide"},{"word":"hyaluronic acid"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article139":{"pmid":"31057940","title":"On-chip manufacturing of synthetic proteins for point-of-care therapeutics.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Therapeutic proteins have recently received increasing attention because of their clinical potential. Currently, most therapeutic proteins are produced on a large scale using various cell culture systems.

Here we present the development of Therapeutics-On-a-Chip (TOC), an integrated microfluidic platform that enables point-of-care synthesis and purification of therapeutic proteins. We used fresh and lyophilized materials for cell-free synthesis of therapeutic proteins on microfluidic chips and applied immunoprecipitation for highly efficient, on-chip protein purification. We first demonstrated this approach by expressing and purifying a reporter protein, green fluorescent protein. Next, we used TOC to produce cecropin B, an antimicrobial peptide that is widely used to control biofilm-associated diseases. We successfully synthesized and purified cecropin B at 63 ng/μl within 6 h with a 92% purity, followed by confirming its antimicrobial functionality using a growth inhibition assay.

While initial MC removal was exclusively due to abiotic processes, significantly higher biological MC removal was observed in ExpL.

Co-occurrence network analysis revealed a pronounced modularity of the biofilm communities, with a clear hierarchic distinction according to feed water origin and treatment type. Genotypes in the network modules associated with ExpS had significantly more links to each other, indicating that these biofilms had assembled from a more coherent source community.

In the present study we show that cellulose production is a complex process regulated at multiple levels and involving different players in this bacterium.

The additive effect of the double amrZ/fleQ mutation on the expression of wss, together with the fact that they are not cross-regulated at the transcriptional level, suggest that FleQ and AmrZ behave as independent regulators, unlike what has been described in other Pseudomonas species.

The present study was designed to characterize antibiotic-resistant and virulent enterococci from ready-to-eat (RTE) seafood. A total of 720 RTE shrimp samples comprising sauced shrimp (n = 288), boiled shrimp (n = 216), and smoked shrimp (n = 216) obtained from open markets in Delta State, Nigeria, were assessed. Standard classical methods and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used in identifying the Enterococcus species. Potential virulence factors (β-hemolysis, gelatinase activity, S-layer, and biofilm formation) were assessed using standard procedures. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the identified enterococci isolates was assayed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. PCR was further used to screen selected antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Prevalence of Enterococcus species from shrimp varieties is as follows: sauced, 26 (9.03%); boiled, 6 (2.78%); and smoked, 27 (12.50%), with an overall prevalence of 59 (8.19%) based on the occurrence of black hallow colonies after incubation. Enterococcus species detected include E. faecalis, 17 (28.8%); E. faecium, 29 (49.2%); E. gallinarum, 6 (10.2%); E. casseliflavus, 2 (3.4%); E. hirae, 3 (5.1%); and E. durans, 2 (3.4%). Biofilm occurrence among the shrimp varieties is as follows: 19/26 (73.1%) for sauced shrimps, 5/6 (83.3%) for boiled shrimps, and 16/27 (59.3%) for smoked shrimps. The phenotypic expression of the enterococci virulence revealed the following: S-layer, 59 (100%); gelatinase production, 19 (32.2%); and β-hemolysis, 21 (35.6%). An average of 3-11 virulence genes were detected in the Enterococcus species. The resistance profile of Enterococcus species is as follows: erythromycin, 29 (49.2%); vancomycin, 22 (37.3%); and tetracycline, 27 (45.8%). The frequency of occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes from the phenotypic resistant enterococci isolates to the macrolide, glycopeptide, and tetracycline antibiotics is as follows: ermA, 13/29 (44.8%); vanA, 14/22 (63.6%); tetA, 14/27 (51.9%); tetM, 15/27 (55.6%); ermB, 4/29 (13.8%); and vanB, 5/22 (22.7%). Findings from this study reveal the antibiotic resistance of enterococci strains of such species as E. durans, E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, and E. hirae.

Caries and periodontal diseases are the most common bacterial diseases of the oral cavity. In both cases, the dental biofilm gives rise to the disorder, which is caused by the insufficient oral hygiene. Dental caries are mainly caused by cariogenic streptococci and lactobacilli. In the case of serious periodontal diseases, anaerob parodonto-pathogen microorganisms play the major role. Untreated caries may result in the necrosis of the pulp, which can cause an inflammation expanding towards the parodontium. This can be characterized as a focal infection, like the untreated periodontal pockets.

Finally, we tested phages expressing 1018 (1018 T7) against bacterial planktonic cultures and biofilms, and found the 1018 T7 phage was more effective than the unmodified T7Select phage at both killing planktonic cells and eradicating established biofilms, validating our phage-driven antimicrobial peptide expression system. The combination of narrow-spectrum phages delivering relatively high local doses of broad-spectrum antimicrobials could be a powerful method to combat resistant infections. The experiments we describe prove this combination is feasible in vitro, but further testing and optimization are required before genetically modified phages are ready for use in vivo.","authors":[{"name":"David J Lemon"},{"name":"Matthew K Kay"},{"name":"James K Titus"},{"name":"April A Ford"},{"name":"Wen Chen"},{"name":"Nicholas J Hamlin"},{"name":"Yoon Y Hwang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"T7 phage"},{"word":"antibiotic-resistant infection"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"genetic modification"},{"word":"mCherry"},{"word":"peptide 1018"}]},"article157":{"pmid":"31054134","title":"Superantigen SpeA attenuates the biofilm forming capacity of Streptococcus pyogenes.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Beta haemolytic Group A streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus pyogenes are strict human pathogens responsible for mild to severe fatal invasive infections.

Transcriptome analysis of SpeA treated S. pyogenes biofilms revealed the involvement of many transcriptional regulators (ciaRH) and response genes (luxS, shr, shp, SPy_0572), hinting towards specific mechanisms underlying the dispersal effect by SpeA.

Here, we examine the role of signaling pathways that control filamentous growth in regulating adhesion-dependent surface responses, including mat formation and colony patterning. Expression profiling and mutant phenotype analysis showed that the major pathways that regulate filamentous growth [filamentous growth MAPK (fMAPK), RAS, retrograde (RTG), RIM101, RPD3, ELP, SNF1, and PHO85] also regulated mat formation and colony patterning. The chromatin remodeling complex, SAGA, also regulated these responses. We also show that the RAS and RTG pathways coregulated a common set of target genes, and that SAGA regulated target genes known to be controlled by the fMAPK, RAS, and RTG pathways. Analysis of surface growth-specific targets identified genes that respond to low oxygen, high temperature, and desiccation stresses. We also explore the question of why cells make adhesive contacts in colonies. Cell adhesion contacts mediated by the coregulated target and adhesion molecule, Flo11p, deterred entry into colonies by macroscopic predators and impacted colony temperature regulation. The identification of new regulators (e.g., SAGA), and targets of surface growth in yeast may provide insights into fungal pathogenesis in settings where surface growth and adhesion contributes to virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Jacky Chow"},{"name":"Izzy Starr"},{"name":"Sheida Jamalzadeh"},{"name":"Omar Muniz"},{"name":"Anuj Kumar"},{"name":"Omer Gokcumen"},{"name":"Denise M Ferkey"},{"name":"Paul J Cullen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MAPK pathways"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"complex colony"},{"word":"expression profiling"},{"word":"fungal pathogenesis"},{"word":"invasive growth"},{"word":"mat"},{"word":"microbial predator–prey relationships"},{"word":"pseudohyphal growth"},{"word":"signaling networks"},{"word":"temperature control"}]},"article160":{"pmid":"31053580","title":"Alternative Sigma Factor RpoX Is a Part of the RpoE Regulon and Plays Distinct Roles in Stress Responses, Motility, Biofilm Formation, and Hemolytic Activities in the Marine Pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Vibrio alginolyticus is one of the most abundant microorganisms in marine environments and is also an opportunistic pathogen mediating high-mortality vibriosis in marine animals.

Hindered drug diffusion is caused on the one hand by interactions with the sticky biofilm matrix and on the other hand by the fact that bacterial cells are organized in densely packed clusters of cells. Binding interactions with the biofilm matrix can be avoided by encapsulating the antibiotics into nanocarriers, while interfering with the integrity of the dense cell clusters can enhance drug transport deep into the biofilm. Vapor nanobubbles (VNB), generated from laser irradiated nanoparticles, are a recently reported effective way to loosen up the biofilm structure in order to enhance drug transport and efficacy. In the present study, we explored if the disruptive force of VNB can be used simultaneously to interfere with the biofilm structure and trigger antibiotic release from light-responsive nanocarriers. The antibiotic tobramycin was incorporated in two types of light-responsive nanocarriers-liposomes functionalized with gold nanoparticles (Lip-AuNP) and graphene quantum dots (GQD)-and their efficacy was evaluated on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Even though the anti-biofilm efficacy of tobramycin was improved by liposomal encapsulation, electrostatic functionalization with 70 nm AuNP unfortunately resulted in premature leakage of tobramycin in a matter of hours. Laser-irradiation consequently did not further improve P. aeruginosa biofilm eradication. Adsorption of tobramycin to GQD, on the other hand, did result in a stable formulation with high encapsulation efficiency, without burst release of tobramycin from the nanocarriers. However, even though laser-induced VNB formation from GQD resulted in biofilm disruption, an enhanced anti-biofilm effect was not achieved due to tobramycin not being efficiently released from GQD. Even though this study was unsuccessful in designing suitable nanocarriers for simultaneous biofilm disruption and light-triggered release of tobramycin, it provides insights into the difficulties and challenges that need to be considered for future developments in this regard.","authors":[{"name":"Eline Teirlinck"},{"name":"Alexandre Barras"},{"name":"Jing Liu"},{"name":"Juan C Fraire"},{"name":"Tatu Lajunen"},{"name":"Ranhua Xiong"},{"name":"Katrien Forier"},{"name":"Chengnan Li"},{"name":"Arto Urtti"},{"name":"Rabah Boukherroub"},{"name":"Sabine Szunerits"},{"name":"Stefaan C De Smedt"},{"name":"Tom Coenye"},{"name":"Kevin Braeckmans"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"diffusion barrier"},{"word":"gold nanoparticles"},{"word":"graphene quantum dots"},{"word":"laser treatment"},{"word":"liposomes"},{"word":"triggered release"},{"word":"vapor nanobubbles"}]},"article163":{"pmid":"31052335","title":"Recent Advances in Non-Conventional Antimicrobial Approaches for Chronic Wound Biofilms: Have We Found the 'Chink in the Armor'?","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Chronic wounds are a major healthcare burden, with huge public health and economic impact. Microbial infections are the single most important cause of chronic, non-healing wounds. Chronic wound infections typically form biofilms, which are notoriously recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics. This prompts the need for alternative or adjunct 'anti-biofilm' approaches, notably those that account for the unique chronic wound biofilm microenvironment. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in non-conventional antimicrobial approaches for chronic wound biofilms, looking beyond standard antibiotic therapies. These non-conventional strategies are discussed under three groups. The first group focuses on treatment approaches that directly kill or inhibit microbes in chronic wound biofilms, using mechanisms or delivery strategies distinct from antibiotics. The second group discusses antimicrobial approaches that modify the biological, chemical or biophysical parameters in the chronic wound microenvironment, which in turn enables the disruption and removal of biofilms. Finally, therapeutic approaches that affect both, biofilm bacteria and microenvironment factors, are discussed. Understanding the advantages and limitations of these recent approaches, their stage of development and role in biofilm management, could lead to new treatment paradigms for chronic wound infections. Towards this end, we discuss the possibility that non-conventional antimicrobial therapeutics and targets could expose the 'chink in the armor' of chronic wound biofilms, thereby providing much-needed alternative or adjunct strategies for wound infection management.","authors":[{"name":"Snehal Kadam"},{"name":"Saptarsi Shai"},{"name":"Aditi Shahane"},{"name":"Karishma S Kaushik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobials"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronic wounds"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"pH"},{"word":"phages"},{"word":"probiotics"}]},"article164":{"pmid":"31052271","title":"Current Status of In Vitro Models and Assays for Susceptibility Testing for Wound Biofilm Infections.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biofilm infections have gained recognition as an important therapeutic challenge in the last several decades due to their relationship with the chronicity of infectious diseases.

Constant dosing is typically ineffective and to generate an effective treatment protocol, we need to understand the dynamics of persister cells. In this study, we investigate how manipulating the application of antibiotics and addition of nutrients enhances the disinfection of a bacterial population in batch culture. Eliminating persister bacteria is considered as a challenge for the food industry or wastewater treatment, since the failure may result in food contamination and disease transmission. Previous studies focused on the antimicrobial agent as a control variable to eliminate the bacterial population. In addition to antibiotic, we consider the significance of the nutrient in eradicating the susceptible and persister cells since the disinfection of susceptible population depends on the nutrient intake. We present a mathematical model that captures the dynamics between susceptible and persister bacteria with antibiotic and nutrient control variables. We investigate the optimal dose-withdrawal of antibiotic timing in several cases including constant nutrient in time, dynamic nutrient in time and piecewise constant nutrient in time.","authors":[{"name":"Nihan Acar"},{"name":"Nick G Cogan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic challenge"},{"word":"Bacterial tolerance"},{"word":"Nutrient timing"},{"word":"Persister formation"},{"word":"Poincaré map"}]},"article179":{"pmid":"31046747","title":"Efficacy of removing Candida albicans from orthodontic acrylic bases: an in vitro study.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"This study evaluated the efficacy of four methods in removing Candida albicans from the acrylic base material used to fabricate removable orthodontic appliances.","authors":[{"name":"Abdul Razzak A Ghazal"},{"name":"Ghassan Idris"},{"name":"Mohammad Y Hajeer"},{"name":"Karam Alawer"},{"name":"Richard D Cannon"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans, Orthodontic acrylic"},{"word":"Disinfection"},{"word":"Orthodontic appliances"}]},"article180":{"pmid":"31046689","title":"Use of ceragenins as a potential treatment for urinary tract infections.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections.

Direct detection of PYO in biofilms is crucial because PYO can provide important information about infection-related virulence mechanisms in P. aeruginosa. Because PYO is both redox-active and Raman-active, we seek to simultaneously acquire both spectroscopic and redox state information about PYO. The combination of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and voltammetry is used here to provide insights into the molecular redox behavior of PYO while controlling the SERS and electrochemical (EC) response of PYO with external stimuli, such as pH and applied potential. Furthermore, PYO secretion from biofilms of different P. aeruginosa strains is compared. Both SERS spectra and EC behavior are observed to change with pH, and several pH-dependent bands are identified in the SERS spectra, which can potentially be used to probe the local environment. Comparison of the voltammetric behavior of wild-type and a PYO-deficient mutant unequivocally identifies PYO as a major component of the secretome. Spectroelectrochemical studies of the PYO standard reveal decreasing SERS intensities of PYO bands under reducing conditions. Extending these experiments to pellicle biofilms shows similar behavior with applied potential, and SERS imaging indicates that secreted PYO is localized in regions approximately the size of P. aeruginosa cells. The in situ spectroelectrochemical biofilm characterization approach developed here suggests that EC-SERS monitoring of secreted molecules can be used diagnostically and correlated with the progress of infection.","authors":[{"name":"Hyein Do"},{"name":"Seung-Ryong Kwon"},{"name":"Kaiyu Fu"},{"name":"Nydia Morales-Soto"},{"name":"Joshua D Shrout"},{"name":"Paul W Bohn"}],"keywords":[]},"article193":{"pmid":"31041915","title":"Influence of microbiology on endodontic failure.

In a laboratory study, we investigated the single and combined effects of phosphorus (P) availability and silver, a re-emerging contaminant, on the elemental [carbon (C):nitrogen (N):P ratios] and biochemical (fatty acid profiles) compositions of a diatom-dominated biofilm initially collected in a shallow lake. We hypothesized that (1) P and silver, through the replacement of diatoms by more tolerant primary producer species, reduce the biochemical quality of biofilms for their consumers while (2) P enhances biofilm elemental quality and (3) silver contamination of biofilm has negative effects on consumers life history traits. The quality of biofilms for consumers was assessed for a common crustacean species, Gammarus fossarum, by measuring organisms' survival and growth rates during a 42-days feeding experiment. Results mainly showed that species replacement induced by both stressors affected biofilm fatty acid compositions, and that P immobilization permitted to achieve low C:P biofilms, whatever the level of silver contamination. Gammarids growth and survival rates were not significantly impacted by the ingestion of silver-contaminated resource. On the contrary, we found a significant positive relationship between the biofilm P-content and gammarids growth.

Intriguingly, it emerged that even if electrostatic interactions between negatively charged bacterial membranes and positively charged HDPs play a key role in mediating peptide toxicity, they are strongly influenced by the composition of negatively charged bacterial surfaces and by defined extracellular microenvironments.","authors":[{"name":"Rosa Gaglione"},{"name":"Angela Cesaro"},{"name":"Eliana Dell'Olmo"},{"name":"Bartolomeo Della Ventura"},{"name":"Angela Casillo"},{"name":"Rocco Di Girolamo"},{"name":"Raffaele Velotta"},{"name":"Eugenio Notomista"},{"name":"Edwin J A Veldhuizen"},{"name":"Maria Michela Corsaro"},{"name":"Claudio De Rosa"},{"name":"Angela Arciello"}],"keywords":[]},"article202":{"pmid":"31040318","title":"Effect of D-cysteine on dual-species biofilms of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Dental caries is a highly prevalent disease worldwide. It is caused by the cariogenic biofilms composed of multiple dynamic bacteria on dental surface. Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis are resident members within the biofilms and an antagonistic relationship has been shown between these two species. S. mutans, as the major causative microorganism of dental caries, has been reported to be inhibited by free D-cysteine (D-Cys). However, whether D-Cys could affect S. sanguinis and the interspecies relationship between S. mutans and S. sanguinis remains unknown. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of D-Cys on the growth and cariogenicity of dual-species biofilms formed by S. mutans and S. sanguinis. We measured dual-species biofilms biomass, metabolic activity, lactate production. We also detected the biofilms structure, the ratio of live/dead bacteria, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) synthesis and bacterial composition in the dual-species biofilms. We found that D-Cys could reduce the metabolic activity and lactic acid production of dual-species biofilms (p < 0.05). In addition, biofilms formation, the proportion of S. mutans in dual-species biofilms, and EPS synthesis were decreased with D-Cys treatment. The results suggested that D-Cys could inhibit the growth and cariogenic virulence of dual-species biofilms formed by S. mutans and S. sanguinis, indicating the potential of D-Cys in clinical application for caries prevention and treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Xiao Guo"},{"name":"Shiyu Liu"},{"name":"Xuedong Zhou"},{"name":"Hongying Hu"},{"name":"Keke Zhang"},{"name":"Xinmei Du"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Biao Ren"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"},{"name":"Mingyun Li"}],"keywords":[]},"article203":{"pmid":"31039462","title":"Biodegradation of mixture of plastic films by tailored marine consortia.","date":"2020-02-27","abs":"This work sheds light on the physicochemical changes of naturally weathered polymer surfaces along with changes of polymer buoyancy due to biofilm formation and degradation processes.

Cell adhesion and biofilm formation involve a family of cell surface Als (agglutinin-like sequence) proteins. It is now well documented that amyloid-like clusters of laterally arranged Als proteins activate cell-cell adhesion under mechanical stress, but whether amyloid-like bonds form between aggregating cells is not known. To address this issue, we measure the forces driving Als5-mediated intercellular adhesion using an innovative fluidic force microscopy platform. Strong cell-cell adhesion is dependent on expression of amyloid-forming Als5 at high cell surface density and is inhibited by a short antiamyloid peptide. Furthermore, there is greatly attenuated binding between cells expressing amyloid-forming Als5 and cells with a nonamyloid form of Als5. Thus, homophilic bonding between Als5 proteins on adhering cells is the major mode of fungal aggregation, rather than protein-ligand interactions. These results point to a model whereby amyloid-like β-sheet interactions play a dual role in cell-cell adhesion, that is, in formation of adhesin nanoclusters ( cis-interactions) and in homophilic bonding between amyloid sequences on opposing cells ( trans-interactions). Because potential amyloid-forming sequences are found in many microbial adhesins, we speculate that this novel mechanism of amyloid-based homophilic adhesion might be widespread and could represent an interesting target for treating biofilm-associated infections.","authors":[{"name":"Jérôme Dehullu"},{"name":"Claire Valotteau"},{"name":"Philippe Herman-Bausier"},{"name":"Melissa Garcia-Sherman"},{"name":"Maximilian Mittelviefhaus"},{"name":"Julia A Vorholt"},{"name":"Peter N Lipke"},{"name":"Yves F Dufrêne"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"fluidic force microscopy"},{"word":"functional amyloids"},{"word":"homophilic adhesion"},{"word":"nanoscale forces"}]},"article206":{"pmid":"31038919","title":"Thinking Outside the Treatment Plant: UV for Water Distribution System Disinfection.","date":"2020-03-18","abs":"This work critically evaluates the current paradigm of water distribution system management and juxtaposes that with the potential benefits of employing UV irradiation, which we hope will catalyze a judicial re-evaluation of the current practices in water distribution system management and spur critical research and a new way of thinking about secondary disinfection across the extent of distribution systems. Given the recent advances in UV technology and the efficacy of UV disinfection against all pathogen classes, we now see UV applications for disinfection in many aspects of consumers lives: in water coolers, dishwashers, coffee makers, and disinfection of personal items like gym bags, water bottles, and toothbrushes. Public and regulatory concern over water quality and pathogens, especially the recent interest in building plumbing, calls out for new approaches to disinfection and distribution system management. We envision a new model for secondary disinfection in water distribution systems utilizing emerging germicidal UV LED-based disinfection. UV irradiation in water treatment can achieve high levels of disinfection of all pathogens and minimize or eliminate the formation of regulated disinfection byproducts. So why is UV not considered as a secondary disinfectant for distribution systems? In this Account, we lay out the logic as to the benefits and practicality of adding distributed UV treatment to assist in protection of distribution systems and protect water quality for human exposure. The possible locations of UV irradiation in distribution systems are envisioned, potentially including UV booster stations along the distribution network, UV in storage tanks or their inlet/outlets, LEDs distributed along pipe walls, small point of use/entry treatment systems for buildings/homes/taps, or submersible swimming or rolling UV LED drones to reach problem pipes and provide a shock treatment or provide sterilization after main breaks or repairs. The benefits of UV applications in water also include high effectiveness against chlorine-resistant protozoa, no added disinfection byproducts, and compatibility of adding of UV to existing secondary disinfection strategies for enhanced protection. Potential challenges and research needs are described, such as use of UV-compatible pipe materials, implementation of sensors to monitor distributed LEDs, management of waste heat from the rear surface of the LED, and understanding the potential for regrowth of opportunistic microorganisms. Another notable challenge is the relatively stagnant regulatory environment in some countries to develop frameworks for evaluation and acceptance of UV technology in distribution systems that require a chemical secondary disinfectant. Rapid advances in UV LED research has propelled the growth of this field, but needs still remain, including understanding behavior of biofilms in pipes under UV irradiation, including any beneficial effects that may be lost, the potential for fouling of LED emission surfaces and monitoring points, and provision of a distributed power network to run the LEDs. Regulators may want specific monitoring approaches and advances in real-time monitoring of microbial viability, and engineers may need to develop new approaches to overall management.","authors":[{"name":"Karl G Linden"},{"name":"Natalie Hull"},{"name":"Vanessa Speight"}],"keywords":[]},"article207":{"pmid":"31038914","title":"Visible-Light-Induced Photocatalytic and Antibacterial Activity of TiO","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilm-associated diseases are one of the main causes of implant failure.

Using fluorescent microscopy, we studied in-situ the colonization of L. pneumophila in the presence of two water-related FLA species, Willaertia magna and Acanthamoeba polyphaga in drinking water biofilms. During water flow as well as after periods of long-stagnation, the attachment and colonization of L. pneumophila to predeveloped water-biofilm was limited. Furthermore, W. magna and A. polyphaga showed no immediate interactions with L. pneumophila when introduced to the same natural biofilm environment. A. polyphaga encysted within 5-7 d after introduction to the tap-water biofilms and mostly persisted in cysts till the end of the study period (850 d). W. magna trophozoites, however, exhibited a time delay in feeding on Legionella and were observed with internalized L. pneumophila cells after 3 weeks from their introduction to the end of the study period and supported putative (yet limited) intracellular growth. The culturable L.pneumophila in the bulk water was reduced by 2-log over 2 years at room temperature but increased (without a change in mip gene copies by qPCR) when the temperature was elevated to 40 °C within the same closed-loop tap-water system without the addition of nutrients or fresh water. The overall results suggest that L. pneumophila maintains an ecological balance with FLA within the biofilm environment, and higher temperature improve the viability of L. pneumophila cells, and intracellular growth of Legionella is possibly cell-concentration dependent. Observing the preferential feeding behavior, we hypothesize that an initial increase of FLA numbers through feeding on a range of other available bacteria could lead to an enrichment of L. pneumophila, and later force predation of Legionella by the amoeba trophozoites results in rapid intracellular replication, leading to problematic concentration of L. pneumophila in water.

H. pylori biofilm biomass was significantly decreased compared to initial biomass after treatment with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AMPC. Similarly, the biofilm biomass of H. pylori decreased after treatment with MIC of MNZ, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of AMPC or MNZ to biofilm cells were higher than those of planktonic cells. The biofilm biomasses of all of the CAM resistant strains were significantly decreased compared to initial biomass after treatment with 2x MIC of CAM. However, the viability of the CAM treated biofilm cells with 2x MIC of CAM was not significantly reduced compared to initial cell numbers with the exception of one strain. The viability of biofilm cells of all strains was higher than that of planktonic cells after treatment with various concentrations of CAM. These results indicate that biofilm cells were more resistant to these antibiotics than planktonic cells and that the assessment of the ability to form biofilms in H. pylori is important for eradication of this microorganism.","authors":[{"name":"Hideo Yonezawa"},{"name":"Takako Osaki"},{"name":"Fuhito Hojo"},{"name":"Shigeru Kamiya"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotics susceptibility"},{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"Clarithromycin resistance"},{"word":"Helicobacter pylori"},{"word":"MBC"}]},"article227":{"pmid":"31034512","title":"Host metabolites stimulate the bacterial proton motive force to enhance the activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens is typically evaluated using in vitro assays that do not consider the complex host microenvironment. This may help explaining a significant discrepancy between antibiotic efficacy in vitro and in vivo, with some antibiotics being effective in vitro but not in vivo or vice versa. Nevertheless, it is well-known that antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria is driven by environmental factors. Lung epithelial cells enhance the activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yet the mechanism behind is unknown. The present study addresses this gap and provides mechanistic understanding on how lung epithelial cells stimulate aminoglycoside activity. To investigate the influence of the local host microenvironment on antibiotic activity, an in vivo-like three-dimensional (3-D) lung epithelial cell model was used. We report that conditioned medium of 3-D lung cells, containing secreted but not cellular components, potentiated the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides against P. aeruginosa, including resistant clinical isolates, and several other pathogens. In contrast, conditioned medium obtained from the same cell type, but grown as conventional (2-D) monolayers did not influence antibiotic efficacy. We found that 3-D lung cells secreted endogenous metabolites (including succinate and glutamate) that enhanced aminoglycoside activity, and provide evidence that bacterial pyruvate metabolism is linked to the observed potentiation of antimicrobial activity. Biochemical and phenotypic assays indicated that 3-D cell conditioned medium stimulated the proton motive force (PMF), resulting in increased bacterial intracellular pH. The latter stimulated antibiotic uptake, as determined using fluorescently labelled tobramycin in combination with flow cytometry analysis. Our findings reveal a cross-talk between host and bacterial metabolic pathways, that influence downstream activity of antibiotics. Understanding the underlying basis of the discrepancy between the activity of antibiotics in vitro and in vivo may lead to improved diagnostic approaches and pave the way towards novel means to stimulate antibiotic activity.","authors":[{"name":"Aurélie Crabbé"},{"name":"Lisa Ostyn"},{"name":"Sorien Staelens"},{"name":"Charlotte Rigauts"},{"name":"Martijn Risseeuw"},{"name":"Maarten Dhaenens"},{"name":"Simon Daled"},{"name":"Heleen Van Acker"},{"name":"Dieter Deforce"},{"name":"Serge Van Calenbergh"},{"name":"Tom Coenye"}],"keywords":[]},"article228":{"pmid":"31034123","title":"Investigating possible association between multidrug resistance and isolate origin with some virulence factors of Escherichia coli strains isolated from infant faeces and fresh green vegetables.","date":"2019-08-19","abs":"In this study, the association between multidrug resistance (MDR) and the expression of some virulence factors were evaluated in Escherichia coli strains isolated from infant faeces and fresh green vegetables.

Using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a substrate, we measured ALP activity in S. aureus biofilm formed in 96-well tissue culture plates. Activity was based on the formation of the soluble reaction product measured by 405 nm absorbance. The high throughput nature of the 96 well tissue culture plate method provides a sensitive and reproducible method for ALP activity assays.

Among them, mesoporous silica materials (MSMs) have attracted burgeoning attention due to high surface area, tunable pore/particle size, and easy surface functionalization. This review discusses how one can exploit capacities of MSMs to design and fabricate multifunctional/controllable drug delivery systems (DDSs) to combat bacterial infections.

One major resource for discovery of antimicrobials is the arsenal of innate immunity molecules that are part of the first line of pathogen defense in many organisms. Gene encoded cationic antimicrobial peptides are a major constituent of innate immune arsenals. Many of these peptides exhibit potent antimicrobial activity in vitro. However, a major hurdle that has impeded their development for use in the clinic is the loss of activity at physiological salt concentrations, attributed to weakening of the electrostatic interactions between the cationic peptide and anionic surfaces of the microbial cells in the presence of salt. Using plant defensins we have investigated the relationship between the charge of an antimicrobial peptide and its activity in media with elevated salt concentrations. Plant defensins are a large class of antifungal peptides that have remarkable stability at extremes of pH and temperature as well as resistance to protease digestion. A search of a database of over 1200 plant defensins identified ZmD32, a defensin from Zea mays, with a predicted charge of +10.1 at pH 7, the highest of any defensin in the database. Recombinant ZmD32 retained activity against a range of fungal species in media containing elevated concentrations of salt. In addition, ZmD32 was active against Candida albicans biofilms as well as both Gram negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, combined with a low toxicity on human cells make ZmD32 an attractive lead for development of future antimicrobial molecules.","authors":[{"name":"Bomai K Kerenga"},{"name":"James A McKenna"},{"name":"Peta J Harvey"},{"name":"Pedro Quimbar"},{"name":"Donovan Garcia-Ceron"},{"name":"Fung T Lay"},{"name":"Thanh Kha Phan"},{"name":"Prem K Veneer"},{"name":"Shaily Vasa"},{"name":"Kathy Parisi"},{"name":"Thomas M A Shafee"},{"name":"Nicole L van der Weerden"},{"name":"Mark D Hulett"},{"name":"David J Craik"},{"name":"Marilyn A Anderson"},{"name":"Mark R Bleackley"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"plant defensin"},{"word":"salt tolerance"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"31031731","title":"The Carbon Switch at the Level of Pyruvate and Phosphoenolpyruvate in Sulfolobus solfataricus P2.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 grows on different carbohydrates as well as alcohols, peptides and amino acids.

STEC is one of the important food borne pathogens that causes food poisoning leading to diarrhoea and number of STEC outbreaks have occurred across the world. The use of standard antibiotics to treat STEC infection is not recommended as it increases the production of shiga toxin which could lead to HUS.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum) against STEC strains isolated from various patient and food samples using in vitro assays. The microbiological isolation of STEC from various patient and food samples resulted in eight STEC isolates of which seven strains were multidrug resistant.

These treponemes can cause various diseases in humans and other animals, such as periodontal disease, bovine digital dermatitis and animal skin lesions. However, the most important and well-studied disease of treponemes that affects humans is 'syphilis'. This disease is caused by Treponema pallidum subspecie pallidum with 11-12 million new cases around the globe on an annual basis. In this study we analyze the transportome of ten Treponema species, with emphasis on the types of encoded transport proteins and their substrates. Of the ten species examined, two (T. primitia and T. azonutricium) reside as symbionts in the guts of termites; six (T. pallidum, T. paraluiscuniculi, T. pedis, T. denticola, T. putidum and T. brennaborense) are pathogens of either humans or animals, and T. caldarium and T. succinifaciens are avirulent species, the former being thermophilic. All ten species have a repertoire of transport proteins that assists them in residing in their respective ecological niches. For instance, oral pathogens use transport proteins that take up nutrients uniquely present in their ecosystem; they also encode multiple multidrug/macromolecule exporters that protect against antimicrobials and aid in biofilm formation. Proteins of termite gut symbionts convert cellulose into other sugars that can be metabolized by the host. As often observed for pathogens and symbionts, several of these treponemes have reduced genome sizes, and their small genomes correlate with their dependencies on the host. Overall, the transportomes of T. pallidum and other pathogens have a conglomerate of parasitic lifestyle-assisting proteins. For example, a T. pallidum repeat protein (TprK) mediates immune evasion; outer membrane proteins (OMPs) allow nutrient uptake and end product export, and several ABC transporters catalyze sugar uptake, considered pivotal to parasitic lifestyles. Taken together, the results of this study yield new information that may help open new avenues of treponeme research.","authors":[{"name":"Bora Buyuktimkin"},{"name":"Hassan Zafar"},{"name":"Milton H Saier"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Diverse lifestyles"},{"word":"Free living"},{"word":"Pathogens"},{"word":"Symbionts"},{"word":"Transport proteins"},{"word":"Treponema"}]},"article245":{"pmid":"31029705","title":"Coordinated Cell Death in Isogenic Bacterial Populations: Sacrificing Some for the Benefit of Many?","date":"2019-12-21","abs":"Antibiotics are classically perceived as biological weapons that bacteria produce to hold their ground against competing species in their natural habitat. But in the context of multicellular differentiation processes, antimicrobial compounds sometimes also play a role in intraspecies competition, resulting in the death of a sub-population of genetically identical siblings for the benefit of the population. Such a strategy is based on the diversification and hence phenotypic heterogeneity of an isogenic bacterial population. This review article will address three such phenomena. In Bacillus subtilis, cannibalism is a differentiation strategy that enhances biofilm formation, prolongs or potentially even prevents full commitment to endospore formation under starvation conditions, and protects cells within the biofilm against competing species. The nutrients released by lysed cells can be used by the toxin producers, thereby delaying the full activation of the master regulator of sporulation. A related strategy is associated with the initiation of competence development under nutrient excess in Streptococcus pneumoniae. This process, termed fratricide, causes allolysis in a sub-population and is thought to enhance genetic diversity within the species. In Myxococcus xanthus, a large fraction of the population undergoes programmed cell death during the formation of fruiting bodies. This sacrifice ensures the survival of the sporulating sub-population by providing nutrients and hence energy to complete this differentiation process. The biological relevance and underlying regulatory mechanisms of these three processes will be discussed in order to extract common features of such strategies. Moreover, open questions and future challenges will be addressed.","authors":[{"name":"Philipp F Popp"},{"name":"Thorsten Mascher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"autolysis"},{"word":"cannibalism"},{"word":"fratricide"},{"word":"phenotypic heterogeneity"},{"word":"programmed cell death"}]},"article248":{"pmid":"31029348","title":"Green fabrication of anti-bacterial biofilm layer on endotracheal tubing using silver nanoparticles embedded in polyelectrolyte multilayered film.","date":"2019-08-29","abs":"Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) are a common source of bacterial colonization, leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

In our work we aimed the development of novel multifunctionalized 3D printed poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffolds with bioinspired surface coatings able to reduce bacterial biofilm formation while favoring human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) activity. For that purpose, 3D printing was used to prepare PLA scaffolds that were further multifunctionalized with collagen (Col), minocycline (MH) and bioinspired citrate- hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (cHA). PLA-Col-MH-cHA scaffolds provide a closer structural support approximation to native bone architecture with uniform macroporous, adequate wettability and an excellent compressive strength. The addition of MH resulted in an adequate antibiotic release profile that by being compatible with local drug delivery therapy was translated into antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, a main pathogen associated to bone-related infections. Subsequently, the hMSCs response to these scaffolds revealed that the incorporation of cHA significantly stimulated the adhesion, proliferation and osteogenesis-related gene expression (RUNX2, OCN and OPN) of hMSCs. Furthermore, the association of a bioinspired material (cHA) with the antibiotic MH resulted in a combined effect of an enhanced osteogenic activity. These findings, together with the antibiofilm activity depicted strengthen the appropriateness of this 3D-printed PLA-Col-MH-cHA scaffold for future use in bone repair. By targeting bone repair while mitigating the typical infections associated to bone implants, our 3D scaffolds deliver an integrated strategy with the combined effects further envisaging an increase in the success rate of bone-implanted devices.","authors":[{"name":"Victor Martin"},{"name":"Isabel A Ribeiro"},{"name":"Marta M Alves"},{"name":"Lídia Gonçalves"},{"name":"Ricardo A Claudio"},{"name":"Liliana Grenho"},{"name":"Maria H Fernandes"},{"name":"Pedro Gomes"},{"name":"Catarina F Santos"},{"name":"Ana F Bettencourt"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Additive manufacturing"},{"word":"Antibiofilm"},{"word":"Bone regeneration"},{"word":"Local-drug-delivery"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Tetracyclines"}]},"article250":{"pmid":"31029304","title":"Tailoring the synthesis of tantalum-based thin films for biomedical application: Characterization and biological response.","date":"2019-08-29","abs":"The aim of this study was to tailor the deposition parameters of magnetron sputtering to synthetize tantalum oxide (Ta","authors":[{"name":"Thamara Beline"},{"name":"José H D da Silva"},{"name":"Adaias O Matos"},{"name":"Nilton F Azevedo Neto"},{"name":"Amanda B de Almeida"},{"name":"Francisco H Nociti Júnior"},{"name":"Douglas M G Leite"},{"name":"Elidiane Cipriano Rangel"},{"name":"Valentim A R Barão"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Dental implants"},{"word":"Magnetron sputtering"},{"word":"Optical characterization"},{"word":"Tantalum oxide"}]},"article251":{"pmid":"31028863","title":"Antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-adhesive activities of biosurfactants isolated from Bacillus strains.","date":"2019-08-06","abs":"Biosurfactants are surface-active compounds that display a range of physiological functions.

In the present study, subtropical river biofilms were chronically exposed to TCS for 14 d at concentrations of 0.1-100 μg/L in artificial river water, which was followed by a 7 d recovery period.

Higher diversity was observed in the biofilms grown in AOM-impacted bulk water (BFAOM) than biofilms grown in HS-impacted (BFHS) and R2A-impacted bulk water (BFR2A) as the biofilms matured. In addition, some taxa (e.g., Rhodobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae) were enriched in BFAOM compared to BFHS and BFR2A. The biofilm image analysis results indicated that compared to BFHS, BFAOM and BFR2A had relatively thinner and heterogeneous physical structures with lower amounts of cell biomass, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and higher EPS protein/polysaccharide ratios. Overall, this study revealed how AOM- and HS-impacted bulk water shape the physiochemical and community structures of biofilms, which can provide insights into assessing biofilm-associated risks and optimizing disinfection practices for biofilm control in DWDS.","authors":[{"name":"Lei Li"},{"name":"Youchul Jeon"},{"name":"Sang-Hoon Lee"},{"name":"Hodon Ryu"},{"name":"Jorge W Santo Domingo"},{"name":"Youngwoo Seo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algal organic matter"},{"word":"Biofilm development"},{"word":"Drinking water"},{"word":"Humic substance"},{"word":"Physiochemical and community structure"}]},"article270":{"pmid":"31026615","title":"Comparison study of root canal disinfection by cold plasma jet and photodynamic therapy.","date":"2020-01-15","abs":"This study evaluated and compared the antibacterial effect of plasma and photodynamic therapy (PDT) in root canals infected with Enterococcus faecalis.","authors":[{"name":"Ameneh Armand"},{"name":"Mohammadreza Khani"},{"name":"Mohammad Asnaashari"},{"name":"Atousa AliAhmadi"},{"name":"Babak Shokri"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy"},{"word":"Disinfection"},{"word":"Photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"Plasma"},{"word":"Root canal"}]},"article271":{"pmid":"31026607","title":"Polyvinyl chloride biodegradation by Pseudomonas citronellolis and Bacillus flexus.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"The accumulation of high amounts of petroleum-derived plastics in the environment has raised ecological and health concerns. The aim of this work was to study the biodegradative abilities of five bacterial strains, namely Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas citronellolis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus flexus and Chelatococcus daeguensis, towards polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride films under aerobic conditions. Preliminary screening resulted in the selection of P. citronellolis and B. flexus as potential PVC film degraders. Both strains were able to form a biofilm on the plastic film surface and to cause some modifications to the FTIR spectra of biomass-free PVC films. The two strains were then used to set up a PVC film biodegradation assay in 2-liter flasks. After 45 days incubation, fragmentation of the film was observed, suggesting that PVC biodegradative activity took place. Gel permeation chromatography analysis showed a reduction in average molecular weight of 10% for PVC incubated with P. citronellolis, with PVC polymer chains apparently attacked. Based on these results, the P. citronellolis strain was selected for biodegradation assays of two waste PVC films, used either nonsterile or subjected to ethanol sterilization. Chemical analyses on the incubated films confirmed the biodegradation of waste PVC plastics as shown by a gravimetric weight loss of up to about 19% after 30 days incubation. In summary, this work reports the biodegradation of PVC films by P. citronellolis and B. flexus. Both strains were shown to act mainly against PVC additives, exhibiting a low biodegradation rate of PVC polymer.","authors":[{"name":"Lucia Giacomucci"},{"name":"Noura Raddadi"},{"name":"Michelina Soccio"},{"name":"Nadia Lotti"},{"name":"Fabio Fava"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus flexus"},{"word":"Polyvinyl chloride biodegradation"},{"word":"Pseudomonas citronellolis"},{"word":"Waste plastic"}]},"article272":{"pmid":"31026587","title":"Crystal structure of basal pilin SpaE reveals the molecular basis of its incorporation in the lactobacillar SpaFED pilus.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"For some Gram-positive genera and species, the long-extended and adhesive sortase-dependent pilus plays an essential role during host colonization, biofilm formation, and immune modulation.

In this paper, we propose a functional gene-based composition prediction (FCP) model to predict the population structure composition within a microbial community. The model predicts the community composition well in both a low-complexity community as acid mine drainage (AMD) microbiota, and a complex community as human gut microbiota. Furthermore, we define community structure shaping (CSS) genes as functional genes crucial for shaping the microbial community. We have identified CSS genes in AMD and human gut microbiota samples with FCP model and find that CSS genes change with the conditions. Compared to essential genes for microbes, CSS genes are significantly enriched in the genes involved in mobile genetic elements, cell motility, and defense mechanisms, indicating that the functions of CSS genes are focused on communication and strategies in response to the environment factors. We further find that it is the minority, rather than the majority, which contributes to maintaining community structure. Compared to health control samples, we find that some functional genes associated with metabolism of amino acids, nucleotides, and lipopolysaccharide are more likely to be CSS genes in the disease group. CSS genes may help us to understand critical cellular processes and be useful in seeking addable gene circuitries to maintain artificial self-sustainable communities.

In this study, nine novel fungal DLPs were firstly identified by querying against UniProt databases and expressed in Pichia pastoris, and their antibacterial and anti-biofilm ability were tested against multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus. Results showed that among them, P2, the highest activity and expression level, showed low toxicity, no resistance, and high stability.

P2 exhibited the potent activity against intracellular MDR S. aureus (bacterial reduction in 80-97%) in RAW264.7 macrophages. P2 bound to/disrupted bacterial DNA, wrinkled outer membranes and permeabilized cytoplasmic membranes, but maintained the integrity of bacterial cells.

One of the main sources of contamination comes from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents that contain wide range of micro- and macropollutants. Chemical composition, toxicity levels and impact of treated effluents (TEs) on the recipient aquatic ecosystems may strongly differ depending on the wastewater origin. Compared to urban TEs, hospital ones may contain more active pharmaceutical substances. Benthic diatoms are relevant ecological indicators because of their high species and ecological diversity and rapid response to human pressure. They are routinely used for water quality monitoring. However, there is a knowledge gap on diatom communities' development and behavior in treated wastewater in relation to prevailing micro- and macropollutants. In this study, we aim to (1) investigate the response of diatom communities to urban and hospital TEs, and (2) evaluate TEs effect on communities in the recipient river. Environmental biofilms were colonized in TEs and the recipient river up- and downstream from the WWTP output to study benthic diatoms using DNA metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS). In parallel, concentrations of nutrients, pharmaceuticals and seasonal conditions were recorded. Diatom metabarcoding showed that benthic communities differed strongly in their diversity and structure depending on the habitat. TE sites were generally dominated by few genera with polysaprobic preferences belonging to the motile guild, while river sites favored diverse communities from oligotrophic and oligosaprobic groups. Seasonal changes were visible to lower extent. To categorize parameters important for diatom changes we performed redundancy analysis which suggested that communities within TE sites were associated to higher concentrations of beta-blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in urban effluents vs. antibiotics and orthophosphate in hospital effluents. Furthermore, indicator species analysis showed that 27% of OTUs detected in river downstream communities were indicator for urban or hospital TE sites and were absent in the river upstream. Finally, biological diatom index (BDI) calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the recipient river suggested water quality decrease linked to the release of TEs. Thus, in-depth assessment of diatom community composition using DNA metabarcoding is proposed as a promising technique to highlight the disturbing effect of pollutants in Alpine rivers.","authors":[{"name":"Teofana Chonova"},{"name":"Rainer Kurmayer"},{"name":"Frédéric Rimet"},{"name":"Jérôme Labanowski"},{"name":"Valentin Vasselon"},{"name":"François Keck"},{"name":"Paul Illmer"},{"name":"Agnès Bouchez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNA metabarcoding"},{"word":"WWTP effluents"},{"word":"diatom communities"},{"word":"functional traits"},{"word":"indicator species analysis"},{"word":"pharmaceuticals"},{"word":"water quality index"}]},"article285":{"pmid":"31024468","title":"Polymorphisms of a Collagen-Like Adhesin Contributes to Legionella pneumophila Adhesion, Biofilm Formation Capacity and Clinical Prevalence.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Legionellosis is a severe respiratory illness caused by the inhalation of aerosolized water droplets contaminated with the opportunistic pathogen Legionella pneumophila. The ability of L. pneumophila to produce biofilms has been associated with its capacity to colonize and persist in human-made water reservoirs and distribution systems, which are the source of legionellosis outbreaks. Nevertheless, the factors that mediate L. pneumophila biofilm formation are largely unknown. In previous studies we reported that the adhesin Legionella collagen-like protein (Lcl), is required for auto-aggregation, attachment to multiple surfaces and the formation of biofilms. Lcl structure contains three distinguishable regions: An N-terminal region with a predicted signal sequence, a central region containing tandem collagen-like repeats (R-domain) and a C-terminal region (C-domain) with no significant homology to other known proteins. Lcl R-domain encodes tandem repeats of the collagenous tripeptide Gly-Xaa-Yaa (GXY), a motif that is key for the molecular organization of mammalian collagen and mediates the binding of collagenous proteins to different cellular and environmental ligands. Interestingly, Lcl is polymorphic in the number of GXY tandem repeats. In this study, we combined diverse biochemical, genetic, and cellular approaches to determine the role of Lcl domains and GXY repeats polymorphisms on the structural and functional properties of Lcl, as well as on bacterial attachment, aggregation and biofilm formation. Our results indicate that the R-domain is key for assembling Lcl collagenous triple-helices and has a more preponderate role over the C-domain in Lcl adhesin binding properties. We show that Lcl molecules oligomerize to form large supramolecular complexes to which both, R and C-domains are required. Furthermore, we found that the number of GXY tandem repeats encoded in Lcl R-domain correlates positively with the binding capabilities of Lcl and with the attachment and biofilm production capacity of L. pneumophila strains. Accordingly, the number of GXY tandem repeats in Lcl influences the clinical prevalence of L. pneumophila strains. Therefore, the number of Lcl tandem repeats could be considered as a potential predictor for virulence in L. pneumophila isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Mena Abdel-Nour"},{"name":"Han Su"},{"name":"Carla Duncan"},{"name":"Shaopei Li"},{"name":"Deepa Raju"},{"name":"Feras Shamoun"},{"name":"Marine Valton"},{"name":"Christophe Ginevra"},{"name":"Sophie Jarraud"},{"name":"Cyril Guyard"},{"name":"Kagan Kerman"},{"name":"Mauricio R Terebiznik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Legionella pneumophila"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell–cell adhesion"},{"word":"clinical prevalence"},{"word":"collagen-like adhesion"}]},"article286":{"pmid":"31023592","title":"Activity of base analogues (5-fluorouracil, 5-flucytosine) against planktonic cells and mature biofilm of Candida yeast.

Analysis of the pP32BP2 nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of three predicted phenotypic modules that comprise nearly 30% of the plasmid genome. These modules appear to be involved in fimbriae synthesis via the chaperone-usher pathway (FIM module) and the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of carnitine (CAR and CAI modules, respectively). The FIM module was found to be functional in diverse hosts since it facilitated the attachment of bacterial cells to abiotic surfaces, enhancing biofilm formation. The CAI module did not show measurable activity in any of the tested strains. Interestingly, the CAR module enabled the enzymatic breakdown of carnitine, but this led to the formation of the toxic by-product trimethylamine, which inhibited bacterial growth. Thus, on the one hand, pP32BP2 can enhance biofilm formation, a highly advantageous feature in cold environments, while on the other, it may prevent bacterial growth under certain environmental conditions. The detrimental effect of harboring pP32BP2 (and its CAR module) seems to be conditional, since this replicon may also confer the ability to use carnitine as an alternative carbon source, although a pathway to utilize trimethylamine is most probably necessary to make this beneficial. Therefore, the phenotype determined by this CAR-containing plasmid depends on the metabolic background of the host strain.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Ciok"},{"name":"Adrian Cegielski"},{"name":"Dariusz Bartosik"},{"name":"Lukasz Dziewit"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Arctic"},{"word":"Psychrobacter"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"carnitine metabolism"},{"word":"plasmid"},{"word":"psychrophile"},{"word":"trimethylamine"}]},"article289":{"pmid":"31022884","title":"Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm N-acetyl-L-cysteine Grafted Siloxane Polymers with Potential for Use in Water Systems.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Antibiofilm strategies may be based on the prevention of initial bacterial adhesion, the inhibition of biofilm maturation or biofilm eradication.

These infections often occur with the use of indwelling medical devices, such as endotracheal tubes (ETTs), that can result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). When examining the various routes of infection, VAP is associated with the highest incidence, rate of morbidity, and economic burden. Although ETTs are essential for the survival of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, their use comes with complications. The presence of an ETT in the airway impairs physiological host defense mechanisms for clearance of pathogens and provides a platform for oropharynx microorganism transport to the sterile tracheobronchial network. Antibiotics are administered to treat lower respiratory infections; however, they are not always effective and consequently can result in increased antibiotic resistance. Prophylactic approaches by altering the surface of ETTs to prevent the establishment and growth of bacteria have exhibited promising results. In addition, passive surface modifications that prevent bacterial establishment and growth, or active coatings that possess a bactericidal effect have also proven effective. In this review we aim to highlight the importance of preventing biofilm establishment on indwelling medical devices, focusing on ETTs. We will investigate successful antimicrobial modifications to ETTs and the future avenues that will ultimately decrease HAIs and improve patient care. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Infections that occur with indwelling medicals devices remain a constant concern in the medical field and can result in hospital-acquired infections. Specifically, ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs with the use of an endotracheal tube (ETT). Infections often require use of antibiotics and can result in patient mortality. Our review includes a summary of the recent collective work of antimicrobial ETT modifications and potential avenues for further investigations in an effort to reduce VAP associated with ETTs. Polymer modifications with antibacterial nature have been developed and tested; however, a focus on ETTs is lacking and clinical availability of new antimicrobial ETT devices is limited. Our collective work shows the successful and prospective applications to the surfaces of ETTs that can support researchers and physicians to create safer medical devices.","authors":[{"name":"Megan Barnes"},{"name":"Corbin Feit"},{"name":"Trudy-Ann Grant"},{"name":"Elizabeth J Brisbois"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial polymers"},{"word":"Endotracheal tube (ETT)"},{"word":"Hospital acquired infections (HAIs)"},{"word":"Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP)"}]},"article293":{"pmid":"31022421","title":"Underperforming light curing procedures trigger detrimental irradiance-dependent biofilm response on incrementally placed dental composites.","date":"2019-09-07","abs":"Insufficient radiant exposure (J/cm","authors":[{"name":"Haifa Maktabi"},{"name":"Maria Ibrahim"},{"name":"Qoot Alkhubaizi"},{"name":"Michael Weir"},{"name":"Hockin Xu"},{"name":"Howard Strassler"},{"name":"Ana Paula P Fugolin"},{"name":"Carmem S Pfeifer"},{"name":"Mary Anne S Melo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Light curing"},{"word":"Oral biofilm"},{"word":"Resin composite"},{"word":"S. mutans"},{"word":"The degree of conversion"}]},"article294":{"pmid":"31022418","title":"Electrochemical detection of food-spoiling bacteria using interdigitated platinum microelectrodes.","date":"2020-02-24","abs":"The fast and non-destructive detection of bacterial attachment on food contact surfaces is important for the prevention of the unwanted formation of biofilms.

Conventional strategies in controlling the contaminations are significantly limited either by biofouling or by the irreversible consumption of antimicrobial agents. Herein, we report a robust methodology to create rechargeable biocidal poly(vinyl alcohol- co-ethylene) films (SBMA@HAF films) with antifouling function via chemically incorporating both N-halamine (HAF) and zwitterionic moieties [[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide (SBMA)]. The promise of the design exhibits three features to defeat bacterial contaminations: (i) zwitterionic moieties can effectively reduce bacterial attachment onto the films, (ii) N-halamine with robust rechargeable biocidal activity can rapidly kill any attached bacteria, and (iii) any inactivated bacterial debris can be easily released to avoid biofilm formation due to the superhydrophilicity of the zwitterions. The resulting SBMA@HAF films exhibit integrated properties of high transparency, robust mechanical property, great hydrophilicity, ease of chlorine recharging (>250 ppm), long-term stability, high biocidal efficacy (>99.9999% via contact killing), and promising antifouling functions, which enable the SBMA@HAF films to serve as a biocidal material in food packaging applications.","authors":[{"name":"Yue Ma"},{"name":"Jiaying Li"},{"name":"Yang Si"},{"name":"Kang Huang"},{"name":"Nitin Nitin"},{"name":"Gang Sun"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PVA-co-PE"},{"word":"antifouling"},{"word":"photo-graft"},{"word":"rechargeable antimicrobial"},{"word":"zwitterionic surface"}]},"article297":{"pmid":"31022167","title":"Genetic dissection of Escherichia coli's master diguanylate cyclase DgcE: Role of the N-terminal MASE1 domain and direct signal input from a GTPase partner system.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"The ubiquitous second messenger c-di-GMP promotes bacterial biofilm formation by playing diverse roles in the underlying regulatory networks. This is reflected in the multiplicity of diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and phosphodiesterases (PDE) that synthesize and degrade c-di-GMP, respectively, in most bacterial species. One of the 12 DGCs of Escherichia coli, DgcE, serves as the top-level trigger for extracellular matrix production during macrocolony biofilm formation. Its multi-domain architecture-a N-terminal membrane-inserted MASE1 domain followed by three PAS, a GGDEF and a degenerate EAL domain-suggested complex signal integration and transmission through DgcE. Genetic dissection of DgcE revealed activating roles for the MASE1 domain and the dimerization-proficient PAS3 region, whereas the inhibitory EALdeg domain counteracts the formation of DgcE oligomers. The MASE1 domain is directly targeted by the GTPase RdcA (YjdA), a dimer or oligomer that together with its partner protein RdcB (YjcZ) activates DgcE, probably by aligning and promoting dimerization of the PAS3 and GGDEF domains. This activation and RdcA/DgcE interaction depend on GTP hydrolysis by RdcA, suggesting GTP as an inhibitor and the pronounced decrease of the cellular GTP pool during entry into stationary phase, which correlates with DgcE-dependent activation of matrix production, as a possible input signal sensed by RdcA. Furthermore, DgcE exhibits rapid, continuous and processive proteolytic turnover that also depends on the relatively disordered transmembrane MASE1 domain. Overall, our study reveals a novel GTP/c-di-GMP-connecting signaling pathway through the multi-domain DGC DgcE with a dual role for the previously uncharacterized MASE1 signaling domain.","authors":[{"name":"Vanessa Pfiffer"},{"name":"Olga Sarenko"},{"name":"Alexandra Possling"},{"name":"Regine Hengge"}],"keywords":[]},"article298":{"pmid":"31021953","title":"Regulation of virulence and antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive microbes in response to cell wall-active antibiotics.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Antibiotic stress can evoke considerable genotypic and phenotypic changes in Gram-positive bacteria.

For this purpose, quantification of the pigment production in the presence of these nanoparticles was monitored using the C. violaceum strain. Additionally, a combination of different microscopical imaging techniques was applied to examine the changes in the 3D biofilm structure of P. aeruginosa, which were quantified through performing architectural metric calculations (substratum area, cell area coverage and biovolume). SeNPs produce an 80% inhibition in the violacein production by C. violaceum and a significant effect on the P. aeruginosa biofilm architecture (a reduction of 80% in the biovolume of the bacterial biofilm was obtained). TeNPs similarly affect violacein production and the P. aeruginosa biofilm structure but at lower concentration levels.

In the natural environment, several non-pathogenic bacteria are present as mixed population along with pathogenic bacteria and they control the behavior of microbial community by producing secondary metabolites. Similarly, non-pathogenic bacteria also take advantages of the QS signaling molecule as a sole carbon source for their growth through catabolism with enzymes. Several enzymes are produced by bacteria which disrupt the biofilm architecture by degrading the composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) such as exopolysaccharide, extracellular- DNA and protein.

The phosphorylation state of HsbA thus drives the switch between the sessile and planktonic way of life of P. aeruginosa by driving the release or the sequestration of one or the other of these two sigma factors.","authors":[{"name":"Sophie Bouillet"},{"name":"Moly Ba"},{"name":"Laetitia Houot"},{"name":"Chantal Iobbi-Nivol"},{"name":"Christophe Bordi"}],"keywords":[]},"article312":{"pmid":"31018439","title":"Agro-industrial residues as a unique support in a sand filter to enhance the bioactivity to remove microcystin-Leucine aRginine and organics.","date":"2019-06-19","abs":"In the past, the versatility of a biosand filter has been successfully checked to counter suspended solids, metals, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), coliforms and other water quality parameters (WQPs) from the drinking water sources.

However, it is challenging yet important to investigate mechanical behaviors of biofilms with a high spatial resolution because biofilms are very heterogeneous. Moreover, biofilms are viscoelastic, and their time-dependent mechanical behavior is difficult to capture. Herein, we develop a powerful technique that combines the high spatial resolution of an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a rigorous history-dependent viscoelastic analysis to deliver highly spatial-localized biofilm properties within a wide time-frequency window. By exploiting the use of static force spectroscopy in combination with an appropriate viscoelastic framework, we highlight the intensive amount of time-dependent information experimentally available that has been largely overlooked. It is shown that this technique provides a detailed nanorheological signature of the biofilms even at the single-cell level.

Despite important advances, how fusion modules affect the self-assembly and functional properties of amyloids remains elusive. Here, using Escherichia coli curli as a model system, we systematically studied the effect of flanking domains on the structures, assembly kinetics and functions of amyloids. The designed amyloids were composed of E. coli biofilm protein CsgA (as amyloidogenic cores) and one or two flanking domains, consisting of chitin-binding domains (CBDs) from Bacillus circulans chitinase, and/or mussel foot proteins (Mfps). Incorporation of fusion domains did not disrupt the typical β-sheet structures, but indeed affected assembly rate, morphology, and stiffness of resultant fibrils. Consequently, the CsgA-fusion fibrils, particularly those containing three domains, were much shorter than the CsgA-only fibrils. Furthermore, the stiffness of the resultant fibrils was heavily affected by the structural feature of fusion domains, with β-sheet-containing domains tending to increase the Young's modulus while random coil domains decreasing the Young's modulus. In addition, fibrils containing CBD domains showed higher chitin-binding activity compared to their CBD-free counterparts. The CBD-CsgA-Mfp3 construct exhibited significantly lower binding activity than Mfp5-CsgA-CBD due to inappropriate folding of the CBD domain in the former construct, in agreement with results based upon molecular dynamics modeling.

I report an approach to study temporal features of Caulobacter crescentus colonization and pellicle biofilm development at the air-liquid interface and have defined the role of cell surface structures in this process. At this interface, C. crescentus initially forms a monolayer of cells bearing a surface adhesin known as the holdfast. When excised from the liquid surface, this monolayer strongly adheres to glass. The monolayer subsequently develops into a three-dimensional structure that is highly enriched in clusters of stalked cells known as rosettes. As this pellicle film matures, it becomes more cohesive and less adherent to a glass surface. A mutant strain lacking a flagellum does not efficiently reach the surface, and strains lacking type IV pili exhibit defects in organization of the three-dimensional pellicle. Strains unable to synthesize the holdfast fail to accumulate at the boundary between air and liquid and do not form a pellicle. Phase-contrast images support a model whereby the holdfast functions to trap C. crescentus cells at the air-liquid boundary. Unlike the holdfast, neither the flagellum nor type IV pili are required for C. crescentus to partition to the air-liquid interface. While it is well established that the holdfast enables adherence to solid surfaces, this study provides evidence that the holdfast has physicochemical properties that allow partitioning of nonmotile mother cells to the air-liquid interface and facilitate colonization of this microenvironment.","authors":[{"name":"Aretha Fiebig"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alphaproteobacteria"},{"word":"Caulobacter"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"flagellum"},{"word":"holdfast"},{"word":"neuston"},{"word":"pellicle"},{"word":"type 4 pilus"},{"word":"unipolar polysaccharide"}]},"article337":{"pmid":"31010865","title":"Efficacy of Aerosolized Rifaximin versus Tobramycin for Treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pneumonia in Mice.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic bacterial pathogen that can cause chronic lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

In C57BL/6 mice, penetration of nebulized TOB into the lungs was shown at a higher level than that of RFX. Further, in vivo assessment using a DBA/2 mouse lung infection model found increased survival rates with a single-dose treatment of nebulized RFX and decreased P. aeruginosa PAO1 bioburden with a multiple-dose treatment of RFX plus TOB. In addition, mice treated with a single exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent that dissolves RFX, showed no apparent toxicity.

However, a frail point of the CIP procedures is their variable efficiency in eliminating biofilm bacteria. In the present study, we evaluated the susceptibility of strong biofilm-forming dairy Bacillus isolates to industrial cleaning procedures using two differently designed model systems. According to our results, the dairy-associated Bacillus isolates demonstrate a higher resistance to CIP procedures, compared to the non-dairy strain of B. subtilis. Notably, the tested dairy isolates are highly persistent to different parameters of the CIP operations, including the turbulent flow of liquid (up to 1 log), as well as the cleaning and disinfecting effects of commercial detergents (up to 2.3 log). Moreover, our observations indicate an enhanced resistance of poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA)-overproducing B. subtilis, which produces high amounts of proteinaceous extracellular matrix, to the CIP procedures (about 0.7 log, compared to the wild-type non-dairy strain of B. subtilis). We therefore suggest that the enhanced resistance to the CIP procedures by the dairy Bacillus isolates can be attributed to robust biofilm formation. In addition, this study underlines the importance of evaluating the efficiency of commercial cleaning agents in relation to strong biofilm-forming bacteria, which are relevant to industrial conditions. Consequently, we believe that the findings of this study can facilitate the assessment and refining of the industrial CIP procedures.","authors":[{"name":"Ievgeniia Ostrov"},{"name":"Tali Paz"},{"name":"Moshe Shemesh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus species"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm derived spores"},{"word":"cleaning-in-place"},{"word":"dairy industry"},{"word":"disinfecting effect"}]},"article341":{"pmid":"30828441","title":"Anti-infective potential of hydroalcoholic extract of Punica  granatum peel against gram-negative bacterial pathogens.","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Chinmayi Joshi"},{"name":"Pooja Patel"},{"name":"Vijay Kothari"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Microwave Assisted Extraction"},{"word":"Post Extract Effect"},{"word":"Prebiotic"},{"word":"Punica granatum peel"},{"word":"Quorum Sensing"}]},"article342":{"pmid":"31009806","title":"VraSR has an important role in immune evasion of Staphylococcus aureus with low level vancomycin resistance.","date":"2020-02-06","abs":"Vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous VISA (hVISA) are increasingly being reported as associated with treatment failure.

Currently, all alginate used commercially is extracted from brown seaweed. However, with environmental changes such as increasing ocean temperature and the increasing number of biotechnological uses of alginates with specific properties, there is an emerging need for more reliable and customizable sources of alginate. An alternative to seaweed for alginate production is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common Gram-negative bacterium that can form alginate-containing biofilms. However, P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, we sought to engineer a non-pathogenic P. aeruginosa strain that is safe for commercial production of alginate. Using a homologous recombination strategy, we sequentially deleted five key pathogenicity genes from the P. aeruginosa chromosome, resulting in the marker-free strain PGN5. Intraperitoneal injection of mice with PGN5 resulted in 0% mortality, while injection with wild-type P. aeruginosa resulted in 95% mortality, providing evidence that the systemic virulence of PGN5 is highly attenuated. Importantly, PGN5 produces large amounts of alginate in response to overexpression of MucE, an activator of alginate biosynthesis. The alginate produced by PGN5 is structurally identical to alginate produced by wild-type P. aeruginosa, indicating that the alginate biosynthetic pathway remains functional in this modified strain. The genetic versatility of P. aeruginosa will allow us to further engineer PGN5 to produce alginates with specific chemical compositions and physical properties to meet different industrial and biomedical needs.","authors":[{"name":"Meagan E Valentine"},{"name":"Brandon D Kirby"},{"name":"Thomas R Withers"},{"name":"Shannon L Johnson"},{"name":"Timothy E Long"},{"name":"Youai Hao"},{"name":"Joseph S Lam"},{"name":"Richard M Niles"},{"name":"Hongwei D Yu"}],"keywords":[]},"article351":{"pmid":"31006638","title":"Strain- and Species-Level Variation in the Microbiome of Diabetic Wounds Is Associated with Clinical Outcomes and Therapeutic Efficacy.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Chronic wounds are a major complication of diabetes associated with high morbidity and health care expenditures.

For effective therapy to resolve biofilm infections it is essential to assess the efficacy of commonly used antibiotics against biofilms. Here, we offer a robust and simple assay to assess the efficacy of antibiotics against biofilms. In the present work, we carefully optimized the incubation time, detection range, and fluorescence reading mode for resazurin-based viability staining of biofilms in 96-well-plates and determined minimal biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) for A. baumannii isolates from patients with chronic infection. By applying this assay, we demonstrated that antibiotic response patterns varied uniquely within the biofilm formation of various clinical samples. MBEC-50 and 75 have significant discriminatory power over minimum inhibitory concentrations for planktonic suspensions to differentiate the overall efficiency of an antibiotic to eradicate a biofilm.

The MgtC membrane protein has been proposed as an attractive target that is involved in the ability of several major bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to survive inside macrophages. In liquid culture, P. aeruginosa MgtC acts negatively on biofilm formation. However, a putative link between these two functions of MgtC in P. aeruginosa has not been experimentally addressed. In the present study, we first investigated the contribution of exopolysaccharides (EPS) in the intramacrophage survival defect and biofilm increase of mgtC mutant. Within infected macrophages, expression of EPS genes psl and alg was increased in a P. aeruginosa mgtC mutant strain comparatively to wild-type strain. However, the intramacrophage survival defect of mgtC mutant was not rescued upon introduction of psl or alg mutation, suggesting that MgtC intramacrophage role is unrelated to EPS production, whereas the increased biofilm formation of mgtC mutant was partially suppressed by introduction of psl mutation. We aimed to develop an antivirulence strategy targeting MgtC, by taking advantage of a natural antagonistic peptide, MgtR. Heterologous expression of mgtR in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was shown to reduce its ability to survive within macrophages. We investigated for the first time the biological effect of a synthetic MgtR peptide on P. aeruginosa. Exogenously added synthetic MgtR peptide lowered the intramacrophage survival of wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1, thus mimicking the phenotype of an mgtC mutant as well as the effect of endogenously produced MgtR peptide. In correlation with this finding, addition of MgtR peptide to bacterial culture strongly reduced MgtC protein level, without reducing bacterial growth or viability, thus differing from classical antimicrobial peptides. On the other hand, the addition of exogenous MgtR peptide did not affect significantly biofilm formation, indicating an action toward EPS-independent phenotype rather than EPS-related phenotype. Cumulatively, our results show an antivirulence action of synthetic MgtR peptide, which may be more potent against acute infection, and provide a proof of concept for further exploitation of anti-Pseudomonas strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Malika Moussouni"},{"name":"Pauline Nogaret"},{"name":"Preeti Garai"},{"name":"Bérengère Ize"},{"name":"Eric Vivès"},{"name":"Anne-Béatrice Blanc-Potard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"MgtC"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antivirulence strategy"},{"word":"macrophage"},{"word":"peptide"}]},"article380":{"pmid":"31001485","title":"Recent Advances in Anti-virulence Therapeutic Strategies With a Focus on Dismantling Bacterial Membrane Microdomains, Toxin Neutralization, Quorum-Sensing Interference and Biofilm Inhibition.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Antimicrobial resistance constitutes one of the major challenges facing humanity in the Twenty-First century.

While there have been several studies investigating synthetic meshes, there is limited data comparing synthetic and biologic meshes in vitro in an infection model. This study evaluates the in vitro susceptibility of both synthetic and biologic meshes to single-species methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms. This research compares biofilm biomass, average thickness, and coverage between the three meshes through florescent in situ hybridization (FISH), confocal scanning microscopy (CSLM), and image analysis.

It produces various toxins and invasive enzymes and can be found in numerous food products. Milk is an important source of staphylococcal food poisoning. After pasteurization, this microorganism or its enterotoxins might still remain in pasteurized milk. Therefore, this study was to investigate the contamination of S. aureus in 258 pasteurized milk from 39 cities of China. The prevalence and levels of S. aureus in these samples as well as antibiotic susceptibility profiles, virulence genes, biofilm formation, and biofilm related genes, spa typing and MLST were used to determine the characterization among the isolates. It was found 3.9% of samples were detected S. aureus in 8 of 39 cities in China. The contaminated level were not very excessive which showed the MPN values of the most positive samples (9/10) were less than 1 MPN/g. All pasteurized milk-related S. aureus isolates have ability to produce biofilm and harbored icaA, icaD, eno, clfA, clfB, fnbA, fnbB, fib genes, other biofilm related genes icaC were showed in 91.7% of isolates and cna gene were showed in 50%, except bap gene which were free in all isolates. The antibiotic susceptibility test showed that all isolates were resistant or intermediate-resistant to different concentrations of the antibiotics. Furthermore, 75.0% of the isolates were resistant to three or more antibiotic classes, which indicated multidrug resistance. The isolates had virulence potential, which showed 66.7% (8/12) of the isolates carried one or more virulence-associated genes. Molecular typing by MLST and spa typing enabled classification of these isolates into a total of 11 sequence types (STs) and spa types, which indicated high genetic diversity. Most of these types were related to various clinical S. aureus infections. Thus, the findings of this study reflect the potential risk of S. aureus infection in China. Our study also provides comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of S. aureus in pasteurized milk and helps ensure more accurate treatment of human infection with effective antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Jingsha Dai"},{"name":"Shi Wu"},{"name":"Jiahui Huang"},{"name":"Qingping Wu"},{"name":"Feng Zhang"},{"name":"Jumei Zhang"},{"name":"Juan Wang"},{"name":"Yu Ding"},{"name":"Shuhong Zhang"},{"name":"Xiaojuan Yang"},{"name":"Tao Lei"},{"name":"Liang Xue"},{"name":"Haoming Wu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MLST"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"pasteurized milk"},{"word":"risk assessment"},{"word":"spa typing"},{"word":"virulence genes"}]},"article384":{"pmid":"31001223","title":"Identification of Cbp1, a c-di-GMP Binding Chemoreceptor in Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 Involved in Chemotaxis and Nodulation of the Host Plant.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Cbp1, a chemoreceptor containing a PilZ domain was identified in Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571, a nitrogen-fixing free-living soil bacterium that induces nodule formation in both the roots and stems of the host legume Sesbania rostrata.

PilZ domain proteins are known to bind the second messenger c-di-GMP, an important regulator of motility, biofilm formation and virulence. Cbp1 was shown to bind c-di-GMP through the conserved RxxxR motif of its PilZ domain.

UVc radiation is the most disinfection technology usually applied for wastewater and proven to be effective to inactivate microorganisms. However, efficiency against motile bacteria is not yet studied. This study aims to explain the mechanisms of resistance of swarmer P. aeruginosa cells toward UVc exposure. P. aeruginosa liquid cultures were allowed to swarm across a semisolid surface for 18 h and directly exposed to UVc radiations. Emergent swarmer colonies, revealed after re-incubation, were selected to study biofilm formation, fatty acid (FA) composition, and ultrastructure. Our results showed that membrane adaptation to UVc radiations was seen in Pseudomonas cells by an increase of cyclic fatty acid (CFA) content, confirming the role of cyclopropane in radio-resistance of swarmer cells. Furthermore, electron microscopic study confirmed that over production of S-layer is believed to be a protective form adopted by P. aeruginosa swarmer cells to resist after 5 min of UVc exposure. Moreover, membrane disintegration is the lethal effect observed after 15 min of UVc exposure. In the other hand, study of biofilm production showed an enhancement of biofilm formation, of swarmer cells mainly after 15 min of UVc exposure. There results confirmed that swarming process is highly correlated with particular FA composition of P. aeruginosa membrane and that radio-resistance of swarmer cells is highly supported by CFA biosynthesis and S-layer overproduction.","authors":[{"name":"Salma Kloula Ben Ghorbal"},{"name":"Kalthoum Chourabi"},{"name":"Lobna Maalej"},{"name":"Aouatef Ben Ammar"},{"name":"Hadda-Imene Ouzari"},{"name":"Abdenaceur Hassen"},{"name":"Habib Jaafoura"},{"name":"Abdelwaheb Chatti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"UVc"},{"word":"fatty acids"},{"word":"membrane"},{"word":"swarming"},{"word":"ultrastructure"}]},"article386":{"pmid":"31000791","title":"Isolation and characterisation of pVa-21, a giant bacteriophage with anti-biofilm potential against Vibrio alginolyticus.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"There is an increasing emergence of antibiotic-resistant Vibrio alginolyticus, a zoonotic pathogen that causes mass mortality in aquatic animals and infects humans; therefore, there is a demand for alternatives to antibiotics for the treatment and prevention of infections caused by this pathogen.

Our aim was to apply scanning electron microscopy to compare the efficacy of two types of wound dressings in preventing the formation of bacterial biofilm on burn patient skin graft donor sites. One dressing contained bismuth tribromophenate at a concentration of 3% which confers it bacteriostatic properties (Xeroform™).

Samples prepared by this method were then analyzed using SEM, which allowed the characterization of biofilm and the evaluation of bacterial density on the studied dressing samples.

Previous studies have shown that the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate ratio is a critical determinant of PTS functions. This study shows that 2-oxo-4-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-3-furancarbonitrile (MW01), a compound with structural similarity to known natural products, induces Vibrio cholerae to grow preferentially in the biofilm mode in a mechanism that involves interaction with pyruvate. Spectrophotometric assays were used to monitor bacterial growth kinetics in microtiter plates and quantitatively evaluate biofilm formation in borosilicate glass tubes. Evidence of MW01 and pyruvate interactions was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

In this study, a novel biobased sanitizer composition was developed to effectively target biofilms and deliver chlorine-based sanitizers to inactivate bacterial and fungal biofilms. The biobased composition was developed by encapsulating a chlorine-binding polymer in a biobased yeast cell wall particle (YCWP) microcarrier. This study demonstrates the high affinity of biobased compositions to bind target bacterial and fungal cells and inactivate 5 logs of model pathogenic bacteria and fungi in wash water without and with high organic load (chemical oxygen demand = 2000 mg/L) in 30 s and 5 min, respectively. For the sanitation of biofilms, this biobased sanitizer can inactivate 7 logs of pathogenic bacteria and 3 logs of fungi after 1 h treatment, whereas the 1 h treatment using conventional chlorine-based sanitizer can only achieve 2-3 log reduction for bacterial biofilms and 1-2 log reduction for fungal biofilms, respectively. The enhanced antimicrobial activity can be attributed to three factors: (a) localized high concentration of chlorine bound on the YCWPs; (b) high affinity of YCWPs to bind diverse microbes; and (c) improved stability in an organic-rich aqueous environment. In summary, these unique attributes of biobased carriers will significantly enhance the sanitation efficacy of biofilms, reduce the persistence and transmission of antimicrobial resistant microbes, limit the use of antimicrobial chemicals, and improve the cost-effectiveness of sanitizers.","authors":[{"name":"Kang Huang"},{"name":"Fang Dou"},{"name":"Nitin Nitin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"N-halamine"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"particle-based sanitizer"},{"word":"yeast cell wall particles"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"30997794","title":"Silica-Coated Gold-Silver Nanocages as Photothermal Antibacterial Agents for Combined Anti-Infective Therapy.","date":"2019-11-11","abs":"Because of the abuse of antibiotics and threats of antibiotic resistance, bacterial infection is still one of the most difficult issues to be resolved.
