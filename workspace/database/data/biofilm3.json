Biofilm contains homogenous or heterogeneous microorganisms that remain enclosed in a matrix of an extracellular polymeric substance on biotic or abiotic surfaces. Bacterial biofilm formed on medical devices such as central venous catheters, urinary catheters, prosthetic joints, cardiovascular implantable devices, dental implants, contact lenses, intrauterine contraceptive devices and breast implants cause persistent infections. Such biofilm-associated infections in medical implants cause serious problems for public health and affect the function of medical implants. So, there is an urgent need for the use of an antimicrobial agent that will inhibit biofilm, including such antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains as bacteria, to develop multiple drug-resistances resulting in failure of the antibiotic's action. The antimicrobial agent used should be ideal in terms of biocompatibility, antimicrobial activity, stability at different environmental conditions, with less sensitivity to the development of resistance towards micro-organisms, safe for in vivo and in vitro use, and remain non-hazardous to the environment, etc. The first objective of the review discusses the insights into the formation of biofilm on a medical device with the current strategies to inhibit. The second purpose is to review the recent progress in ZnO- based nanostructure including composites for antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities.

An immune-mediated pathogenesis is suspected though not yet proven. We have recently reported on the clinical and histologic features, and identification of select leukocyte cell populations within the lesion. A clinical and histologic similarity to oral lichen planus of people was proposed. In the present study, these initial observations are extended by examining lesions from 24 dogs with clinical evidence of chronic ulcerative stomatitis. Because dogs with chronic ulcerative stomatitis often have concurrent periodontal disease, we wondered if dental plaque/biofilm may be a common instigator of inflammation in both lesions. We hypothesized that dogs with chronic ulcerative stomatitis would exhibit a spectrum of pathologic changes and phenotype of infiltrating leukocytes that would inform lesion pathogenesis and that these changes would differ from inflammatory phenotypes in periodontitis. Previously we identified chronic ulcerative stomatitis lesions to be rich in FoxP3+ and IL17+ cells. As such, we suspect that these leukocytes play an important role in lesion pathogenesis. The current study confirms the presence of moderate to large numbers of FoxP3+ T cells and IL17+ cells in all ulcerative stomatitis lesions using confocal immunofluorescence. Interestingly, the majority of IL17+ cells were determined to be non-T cells and IL17+ cell frequencies were negatively correlated with severity on the clinical scoring system. Three histologic subtypes of ulcerative stomatitis were determined; lichenoid, deep stomatitis and granulomatous. Periodontitis lesions, like stomatitis lesions, were B cell and plasma cell rich, but otherwise differed from the stomatitis lesions. Direct immunofluorescence results did not support an autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disease process.

Despite intense practical and theoretical interest, it is unclear how strong fluid flow alters the local and global architectures of biofilms. Here, we combine highly time-resolved single-cell live imaging with 3D multiscale modeling to investigate the mechanisms by which flow affects the dynamics of all individual cells in growing biofilms. Our experiments and cell-based simulations reveal three quantitatively different growth phases in strong external flow and the transitions between them. In the initial stages of biofilm development, flow induces a downstream gradient in cell orientation, causing asymmetrical dropletlike biofilm shapes. In the later developmental stages, when the majority of cells are sheltered from the flow by the surrounding extracellular matrix, buckling-induced cell verticalization in the biofilm core restores radially symmetric biofilm growth, in agreement with predictions of a 3D continuum model.","authors":[{"name":"Philip Pearce"},{"name":"Boya Song"},{"name":"Dominic J Skinner"},{"name":"Rachel Mok"},{"name":"Raimo Hartmann"},{"name":"Praveen K Singh"},{"name":"Hannah Jeckel"},{"name":"Jeffrey S Oishi"},{"name":"Knut Drescher"},{"name":"Jörn Dunkel"}],"keywords":[]},"article9":{"pmid":"31922722","title":"Antibacterial Liquid Metals: Biofilm Treatment via Magnetic Activation.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Antibiotic resistance has made the treatment of biofilm-related infections challenging.

Once exposed to a low-intensity rotating magnetic field, the LM droplets become physically actuated and transform their shape, developing sharp edges.

Synovial fluid was infected, and biofilm aggregates allowed to form over a 2-hour period. PRP was collected and processed into different formulations by platelet concentration, leukocyte presence, and activation or lysis. Infected synovial fluid was treated with different PRP formulations with or without aminoglycoside cotreatment. Bacterial load (colony-forming unit/mL) was determined by serial dilutions and plate counting at 8 hours posttreatment. All PRP formulations displayed antimicrobial properties; however, formulations containing higher concentrations of platelets without leukocytes had increased antimicrobial activity. Lysis of PRP and pooling of the PRP lysate (PRP-L) from multiple horses as compared to individual horses further increased antimicrobial activity. This activity was lost with the removal of the plasma component or inhibition of the proteolytic activity within the plasma. Fractionation of pooled PRP-L identified the bioactive components to be cationic and low-molecular weight (<10 kDa). Overall, PRP-L exhibited synergism with amikacin against aminoglycoside tolerant biofilm aggregates with greater activity against gram-positive bacteria.

These infections most often take the form of three-dimensional biofilm communities, which are notoriously recalcitrant to antibiotics and immune clearance, contributing to the chronic wound state. In the chronic wound microenvironment, microbial biofilms interact closely with other key components, including host cellular and matrix elements, immune cells, inflammatory factors, signaling components, and mechanical cues. Intricate relationships between these contributing factors not only orchestrate the development and progression of wound infections but also influence the therapeutic outcome. Current medical treatment for chronic wound infections relies heavily on long-term usage of antibiotics; however, their efficacy and reasons for failure remain uncertain. To develop effective therapeutic approaches, it is essential to better understand the complex pathophysiology of the chronic wound infection microenvironment, including dynamic interactions between various key factors. For this, it is critical to develop bioengineered platforms or model systems that not only include key components of the chronic wound infection microenvironment but also recapitulate interactions between these factors, thereby simulating the infection state. In doing so, these platforms will enable the testing of novel therapeutics, alone and in combinations, providing insights toward composite treatment strategies. In the first section of this review, we discuss the key components and interactions in the chronic wound infection microenvironment, which would be critical to recapitulate in a bioengineered platform. In the next section, we summarize the key features and relevance of current bioengineered chronic wound infection platforms. These are categorized and discussed based on the microenvironmental components included and their ability to recapitulate the architecture, interactions, and outcomes of the infection microenvironment. While these platforms have advanced our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of chronic wound infections and provided insights into therapeutics, they possess certain insufficiencies that limit their clinical relevance. In the final section, we propose approaches that can be incorporated into these existing model systems or developed into future platforms developed, thus enhancing their biomimetic and translational capabilities, and thereby their human-relevance.","authors":[{"name":"Snehal Kadam"},{"name":"Shivani Nadkarni"},{"name":"Janhavi Lele"},{"name":"Savani Sakhalkar"},{"name":"Pratiksha Mokashi"},{"name":"Karishma Surendra Kaushik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioengineered platforms"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chronic wounds"},{"word":"ex vivo"},{"word":"in vitro"},{"word":"wound infection"},{"word":"wound models"}]},"article15":{"pmid":"31921811","title":"Nanomedicine Approaches for the Pulmonary Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease affecting today nearly 70,000 patients worldwide and characterized by a hypersecretion of thick mucus difficult to clear arising from the defective CFTR protein.

P. gingivalis and T. denticola are co-localized in subgingival plaque and have been previously shown to exhibit strong synergy in growth, biofilm formation and virulence in an animal model of disease. The motility of T. denticola, although not considered as a classic virulence factor, may be involved in synergistic biofilm development between P. gingivalis and T. denticola. We determined the role of T. denticola motility in polymicrobial biofilm development using an optimized transformation protocol to produce two T. denticola mutants targeting the motility machinery. These deletion mutants were non-motile and lacked the gene encoding the flagellar hook protein of the periplasmic flagella (ΔflgE) or a component of the stator motor that drives the flagella (ΔmotB). The specificity of these gene deletions was determined by whole genome sequencing. Quantitative proteomic analyses of mutant strains revealed that the specific inactivation of the motility-associated gene, motB, had effects beyond motility. There were 64 and 326 proteins that changed in abundance in the ΔflgE and ΔmotB mutants, respectively. In the ΔflgE mutant, motility-associated proteins showed the most significant change in abundance confirming the phenotype change for the mutant was related to motility. However, the inactivation of motB as well as stopping motility also upregulated cellular stress responses in the mutant indicating pleiotropic effects of the mutation. T. denticola wild-type and P. gingivalis displayed synergistic biofilm development with a 2-fold higher biomass of the dual-species biofilms than the sum of the monospecies biofilms.

In this study the plasma deposition process for direct deposition of pharmaceutical drugs on to a range of surfaces and the retention of structure function relationship and antimicrobial efficacy against mono-species biofilms were investigated. Two selected sample antibiotics-ampicillin and gentamicin, were deposited onto two types of surfaces-polystyrene microtiter plates and stainless steel coupons. The antimicrobial efficacy of the antibiotic-coated surfaces was tested against challenge populations of both planktonic and sessile Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with responses monitored for up to 14 days. The plasma deposition process bonded the antibiotic to the surfaces, with localized retention of antibiotic activity. The antibiotics deposited on the test surfaces retained a good efficacy against planktonic cells, and importantly prevented biofilm formation of attached cells for up to 96 h. The antibiotic rapidly eluted from the surface of antibiotic-coated surfaces to the surrounding medium, with retention of effect in this surrounding milieu for up to 2 weeks. Control experiments established that there was no independent antimicrobial or growth promoting effect of the plasma deposition process, where there was no antibiotic in the helium plasma assisted delivery stream. Apart from the flexibility offered through deposition on material surfaces, there was no additive or destructive effect associated with the helium assisted plasma deposition process on the antibiotic. The plasma assisted process was a viable mean of coating clinically relevant materials and developing innovative functional materials with retention of antibiotic activity, without employing a linker or plasma modified polymer, thus minimizing bio-compatibility issues for medical device materials.

In this review, we summarize the recent progresses on the experimental and human disease-associated multi-species biofilm studies. We hypothesize that engineering biofilm structures and interspecies interactions might provide a tool for manipulating the composition and function of human microbiota.","authors":[{"name":"Fang Bai"},{"name":"Zhao Cai"},{"name":"Liang Yang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chronic infections"},{"word":"Microbiota"},{"word":"Multi-species biofilm"}]},"article20":{"pmid":"31921369","title":"Pigmentosins from Gibellula sp. as antibiofilm agents and a new glycosylated asperfuran from Cordyceps javanica.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"In the course of our exploration of the Thai invertebrate-pathogenic fungi for biologically active metabolites, pigmentosin A (","authors":[{"name":"Soleiman E Helaly"},{"name":"Wilawan Kuephadungphan"},{"name":"Patima Phainuphong"},{"name":"Mahmoud A A Ibrahim"},{"name":"Kanoksri Tasanathai"},{"name":"Suchada Mongkolsamrit"},{"name":"Janet Jennifer Luangsa-Ard"},{"name":"Souwalak Phongpaichit"},{"name":"Vatcharin Rukachaisirikul"},{"name":"Marc Stadler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm agents"},{"word":"natural products"},{"word":"spider-parasitic fungi"}]},"article21":{"pmid":"31921091","title":"Anti-listeria Activities of Linalool and Its Mechanism Revealed by Comparative Transcriptome Analysis.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"Listeria monocytogenes, which causes serious foodborne infections and public health problems worldwide, is one of the most important foodborne pathogens.

Candida albicans is one of the leading opportunistic fungal pathogens. However, due to the increased use of antifungal agents, resistance of C. albicans to conventional agents, especially fluconazole, has frequently emerged. Therefore, research on the use of combinations of current drugs to sensitize antifungal agents and overcome fungal resistance has attracted considerable attention. This study demonstrated for the first time that D-penicillamine (PCA) combined with fluconazole showed a synergistic effect against C. albicans. PCA combined with fluconazole not only showed synergistic effects against planktonic cells of C. albicans, but also showed synergistic effects against C. albicans biofilms formed within 12 h in vitro. In addition, a Galleria mellonella infection model was used to evaluate the in vivo effects of this drug combination. The results showed that the combination of the two drugs could improve the survival rate, decrease the fungal burden, and reduce the tissue invasion of G. mellonella larvae. Finally, we explored the potential synergistic mechanisms of the drug combination, mainly including inhibition of the morphological transformation, reduction of the intracellular calcium concentration, and the activation of metacaspase, which is closely related to cell apoptosis.

Further, to ascertain if sub-lethal environmental stress conditions could influence L. monocytogenes survival and growth responses, atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) resistance was evaluated for the cultures exposed to cold (4°C) or acid (pH 4) stress for 1 h. The results demonstrate that both wild-type and knockout mutants were similarly affected after 1 min exposure to ACP (p > 0.05), with a difference in response noted only after 3 min of treatment. While all L. monocytogenes strains exposed to acid/cold stress were hypersensitive to ACP treatment and were significantly reduced or inactivated within 1 min of treatment (p < 0.05). The results indicate sigB and prfA are important for general stress resistance and biofilm, respectively, loss of these two genes significantly reduced bacterial resistance to ACP treatment. In addition, exposure to sub-lethal 1min ACP increased the gene expression of stress associated genes. SigB showed the highest gene expression, increasing by 15.60 fold, followed by gadD2 (7.19) and lmo0799 (8.6) after 1 min exposure. Overall, an increase in gene expression was seen in all stress associated genes analyzed both at 1 min treatment; while long treatment time reduced the gene expression and some cases down-regulated prfA and gadD3 gene expression. By comparing the response of mutants under ACP exposure to key processing parameters, the experimental results presented here provide a baseline for understanding the bacterial genetic response and resistance to cold plasma stress and offers promising insights for optimizing ACP applications.","authors":[{"name":"Apurva Patange"},{"name":"Conor O'Byrne"},{"name":"Daniela Boehm"},{"name":"P J Cullen"},{"name":"Kevin Keener"},{"name":"Paula Bourke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"atmospheric cold plasma"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gene expression"},{"word":"stress genes"},{"word":"sub-lethal stress"}]},"article27":{"pmid":"31921010","title":"Explication of the Potential of 2-Hydroxy-4-Methoxybenzaldehyde in Hampering Uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis Crystalline Biofilm and Virulence.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"Proteus mirabilis is an important etiological agent of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) owing to its efficient crystalline biofilm formation and virulence enzyme production.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether baicalin can inhibit S. saprophyticus biofilm formation and the quorum-sensing system by inhibiting the MsrA efflux pump. First, the mechanism of baicalin inhibiting efflux was investigated by the ethidium bromide (EtBr) efflux assay, measurement of ATP content, and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities. These results revealed that baicalin significantly reduced the efflux of EtBr, the ATP content, and the activity of PK. Moreover, its role in biofilm formation and the agr system was studied by crystal violet staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. These results showed that baicalin decreased biofilm formation, inhibited bacterial aggregation, and downregulated mRNA transcription levels of the quorum-sensing system regulators agrA, agrC, RNAIII, and sarA. Correlation analysis indicated that there was a strong positive correlation between the efflux pump and biofilm formation and the agr system.

Various in vitro and in vivo studies have established their antimicrobial spectrum against clinically significant Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic pathogens. The potent activity of levonadifloxacin against MRSA, quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and hetero-vancomycin-intermediate strains is an outcome of its well-differentiated mechanism of action involving preferential targeting to DNA gyrase. Potent anti-staphylococcal activity of levonadifloxacin was also observed in clinically relevant experimental conditions such as acidic pH, the intracellular environment, and biofilms, suggesting that the drug is bestowed with enabling features for the treatment of difficult-to-treat MRSA infections. Levonadifloxacin also retains clinically relevant activity against resistant respiratory pathogens such as macrolide- and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis and, in conjunction with clinically established best-in-class human epithelial lung fluid concentration, has promising potential in the management of recalcitrant respiratory infections. Attractive features, such as resistance to NorA efflux, divergent mechanism of action in S. aureus, cidality against high-inoculum cultures, and low mutant prevention concentration, are likely to confer favorable resistance-suppression features to both agents. In vivo studies have shown promising efficacy in models of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection, respiratory infections, pyelonephritis, and peritonitis at human-equivalent mouse doses. Both formulations were well tolerated in multiple phase I studies and overall showed a dose-dependent exposure. In particular, oral alalevonadifloxacin showed excellent bioavailability (~90%), almost mirroring the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous levonadifloxacin, indicating the prodrug's seamless absorption and efficient cleavage to release the active parent drug. Hepatic impairment studies showed that clinical doses of levonadifloxacin/alalevonadifloxacin are not required to be adjusted for various degrees of hepatic impairment. With the successful completion of phase II and phase III studies for both levonadifloxacin and alalevonadifloxacin, they represent clinically attractive therapeutic options for the treatment of infections caused by multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms.

Intensive efforts have been directed toward the development of novel technologies that can prevent bacterial colonization while requiring minimal antibiotics doses. To this end, biocompatible materials with intrinsic antifouling capabilities are in high demand. Silk fibroin, widely employed in biotechnology, represents an interesting candidate. Here, we employ a soft-lithography approach to realize micro- and nanostructured silk fibroin substrates, with different geometries. We show that patterned silk film substrates support mammal cells (HEK-293) adhesion and proliferation, and at the same time, they intrinsically display remarkable antifouling properties. We employ Escherichia coli as representative Gram-negative bacteria, and we observe an up to 66% decrease in the number of bacteria that adhere to patterned silk surfaces as compared to control, flat silk samples. The mechanism leading to the inhibition of biofilm formation critically depends on the microstructure geometry, involving both a steric and a hydrophobic effect. We also couple silk fibroin patterned films to a biocompatible, optically responsive organic semiconductor, and we verify that the antifouling properties are very well preserved.

To examine this, composites of graphite nanoplatelets (GNP) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) are extruded in controlled conditions to obtain controlled orientation of GNP flakes within the polymer matrix.

GNP nanoflakes on the extruded samples interact with bacterial cell membranes, physically damaging the cells. Bactericidal activity is observed dependent on orientation and nanoflakes density. Composites with high density of GNP (≥15%) present two key advantages: i) they decrease bacterial viability by a factor of 99.9999%, which is 10 000-fold improvement on the current benchmark, and ii) prevent bacterial colonization, thus drastically reducing the numbers of dead cells on the surface.

Chemical cleaning is only partially effective in removing biofilm components from the membrane surface. In order to identify opportunities to improve the efficiency of commercial cleaning solutions used in nanofiltration, we compared the in vitro efficacy of different commercial treatments, with or without the addition of polysaccharidases, to clean fouled membrane samples. The treatments were tested at two stages of biofilm development corresponding to 80 (D80) and 475 (D475) days of filtration in an industrial plant. The cleaning efficiency was evaluated by comparing the ATR-FTIR spectra before and after cleaning. At D80 and D475, all cleaning solutions led to a reduction of infrared signals from the biofilm. At D80, enzymatic alkaline detergent (AEDT) treatment was significantly more effective than alkaline detergent (ADT) treatment in removing proteins, but no significant difference in efficacy between the two treatments was observed for polysaccharides. The addition of polysaccharidases to AEDT did not bring any significant efficiency gain. At D475, ADT and AEDT treatments had the same efficacy, but the addition of polysaccharidases to the AEDT treatment significantly increased the removal of polysaccharides and proteins from the membrane surface. In conclusion, polysaccharidases can increase the in vitro efficacy of a commercially available alkaline enzymatic detergent cleaning solution against sufficiently developed biofilms. These results pave the way for the development of new cleaning solutions containing polysaccharide degrading enzymes for the cleaning of membranes used in the production of drinking water. Further experiments are needed to characterize the mechanism of this polysaccharidase effect and to confirm this increase in cleaning efficiency in an industrial context.","authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Houari"},{"name":"Patrick Di Martino"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofouling"},{"word":"cleaning"},{"word":"enzyme"},{"word":"nanofiltration"},{"word":"polysaccharidase"}]},"article47":{"pmid":"31915746","title":"Bacteriophages-a new hope or a huge problem in the food industry.","date":"2020-01-12","abs":"Bacteriophages are viruses that are ubiquitous in nature and infect only bacterial cells.

Periodontal diseases & dental caries are the most prevalent conditions in which biofilm has established as a primary causative factor. Managing poly-microbial biofilm is the mainstay of periodontal therapy. Plethora of antimicrobials have been used till date to combat biofilm, but the emergence of antibiotic tolerance and resistance in biofilms is a major cause of concern. Apart from use of antimicrobials, various anti-biofilm strategies have evolved which include the use of mechanical, and chemical means to disrupt biofilms. However, none of these approaches have led to desired or optimal biofilm control and hence search for novel approach continues. Shockwaves are used in medical practice for various therapeutic purposes and in local drug delivery, gene therapy, wound healing & regeneration. With this background, a study was designed with an attempt to explore the possibility of using the shockwave for their effect on multispecies oral biofilm development from subgingival plaque samples obtained from chronic periodontitis patients. Plaque samples from 25 patients were used to derive multispecies biofilm which were used to check the efficacy of shockwaves and antibacterial efficacy of four clinically relevant antimicrobials. Biofilms were analyzed by scanning electron microscope; atomic force microscope and their biomass was quantitated by crystal violet staining. Further, a humanized rat model of periodontitis was developed. Patient derived plaque was used to establish periodontitis in healthy rats. The model was validated by performing colony forming unit (CFU) analysis of the infected tissue. The animals were subjected to low intensity shockwaves using a hand-held shockwave generator at the site of infection. Shockwave treatment was done with or without antimicrobial application. The animals were monitored for clearance of infection and for mortality. The results show that shockwave treatment in combination with antimicrobials is significantly effective in clearing a multispecies biofilm. This also brings out the possibility of application of shockwaves in the management of oral biofilms either alone or in combination with established antimicrobial agents. With further research, safety profile validation and clinical trials, shockwaves can be an effective, novel approach in management of biofilm associated periodontal disease.","authors":[{"name":"Akshay Datey"},{"name":"C S Adeeb Thaha"},{"name":"Sudhir R Patil"},{"name":"Jagadeesh Gopalan"},{"name":"Dipshikha Chakravortty"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"humanized rat model"},{"word":"patient sample"},{"word":"periodontitis"},{"word":"shock waves"}]},"article59":{"pmid":"31911489","title":"Computational and Experimental Investigation of Biofilm Disruption Dynamics Induced by High-Velocity Gas Jet Impingement.","date":"2020-03-16","abs":"Experimental data showed that high-speed microsprays can effectively disrupt biofilms on their support substratum, producing a variety of dynamic reactions such as elongation, displacement, ripple formation, and fluidization. However, the mechanics underlying the impact of high-speed turbulent flows on biofilm structure is complex under such extreme conditions, since direct measurements of viscosity at these high shear rates are not possible using dynamic testing instruments. Here, we used computational fluid dynamics simulations to assess the complex fluid interactions of ripple patterning produced by high-speed turbulent air jets impacting perpendicular to the surface of Streptococcus mutans biofilms, a dental pathogen causing caries, captured by high-speed imaging. The numerical model involved a two-phase flow of air over a non-Newtonian biofilm, whose viscosity as a function of shear rate was estimated using the Herschel-Bulkley model. The simulation suggested that inertial, shear, and interfacial tension forces governed biofilm disruption by the air jet. Additionally, the high shear rates generated by the jet impacts coupled with shear-thinning biofilm property resulted in rapid liquefaction (within milliseconds) of the biofilm, followed by surface instability and traveling waves from the impact site. Our findings suggest that rapid shear thinning under very high shear flows causes the biofilm to behave like a fluid and elasticity can be neglected. A parametric sensitivity study confirmed that both applied force intensity (i.e., high jet nozzle air velocity) and biofilm properties (i.e., low viscosity and low air-biofilm surface tension and thickness) intensify biofilm disruption by generating large interfacial instabilities.","authors":[{"name":"Lledó Prades"},{"name":"Stefania Fabbri"},{"name":"Antonio D Dorado"},{"name":"Xavier Gamisans"},{"name":"Paul Stoodley"},{"name":"Cristian Picioreanu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"computational fluid dynamics"},{"word":"disruption"},{"word":"high-velocity air jets"},{"word":"non-Newtonian fluid flow"},{"word":"ripples"},{"word":"turbulence"}]},"article60":{"pmid":"31911464","title":"Comparative Transcriptomic and Functional Assessments of Linezolid-Responsive Small RNA Genes in Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus contains a repertoire of at least 50 and possibly 500 small RNAs (sRNAs).

These data suggest sRNA functional redundancy, because despite their high expression levels upon antibiotic exposure, individual sRNA genes do not affect readily observable bacterial phenotypes.

Compared to nonadapted strains, these strains became adapted to up to 180-fold higher concentrations of DDAC, as seen by their increased minimal inhibitory concentrations. Examination of the stability of adaptation showed that three strains became permanently adapted to DDAC and named as resistant strains, and four strains were temporarily adapted to DDAC and named as strains with higher tolerance to DDAC. Some adapted strains showed cross-resistance to benzalkonium chloride and/or antibiotics. The adaptation response mechanisms of these DDAC-adapted strains were also investigated. The majority of adapted strains showed modifications to cell size and fatty acid composition. Some of the adapted strains showed changes in biofilm formation and overexpression of efflux pumps. Three adapted strains also showed altered growth rates. In this first report of adaptation of S. epidermidis strains to DDAC, the fatty acid profiling showed that the majority of strains had reduced ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids and decreased content of straight-chain fatty acids, at the expense of the anteiso-branched fatty acids.

The surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and water contact angle measurements. To evaluate the hemocompatibility of the surfaces, fibrinogen adsorption, Factor XII activation, and platelet adhesion and activation were analyzed. The antibacterial activity was investigated against Gram-negative P. aeruginosa and Gram-positive S. aureus. Bacterial adhesion and morphology, as well as biofilm formation, were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and SEM. The anti-thrombogenic properties of the surfaces were demonstrated by significant decreases in fibrinogen adsorption, Factor XII activation, and platelet adhesion and activation. Modifying NT with tanfloc/heparin also reduces the adhesion and proliferation of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus bacteria after 24 hr of incubation, with no biofilm formation.

Its frequency is estimated to be 0.5-4% of the general population, affecting women more often. Pathogenesis of HS is still not clearly defined. It seems to be a combination of genetic factors with alterations in the skin microbiome. Furthermore, at tissue (i.e. skin) as well as at serum level, several inflammatory cytokines are upregulated. The most important of the latter are tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-17, and IL-23. Adding another level of complexity, it has been suggested that keratinocytes might be intrinsically activated, contributing also to the observed inflammation. Interestingly, it has been noted that frequency of HS is increased in some autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as spondyloarthropathies (SpA). Of note, both HS and SpA have relatively strong association with metabolic diseases and obesity implying that there are indeed some common underlying pathophysiological pathways. Although no specific microbe has been identified, alterations in the microbiome of the skin of these patients have been reported.

We explore the different behavior of the studied species toward oxygen and examine how this behavior is associated with the targeted infection sites. As a model, we characterize the adaptation profile of the ribonucleotide reductase network, a complex oxygen-dependent enzymatic system responsible for the generation of the deoxyribonucleotides. We also explore the actions of the most important anaerobic regulators and how these regulators influence bacterial fitness.

The application of algal-bacterial consortia to treat wastewater has recently attracted considerable attention because mechanical aeration is unnecessary. Therefore, algal-bacterial bioreactors are emerging as alternatives to activated sludge-based bioprocesses. Most studies have used a plate substratum to support the growth of algal-bacterial biofilms, which results in low reactor efficiencies. Usually, 2-10 days are required for targeted pollutant removal effects. Substratum structures can significantly influence reactor efficiencies. Indeed, substratum-free biofilms (granules) generally achieve high reactor efficiencies that rapidly form. 7-12 h are sufficient for a high-level pollutant removal efficiency. However, granule stability must be validated during long-term experiments (>1 year) involving real wastewater. In addition, the application of algal-bacterial membrane bioreactors represents a novel treatment approach. In membrane bioreactors, good reactor efficiencies and stabilities can be achieved. However, the maximum capacity of algal-bacterial membrane bioreactors requires further investigation. In addition, an accurate model for pollutant removal kinetics in algal-bacterial reactors is not yet available but is necessary for reactor control and up-scaling. The microbial and physical structures of algal-bacterial biofilms require more studies to clarify the system.

In this work, 85 S. maltophilia strains isolated in several hospital of central Italy and from several clinical settings were evaluated for their genetic relatedness (by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, PFGE), biofilm formation (by microtiter plate assay), and planktonic antibiotic resistance (by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique). The S. maltophilia population showed a high genetic heterogeneity: 64 different PFGE types were identified, equally distributed in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF strains, and some consisted of multiple strains. Most of the strains (88.2%) were able to form biofilm, although non-CF strains were significantly more efficient than CF strains. CF strains produced lower biofilm amounts than non-CF strains, both those from respiratory tracts and blood. Non-CF PFGE types 3 and 27 consisted of strong-producers only. Cotrimoxazole and levofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics, being active respectively against 81.2% and 72.9% of strains. CF strains were significantly more resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam compared to non-CF strains (90% versus 53.3%), regardless of sample type. Among respiratory strains, cotrimoxazole was more active against non-CF than CF strains (susceptibility rates: 86.7% versus 75%). The multidrug resistant phenotype was significantly more prevalent in CF than non-CF strains (90% versus 66.7%). Overall, the multidrug-resistance level was negatively associated with efficiency in biofilm formation. Our results showed, for the first time, that in S. maltophilia both classical planktonic drug resistance and the ability of biofilm formation might favor its dissemination in the hospital setting. Biofilm formation might in fact act as a survival mechanism for susceptible bacteria, suggesting that clinical isolates should be routinely assayed for biofilm formation in diagnostic laboratories.","authors":[{"name":"Arianna Pompilio"},{"name":"Vincenzo Savini"},{"name":"Ersilia Fiscarelli"},{"name":"Giovanni Gherardi"},{"name":"Giovanni Di Bonaventura"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm formation"}]},"article81":{"pmid":"31906451","title":"Deciphering the Symbiotic Significance of Quorum Sensing Systems of Sinorhizobium fredii HH103.","date":"2020-03-11","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial cell-to-cell signaling mechanism that collectively regulates and synchronizes behaviors by means of small diffusible chemical molecules.

In the model bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti functions regulated by the QS systems TraI-TraR and SinI-SinR(-ExpR) include plasmid transfer, production of surface polysaccharides, motility, growth rate and nodulation. These systems are also present in other bacteria of the Sinorhizobium genus, with variations at the species and strain level. In Sinorhizobium fredii NGR234 phenotypes regulated by QS are plasmid transfer, growth rate, sedimentation, motility, biofilm formation, EPS production and copy number of the symbiotic plasmid (pSym). The analysis of the S. fredii HH103 genomes reveal also the presence of both QS systems. In this manuscript we characterized the QS systems of S. fredii HH103, determining that both TraI and SinI AHL-synthases proteins are responsible of the production of short- and long-chain AHLs, respectively, at very low and not physiological concentrations. Interestingly, the main HH103 luxR-type genes, expR and traR, are split into two ORFs, suggesting that in S. fredii HH103 the corresponding carboxy-terminal proteins, which contain the DNA-binding motives, may control target genes in an AHL-independent manner.

By modeling the surface morphology of colony-type biofilms using confocal and multiphoton microscopy, we analyzed the appearance of distinctive folds or wrinkles that form as a result of lysogeny broth content reduction in the solid agar growth media. When subjected to varying nutritional conditions, the channel-like folds were shown to alter their morphology; growth on nutrient-depleted media was found to trigger the formation of large and straight wrinkles connecting the colony core to its periphery.

We used 630 nm laser diode as an excitation source to enhance the penetration depth and diminish unwanted light scattering, additionally the experiments were performed in planktonic and biofilm cultures to differentiate the results obtained for cells showing various phenotypic characteristics. Based on performed experiments it became obvious that the incubation of C. albicans fungal cells with 5-ALA in the presence of glucose caused a significant increase in concentration of intracellular PpIX, resulting in a higher efficacy of photo-toxic effect. The observed results were rationalized by the role of glucose as an energy source, which supported the active transport of 5-ALA into cells. In contrary to glucose, the presence of human serum caused a significant reduction in PpIX concentration in C. albicans cells with exogenous delivery of 5-ALA, resulting in a less efficient photo-fungicidal effect.

Docking analysis revealed that the compound 10252273, bound to the specific allosteric site, interacted with Glu118, unique amino acid residue of the active binding pocket, hence indicates the presence of a competitive allosteric site. The current study thus identifies and characterizes inhibitors by targeting the normal binding site and also reports the presence of the competo-allosteric site in the same binding tunnel as the normal site. Molecular docking studies proposed two chemical compounds that share a benzamide-benzimidazole (BB) backbone as potent inhibitors that can obstruct the mechanism of DSPI by targeting both the normal and proposed allosteric binding sites.

Pre-clinical (animal) studies are indispensable for this development. Often, animal infection outcomes bear little relation to human clinical outcome. Here, we review conclusions from pathogen-inoculum dose-finding pilot studies for evaluation of novel infection-control strategies in murine models. Pathogen-inoculum doses are generally preferred that produce the largest differences in quantitative infection outcome parameters between a control and an experimental group, without death or termination of animals due to having reached an inhumane end-point during the study. However, animal death may represent a better end-point for evaluation than large differences in outcome parameters or number of days over which infection persists. The clinical relevance of lower pre-clinical outcomes, such as bioluminescence, colony forming units (CFUs) retrieved or more rapid clearance of infection is unknown, as most animals cure infection without intervention, depending on pathogen-species and pathogen-inoculum dose administered. In human clinical practice, patients suffering from infection present to hospital emergency wards, frequently in life-threatening conditions.

To compensate for increased animal morbidity and mortality, animal experiments should solely be conducted for pre-clinical proof of principle and safety.

The effects of estrogen on virulence factors that enhance P. aeruginosa persistence in CF lung epithelium were investigated by phenotypic and chemical assays in various PsA clinical isolates and laboratory strains in isolation or in co-culture with normal (Nuli-1) and CF dPhe508-CFTR (CuFi-1) human bronchial epithelial cell lines. Estrogen (E2, 10 nM) significantly increased secretion of the virulence factor pyocyanin by 80% in PsA early infection isolates from female CF patients and by 280% in late infection PsA isolates. Estrogen also increased the swarming motility by up to 50% in all PsA isolates and strains tested in 0.5% agar. A significant increase of 110% in the twitching motility of all PsA isolates and strains tested was also observed with estrogen treatment. Treatment with E2 increased biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PsAO1 which became more adherent to, and invasive into, normal and CF bronchial epithelial cells. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), Tamoxifen and ICI 182780 inhibited P. aeruginosa motility. The potency of various steroid hormones to stimulate motility of P. aeruginosa was in the order; estradiol ≫ estrone > E3 estriol ≥ testosterone ≥ progesterone ≫ aldosterone, cortisol. Estrogen was also shown to reduce ciliary beat intensity in CF bronchial epithelium which would further exacerbate PsA trapping and virulence in the CF airways. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that estrogen exacerbates P. aeruginosa virulence factors and enhances bacterial interactions with CF bronchial epithelium which can be inhibited by tamoxifen. Our work suggests that SERMs could be used as an adjuvant treatment to reduce estrogen-induced P. aeruginosa infections and associated lung exacerbations in females with CF.","authors":[{"name":"Jean Tyrrell"},{"name":"Brian J Harvey"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CF gender gap"},{"word":"Cystic Fibrosis microbiology"},{"word":"Estrogen"},{"word":"PsA virulence"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Sexual dimorphism in CF"}]},"article105":{"pmid":"31901291","title":"Panel 1: Biotechnology, biomedical engineering and new models of otitis media.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"To summarize recently published key articles on the topics of biomedical engineering, biotechnology and new models in relation to otitis media (OM).","authors":[{"name":"Marie Gisselsson-Solén"},{"name":"Paula A Tähtinen"},{"name":"Allen F Ryan"},{"name":"Apoorva Mulay"},{"name":"Shin Kariya"},{"name":"Anne G M Schilder"},{"name":"Tulio A Valdez"},{"name":"Steve Brown"},{"name":"Ryan M Nolan"},{"name":"Ann Hermansson"},{"name":"Gijs van Ingen"},{"name":"Tal Marom"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Animal model"},{"word":"Diagnostics"},{"word":"Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"Moraxella catarrhalis"},{"word":"Otitis media"},{"word":"Streptococcus pneumoniae"},{"word":"Treatment"},{"word":"Vaccines"}]},"article106":{"pmid":"31901280","title":"Microbial profile in different orthodontic appliances by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization: An in-vivo study.","date":"2020-01-28","abs":"The design of the orthodontic bracket or appliance is 1 of the most important factors for creating retentive areas for biofilm formation.

However, study of Se contamination has focused on lentic and larger order lotic systems, whereas headwater streams have received little scrutiny. In central Appalachia, surface coal mining is a common Se source to headwater streams, thus providing a useful system to investigate Se bioaccumulation in headwater food chains and possible longitudinal patterns in Se concentrations. Toward that end, we assessed Se bioaccumulation in 2 reference and 4 mining-influenced headwater streams. At each stream, we sampled ecosystem media, including streamwater, particulate matter (sediment, biofilm, leaf detritus), benthic macroinvertebrates, salamanders, and fish, every 400 m along 1.2- and 1.6-km reaches. We compared media Se concentrations within and among streams and evaluated longitudinal trends in media Se concentrations. Selenium concentrations in sampled media were higher in mining-influenced streams compared with reference streams. We found the highest Se concentrations in benthic macroinvertebrates; however, salamanders and fish bioaccumulated Se to potentially harmful levels in mining-influenced streams. Only one stream demonstrated dilution of streamwater Se with distance downstream, and few longitudinal patterns in Se bioaccumulation occurred along our study reaches. Collectively, our results provide a field-based assessment of Se bioaccumulation in headwater food chains, from streamwater to fish, and highlight the need for future assessments of Se effects in headwater streams and receiving downstream waters.

The success of the method encouraged other municipalities to apply this method for monitoring indirect discharges into sewerage systems. Municipality of Konya, Turkey, started to use the method in 2013. Continuous monitoring has been performed for the determination of regulated heavy metals: chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd). Unauthorized discharges of Cr, Zn and Ni were identified in Konya by performing sewerage slime tests through biofilm analyses. 2686 mg/kg d.m. Cr, 3949 mg/kg d.m. Zn and 3300 mg/kg d.m. Ni were highest values determined for biofilm samples taken from monitoring sites. In this paper, the principles of the method will be introduced, and findings from the wastewater of Konya City will be given in comparison with findings from Bielefeld, Germany.

However, local delivery of drug not only addresses these limitations but also provides better efficacy at the site of infection. In the present study, hydrogel preparations were developed for the topical delivery of moxifloxacin for the treatment of S. aureus-infected burn wound. Moxifloxacin was characterized by UV, FTIR, DSC, hot-stage microscopy, NMR, and HPLC and loaded into conventional and Boswellia-containing novel gels. Gels were characterized by visual examination, pH, UV spectroscopy, and release assays. In vivo studies showed that both gels were effective in eradicating the bacteria completely from the wound site when treatment was started during the early stage of infection. On the contrary, delayed treatment of planktonic and biofilm cells with novel gel showed better efficacy as compared with conventional gel in S. aureus-infected burn wound. Histopathological analysis also showed better skin healing efficacy of novel gel than conventional gel. Our results show that moxifloxacin can be efficiently used topically in the management of burn wound infections along with other antibacterial agents.

There are four SODs in Bacillus cereus 0-9, and this coexistence of multiple homologous enzymes is of great significance in the evolution of bacteria. We hypothesized that the four sod genes in B. cereus 0-9 constituted non-redundant protection against oxidative damage in vivo and played unique roles in the pathogenicity of B. cereus 0-9 during different phases or growth environments. To test this hypothesis, we constructed four single-knockout mutants (∆sodA1, ∆sodA2, ∆sodS, and ∆sodC) and a mutant lacking all four sod genes (∆sod-4) of B. cereus 0-9 and assessed their various phenotypes. Our results indicated that sodA1 plays a major role in tolerance to intracellular oxidative stress and spore formation. The ∆sodA1 and ∆sod-4 mutants were very sensitive to oxidants. The spore formation of the ∆sodA1 mutant was dramatically delayed, and the ∆sod-4 mutant did not form any spores under our experimental conditions. The sodA2 gene may play an important role in negative regulation of swarming motility, pathogenicity, and phospholipase and haemolytic activity of B. cereus but also a role in positive regulation of biofilm formation under our experimental conditions. The other two genes, sodS and sodC, were key to the pathogenicity of B. cereus. The lethal rates of Helicoverpa armigera infected by the ∆sodS and ∆sodC mutants were only 26.67%, while wild-type B. cereus 0-9 caused lethality in up to 86.67% of the insects at 24 h after injection. Moreover, the ∆sod-4 mutant caused a reduced death rate of H. armigera of 46.70%, which was slightly higher than that caused by the ∆sodS and ∆sodC strains. Thus, these four sod genes were non-redundant for oxidative stress and may play different additional roles in B. cereus 0-9. These results can help us to further understand the biocontrol characteristics of B. cereus 0-9 and lay a theoretical foundation for further research.","authors":[{"name":"Juanmei Zhang"},{"name":"Haodong Wang"},{"name":"Qiubin Huang"},{"name":"Ying Zhang"},{"name":"Linlin Zhao"},{"name":"Fengying Liu"},{"name":"Gang Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"Oxidative stress"},{"word":"Pathogenicity"},{"word":"Superoxide dismutase"},{"word":"Swarming motility"}]},"article130":{"pmid":"31897706","title":"Effect of high-fluoride dentifrice and bracket bonding composite material on enamel demineralization in situ.","date":"2020-01-03","abs":"This in situ study evaluated the effect of high-fluoride dentifrice (5000 μg F","authors":[{"name":"Robson S Ferreira"},{"name":"Antonio Pedro Ricomini-Filho"},{"name":"Cínthia P Tabchoury"},{"name":"Glauber Campos Vale"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bonding materials"},{"word":"Dentifrices"},{"word":"Enamel demineralization"},{"word":"Orthodontic brackets"}]},"article131":{"pmid":"31897429","title":"A bifunctional ATPase drives tad pilus extension and retraction.","date":"2020-02-06","abs":"A widespread class of prokaryotic motors powered by secretion motor adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) drives the dynamic extension and retraction of extracellular fibers, such as type IV pili (T4P).

Current study was aimed to standardize the M. buxifolia leaves extract and evaluate its antibacterial and anticancer activity. Phytochemical analysis was carried through GC, GC/MS, FTIR, and ICP-OES analytical techniques. Antibacterial assay of the crude extract was performed by using tetrazolium micro plates. The extract treated bacteria were observed under (AFM) atomic force microscope and PCR was used for DNA amplification. The anti-proliferative activity of M. buxifolia leaves extract was examined through MTT cytotoxicity assay. The bacterial strains employed in this study were S. epidermidis ATCC (13518), S. aureus ATCC (25923), P. aeruginosa ATCC (10145), and E. coli ATCC (10536). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) against gram positive bacteria was significantly (p<0.01) achieved at 50 and 75μg/mL. MIC50 against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was also significant at 100μg/mL (p<0.01). M. buxifolia leaves extract damaged the cell walls gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, while biofilm around gram positive bacteria was significantly damaged. The DNA decantation was also inhibited of S. aureus and S. epidermidis, however, no any impact was observed on E. coli and P. aeruginosa DNA decantation. The cytotoxicity findings suggested that the crude extract of M. buxifolia leaves at 1000μg/mL gives significant inhibition 73.96±2.0%, 83.76±1.2%, 77.66±1.2% and 72.67±1.6% against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HeLa and H460 cell lines respectively at (p<0.001).

The increased frequency of pneumonia among elderly subjects can be explained by the physiological changes linked to the progressive aging of the respiratory tree and the diminished immunological response. A spiral of event leads to frailty, infection and possible death; preventing pneumonia consists of controlling the risk factors. Dysphagia, which is associated with malnutrition and dehydration, is recognized as one of the major pathophysiological mechanism leading to pneumonia and its screening is crucial for the pneumonia risk assessment. The impairment in the oropharyngeal reflexes results in stagnation of foreign material in the lateral cavities of the pharynx which may then get aspirated repeatedly in the lungs and cause pneumonia. Pneumonia prevention starts with lifestyle modifications such as alcohol and tobacco cessation. A careful review of the risk-benefit of the prescribed medication is critical and adaptation may be required in elders with multiple morbidities. Respiratory physiotherapy and mobilization improve the functional status and hence may help reduce the risk of pneumonia. Maintaining teeth and masticatory efficiency is important if malnutrition and its consequences are to be avoided. Daily oral hygiene and regular professional removal of oral biofilm can prevent the onset of periodontitis and can avoid an oral environment favoring the colonization of respiratory pathogens than can then be aspirated into the lungs.","authors":[{"name":"Najla Chebib"},{"name":"Clémence Cuvelier"},{"name":"Astrid Malézieux-Picard"},{"name":"Thibault Parent"},{"name":"Xavier Roux"},{"name":"Thomas Fassier"},{"name":"Frauke Müller"},{"name":"Virginie Prendki"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aged over 80"},{"word":"Dysphagia"},{"word":"Nutrition"},{"word":"Oral hygiene"},{"word":"Pneumonia"},{"word":"Prevention"}]},"article148":{"pmid":"31893222","title":"Micrococcal-Nuclease-Triggered On-Demand Release of Vancomycin from Intramedullary Implant Coating Eradicates Staphylococcus aureus Infection in Mouse Femoral Canals.","date":"2020-01-04","abs":"Preventing orthopedic implant-associated bacterial infections remains a critical challenge. Current practices of physically blending high-dose antibiotics with bone cements is known for cytotoxicity while covalently tethering antibiotics to implant surfaces is ineffective in eradicating bacteria from the periprosthetic tissue environment due to the short-range bactericidal actions, which are limited to the implant surface. Here, we covalently functionalize poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate hydrogel coatings with vancomycin via an oligonucleotide linker sensitive to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) micrococcal nuclease (MN) (PEGDMA-Oligo-Vanco). This design enables the timely release of vancomycin in the presence of S. aureus to kill the bacteria both on the implant surface and within the periprosthetic tissue environment. Ti6Al4V intramedullary (IM) pins surface-tethered with dopamine methacrylamide (DopaMA) and uniformly coated with PEGDMA-Oligo-Vanco effectively prevented periprosthetic infections in mouse femoral canals inoculated with bioluminescent S. aureus. Longitudinal bioluminescence monitoring, μCT quantification of femoral bone changes, end point quantification of implant surface bacteria, and histological detection of S. aureus in the periprosthetic tissue environment confirmed rapid and sustained bacterial clearance by the PEGDMA-Oligo-Vanco coating. The observed eradication of bacteria was in stark contrast with the significant bacterial colonization on implants and osteomyelitis development found in the absence of the MN-sensitive bactericidal coating. The effective vancomycin tethering dose presented in this on-demand release strategy was >200 times lower than the typical prophylactic antibiotic contents used in bone cements and may be applied to medical implants and bone/dental cements to prevent periprosthetic infections in high-risk clinical scenarios. This study also supports the timely bactericidal action by MN-triggered release of antibiotics as an effective prophylactic method to bypass the notoriously harder to treat periprosthetic biofilms and osteomyelitis.","authors":[{"name":"Ananta Ghimire"},{"name":"Jordan D Skelly"},{"name":"Jie Song"}],"keywords":[]},"article149":{"pmid":"31893017","title":"Protozoans in subgingival biofilm: clinical and bacterial associated factors and impact of scaling and root planing treatment.","date":"2020-01-03","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Marie Dubar"},{"name":"Marie-Laure Zaffino"},{"name":"Thomas Remen"},{"name":"Nathalie Thilly"},{"name":"Lisiane Cunat"},{"name":"Marie-Claire Machouart"},{"name":"Catherine Bisson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Entamoeba gingivalis"},{"word":"Trichomonas tenax"},{"word":"clinical periodontal parameters"},{"word":"periodontitis"},{"word":"periodontopathogens"},{"word":"scaling and root planing"},{"word":"subgingival microbiota"}]},"article150":{"pmid":"31892814","title":"Identification of Streptomyces strains isolated from Humulus lupulus rhizosphere and determination of plant growth promotion potential of selected strains.","date":"2020-01-03","abs":"In the present study it was aimed to obtain novel strains of actinomycetes that have the ability to promote plant growth.

The major organic substance in nature is plant, but the genetic system of E. coli how to utilize plant-derived materials as nutrients is poorly understood. Here we describe the set of regulatory targets for uncharacterized IclR-family transcription factor YiaJ on the E. coli genome, using gSELEX screening system. Among a total of 18 high-affinity binding targets of YiaJ, the major regulatory target was identified to be the yiaLMNOPQRS operon for utilization of ascorbate from fruits and galacturonate from plant pectin. The targets of YiaJ also include the genes involved in the utilization for other plant-derived materials as nutrients such as fructose, sorbitol, glycerol and fructoselysine. Detailed in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that L-ascorbate and α-D-galacturonate are the effector ligands for regulation of YiaJ function. These findings altogether indicate that YiaJ plays a major regulatory role in expression of a set of the genes for the utilization of plant-derived materials as nutrients for survival. PlaR was also suggested to play protecting roles of E. coli under stressful environments in nature, including the formation of biofilm. We then propose renaming YiaJ to PlaR (regulator of plant utilization).

In the course of gSELEX screening of the regulatory targets for hitherto uncharacterized TFs, we identified in this study the involvement of the IclR-family YiaJ in the regulation of about 20 genes or operons, of which the majority are related to the catabolism of plant-derived materials such as ascorbate, galacturonate, sorbitol, fructose and fructoselysine.

To demonstrate the use of this model the antimicrobial kinetics of ceftazidime, against both mature and developing Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, was assessed. In addition, we have shown the potential application of this model system for investigating microbial metabolomics by employing selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) to monitor ammonia and hydrogen cyanide production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in real-time.","authors":[{"name":"Elisabeth A Slade"},{"name":"Robin M S Thorn"},{"name":"Amber Young"},{"name":"Darren M Reynolds"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Collagen"},{"word":"In vitro model"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Volatile metabolite"},{"word":"Wound"}]},"article170":{"pmid":"31888239","title":"Genomic and Proteomic Characterization of Bacteriophage BH1 Spontaneously Released from Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus Pen.","date":"2020-01-17","abs":"Lactobacillus rhamnosus Pen is a human endogenous strain used for the production of probiotic formula, which is effective in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.

Our research revealed that phage BH1 has a circular genome with a length of 40721 nt and a GC content of 44.8%. The genome of phage BH1 possesses 57 open reading frames which could be divided into functional modules associated with DNA packaging, morphogenesis, lysis, integration, genetic switch, and replication. In spite of similarity in morphology and genomic organization, comparative analysis revealed substantial genetic diversity and mosaic genomic architecture among phages described for the Lactobacillus casei group. Additionally, qPCR and ddPCR analysis confirmed earlier microscopic observations indicating that L. rhamnosus Pen liberates bacteriophage particles during growth. This occurs spontaneously, and is not a result of external inducing factors. For samples collected after 4 and 24 h of L. rhamnosus Pen culture, the number of attB and attP copies increased 2.5 and 12 times, respectively. This phenomenon, by introducing resistance to other phages or enhancing the biofilm-forming capabilities, may increase the survivability of microorganisms in their natural ecological niche. Conversely, spontaneous phage induction may be an important virulence factor for bacteria, posing a potential threat for the human host.","authors":[{"name":"Piotr Jarocki"},{"name":"Elwira Komoń-Janczara"},{"name":"Marcin Podleśny"},{"name":"Oleksandr Kholiavskyi"},{"name":"Monika Pytka"},{"name":"Monika Kordowska-Wiater"}],"keywords":[{"word":"L. rhamnosus"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"probiotics"},{"word":"spontaneous prophage induction"}]},"article171":{"pmid":"31888149","title":"Investigation on Antibiotic-Resistance, Biofilm Formation and Virulence Factors in Multi Drug Resistant and Non Multi Drug Resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.","date":"2020-01-24","abs":"Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a commensal bacterium frequently isolated from canine skin and recognized as a zoonotic agent especially for dog-owners.

Seventy-three S. pseudintermedius strains were screened for antibiotic-resistance against 22 different molecules by means of Kirby-Bauer assay. The ability to produce biofilm was investigated using the microtiter plate assay (MtP) and the amplification of icaA and icaD genes. Virulence factors such as cytotoxins (lukI), enterotoxins (seC), and exfoliative toxins (siet, expA, and expB) were evaluated. The antibiotic-resistance profiles revealed 42/73 (57%) multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains and 31/73 (43%) not-MDR. All the MDR strains and 8/31 (27%) of not-MDR resulted in biofilm producers. Leukotoxin LukI was found in 70/73 (96%) of the isolates. Moreover, the enterotoxin gene seC was detected in 47/73 (64%) of the strains.

Notwithstanding the fact that coin-related biofilms were dominated by typical marine taxa, coin biofilms had specific microbial communities that were different from the communities of the surrounding sediment. Moreover, the communities were different depending on whether the coin were made mainly of steel or of copper.

Biofilm microbiomes in the biofilter media play essential roles in biotransformation of contaminants, but is not comprehensively understood. This study reports on Mn(II) oxidation and the core microbiomes in magnetite sand RSBF (MagS-RSBF) and manganese sand RSBF (MnS-RSBF). MnS-RSBF showed a relatively higher Mn(II) removal rate (40-91.2%) than MagS-RSBF during the start-up. MagS-RSBF and MnS-RSBF had similar Mn(II) removal rates (94.13% and 99.16%) over stable operation for 80 days. Mn(II) removal rates at different depths in the MnS-RSBF reactor significantly changed with operation time, and the filter in the upper layer of MnS-RSBF made the largest contribution to Mn(II) oxidation once operation had stabilized. PacBio single molecule sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA gene indicated that biofilter medium had a significant impact on the core microbiomes of the biofilms from the two biofilters. The magnetite sand biofilter facilitated the enrichment of Mn(II)-oxidizing biofilms. The dominant populations consisted of Pedomicrobium, Pseudomonas, and Hyphomicrobium in the RSBF, which have been affiliated with putative manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB). The relative abundance of Pedomicrobium manganicum increased with operation time in both RSBF reactors. In addition, Nordella oligomobilis and Derxia gummosa were statistically correlated with Mn(II) oxidation. Species-species co-occurrence networks indicated that the microbiome of MnS-RSBF had more complex correlations than that of MagS-RSBF, implying that biofilter medium substantially shaped the microbial community in the RSBF. Hyphomicrobium and nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira moscoviensis were positively correlated. The core microbiomes' composition of both RSBF reactors converged over operation time. A hybrid biofilter medium with magnetite sand and manganese sand may therefore be best in rapid sand filtration for Mn(II) oxidation.","authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhao"},{"name":"Bingfeng Liu"},{"name":"Xiuheng Wang"},{"name":"Chuan Chen"},{"name":"Nanqi Ren"},{"name":"Defeng Xing"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofiltration"},{"word":"Drinking water"},{"word":"Manganese oxidation"},{"word":"Microbiome"},{"word":"Network"},{"word":"Single molecule sequencing"}]},"article175":{"pmid":"31887516","title":"Considerations for assessing stability of wastewater-based epidemiology biomarkers using biofilm-free and sewer reactor tests.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Wastewater-based epidemiology is an increasingly popular method for analysing drugs or metabolites excreted by populations.

This study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial properties of sophorolipids in medical-grade silicone discs using strains of clinical relevance. Sophorolipids were produced under fed batch conditions, ESI-MS analyses were carried out to confirm the congeners present in each formulation. Three different products were obtained SLA (acidic congeners), SL18 (lactonic congeners) and SLV (mixture of acidic and lactonic congeners) and were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and Candida albicans IHEM 2894. All three congener mixtures showed a biofilms disruption effect (> 0.1 % w/v) of 70 %, 75 % and 80 % for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans, respectively. On pre-coated silicone discs, biofilm formation of S. aureus was reduced by 75 % using SLA 0.8 % w/v. After 1.5 h the inhibition of C. albicans attachment was between 45-56 % whilst after 24 h incubation the percentage of inhibition for the cell attachment increased to 68-70 % when using SLA 0.8 % w/v. Finally, in co-incubation experiments SLA 0.05 % w/v significantly reduced the ability of S. aureus and C. albicans to form biofilms and to adhere to surfaces by 90-95 % at concentrations between 0.025-0.1 % w/v.

Here, we show interaction between bacterial and fungal species for utilization of dietary components driving their efficient growth in the intestine. Next generation sequencing of fecal samples from Japanese and Indian adults revealed differential patterns of bacterial and fungal composition. In particular, Indians, who consume more plant polysaccharides than Japanese, harbored increased numbers of Prevotella and Candida. Candida spp. showed strong growth responses to the plant polysaccharide arabinoxylan in vitro. Furthermore, the culture supernatants of Candida spp. grown with arabinoxylan promoted rapid proliferation of Prevotella copri. Arabinose was identified as a potential growth-inducing factor in the Candida culture supernatants. Candida spp. exhibited a growth response to xylose, but not to arabinose, whereas P. copri proliferated in response to both xylose and arabinose. Candida spp., but not P. copri, colonized the intestine of germ-free mice. However, P. copri successfully colonized mouse intestine already harboring Candida.

The effect on the QS system was studied by signal molecule quantification using LC-MS/MS and related gene expression measurements using Real-Time PCR.

The antimicrobial mechanisms of ginseng components could be summarized to the following points: (a) inhibit the microbial motility and quorum-sensing ability; (b) affect the formation of biofilms and destroy the mature biofilms, which can weaken the infection ability of the microbes; (c) perturb membrane lipid bilayers, thus causing the formation of pores, leakages of cell constituents and eventually cell death; (d) stimulate of the immune system and attenuate microbes induced apoptosis, inflammation, and DNA damages, which can protect or help the host fight against microbial infections; and (e) inhibit the efflux of antibiotics that can descend the drug resistance of the microbial. The collected information might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of ginseng and their components to improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.","authors":[{"name":"Lijun Wang"},{"name":"Yang Huang"},{"name":"Guo Yin"},{"name":"Jue Wang"},{"name":"Ping Wang"},{"name":"Zhen-Yu Chen"},{"name":"Tiejie Wang"},{"name":"Guixing Ren"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antibiotic"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"essential oil"},{"word":"ginseng"},{"word":"ginsenoside"},{"word":"polysaccharide"}]},"article188":{"pmid":"31885074","title":"Effective biofilm control in a membrane biofilm reactor using a quenching bacterium (Rhodococcus sp.

One novel strategy against AD might involve the use of psychobiotics, probiotic gut bacteria with specific mental health benefits. Here, we report the neuronal and behavioral protective effects of the probiotic bacterium Bacillus subtilis in a Caenorhabditis elegans AD model. Aging and neuronal deterioration constitute important risk factors for AD development, and we showed that B. subtilis significantly delayed both detrimental processes in the wild-type C. elegans strain N2 compared with N2 worms colonized by the non-probiotic Escherichia coli OP50 strain. Importantly, B. subtilis alleviated the AD-related paralysis phenotype of the transgenic C. elegans strains CL2120 and GMC101 that express, in body wall muscle cells, the toxic peptides Aβ3-42 and Aβ1-42, respectively. B. subtilis-colonized CL2355 worms were protected from the behavioral deficits (e.g., poor chemotactic response and decreased body bends) produced by pan-neuronal Aβ1-42 expression. Notably, B. subtilis restored the lifespan level of C. elegans strains that express Aβ to values similar to the life expectancy of the wild-type strain N2 fed on E. coli OP50 cells. The B. subtilis proficiencies in quorum-sensing peptide (i.e., the Competence Sporulation Factor, CSF) synthesis and gut-associated biofilm formation (related to the anti-aging effect of the probiotic) play a crucial role in the anti-AD effects of B. subtilis.

Here, we report a biochemiluminescent sialidase assay that uses a substrate derivatized with firefly luciferin. In the presence of sialidase in the reaction, the substrate is cleaved to release luciferin, which is subsequently oxidized by firefly luciferase to generate a light signal. Thus, the light signal intensity can be used to detect and measure the relative concentration of sialidase in a vaginal sample as a means of BV diagnosis. All reagents are present in a reagent bead and sample buffer, enabling essentially a one-step assay. The assay is highly sensitive and quantitative, with a sensitivity and specificity of 95.40% and 94.94%, respectively, compared to the Amsel method.

Herein, we examined MSCs/C. acnes interaction and analysed the subsequent bacteria and MSCs behaviours following infection. Human bone marrow derived MSCs were infected by two clinical and one laboratory C. acnes strains. Following 3h of interaction, all bacterial strains were able to invade MSCs. Viable intracellular bacteria acquired virulence factors by increasing biofilm formation and/or by affecting macrophage phagocytosis. Although the direct and indirect (through neutrophil stimulation) antibacterial effects of the MSCs secretome were not enhanced following C. acnes infection, ELISA analysis revealed that C. acnes clinical strains are able to license MSCs to become immunosuppressive cell-like by increasing the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, PGE-2, VEGF, TGF-β and HGF.

It is recognized that small-colony variants (SCVs), which produce higher levels of biofilm and that are capable of intracellular persistence, contribute to the chronicity or recurrence of infections and that this phenotype is inherent to the pathogenesis process. Prevention of S. aureus infections through vaccination has not yet met with considerable success. Some of the current vaccine formulations for S. aureus bovine mastitis consist of inactivated S. aureus bacteria, sometimes combined to E. coli J5. As such, the stimulation of cell-mediated immunity by these vaccines might not be optimal. With this in mind, we recently engineered a genetically stable double mutant SCV (ΔvraGΔhemB), which was highly attenuated in a mastitis model of infection. The present work describes the immune responses elicited in mice by various experimental vaccine compositions including the live-attenuated SCV double mutant and its inactivated form, combined or not with inactivated E. coli J5. The live-attenuated SCV was found to provoke a strong and balanced humoral response in immunized mice, as well as strong proliferation of ex-vivo stimulated splenocytes isolated from these animals. These splenocytes were also found to release high concentration of IL-17 and IFN-γ when compared to every other vaccination formulation. Inversely, the inactivated whole-cell vaccine, alone or in combination with the E. coli J5 bacterin, elicited lower antibody titers and failed to induce Th1 or Th17 cell-mediated responses in the splenocyte proliferation assay. Our results suggest that live-attenuated SCVs can trigger host immunity differently than inactivated bacteria and could represent a suitable vector for inducing strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, which are crucial for protection. This could represent an important improvement over existing vaccine formulations for preventing S. aureus bovine mastitis and other infections caused by this pathogen.","authors":[{"name":"Julie Côté-Gravel"},{"name":"Eric Brouillette"},{"name":"François Malouin"}],"keywords":[]},"article207":{"pmid":"31880897","title":"Epidemiology, Drug Resistance, and Virulence of Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Ocular Infections in Polish Patients.","date":"2020-01-02","abs":"Analysis of the epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) ocular infections and virulence factors of the isolates with a special emphasis on their drug resistance, and the ability of biofilm formation.

Majority of patients showed moderate or severe bacterial dental plaque accumulation, but none of them had clinical symptoms of periodontal diseases. RT-PCR showed the presence of periopathogens in 50% of patients. Red complex microorganisms were detected in 9.09%, orange complex in 27.27%, and green complex in 31.82% of the samples analyzed. In cystic fibrosis patients colonized by periopathogens, the periodontal markers were significantly higher in comparison to not colonized by periopathogens patients. Despite the widespread presence of bacterial dental deposits in the cystic fibrosis adult patients examined, none of them has clinical symptoms of periodontal disease; however, the presence of periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm may represent a possible risk factor of this disease in the future. An unsatisfactory level of oral hygiene in any patient with cystic fibrosis indicates a need to focus on standards of dental care for such patients.","authors":[{"name":"Tamara Pawlaczyk-Kamieńska"},{"name":"Renata Śniatała"},{"name":"Halina Batura-Gabryel"},{"name":"Maria Borysewicz-Lewicka"},{"name":"Szczepan Cofta"}],"keywords":[]},"article210":{"pmid":"31880881","title":"Characteristics of Listeria monocytogenes Strains Isolated from Milk and Humans and the Possibility of Milk-Borne Strains Transmission.","date":"2020-01-14","abs":"Listeria monocytogenes is the etiological factor of listeriosis.

The spread of L. monocytogenes via contaminated teat rubbers was assessed. The L. monocytogenes strains recovered from milk (18), human blood (10), and the reference strain ATCC®19111™ were used in the study. Penicillin resistance was the most prevalent resistance in the milk isolates (n=8; 44.4%), whereas among clinical strains erythromycin resistance was predominating - (n=6; 60%). The most frequent VGs among strains isolated from milk were hlyA (100%) and plcB (100%) whereas in strains isolated from blood - hlyA (100%) and prfA (90%). All tested VGs were present in 50% of blood isolates and 11% of milk-borne strains. The strains isolated from milk formed a significantly stronger biofilm. The strains with more numerous virulence genes were resistant to more antibiotics and formed a stronger biofilm. It was shown that contaminated teat cups might contribute to the transmission of L. monocytogenes in the herd.

Three DGT devices were deployed in a lake for 5 weeks, and two were deployed in a stream for 3 weeks. In the lake, the total Hg (THg) mass accumulated in the DGT varied between 0.05 and 0.15 ng, which increased with an increase in deployment time and decreased with an increase in agarose diffusion gel thickness. The DGT concentration in the lake water for a 2 week period was estimated to be about 0.8-1.0 ng/L, which was close to the measured value of 1.1 (± 0.13) ng/L, using the grab sampling technique. However, the DGT estimated at 4 and 6 weeks showed a concentration of about 0.5-0.7 ng/L, which is about twice as small as that measured by grab sampling. This underestimation of the THg levels in water appear to be caused by additional thicknesses of the physical diffusive boundary layer (0.15, 0.5, 1.29 mm) and biofilm, outside the DGT filter. The predicted DGT concentration in the upper stream of the Nakdong River was estimated to be about 0.8-1.4 ng/L, which is similar to the value of 1.22 (± 0.29) ng/L measured in the field by grab sampling.

The effects of CQDs and CNF (cellulose nanofibers) content on the morphology, optical, mechanical, water-resistance, and wettability properties of the PVA/CQDs and PVA/CNF/CQDs films are discussed. The results revealed that, when the excitation wavelength was increased from 340 to 390 nm, the emission peak became slightly red-shifted, which was induced by the condensation between CQDs and PVA. The PVA composite films showed an increase in fluorescence intensity with the addition of the CNF and CQDs to polymers. The chemical structure of prepared films was determined by the FTIR spectroscopy, and no new chemical bonds were formed. In addition, the UV transmittance was inversely proportional to the change of CQDs content, which indicated that CQDs improved the UV barrier properties of the films. Furthermore, embedding CQDs Nano-materials and CNF into the PVA matrix improved the mechanical behavior of the Nano-composite. Tensile modulus and strength at break increased significantly with increasing the concentration of CQDs Nano-materials inside the Nano-composite, which was due to the increased in the density of crosslinking behavior. With the increase of CQDs content (>1 mL), the water absorption and surface contact angle of the prepared films decreased gradually, and the water-resistance and surface wettability of the films were improved.

These pumps are also essential for Gram-negative pathogens to cause infection and form biofilms. They consist of an inner membrane RND transporter; a periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP), and an outer membrane channel. The role of PAPs in assembly, and the identities of specific residues involved in PAP-RND binding, remain poorly understood. Using recent high-resolution structures, four 3D sites involved in PAP-RND binding within each PAP protomer were defined that correspond to nine discrete linear binding sequences or binding boxes within the PAP sequence. In the important human pathogen Salmonella enterica, these binding boxes are conserved within phylogenetically-related PAPs, such as AcrA and AcrE, while differing considerably between divergent PAPs such as MdsA and MdtA, despite overall conservation of the PAP structure. By analysing these binding sequences we created a predictive model of PAP-RND interaction, which suggested the determinants that may allow promiscuity between certain PAPs, but discrimination of others. We corroborated these predictions using direct phenotypic data, confirming that only AcrA and AcrE, but not MdtA or MsdA, can function with the major RND pump AcrB. Furthermore, we provide functional validation of the involvement of the binding boxes by disruptive site-directed mutagenesis. These results directly link sequence conservation within identified PAP binding sites with functional data providing mechanistic explanation for assembly of clinically relevant RND-pumps and explain how Salmonella and other pathogens maintain a degree of redundancy in efflux mediated resistance. Overall, our study provides a novel understanding of the molecular determinants driving the RND-PAP recognition by bridging the available structural information with experimental functional validation thus providing the scientific community with a predictive model of pump-contacts that could be exploited in the future for the development of targeted therapeutics and efflux pump inhibitors.","authors":[{"name":"Helen E McNeil"},{"name":"Ilyas Alav"},{"name":"Ricardo Corona Torres"},{"name":"Amanda E Rossiter"},{"name":"Eve Laycock"},{"name":"Simon Legood"},{"name":"Inderpreet Kaur"},{"name":"Matthew Davies"},{"name":"Matthew Wand"},{"name":"Mark A Webber"},{"name":"Vassiliy N Bavro"},{"name":"Jessica M A Blair"}],"keywords":[]},"article227":{"pmid":"31877028","title":"Catalytic Cycle of Glycoside Hydrolase BglX from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Its Implications for Biofilm Formation.","date":"2020-01-17","abs":"BglX is a heretofore uncharacterized periplasmic glycoside hydrolase (GH) of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Five compositions of blends (alumina, zirconia, hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, chitosan), in addition to the base cement consisting of homogeneous CAC were evaluated as a substitute for bone repair. Additionally, the monotypic biofilm formation was assessed. Creation of a monocortical bone defect was performed on the femurs of rats, which were randomly filled with the different materials.

To evaluate the formation of biofilms, reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were cultured on the samples, and the biofilm formed was quantified by the MTT method. In the microtomography and histomorphometry results, it was observed that the blends exhibited better results than the control group, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) for alumina and zirconia blends.

Although a marked decline in their use was driven by the discovery of antibiotics, the era of antibiotic resistance has led to a resurgence of phage therapy into clinical practice.

The primary objective of this review is to discuss the positive interactions between phage and antibiotic combinations, with an emphasis on PAS, reductions in bacterial growth or minimum inhibitory concentrations, enhanced biofilm eradication, and alterations in the emergence of bacterial resistance. A peer-reviewed literature search was conducted (1890-2019) using the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases.

Moreover, EEP-NPs exhibited less cytotoxicity on Vero cells and suppressed the virulence factors of C. albicans, including adhesion, hyphal germination, biofilm formation, and invasion. Importantly, EEP-NPs exhibited a statistical decrease in the expression of hyphal adhesion-related genes, ALS3 and HWP1, of C. albicans. The results of this study revealed that EEP-NPs mediates a potent anticandidal activity and key virulence factors by reducing the gene-encoding virulence-associated hyphal- adhesion proteins of C. albicans and, thereby, disrupting the morphologic presence and attenuating their virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Anupon Iadnut"},{"name":"Ketsaya Mamoon"},{"name":"Patcharin Thammasit"},{"name":"Sudjai Pawichai"},{"name":"Singkome Tima"},{"name":"Kanya Preechasuth"},{"name":"Thida Kaewkod"},{"name":"Yingmanee Tragoolpua"},{"name":"Khajornsak Tragoolpua"}],"keywords":[]},"article244":{"pmid":"31871084","title":"Evaluation of the Activity of a Combination of Three Bacteriophages Alone or in Association with Antibiotics on Staphylococcus aureus Embedded in Biofilm or Internalized in Osteoblasts.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for difficult-to-treat bone and joint infections (BJIs). This is related to its ability to form biofilm and to be internalized and persist inside osteoblasts. Recently, bacteriophage therapy has emerged as a promising option to improve treatment of such infections, but data on its activity against the specific bacterial lifestyles presented above remain scarce. We evaluated the activity of a combination of three bacteriophages, recently used for compassionate treatment in France, against S. aureus HG001 in a model of staphylococcal biofilm and a model of osteoblasts infection, alone or in association with vancomycin or rifampin. The activity of bacteriophages against biofilm-embedded S. aureus was dose dependent. In addition, synergistic effects were observed when bacteriophages were combined with antibiotics used at the lowest concentrations. Phage penetration into osteoblasts was observed only when the cells were infected, suggesting a S. aureus-dependent Trojan horse mechanism for internalization. The intracellular bacterial count of bacteria in infected osteoblasts treated with bacteriophages as well as with vancomycin was significantly higher than in cells treated with lysostaphin, used as a control condition, owing to the absence of intracellular activity and the rapid killing of bacteria released after the death of infected cells. These results suggest that bacteriophages are both inactive in the intracellular compartment after being internalized in infected osteoblasts and present a delayed killing effect on bacteria released after cell lysis into the extracellular compartment, which avoids preventing them from infecting other osteoblasts.

The loss of rhamnose production also significantly disrupted biofilm formation, an important aspect of S. mutans growth in the oral cavity. Further, we demonstrate that loss of either rmlD or rgpG results in ablation of rhamnose content in the S. mutans cell wall.

While the ATPase activity of PilB resides at its C-terminal region, the N terminus of a subset of PilBs forms a novel cyclic-di-GMP (cdG)-binding domain. This multi-domain structure suggests that PilB binds cdG and adenine nucleotides through separate domains which may influence the functionality of PilB in both motility and biofilm development. Here, Chloracidobacterium thermophilum PilB is used to investigate ligand binding by its separate domains and by the full-length protein. Our results confirm the specificity of these individual domains for their respective ligands and demonstrate communications between these domains in the full-length protein.

Compared to the regulon of CcpA in SK36 in the RegPrecise database, we found that only minority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) contained putative catabolite response element (cre) in their regulatory regions, indicating that many genes could have been affected indirectly by the loss of CcpA and analyzing the sequence of the promoter region using prediction tools is not a desirable method to recognize potential target genes of global regulator CcpA.

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel approaches to successfully treat this infection. Staphylococcal accessory regulator A (SarA), a global virulence regulator, plays a critical role in pathogenesis and β-lactam antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Hypericin is believed to act as an antibiotic, antidepressant, antiviral and non-specific kinase inhibitor. In the current study, we investigated the impact of hypericin on β-lactam antibiotics susceptibility and mechanism(s) of its activity. We demonstrated that hypericin significantly decreased the minimum inhibitory concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., oxacillin, cefazolin and nafcillin), biofilm formation and fibronectin binding in MRSA strain JE2. In addition, hypericin significantly reduced sarA expression, and subsequently decreased mecA, and virulence-related regulators (e.g., agr RNAⅢ) and genes (e.g., fnbA and hla) expression in the studied MRSA strain. Importantly, the in vitro synergistic effect of hypericin with β-lactam antibiotic (e.g., oxacillin) translated into in vivo therapeutic outcome in a murine MRSA bacteremia model.

This study reports the in vitro antibacterial effect of the oleoresin from Copaifera officinalis Jacq. L. in natura (copaiba oil) and loaded into carbomer-hydrogel against planktonic and sessile cells of GBS. First, the naturally extracted copaiba oil was tested for the ability to inhibit the growth and metabolic activity of planktonic and sessile GBS cells. The time-kill kinetics showed that copaiba oil exhibited a dose-dependent bactericidal activity against planktonic GBS strains, including those resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin [minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranged from 0.06 mg/mL to 0.12 mg/mL]. Copaiba oil did not inhibit the growth of different Lactobacillus species, the indigenous members of the human microbiota. The mass spectral analyses of copaiba oil showed the presence of diterpenes, and the kaurenoic acid appears to be one of the active components of oleoresin from C. officinalis related to antibacterial activity against GBS. Microscopy analyses of planktonic GBS cells treated with copaiba oil revealed morphological and ultrastructural alterations, displaying disruption of the cell wall, damaged cell membrane, decreased electron density of the cytoplasm, presence of intracellular condensed material, and asymmetric septa. Copaiba oil also exhibited antibacterial activity against established biofilms of GBS strains, inhibiting the viability of sessile cells. Low-cost and eco-friendly carbomer-based hydrogels containing copaiba oil (0.5% - CARB-CO 0.5; 1.0% - CARB-CO 1.0) were then developed. However, only CARB-CO 1.0 preserved the antibacterial activity of copaiba oil against GBS strains. This formulation was homogeneous, soft, exhibited a viscoelastic behavior, and showed good biocompatibility with murine vaginal mucosa. Moreover, CARB-CO 1.0 showed a slow and sustained release of the copaiba oil, killing the planktonic and sessile (established biofilm) cells and inhibiting the biofilm formation of GBS on pre-coated abiotic surface. These results indicate that carbomer-based hydrogels may be useful as topical systems for delivery of copaiba oil directly into de vaginal mucosa and controlling S. agalactiae colonization and infection.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Elisa Belotto Morguette"},{"name":"Briani Gisele Bigotto"},{"name":"Renata de Lima Varella"},{"name":"Gabriella Maria Andriani"},{"name":"Laís Fernanda de Almeida Spoladori"},{"name":"Patrícia Moraes Lopes Pereira"},{"name":"Fabio Goulart de Andrade"},{"name":"Cesar Armando Contreras Lancheros"},{"name":"Celso Vataru Nakamura"},{"name":"Nilton Syogo Arakawa"},{"name":"Marcos Luciano Bruschi"},{"name":"José Carlos Tomaz"},{"name":"Audrey Alesandra Stinghen Garcia Lonni"},{"name":"Gilselena Kerbauy"},{"name":"Eliandro Reis Tavares"},{"name":"Lucy Megumi Yamauchi"},{"name":"Sueli Fumie Yamada-Ogatta"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"carbomer"},{"word":"copaiba oil"},{"word":"group B Streptococcus"},{"word":"semi-solid formulation"}]},"article265":{"pmid":"31866973","title":"Polymicrobial Interactions Induce Multidrug Tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus Through Energy Depletion.","date":"2019-12-26","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a high number of relapsing infections, which are often mediated by the protective nature of biofilms.

The possibility of C. albicans matrix components physically blocking antibiotic molecules from reaching S. aureus was ruled out as oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, delafloxacin, and rifampicin were able to diffuse through polymicrobial biofilms. Based on previous findings that S. aureus forms drug tolerant persister cells through ATP depletion, we examined nutrient deprivation by determining glucose availability, which indirectly correlates to ATP production via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Using an extracellular glucose assay, we confirmed that S. aureus and C. albicans polymicrobial cultures depleted available glucose faster than the respective monocultures. Supporting this finding, S. aureus exhibited decreased TCA cycle activity, specifically fumarase expression, when grown in the presence of C. albicans. In addition, S. aureus grown in polymicrobial cultures displayed 2.2-fold more cells with low membrane potential and a 13% reduction in intracellular ATP concentrations than in monocultures.

A total of 109 S. aureus strains isolated from a variety of infections like ocular diseases, wound infection, and sputum were included in the study. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined against 8 antimicrobials. PCR determined the presence of 16S rRNA, nuc, mecA, czrC, qacA/B, pvl, and toxin genes in S. aureus isolates. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), SCCmec, spa-, and agr-typing and serotyping determined the diversity among them. All isolates of S. aureus were resistant to two or more than two antibiotics and generated 32 resistance patterns. These isolates were positive for 16S rRNA and S. aureus-specific nuc gene, but showed variable results for mecA, czrC, and qacA/B and pvl genes. Of the 32 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 13 strains carried SCCmec type V, seven type IV, two type III, and nine carried unreported type UT6. Of the 109 strains, 98.2% were positive for hlg, 94.5% for hla, 86.2% for sei, 73.3% for efb, 70.6% for cna, 30.2% for sea, and 12.8% for sec genes. Serotypes VII and VI were prevalent among S. aureus strains. PFGE analysis grouped the 109 strains into 77 clusters. MLST classified the strains into 33 sequence types (ST) and eight clonal complexes (CCs) of which 12 were singletons, and two belong to new allelic profiles. Isolates showed 46 spa-types that included two new spa-types designated as t14911 and t14912. MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were diverse in terms of antibiotic resistance pattern, toxin genotypes, SCCmec types, serotypes and PFGE, MLST, and spa-types. However, few isolates from eye infection and wound infection belong to CC239, ST239, and spa-type t037/t657.

The results demonstrated vertical stratification of all planktonic communities with geographic variations disappearing in the deep-sea environment.

These seeps flow across iron duricrusts (referred to as canga in Brazil) into hydraulically restricted lakes in northern Brazil. Canga caps all of the iron ore deposits in Brazil, protecting them from being destroyed by erosion in this active weathering environment. Biofilm samples collected from these seeps demonstrated heightened biogeochemical iron cycling, contributing to the relatively rapid, seasonal formation of iron-rich cements. The seeps support iron-oxidising lineages including Sideroxydans, Gallionella, and an Azoarcus species revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In contrast, a low relative abundance of putative iron reducers; for example, Geobacter species (<5% of total sequences in any sample), corresponds to carbon limitation in this canga-associated ecosystem. This carbon limitation is likely to restrict anoxic niches to within biofilms. Examination of a canga rock sample collected from the edge of Lake Violão revealed an array of well- to poorly-preserved microbial fossils in secondary iron cements. These heterogeneous cements preserved bacterial cell envelopes and possibly extracellular polymeric substances within the microfossil iron-rich cements (termed biocements). Bacterial iron reduction initiates the sequence, and intuitively is the rate-limiting step in this broadly aerobic environment. The organic framework of the active- and paleo-biofilms appears to provide a scaffold for the formation of some cements within canga and likely expedites cement formation. The accelerated development of these resilient iron-rich biocements in the lake edge environment compared with surroundings duricrust-associated environments may provide insights into new approaches to remediate mined land, aiding to stabilise slopes, reduce erosion, restore functional hydrogeology and provide a substrate akin to natural canga for revegetation using endemic canga plant species, which have adapted to grow on iron-rich substrates.","authors":[{"name":"Alan Levett"},{"name":"Emma J Gagen"},{"name":"Paulo M Vasconcelos"},{"name":"Yitian Zhao"},{"name":"Anat Paz"},{"name":"Gordon Southam"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocements"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Iron precipitation"},{"word":"Iron reduction"},{"word":"Iron seep"},{"word":"Organic scaffold"}]},"article276":{"pmid":"31864088","title":"Enhanced anti-lung carcinoma and anti-biofilm activity of fungal molecules mediated biogenic zinc oxide nanoparticles conjugated with β-D-glucan from barley.","date":"2020-02-13","abs":"This work reports the optimization, synthesis, characterization, anticancer, and antibacterial activity of the Trichoderma-β-D-glucan‑zinc oxide nanoparticles (T-β-D-glu-ZnO NPs).

In this work, long-term treatment performance of seven full-scale RBC systems along with the structure and abundance of the ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) communities within microbial biofilms were examined. Long term data showed the dominance of AOB in most RBCs, although two RBCs had demonstrable shift toward an AOA dominated AOM community.

AOA were more abundant in the biofilms subject to lower organic loading and higher oxygen concentration found at the distal end of RBC systems. Modelling revealed a distinct nitrogen cycling community present within high performing RBCs, linked to efficient control of RBC process variables (retention time, organic loading and oxygen concentration). We present a novel template for enhancing the resilience of RBC systems through microbial community analysis which can guide future strategies for more effective ammonia removal.

On the background of an aging population, the number of joint replacements and associated complications is expected to increase. The capability for biofilm formation and the increasing resistance of different microbes to antibiotics have complicated the treatment of PPI, requiring the need for the development of alternative treatment options. The bactericidal effect of the naturally occurring amino alcohol sphingosine has already been reported. In our study, we demonstrate the antimicrobial efficacy of sphingosine on three different strains of biofilm producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, representing one of the most frequent microbes involved in PPI. In an in vitro analysis, sphingosine's capability for prevention and treatment of biofilm-contamination on different common orthopedic implant surfaces was tested. Coating titanium implant samples with sphingosine not only prevented implant contamination but also revealed a significant reduction of biofilm formation on the implant surfaces by 99.942%. When testing the antimicrobial efficacy of sphingosine on sessile biofilm-grown Staphylococcus epidermidis, sphingosine solution was capable to eliminate 99.999% of the bacteria on the different implant surfaces, i.e., titanium, steel, and polymethylmethacrylate. This study provides evidence on the antimicrobial efficacy of sphingosine for both planktonic and sessile biofilm-grown Staphylococcus epidermidis on contaminated orthopedic implants. Sphingosine may provide an effective and cheap treatment option for prevention and reduction of infections in joint replacement surgery.

Material properties including film thickness and degree of conversion (DC) of each type of LCFV were evaluated. In addition, protein-repellent effects and inhibitory effects on Streptococcus mutans adhesion and saliva-derived biofilm accumulation of LCFV were estimated. Finally, the preventive effect of LCFV on enamel demineralization was assessed in vitro on extracted human teeth specimens stored in S. mutans-containing medium. The film thickness of LCFV significantly decreased with the incorporation of zwitterionic materials compared to the control LCFV, whereas there were no significant differences in the DC among all of the LCFV groups.

Given the increasing prevalence of S. aureus drug-resistant strains, it is imperative to search for new strategies for treatment and prevention. Thus, we investigated the activity of molecules produced by a commensal S. epidermidis isolate against S. aureus biofilms. We showed that molecules present in S. epidermidis cell-free conditioned media (CFCM) caused a significant reduction in biofilm formation in most S. aureus clinical isolates, including all 4 agr types and agr-defective strains, without any impact on growth. S. epidermidis molecules also disrupted established S. aureus biofilms and reduced the antibiotic concentration required to eliminate them. Preliminary characterization of the active compound showed that its activity is resistant to heat, protease inhibitors, trypsin, proteinase K, and sodium periodate treatments, suggesting that it is not proteinaceous. RNA sequencing revealed that S. epidermidis-secreted molecules modulate the expression of hundreds of S. aureus genes, some of which are associated with biofilm production. Biofilm formation is one of the main virulence factors of S. aureus and has been associated with chronic infections and antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, molecules that can counteract this virulence factor may be promising alternatives as novel therapeutic agents to control S. aureus infections.","authors":[{"name":"Thaís Glatthardt"},{"name":"Juliana Curityba de Mello Campos"},{"name":"Raiane Cardoso Chamon"},{"name":"Thiago Freitas de Sá Coimbra"},{"name":"Giulia de Almeida Rocha"},{"name":"Marília Alves Figueira de Melo"},{"name":"Thiago Estevam Parente"},{"name":"Leandro Araujo Lobo"},{"name":"Luis Caetano Martha Antunes"},{"name":"Kátia Regina Netto Dos Santos"},{"name":"Rosana Barreto Rocha Ferreira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"antivirulence"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"skin microbiota"}]},"article287":{"pmid":"31862559","title":"Rationally designed magnetic poly(catechol-hexanediamine) particles for bacteria removal and on-demand biofilm eradication.","date":"2020-02-18","abs":"In this study, we proposed a green, facile and low-cost approach for the fabrication of multifunctional particles with robust bacteria removal capability and on-demand biofilm eradication activity.

Along with the mycobiont, numerous non-obligate microfungi live in lichen thalli. These microfungi are called endolichenic fungi (ELF). In recent years, the ELF are emerging as promising natural sources because of their capability to exert unique drug molecules. The current study aimed to isolate the ELF from the lichen, Usnea longissima Ach., to control of biofilm formation and quorum sensing phenomenon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an opportunistic multidrug resistance pathogen that uses quorum sensing network to produce an array of pathogenic agents. Therefore, inhibiting quorum sensing to manage the infection caused by PAO1 could be the paramount alternative approach to conventional antibiotics. The isolated ELF was identified by amplifying the long subunit region of the fungal genome. The extracted metabolites of ELF (MELE) using the acetone solvent was further investigated for anti-quorum sensing activity using the biomarker strain Chromobacterium violaceum 12472 which exerts violacein pigment via the AHL mediated quorum sensing signalling. Moreover, the effect of MELE was also evaluated on the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1. The molecular identification revealed that ELF (accession number MN171299) exhibited 100% similarity with Aspergillus quandricinctus strain CBS 135.52. The MELE showed significant anti-quorum sensing activity at the concentration of 4 mg/mL without affecting the bacterial cell viability of P. aeruginosa PAO1. The MELE diminished the production of virulence factors, including pyocyanin, protease, elastase, rhamnolipids, and extracellular polysaccharides of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The MELE also disturbed biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1. The 3-D analysis of biofilm architecture showed that the thickness and surface area covered by microcolonies was decreased as the concentration of MELE was increased. The GC-MS analysis of MELE exhibited that organic acids and fatty acids are major constituents of the MELE.

However, recent studies have linked it with cases of mastitis in cows. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a bioactive compound with pharmacological functions including antibacterial activity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ISL on S. xylosus in vitro and in vivo. The MIC of ISL against S. xylosus was 80 μg/mL. It was observed that sub-MICs of ISL (1/2MIC, 1/4MIC, 1/8MIC) significantly inhibited the formation of S. xylosus biofilm in vitro. Previous studies have observed that inhibiting imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase (IGPD) concomitantly inhibited biofilm formation in S. xylosus. So, we designed experiments to target the formation of IGPD or inhibits its activities in S. xylosus ATCC 700404. The results indicated that the activity of IGPD and its histidine content decreased significantly under 1/2 MIC (40 μg/mL) ISL, and the expression of IGPD gene (hisB) and IGPD protein was significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, Bio-layer interferometry experiments showed that ISL directly interacted with IGPD protein (with strong affinity; KD = 234 μM). In addition, molecular docking was used to predict the binding mode of ISL and IGPD. In vivo tests revealed that, ISL significantly reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels, mitigated the destruction of the mammary glands and reversed the production of inflammatory cells in mice.

This study used targeted gene deletion to investigate the role of SufT in the physiology of mycobacteria, using Mycobacterium smegmatis as a model organism. Deletion of the sufT gene in M. smegmatis had no impact on growth under standard culture conditions and did not significantly alter activity of the FeS cluster dependent enzymes succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and aconitase (ACN). Furthermore, the ΔsufT mutant was no more sensitive than the wild-type strain to the redox cycler 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ), or the anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid, clofazimine or rifampicin.

Based on the quorum-sensing signalling molecules 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ) and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (PQS) from the nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, modifications have been developed with markedly enhanced anti-biofilm bioactivity towards important fungal and bacterial pathogens, including Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Here we show that antibacterial activity of HHQ against Vibrionaceae is species-specific and it requires an exquisite level of structural fidelity within the alkyl-quinolone molecular framework. Antibacterial activity was demonstrated against the serious human pathogens Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio cholerae as well as a panel of bioluminescent squid symbiont Allivibrio fischeri isolates. In contrast, Vibrio parahaemolyticus growth and biofilm formation was unaffected in the presence of HHQ and all the structural variants tested. In general, modification to almost all of the molecule except the alkyl-chain end, led to loss of activity. This suggests that the bacteriostatic activity of HHQ requires the concerted action of the entire framework components. The only exception to this pattern was deuteration of HHQ at the C3 position. HHQ modified with a terminal alkene at the quinolone alkyl chain retained bacteriostatic activity and was also found to activate PqsR signalling comparable to the native agonist. The data from this integrated analysis provides novel insights into the structural flexibility underpinning the signalling activity of the complex alkyl-quinolone molecular communication system.","authors":[{"name":"Ana F Ramos"},{"name":"David F Woods"},{"name":"Rachel Shanahan"},{"name":"Rafael Cano"},{"name":"Gerard P McGlacken"},{"name":"Claudia Serra"},{"name":"Fergal O'Gara"},{"name":"F Jerry Reen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alkyl quinolone (AQ)"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Interspecies interactions"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Vibrionaceae"}]},"article302":{"pmid":"31860279","title":"Revealing the Significance of the Glycan Binding Property of Butea monosperma Seed Lectin for Enhancing the Antibiofilm Activity of Silver Nanoparticles against Uropathogenic Escherichia coli.","date":"2020-01-15","abs":"The incompetence of conventional antibiotics against bacteria residing in biofilms demands newer therapeutic intervention. In this study, we demonstrated that the interaction between silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and Butea monosperma seed lectin (BMSL) forms efficient surface-functionalized AgNPs with excellent antibiofilm competency against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of AgNPs and the BMSL-AgNP conjugate (BAgNP) against UPEC was 75 and 9.37 μM, respectively. The eight-fold reduction in the MBIC of AgNPs was attributed to lectin functionalization. The chemical modification of serine amino acids affects the hemagglutination activity of BMSL but not its interaction with the AgNPs. At the same time, AgNPs surface-functionalized with modified BMSL display poor antibiofilm activity. Molecular docking studies revealed that BMSL binds to galactose with a free energy of -5.72 kcal/mol, whereas the serine residue-modified BMSL showed the lowest free energy values, suggesting incompetence for binding galactose. These results showcase that the sugar binding site of BMSL aids in the adhesion of AgNPs to the biofilm matrix and disturbs the formation of the biofilm, which was confirmed by light microscopy using crystal violet staining. At 37.5 μM, BAgNPs also have the capability to eradicate preformed biofilm. As a proof of concept, UPEC biofilm prevention and eradication were demonstrated on a urinary catheter. A scanning electron microscopy study showed that BAgNPs prevent bacterial colonization and thereby curtail biofilm growth. In addition to antibiofilm activity, BAgNPs exert antibacterial activity at 18.75 μM, which is four-fold lower than the MIC of AgNPs. A mechanistic study revealed that BAgNPs affect the integrity of the bacterial outer membrane and generate an imbalance in the antioxidant defense, which induces cell death. The results highlight that lectin functionalization can be extended to other nanoparticles and different antibiotics to enhance their efficacy against drug-resistant bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Siva Bala Subramaniyan"},{"name":"Rajendran Senthilnathan"},{"name":"Jothi Arunachalam"},{"name":"Veerappan Anbazhagan"}],"keywords":[]},"article303":{"pmid":"31859706","title":"Anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory effect of a herbal nanoparticle mouthwash: a randomized crossover trial.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"Laboratory evidence has demonstrated the antimicrobial effect of Melaleuca alternifolia (MEL) against oral microorganisms.

Chronic S. epidermidis infections are often recalcitrant to traditional therapies due to antibiotic resistance and formation of robust biofilms. The accessory gene regulator (agr) QS system plays an important role in biofilm formation in this opportunistic pathogen, and the binding of an autoinducing peptide (AIP) signal to its cognate transmembrane receptor (AgrC) is responsible for controlling agr. Small molecules or peptides capable of modulating this binding event are of significant interest as probes to investigate both the agr system and QS as a potential antivirulence target. We used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the structures of the three native S. epidermidis AIP signals and five non-native analogs with distinct activity profiles in the AgrC-I receptor from S. epidermidis. These studies revealed a suite of structural motifs critical for ligand activity. Interestingly, a unique β-turn was present in the macrocycles of the two most potent AgrC-I modulators, in both an agonist and an antagonist, which was distinct from the macrocycle conformation in the less-potent AgrC-I modulators and in the native AIP-I itself. This previously unknown β-turn provides a structural rationale for these ligands' respective biological activity profiles. Development of analogs to reinforce the β-turn resulted in our first antagonist with subnanomolar potency in AgrC-I, while analogs designed to contain a disrupted β-turn were dramatically less potent relative to their parent compounds. Collectively, these studies provide new insights into the AIP:AgrC interactions crucial for QS activation in S. epidermidis and advance the understanding of QS at the molecular level.","authors":[{"name":"Joseph K Vasquez"},{"name":"Korbin H J West"},{"name":"Tian Yang"},{"name":"Thomas J Polaske"},{"name":"Gabriel Cornilescu"},{"name":"Marco Tonelli"},{"name":"Helen E Blackwell"}],"keywords":[]},"article305":{"pmid":"31859287","title":"Effect of Silver Fluoride in Preventing the Formation of Artificial Dentinal Caries Lesions in vitro.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"To investigate the effect of silver fluoride in preventing the development of artificial caries lesions in root dentine using an artificial mouth system (AMS).","authors":[{"name":"Bao Ying Liu"},{"name":"Lei Mei"},{"name":"Chun Hung Chu"},{"name":"Edward Chin Man Lo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"artificial mouth system"},{"word":"dental biofilm"},{"word":"dentine caries lesion"},{"word":"prevention"},{"word":"silver fluoride"}]},"article306":{"pmid":"31858707","title":"The role of rhizodeposits in shaping rhizomicrobiome.","date":"2020-03-04","abs":"Rhizomicrobiome, the communities of microorganisms surrounding the root of the plant, plays a vital role in promoting plant growth and health.

Bacteroides fragilis is one of the least abundant Bacteroides species, yet is the most common anaerobe isolated from extraintestinal infections in humans. A subset of B. fragilis strains carry a genetic element that encodes a metalloprotease enterotoxin named Bacteroides fragilis toxin, or BFT. Toxin-bearing strains, or Enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) cause acute and chronic intestinal disease in children and adults. Despite this association with disease, around twenty percent of the human population appear to be asymptomatic carriers of ETBF. BFT damages the colonic epithelial barrier by inducing cleavage of the zonula adherens protein E-cadherin and initiating a cell signaling response characterized by inflammation and c-Myc-dependent pro-oncogenic hyperproliferation. As a consequence, mice harboring genetic mutations that predispose to colonic inflammation or tumor formation are uniquely susceptible to toxin-mediated injury.

These findings display that VA has a potent antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against CREH, and hence has the potential to be exploited in clinic as a novel candidate agent to treat CREH infections and in the food industry as food preservatives and surface disinfectants.","authors":[{"name":"Weidong Qian"},{"name":"Min Yang"},{"name":"Ting Wang"},{"name":"Zhaohuan Sun"},{"name":"Miao Liu"},{"name":"Jianing Zhang"},{"name":"Qiao Zeng"},{"name":"Changlong Cai"},{"name":"Yongdong Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm formation"},{"word":"carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter hormaechei"},{"word":"cell membrane"},{"word":"vanillic acid"}]},"article319":{"pmid":"31854782","title":"[Nitrification, Denitrification, and N","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"A sequencing biofilm batch reactor (SBBR) running continuously in an anaerobic/aerobic/anoxic (A","authors":[{"name":"Wei Dai"},{"name":"Jian-Qiang Zhao"},{"name":"Jia-Zhi Ding"},{"name":"Shuang Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"N2O"},{"word":"high-throughput sequencing"},{"word":"nitrification and denitrification"},{"word":"saline and alkaline conditions"},{"word":"sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR)"}]},"article320":{"pmid":"31854774","title":"[Advanced Denitrification of Municipal Wastewater Achieved via Partial ANAMMOX in Anoxic MBBR].","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Anoxic MBBR is a process to achieve advanced denitrification from municipal wastewater.

The model provides realistic estimates of key structural parameters in the thylakoid membrane, in particular the overall stacking distance and how this is divided between membranes, lumen and cytoplasmic liquid.

The disruption of the homeostatic relationship between plaque bacteria and the host can initiate and promote periodontal disease progression. Recent advances in sequencing technologies allow researchers to profile disease-associated microbial communities and quantify microbial metabolic activities and host transcriptional responses. In addition to confirming the findings from previous studies, new putative pathogens and novel genes that have not previously been associated with periodontitis, emerge. For example, multiple studies have reported that Synergistetes bacteria are associated with periodontitis. Genes involved in epithelial barrier defense were downregulated in periodontitis, while excessive expression of interleukin-17 was associated with a hyperinflammatory response in periodontitis and with a unique microbial community. Bioinformatics-enabled gene ontology pathway analyses provide a panoramic view of the bacterial and host activities as they shift from periodontal health to disease. Additionally, host innate factors, such as genetic variants identified by either a candidate-gene approach or genome-wide association analyses, have an impact on subgingival bacterial colonization. Transgenic mice carrying candidate genetic variants, or with the deletion of candidate genes mimicking the deleterious loss-of-function variant effect, provide experimental evidence validating the biologic relevance of the novel markers associated with the microbial phenotype identified through a statistical approach.

Subsequently, in the 1980s, host-response mechanisms were identified as the mediators of the destruction of the collagen-rich periodontal tissues (gingiva, periodontal ligament, alveolar bone), and the periodontopathogens were now regarded as the trigger of the inflammatory/collagenolytic response that characterizes actively destructive periodontitis. Also at this time a new pharmacologic strategy emerged, entitled host-modulation therapy, based on 2 major findings: (1) that the ability of tetracycline antibiotics to inhibit periodontal breakdown was due (in large part) to their previously unrecognized ability to inhibit the host-derived matrix metalloproteinases (notably, the collagenases, gelatinases, macrophage metalloelastase), and by mechanisms unrelated to the antimicrobial properties of these medications; and (2) that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as flurbiprofen, again by nonantimicrobial mechanisms, could reduce the severity of periodontitis (however, the adverse effects of long-term therapy precluded their development as safe and effective host-modulatory agents). Additional mechanistic studies resulted in the development of novel nonantimicrobial formulations (Periostat® [now generic] and Oracea®) and compositions of tetracyclines (notably chemically modified tetracycline-3) as host-modulator drugs for periodontitis, arthritis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, cancer, and, more recently, for local and systemic bone loss in postmenopausal women. Identification of the cation-binding active site in the tetraphenolic chemically modified tetracycline molecules drove the development of a new category of matrix metalloproteinase-inhibitor compounds, with a similar active site, the biphenolic chemically modified curcumins. A lead compound, chemically modified curcumin 2.24, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in vitro, in cell culture, and in vivo in mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog models of disease. In conclusion, novel host-modulation compounds have shown significant promise as adjuncts to traditional local therapy in the clinical management of periodontal disease; appear to reduce systemic complications of this all-too-common inflammatory/collagenolytic disease; and Oracea® is now commonly prescribed for inflammatory dermatologic diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Lorne M Golub"},{"name":"Hsi-Ming Lee"}],"keywords":[]},"article338":{"pmid":"31850377","title":"Brazilian Green Propolis as a Therapeutic Agent for the Post-surgical Treatment of Caseous Lymphadenitis in Sheep.","date":"2019-12-20","abs":"As antibiotics are ineffective when used to treat caseous lymphadenitis, the surgical excision of lesions is often required. Iodine solution (10%) is currently the choice for the post-surgical treatment; however, it may cause histotoxicity. Propolis are resinous substances composed by a mixture of different plants parts and molecules secreted by bees. As green propolis has already proven to possess anti-bacterial and wound healing properties, this study aimed to evaluate the use of a green propolis-based ointment as a therapeutic agent for the post-surgical treatment of caseous lymphadenitis. The caseous lesions of 28 sheep were surgically excised before dividing animals into two groups: (1) iodine-treated animals and (2) sheep treated with an ointment made with a previously characterized green propolis extract. Clinical data of animals, size of the scar area, the presence of moisture and secretion in the surgical wound, the humoral immune response against the bacterium and the susceptibility of C. pseudotuberculosis clinical isolates to the green propolis extract were analyzed. The green propolis-treated group presented complete healing of the surgical wound 1 week before the iodine-treated group. Additionally, animals treated with the green propolis ointment had fewer cases of wound secretion, but it was not statistically different from the iodine-treated group. No clinical signs indicating green propolis toxicity or other side effects were found, associated with a faster and more organized hair recovery by propolis use. The green propolis extract was able to inhibit the growth of 23 from the 27 C. pseudotuberculosis clinical isolates, with minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericide concentrations ranging from 01 to 08 mg/mL, and did not interfere with the humoral immune response against the bacterium. In addition, green propolis was able to inhibit biofilm formation by four of the C. pseudotuberculosis clinical isolates. We concluded that green propolis is a promising therapeutic agent to be used in the post-surgical treatment of caseous lymphadenitis in small ruminants due to its effects on surgical wound healing, hair recovery, inhibition of wound contamination and bacterial growth.","authors":[{"name":"Mauricio Alcântara Kalil"},{"name":"Laerte Marlon Santos"},{"name":"Thiago Doria Barral"},{"name":"Daniela Méria Rodrigues"},{"name":"Neila Paula Pereira"},{"name":"Maria da Conceição Aquino Sá"},{"name":"Marcelo Andres Umsza-Guez"},{"name":"Bruna Aparecida Souza Machado"},{"name":"Roberto Meyer"},{"name":"Ricardo Wagner Portela"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis"},{"word":"anti-microbials"},{"word":"natural products"},{"word":"sheep"},{"word":"wound healing"}]},"article339":{"pmid":"31850313","title":"Bacterial Biofilm Eradication Agents: A Current Review.","date":"2019-12-20","abs":"Most free-living bacteria can attach to surfaces and aggregate to grow into multicellular communities encased in extracellular polymeric substances called biofilms. Biofilms are recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy and a major cause of persistent and recurrent infections by clinically important pathogens worldwide (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus). Currently, most biofilm remediation strategies involve the development of biofilm-inhibition agents, aimed at preventing the early stages of biofilm formation, or biofilm-dispersal agents, aimed at disrupting the biofilm cell community. While both strategies offer some clinical promise, neither represents a direct treatment and eradication strategy for established biofilms. Consequently, the discovery and development of biofilm eradication agents as comprehensive, stand-alone biofilm treatment options has become a fundamental area of research. Here we review our current understanding of biofilm antibiotic tolerance mechanisms and provide an overview of biofilm remediation strategies, focusing primarily on the most promising biofilm eradication agents and approaches. Many of these offer exciting prospects for the future of biofilm therapeutics for a large number of infections that are currently refractory to conventional antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Anthony D Verderosa"},{"name":"Makrina Totsika"},{"name":"Kathryn E Fairfull-Smith"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"biofilm eradication agent"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"resistance"}]},"article340":{"pmid":"31849923","title":"Anticandidal Activity of Kalopanaxsaponin A: Effect on Proliferation, Cell Morphology, and Key Virulence Attributes of Candida albicans.","date":"2019-12-20","abs":"The pathogenicity of Candida albicans is attributed to various virulence factors including adhesion to the surface of epithelial cells or mucosa, germ tube formation, hyphal morphogenesis, development of drug resistant biofilms, and so on.

Furthermore, C. auris is prone to cause outbreaks, especially since it can persist for weeks in a nosocomial environment and survive high-end disinfection procedures. In this review, we describe the molecular resistance mechanisms to antifungal drugs identified so far in C. auris and compare them to those previously discovered in other Candida species.

We hypothesize that OS levels in wound tissues are critical for chronic wound initiation and development. We show that increased OS levels in the wound correlate with increased chronicity. Moreover, without increased OS levels, biofilm taken from chronic wounds and placed in new excision wounds do not create chronic wounds. Similarly, high OS levels in the wound tissue in the absence of the skin microbiome do not lead to chronic wounds. These findings show that both high OS levels and bacteria are needed for chronic wound initiation and development.

Due to this antimicrobial activity, SCFAs have promising applications in human health and food safety. In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of four SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, and valeric acid) in Salmonella strains isolated from poultry were determined. The effect of subinhibitory concentrations of SCFAs in Salmonella biofilm formation, motility, and gene expression was also evaluated. Butyric acid, propionic acid, and valeric acid showed a MIC of 3750 µg/mL in all strains tested, while the MIC of acetic acid was between 1875 and 3750 µg/mL. Subinhibitory concentrations of SCFAs significantly (p< 0.05) reduced the motility of all Salmonella strains, especially in the presence of acetic acid.

Salmonella Typhimurium T7 showed significant (p < 0.05) upregulation of important virulence genes, such as invA and hilA, especially in the presence of butyric acid.

Although many studies have reported on plant drought tolerance achieved via genetic modification, application of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to achieve tolerance has rarely been studied. In this study, the ability of three isolates, including Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 54, from 30 potential PGPR to induce drought tolerance in tomato plants was examined via greenhouse screening. The results indicated that B. amyloliquefaciens 54 significantly enhanced drought tolerance by increasing survival rate, relative water content and root vigor. Coordinated changes were also observed in cellular defense responses, including decreased concentration of malondialdehyde and elevated concentration of antioxidant enzyme activities. Moreover, expression levels of stress-responsive genes, such as lea, tdi65, and ltpg2, increased in B. amyloliquefaciens 54-treated plants. In addition, B. amyloliquefaciens 54 induced stomatal closure through an abscisic acid-regulated pathway. Furthermore, we constructed biofilm formation mutants and determined the role of biofilm formation in B. amyloliquefaciens 54-induced drought tolerance. The results showed that biofilm-forming ability was positively correlated with plant root colonization. Moreover, plants inoculated with hyper-robust biofilm (ΔabrB and ΔywcC) mutants were better able to resist drought stress, while defective biofilm (ΔepsA-O and ΔtasA) mutants were more vulnerable to drought stress. Taken altogether, these results suggest that biofilm formation is crucial to B. amyloliquefaciens 54 root colonization and drought tolerance in tomato plants.","authors":[{"name":"Da-Cheng Wang"},{"name":"Chun-Hao Jiang"},{"name":"Li-Na Zhang"},{"name":"Lin Chen"},{"name":"Xiao-Yun Zhang"},{"name":"Jian-Hua Guo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus amyloliquefaciens"},{"word":"abscisic acid"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"drought tolerance"},{"word":"stomatal aperture"}]},"article384":{"pmid":"31842276","title":"Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Polymerized Oxazoline-Based Thin Films-Antibacterial Properties and Cytocompatibility Performance.","date":"2020-01-26","abs":"Polyoxazolines are a new promising class of polymers for biomedical applications.

Here, the effects of aquifer recharge (AR) on three levels of parameters were investigated: dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quantity and quality, global biofilm characteristics, and diversity changes of bacterial communities. As DOC enrichment by AR can be mitigated by vadose zone (VZ) thickness, three AR sites with thin VZ (< 3 m) and three sites with thick VZ (> 10 m) were selected. For each AR site, clay beads were incubated over a 10-day-long rainy period through wells in recharged and non-recharged groundwaters. Total proteins, dehydrogenase, and hydrolytic activities were monitored from clay beads to assess biofilm development. Bacterial richness on beads was estimated by 16S rRNA-based metabarcoding. AR was found to significantly increase DOC and biodegradable DOC (BDOC) concentrations, biofilm development, and bacterial richness especially in sites with thin VZ. VZ thickness was inversely related to microbial growth indicators and bacterial richness in groundwater, through a control of DOC availability. The proportion of Bacteroidetes 16S rRNA gene reads was higher in recharged groundwater than in non-recharged groundwater, suggesting that this phylum could be used as an indicator of DOC enrichment associated with AR. Quantitative PCR assays for Bacteroides DNA confirmed these trends and showed an enrichment of this bacterial group in DOC-rich aquifer waters. The positive linear relationships between BDOC concentrations and biofilm variables highlighted a strong C-limitation of groundwater impacting bacterial species sorting and activity.","authors":[{"name":"Jérémy Voisin"},{"name":"Benoit Cournoyer"},{"name":"Laurence Marjolet"},{"name":"Antonin Vienney"},{"name":"Florian Mermillod-Blondin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aquifer 16S rRNA metabarcoding profiling"},{"word":"Clay bead biofilms bacterial communities"},{"word":"Nutrient-driven diversity changes"},{"word":"Stormwater infiltration"},{"word":"Vadose zone thickness"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"31838458","title":"Electron donor availability controls scale up of anodic biofilms.","date":"2020-02-06","abs":"The scale up of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) is a challenging problem that limits the advancement and practical implementation of the technology.

After the on-site investigation, the effect of MCs on the horizontal transfer of ARGs was studied under laboratory conditions, and mechanisms explored at both cellular and molecular levels. MCs could promote the spread of ARGs, especially in relatively stationary and stable environments such as biofilms. MC-LR was the most efficient microcystin subtype promoting conjugative transfer, which was 25.13 times higher than for the control group. MCs affected the horizontal transfer of ARGs by regulating a series of gene systems involved in conjugative transfer, stimulating the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increasing cell membrane permeability. This study can provide a theoretical basis for the control of ARGs and MCs in DWTPs, which is of great significance for the scientific assessment of drinking water safety.","authors":[{"name":"Lan Xu"},{"name":"Zhenchao Zhou"},{"name":"Lin Zhu"},{"name":"Yue Han"},{"name":"Zejun Lin"},{"name":"Wanqiu Feng"},{"name":"Yang Liu"},{"name":"Xinyi Shuai"},{"name":"Hong Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance genes"},{"word":"Drinking water"},{"word":"Horizontal transfer"},{"word":"Microcystins"},{"word":"Molecular mechanism"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"31838364","title":"Modeling cell aggregate morphology during aerobic granulation in activated sludge processes reveals the combined effect of substrate and shear.","date":"2020-01-16","abs":"Past research on AGS (aerobic granular sludge technology) has mainly focused on macro-environment factors, such as settling time, feeding pattern, OLR (organic loading rate), SRT (sludge retention time), among others, and their effects on the granulation process. The biomass granulation process, however, is significantly affected by the micro-environment surrounding these biomass aggregates. In this research, an in silico computational approach was adopted to study the impact of the micro-environment on the biomass granulation process. A 2-D biofilm model based on the cellular automata algorithm and computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate the development of an individual biomass aggregate under specific hydrodynamic and substrate availability conditions. The simulation results indicated that shear and bulk substrate concentration combined to create the optimal conditions for aerobic granule formation. This process can be characterized by the RT (reversed Thiele) modulus value, which is the ratio of the maximum substrate transport over the maximum substrate reaction rate and an indicator of substrate availability. For AGS formation, the RT value should be greater than 0.1. Many common strategies, such as the application of batch reactors, selection for slow-growing microorganism, F/M (food/mass) ratio adjustment, feast and famine condition, and short settling time, for biomass granulation production can be explained by the RT value.
