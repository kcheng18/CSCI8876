In particular, hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, co-aggregation, and biofilm formation were investigated. In addition, antibiotic susceptibility, co-culture, and antimicrobial activity of the two strains were compared. Hydrophobicity was evaluated using xylene and toluene, showing that A. muciniphila DSM 22959 possessed moderate hydrophobicity. A. muciniphila showed a faster and higher auto-aggregation ability than Lb. rhamnosus GG, but a lower aptitude in biofilm formation. In the co-aggregation test, the best performance was obtained by Lb. rhamnosus GG. Regarding the susceptibility to antibiotics, the differences between the two strains were remarkable, with A. muciniphila DSM 22959 showing resistance to half of the antibiotic tested. Interesting results were also obtained with regard to the stimulating effect of Lb. rhamnosus GG on the growth of A. muciniphila when co-cultured.","authors":[{"name":"Autilia Cozzolino"},{"name":"Franca Vergalito"},{"name":"Patrizio Tremonte"},{"name":"Massimo Iorizzo"},{"name":"Silvia J Lombardi"},{"name":"Elena Sorrentino"},{"name":"Delia Luongo"},{"name":"Raffaele Coppola"},{"name":"Roberto Di Marco"},{"name":"Mariantonietta Succi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Akkermansia muciniphila"},{"word":"Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG"},{"word":"auto-aggregation"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"co-aggregation"},{"word":"co-culture"},{"word":"hydrophobicity"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"32019036","title":"Poised potential is not an effective strategy to enhance bio-electrochemical denitrification under cyclic substrate limitations.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"Bio-electrochemical denitrification (BED) is a promising organic carbon-free nitrate remediation technology.

Reduced stream discharge caused by the strengthened intermittency and increased duration of the dry phase is a spreading global response to changes in climate. Here, the impacts of a 5-month desiccation, one-week rewetting and punctual storms, which interrupted the dry period, were examined. The genomic composition of total (DNA) and active (RNA) diversity, and the community level physiological profiles (CLPP) were considered as proxies for functional diversity to describe both prokaryotes and eukaryotes inhabiting the surface and hyporheic streambeds. Comparisons between the genomic and potential functional responses helped to understand how and whether the microbial diversity was sensitive to the environmental conditions and resource acquisition, such as water stress and extracellular enzyme activities, respectively. RNA expression showed the strongest relationship with the environmental conditions and resource acquisition, being more responsive to changing conditions compared to DNA diversity, especially in the case of prokaryotes. The DNA results presumably reflected the legacy of the treatments because inactive, dormant, or dead cells were included, suggesting a slow microbial biomass turnover or responses of the microbial communities to changes mainly through physiological acclimation. On the other hand, microbial functional diversity was largely explained by resources acquisition, such as metrics of extracellular enzymes, and appeared vulnerable to the hydrological changes and duration of desiccation. The data highlight the need to improve the functional assessment of stream ecosystems with the application of complementary metrics to better describe the streambed microbial dynamics under dry-rewet stress.","authors":[{"name":"G Gionchetta"},{"name":"F Oliva"},{"name":"A M Romaní"},{"name":"L Bañeras"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNA-RNA Illumina sequencing"},{"word":"Functional microbial diversity"},{"word":"Streambed biofilms"},{"word":"Water stress"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"32018962","title":"Biodegradable organic matter-containing ammonium wastewater treatment through simultaneous partial nitritation, anammox, denitrification and COD oxidization process.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"For both nitrogen and COD removal from biodegradable organic matter (BOM)-containing ammonium wastewater, the simultaneous partial nitritation, anammox, denitrification and COD oxidization (SNADCO) process is a promising solution.

A functionalized polyurethane (PU, a widely used biomedical material for hernia repairing) surface (PU-Au-PEG) with inherent antifouling and photothermal bactericidal properties was readily prepared based on a near-infrared (NIR)-responsive organic/inorganic hybrid coating which consists of gold nanorods (Au NRs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The PU-Au-PEG showed a high efficiency to resist adhesion of bacteria and exhibited effective photothermal bactericidal properties under 808 nm NIR irradiation, especially against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, the PU-Au-PEG could inhibit biofilm formation long term. The biocompatibility of PU-Au-PEG was also proved by cytotoxicity and hemolysis tests. The in vivo photothermal antibacterial properties were first verified by a subcutaneous implantation animal model.

We developed a portable, easy to use, low-frequency electric sonicator and evaluated its performance for a range of well depths (tested up to 42 m below ground level) and casing types. Three sonicators were characterized in laboratory experiments using a 1 m long tank filled with pea gravel.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of phenothiazines (promethazine and chlorpromazine) on C. neoformans/C. gattii planktonic cells and biofilms. In vitro planktonic susceptibility testing was performed using the broth microdilution assay. The effect of phenothiazines was evaluated against biofilm formation and mature Cryptococcus biofilms.

Promethazine and chlorpromazine showed antifungal activity against planktonic cells, with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 8-32 μg/ml and 4-16 μg/ml, respectively. As for biofilm formation, phenothiazines reduced biomass by 60% and metabolic activity by 90% at 64 μg/ml; while in mature biofilms, reductions of 85% and 90% in biomass and metabolic activity, respectively, were observed at 1024 μg/ml.

Biochemical analysis of the clinical isolate SA564, which aggregates when deficient for CodY, revealed that these features are sensitive to nuclease treatment and are resistant to protease exposure. Genetic analyses revealed that disrupting lgt (the diacylglycerol transferase gene) in codY mutant cells severely weakened aggregation, indicating a role for lipoproteins in the attachment of the biofilm matrix to the cell surface. An additional and critical role of IcaB in producing functional poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PIA) polysaccharide in extracellular DNA (eDNA)-dependent biofilm formation was shown. Moreover, overproducing PIA is sufficient to promote aggregation in a DNA-dependent manner regardless of source of nucleic acids. Taken together, our results point to PIA synthesis as the primary determinant of biofilm formation when CodY activity is reduced and suggest a modified electrostatic net model for matrix attachment whereby PIA associates with eDNA, which interacts with the cell surface via covalently attached membrane lipoproteins.

Most scientific studies have examined the distribution, ingestion, fate, behavior, amount, and effect of MPs. However, few studies have described the development of methods for the removal and remediation of MPs. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the recent literature regarding the microbial-mediated degradation of MPs and discuss the associated degradation characteristics and mechanisms. Different types and combinations of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, bacterial consortia, and biofilms, that can degrade different MPs are categorized. This article summarizes approximately 50 recent papers. Twelve and 6 papers reported that bacteria and fungi, respectively, can degrade MPs. Nine articles indicated that bacterial consortia have the ability to degrade MPs, and 6 articles found that biofilms can also utilize MPs. Furthermore, to evaluate their associated degradation effects, the corresponding structural changes (i.e., macro size, surface morphology, and functional groups) in MPs after microbial degradation are examined. In addition, MP biodegradation is affected by microbial characteristics and environmental factors; therefore, the environmental factors (i.e., temperature, pH and strain activity) influencing MP degradation and the associated degradation effects (i.e., weight loss, degradation rate, and molecular weight change) are generalized. Furthermore, the mechanisms associated with the microbial-mediated degradation of MPs are briefly discussed. Finally, prospects for the degradation of MPs using microbes and future research directions are envisioned. This review provides the first systematic summary of the microbial-mediated degradation of MPs and provides a reference for future studies investigating effective means of MP pollution control.","authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Yuan"},{"name":"Jie Ma"},{"name":"Yiran Sun"},{"name":"Tao Zhou"},{"name":"Youcai Zhao"},{"name":"Fei Yu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Degradation behavior"},{"word":"Degradation mechanism"},{"word":"Microorganism"},{"word":"Microplastics"}]},"article22":{"pmid":"32014762","title":"Biodiversity of organisms inhabiting the water supply network of Wroclaw.

The transport and retention behavior of GONPs was studied in columns in the presence of MS2 -as a nano-sized- and Escherichia coli (E.coli) -as a micro-sized- microorganisms at low and high ionic strength conditions. Results showed no changes in GONPs transport and retention at high ionic strength in the presence of MS2 or E. coli, which was attributed to the effect of high concentration of divalent cation on aggregation of nanoparticles and microorganisms. Furthermore, simultaneous enhanced transport and decreased retention of GONPs in column was observed in the co-presence of microorganisms at low ionic strength. Results revealed that the main mechanism governing increasing GONPs transport in porous media was occupation of reactive surface sites of collectors by microorganisms, which prevented attachment of nanoparticles. The pre-saturation of columns with MS2 and E. coli caused increasing transport of GONPs in the columns, due to the occupation of surface reactive sites. Moreover, conditioning limestone collectors with natural biofilm resulted in the same rates of nanoparticle elution and retention (i.e., in the presence or absence of microorganisms) by straining of GONPs in the inlet end of columns which shows that the biofilm acts as a bio-filter against discharging nanoparticles into the effluents. Finally, from the obtained results, it can be postulated that the presence of microorganisms in a MAR site causes risk of groundwater pollution by toxic nanoparticles.","authors":[{"name":"Amirhosein Ramazanpour Esfahani"},{"name":"Okke Batelaan"},{"name":"John L Hutson"},{"name":"Howard J Fallowfield"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Breakthrough curve"},{"word":"Graphene oxide"},{"word":"Limestone"},{"word":"Retention profile"}]},"article25":{"pmid":"32014453","title":"Antimicrobial and ultrastructural properties of root canal filling materials exposed to bacterial challenge.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Chemo-mechanical preparation of the root canal leaves behind viable bacteria which can lead to treatment failure.

Our study aims to delineate the role of ClpB, a heat shock protein of Hsp100 family, in the general stress response and persistence mechanisms of Mtb. We demonstrate that Mtb requires ClpB to survive under stressful conditions. Additionally, we show that ClpB is necessary for the bacteria to persist in latency-like conditions such as prolonged hypoxia and nutrient-starvation. The disruption of ClpB results in aberrant cellular morphology, impaired biofilm formation and reduced infectivity of Mtb ex vivo. Our study also reports an alternative role of ClpB as a chaperokine which elicits inflammatory response in host. We conclude that ClpB is essential for Mtb to survive within macrophages, and plays a crucial part in the maintenance of dormant Mtb bacilli in latent state.

Here, we cloned 16 genes from P. aeruginosa PAO1 that are predicted to encode diguanylate cyclases (DGCs, responsible for c-di-GMP biosynthesis) and constructed their corresponding in-frame deletion mutants. We evaluated the methods to measure the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration by using deletion mutants and PAO1 strains containing a plasmid expressing one of the 16 genes, respectively. Functional outputs of all PAO1-derived stains were also detected and evaluated, including biofilm formation, production of exopolysaccharide, swimming and swarming motilities. Our data showed that measuring the c-di-GMP level only characterized a few DGC by using either pCdrA::gfp as a reporter or LC/MS/MS.

Gingivitis is triggered by the infection of the periodontal tissues with periodontal disease-causing pathogens present in the dental biofilm. This is accompanied by weak inflammatory immune reactions in the gingiva. In periodontitis, prolonged and excessive inflammation results in the destruction of gingival connective tissue and in the resorption of alveolar bone, leading to tooth loss. There are a number of clinical reports showing the effectiveness of both herbal extracts and polyphenols on periodontal diseases when applied as a mouthwash or dentifrice into the oral cavity. However, to date, at least to the best of our knowledge, there is no clinical report available on the therapeutic effects of garlic or its extract on periodontal diseases, apart from a recent study, which reported that the intake of aged garlic extract (AGE) containing various pharmacologically active sulfur compounds, alleviated the symptoms of gingivitis clinically. The finding suggests that AGE may be a promising candidate for use in the treatment of periodontal diseases, although additional clinical trials are warranted to confirm this. In addition, further studies are required for the clarification of the basic molecular mechanisms through which AGE attenuates gingivitis. In this review, we summarize the beneficial effects of several natural compounds on periodontal disease and describe the possible applications of garlic ingredients in detail.","authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Ohtani"},{"name":"Tsubasa Nishimura"}],"keywords":[{"word":"garlic"},{"word":"herb"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"natural product"},{"word":"periodontal disease"},{"word":"polyphenol"}]},"article46":{"pmid":"32010298","title":"Effects of isosorbide mononitrate loaded nanoparticles conjugated with anti-Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin on Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is associated with recalcitrant chronic infection, especially in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Anti-S. aureus α-toxin antibody coupled immunoliposomes were generated. The effect of ISMN immunoliposomes on S. aureus biofilm formation and their anti-biofilm efficacy were examined using the crystal violet method and confocal laser scanning microscopy, respectively.

The biofilm formation inhibitory effect on all concentrations of ISMN immunoliposomes was stronger than that of ISMN liposomes and free ISMN (P<0.05). At concentrations of 45 and 23 mg/ml, the inhibitory effect of ISMN liposomes was stronger than that of free ISMN (P<0.05), while at 11 mg/ml, the inhibitory effect of ISMN liposomes was the same as that of ISMN (P>0.05).

They display a complex life cycle: vegetatively growing cells coordinate their motility to form multicellular swarms, which upon starvation aggregate into large fruiting bodies where cells differentiate into spores. In addition to growing as saprophytes, Myxobacteria are predators that actively kill bacteria of other species to consume their biomass. In this review, we summarize research on the predation behavior of the model myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus, which can access nutrients from a broad spectrum of microorganisms. M. xanthus displays an epibiotic predation strategy, i.e., it induces prey lysis from the outside and feeds on the released biomass. This predatory behavior encompasses various processes: Gliding motility and induced cell reversals allow M. xanthus to encounter prey and to remain within the area to sweep up its biomass, which causes the characteristic rippling of preying populations. Antibiotics and secreted bacteriolytic enzymes appear to be important predation factors, which are possibly targeted to prey cells with the aid of outer membrane vesicles. However, certain bacteria protect themselves from M. xanthus predation by forming mechanical barriers, such as biofilms and mucoid colonies, or by secreting antibiotics. Further understanding the molecular mechanisms that mediate myxobacterial predation will offer fascinating insight into the reciprocal relationships of bacteria in complex communities, and might spur application-oriented research on the development of novel antibacterial strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Susanne Thiery"},{"name":"Christine Kaimer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial soil communities"},{"word":"gliding motility"},{"word":"myxovirescin"},{"word":"outer membrane vesicle"},{"word":"protein secretion system"}]},"article48":{"pmid":"32010117","title":"Quorum Sensing-Independent Cellulase-Sensitive Pellicle Formation Is Critical for Colonization of Burkholderia glumae in Rice Plants.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Bacteria form biofilms as a means to adapt to environmental changes for survival. Pellicle is a floating biofilm formed at the air-liquid interface in static culture conditions; however, its functional roles have received relatively little attention compared to solid surface-associated biofilms in gram-negative bacteria. Here we show that the rice pathogen Burkholderia glumae BGR1 forms cellulase-sensitive pellicles in a bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP)- and flagellum-dependent, but quorum sensing (QS)-independent, manner. Pellicle formation was more favorable at 28°C than at the optimum growth temperature (37°C), and was facilitated by constitutive expression of pelI, a diguanylate cyclase gene from B. glumae, or pleD, the GGDEF response regulator from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Constitutive expression of pelI or pleD raised the levels of c-di-GMP, facilitated pellicle formation, and suppressed swarming motility in B. glumae. QS-defective mutants of B. glumae formed pellicles, while flagellum-defective mutants did not. Pellicles of B. glumae were sensitive to cellulase but not to proteinase K or DNase I. A gene cluster containing seven genes involved in bacterial cellulose biosynthesis, bcsD, bcsR, bcsQ, bcsA, bcsB, bcsZ, and bcsC, homologous to known genes involved in cellulose biosynthesis in other bacteria, was identified in B. glumae. Mutations in each gene abolished pellicle formation. These results revealed a positive correlation between cellulase-sensitive pellicles and putative cellulose biosynthetic genes. Pellicle-defective mutants did not colonize as successfully as the wild-type strain BGR1 in rice plants, which resulted in a significant reduction in virulence. Our findings show that cellulase-sensitive pellicles produced in a QS-independent manner play important roles in the interactions between rice plants and B. glumae.","authors":[{"name":"Gi-Young Kwak"},{"name":"Okhee Choi"},{"name":"Eunhye Goo"},{"name":"Yongsung Kang"},{"name":"Jinwoo Kim"},{"name":"Ingyu Hwang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia glumae"},{"word":"cellulose biosynthesis"},{"word":"colonization"},{"word":"panicle blight"},{"word":"pellicle"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article49":{"pmid":"32010115","title":"COL","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) and Extensively Drug Resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) represent a serious cause of healthcare-associated infections worldwide.

The pathogenic marine bacterium Vibrio vulnificus forms biofilms and colonizes environmental niches such as oysters. The cabABC operon encodes an extracellular matrix protein CabA and the corresponding type I secretion system, which are essential for biofilm and rugose colony development of V. vulnificus. In this study, molecular biological analyses revealed the roles of three transcriptional regulators BrpR, BrpT, and BrpS in the regulatory pathway for the cabABC operon. BrpR induces brpT and BrpT in turn activates the cabABC operon in a sequential cascade, contributing to development of robust biofilm structures. BrpT also activates brpS, but BrpS represses brpT, constituting a negative feedback loop that stabilizes brpT expression. BrpT and BrpS directly bind to specific sequences upstream of cabA, and they constitute a feedforward loop in which BrpT induces brpS and together with BrpS activates cabABC, leading to precise regulation of cabABC expression. Accordingly, BrpS as well as BrpT plays a crucial role in complete development of rugose colonies. This elaborate network of three transcriptional regulators BrpR, BrpT, and BrpS thus tightly controls cabABC regulation, and contributes to successful development of robust biofilms and rugose colonies in V. vulnificus.","authors":[{"name":"Seung-Ho Hwang"},{"name":"Jin Hwan Park"},{"name":"Byungho Lee"},{"name":"Sang Ho Choi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio vulnificus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"colony morphology"},{"word":"extracellular matrix protein"},{"word":"transcriptional regulator"}]},"article51":{"pmid":"32010108","title":"Oxidative Stress Induced by Metal Ions in Bioleaching of LiCoO","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"An acidophilic microbial consortium (AMC) was used to investigate the fundamental mechanism behind the adverse effects of pulp density increase in the bioleaching of waste lithium ion batteries (WLIBs).

These microorganisms together with their host form a biological unit known as holobiont. Recent studies have revealed that the holobiont of agaves and cacti comprises a diverse and structured microbiome, which might be important for its adaptation to drylands. Here, we investigated the functional signatures of the prokaryotic communities of the soil and the episphere, that includes the rhizosphere and phyllosphere, associated with the cultivated Agave tequilana and the native and sympatric Agave salmiana, Opuntia robusta and Myrtillocactus geometrizans by mining shotgun metagenomic data. Consistent with previous phylogenetic profiling, we found that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the main represented phyla in the episphere of agaves and cacti, and that clustering of metagenomes correlated with the plant compartment. In native plants, genes related to aerobic anoxygenic phototrophy and photosynthesis were enriched in the phyllosphere and soil, while genes coding for biofilm formation and quorum sensing were enriched in both epiphytic communities. In the episphere of cultivated A. tequilana fewer genes were identified, but they belonged to similar pathways than those found in native plants. A. tequilana showed a depletion in several genes belonging to carbon metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation suggesting that its lower microbial diversity might be linked to functional losses. However, this species also showed an enrichment in biofilm and quorum sensing in the epiphytic compartments, and evidence for nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere. Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic markers were represented by Rhizobiales (Methylobacterium) and Rhodospirillales (Belnapia) in the phyllosphere, while photosystem genes were widespread in Bacillales and Cyanobacteria. Nitrogen fixation and biofilm formation genes were mostly related to Proteobacteria. These analyses support the idea of niche differentiation in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere of agaves and cacti and shed light on the potential mechanisms by which epiphytic microbial communities survive and colonize plants of arid and semiarid ecosystems.

These structures can be recognized by a variety of glycan-binding proteins, playing an important role in the bacteria cross-talk with the host and invading bacteriophages, and also in the formation of bacterial microcolonies and biofilms. In recent years, different microarray approaches for exploring bacterial surface glycans and their recognition by proteins have been developed. A main advantage of the microarray format is the inherent miniaturization of the method, which allows sensitive and high-throughput analyses with very small amounts of sample. Antibody and lectin microarrays have been used for examining bacterial glycosignatures, enabling bacteria identification and differentiation among strains. In addition, microarrays incorporating bacterial carbohydrate structures have served to evaluate their recognition by diverse host/phage/bacterial glycan-binding proteins, such as lectins, effectors of the immune system, or bacterial and phagic cell wall lysins, and to identify antigenic determinants for vaccine development. The list of samples printed in the arrays includes polysaccharides, lipopoly/lipooligosaccharides, (lipo)teichoic acids, and peptidoglycans, as well as sequence-defined oligosaccharide fragments.

The results also showed that S. aureus from subclinical bovine mastitis cases in southern Xinjiang, China, were mainly resistant to β-lactams, erythromycin, and clindamycin. Also, biofilm- and adhesion-related genes, which are increasingly known as important virulence factors in the pathogenesis of S. aureus infections, were detected at a high rate.

They exhibit highly complex dynamics due to the interactions between the bacteria and the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), water, and nutrients and minerals that make up the biofilm. We present a hybrid computational model in which the dynamics of discrete bacterial cells are simulated within a multiphase continuum, consisting of EPS and water as separate interacting phases, through which nutrients and minerals diffuse. Bacterial cells in our model consume water and nutrients in order to grow, divide, and produce EPS. Consequently, EPS flows outward from the bacterial colony, while water flows inward. The model predicts bacterial colony formation as a treelike structure. The distribution of bacterial growth and EPS production is found to be sensitive to the pore spacing between bacteria and the consumption of nutrients within the bacterial colony. Forces that are sometimes neglected in biofilm simulations, such as lubrication force between nearby bacterial cells and osmotic (swelling) pressure force resulting from gradients in EPS concentration, are observed to have an important effect on biofilm growth via their influence on bacteria pore spacing and associated water/nutrient percolation into the bacterial colony.","authors":[{"name":"Xing Jin"},{"name":"Jeffrey S Marshall"},{"name":"Matthew J Wargo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Agent-based model"},{"word":"Bacterial modeling"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Individual-based model"}]},"article65":{"pmid":"32008087","title":"Endosymbiosis before eukaryotes: mitochondrial establishment in protoeukaryotes.","date":"2020-02-02","abs":"Endosymbiosis and organellogenesis are virtually unknown among prokaryotes. The single presumed example is the endosymbiogenetic origin of mitochondria, which is hidden behind the event horizon of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. While eukaryotes are monophyletic, it is unlikely that during billions of years, there were no other prokaryote-prokaryote endosymbioses as symbiosis is extremely common among prokaryotes, e.g., in biofilms. Therefore, it is even more precarious to draw conclusions about potentially existing (or once existing) prokaryotic endosymbioses based on a single example. It is yet unknown if the bacterial endosymbiont was captured by a prokaryote or by a (proto-)eukaryote, and if the process of internalization was parasitic infection, slow engulfment, or phagocytosis. In this review, we accordingly explore multiple mechanisms and processes that could drive the evolution of unicellular microbial symbioses with a special attention to prokaryote-prokaryote interactions and to the mitochondrion, possibly the single prokaryotic endosymbiosis that turned out to be a major evolutionary transition. We investigate the ecology and evolutionary stability of inter-species microbial interactions based on dependence, physical proximity, cost-benefit budget, and the types of benefits, investments, and controls. We identify challenges that had to be conquered for the mitochondrial host to establish a stable eukaryotic lineage. Any assumption about the initial interaction of the mitochondrial ancestor and its contemporary host based solely on their modern relationship is rather perilous. As a result, we warn against assuming an initial mutually beneficial interaction based on modern mitochondria-host cooperation. This assumption is twice fallacious: (i) endosymbioses are known to evolve from exploitative interactions and (ii) cooperativity does not necessarily lead to stable mutualism. We point out that the lack of evidence so far on the evolution of endosymbiosis from mutual syntrophy supports the idea that mitochondria emerged from an exploitative (parasitic or phagotrophic) interaction rather than from syntrophy.","authors":[{"name":"István Zachar"},{"name":"Gergely Boza"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Endosymbiosis"},{"word":"Eukaryogenesis"},{"word":"Mitochondria"},{"word":"Mutualism"},{"word":"Prokaryotes"}]},"article66":{"pmid":"32007899","title":"Characterization and co-occurrence of microbial community in epiphytic biofilms and surface sediments of wetlands with submersed macrophytes.","date":"2020-03-03","abs":"Microbes in epiphytic biofilms and surface sediments play crucial roles in the biogeochemical cycles in wetlands.

Additional novel antibiofilm strategies to eliminate C. albicans biofilm infections are needed. This study aims to improve the efficacy of a widely used azole, fluconazole by co-delivering it with a Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing molecule (QSM), N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C12AHL) in a liposomal formulation. C12AHL is known to inhibit C. albicans' morphological transition and biofilm formation. Four different formulations of liposomes with fluconazole (L-F), with C12AHL (L-H), with fluconazole and C12AHL (L-HF), and a drug-free control (L-C) were prepared using a thin-film hydration followed by extrusion method, and characterised. The effect of liposomes on colonising (90 min-24 h) and preformed (24 h) C. albicans biofilms were assessed using a standard biofilm assay. Biofilm viability (XTT reduction assay), biomass (Safranin-O staining) and architecture (confocal laser scanning microscopy, CLSM) were determined. Similar efficiencies of fluconazole entrapment were noticed in L-HF and L-F (11.74% vs 10.2%), however, L-HF released greater quantities of fluconazole compared to L-F during 24 h (4.27% vs 0.97%, P < 0.05). The entrapment and release of C12AHL was similar for L-H and L-HF liposomes (33.3% vs 33% and 88.9% vs 92.3% respectively). L-HF treated colonising, and preformed biofilms exhibited >80%, and 60% reduction in their respective viabilities at a fluconazole concentration as low as 5.5 µg/mL compared to 12% and 36%, respective reductions observed in L-F treated biofilms (P < 0.05). CLSM confirmed biofilm disruption, lack of hyphae, and reduction in biomass when treated with L-HF compared to other liposomal preparations. Liposomal co-delivery of C12AHL and fluconazole appears to suppress C. albicans biofilms through efficacious disruption of the biofilm, killing of constituent yeasts, and diminishing their virulence at a significantly lower antifungal dose. Therefore, liposomal co-formulation of C12AHL and fluconazole appears to be a promising approach to improve the efficacy of this common triazole against biofilm-mediated candidal infections.","authors":[{"name":"H M H N Bandara"},{"name":"A K Hewavitharana"},{"name":"P N Shaw"},{"name":"H D C Smyth"},{"name":"L P Samaranayake"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungal resistance"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Fluconazole"},{"word":"Liposomes"},{"word":"N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone"}]},"article79":{"pmid":"32006577","title":"Structural elucidation and biological aptitude of modified hydroxyethylcellulose-polydimethyl siloxane based polyurethanes.","date":"2020-03-02","abs":"The main aim of this research work was to incorporate modified hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) into PDMS based polyurethanes.

Such transformations are often achieved by the concerted action of communities of interacting microbes, involving different species each performing specific tasks. These interactions can give rise to novel community-intrinsic properties, through e.g. activation of so-called silent genetic pathways or synergistic interplay between microbial activities and functions. Here we studied the microbial community-based degradation of keratin, a recalcitrant biological material, by four soil isolates, which have previously been shown to display synergistic interactions during biofilm formation; Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Xanthomonas retroflexus, Microbacterium oxydans and Paenibacillus amylolyticus. We observed enhanced keratin weight loss in cultures with X. retroflexus, both in dual and four-species co-cultures, as compared to expected keratin degradation by X. retroflexus alone. Additional community intrinsic properties included accelerated keratin degradation rates and increased biofilm formation on keratin particles. Comparison of secretome profiles of X. retroflexus mono-cultures to co-cultures revealed that certain proteases (e.g. serine protease S08) were significantly more abundant in mono-cultures, whereas co-cultures had an increased abundance of proteins related to maintaining the redox environment, e.g. glutathione peroxidase. Hence, one of the mechanisms related to the community intrinsic properties, leading to enhanced degradation from co-cultures, might be related to a switch from sulfitolytic to proteolytic functions between mono- and co-cultures, respectively.","authors":[{"name":"Poonam Nasipuri"},{"name":"Jakob Herschend"},{"name":"Asker D Brejnrod"},{"name":"Jonas S Madsen"},{"name":"Roall Espersen"},{"name":"Birte Svensson"},{"name":"Mette Burmølle"},{"name":"Samuel Jacquiod"},{"name":"Søren J Sørensen"}],"keywords":[]},"article89":{"pmid":"32003349","title":"Determination of Biofilm-Forming Capacity of Otopathogens Isolated from Discharging Ears in Children with Chronic Otitis Media.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Chronic otitis media is a common disease of the developing world with persistent ear discharge, leading to major complications.

Biofilms can become thick enough to be even observed by the naked eye, and biofilm formation is a tightly regulated process. Paracoccus denitrificans is a non-motile, Gram-negative bacterium that forms a very thin, unique biofilm. A key factor in the biofilm formed by this bacterium is a large surface protein named biofilm-associated protein A (BapA), which was recently reported to be regulated by cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (cyclic-di-GMP or c-di-GMP). Cyclic-di-GMP is a major second messenger involved in biofilm formation in many bacteria. Though cyclic-di-GMP is generally reported as a positive regulatory factor in biofilm formation, it represses biofilm formation in P. denitrificans. Furthermore, quorum sensing (QS) represses biofilm formation in this bacterium, which is also reported as a positive regulator of biofilm formation in most bacteria. The QS signal used in P. denitrificans is hydrophobic and is delivered through membrane vesicles. Studies on QS show that P. denitrificans can potentially form a thick biofilm but maintains a thin biofilm under normal growth conditions. In this review, we discuss the peculiarities of biofilm formation by P. denitrificans with the aim of deepening the overall understanding of bacterial biofilm formation and functions.","authors":[{"name":"Kana Morinaga"},{"name":"Keitaro Yoshida"},{"name":"Kohei Takahashi"},{"name":"Nobuhiko Nomura"},{"name":"Masanori Toyofuku"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BapA"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cyclic-di GMP"},{"word":"Membrane vesicle"},{"word":"Paracoccus denitrificans"},{"word":"Quorum-sensing"}]},"article91":{"pmid":"32002130","title":"Inhibitory and preventive effects of Lactobacillus plantarum FB-T9 on dental caries in rats.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Streptococcus mutans is recognized as the main cause of dental caries, and the formation of a plaque biofilm is required for caries development.

Subgingival plaque samples pooled from 5 healthy subjects and, separately, 5 subjects with periodontitis were used to inoculate a Calgary Biofilm Device containing saliva-conditioned, hydroxyapatite-coated pegs. Microbiomes were grown for 7 d on either nutrient-rich media-including a modification of SHI medium, brain-heart infusion (BHI) supplemented with hemin and vitamin K, and a blend of SHI and BHI, each at 3 sucrose concentrations (0%, 0.05% and 0.1%)-or nutrient-limited media (saliva with 5%, 10%, or 20% inactivated human serum). The microbiomes were assessed for biomass, viability, and 16S rRNA profiles. In addition to richness and diversity, a dysbiosis index was calculated as the ratio of the sum of relative abundances of disease-associated species to that of health-associated species. The supplemented BHI and blend of SHI and BHI resulted in the highest biomass, whereas saliva-serum maximized viability. Distinct groups of bacteria were enriched in the different media. Regardless of medium type, the periodontitis-derived microbiomes showed higher species richness and alpha diversity and clustered with their inoculum separate from the health-derived microbiomes. Microbiomes grown in saliva-serum showed the highest species richness and the highest similarity to the clinical inocula in both health and disease.

Antimicrobials can be loaded into nanocarriers to protect them against de-activation, and to reduce their toxicity and potential, harmful side-effects. Moreover, antimicrobial nanocarriers such as micelles, can be equipped with stealth and pH-responsive features that allow self-targeting and accumulation in infectious-biofilms at high concentrations. Micellar and liposomal nanocarriers differ in hydrophilicity of their outer-surface and inner-core. Micelles are self-assembled, spherical core-shell structures composed of single layers of surfactants, with hydrophilic head-groups and hydrophobic tail-groups pointing to the micellar core. Liposomes are composed of lipids, self-assembled into bilayers. The hydrophilic head of the lipids determines the surface properties of liposomes, while the hydrophobic tail, internal to the bilayer, determines the fluidity of liposomal-membranes. Therefore, whereas micelles can only be loaded with hydrophobic antimicrobials, hydrophilic antimicrobials can be encapsulated in the hydrophilic, aqueous core of liposomes and hydrophobic or amphiphilic antimicrobials can be inserted in the phospholipid bilayer. Nanotechnology-derived liposomes can be prepared with diameters <100-200 nm, required to prevent reticulo-endothelial rejection and allow penetration into infectious-biofilms. However, surface-functionalization of liposomes is considerably more difficult than of micelles, which explains while self-targeting, pH-responsive liposomes that find their way through the blood circulation toward infectious-biofilms are still challenging to prepare. Equally, development of liposomes that penetrate over the entire thickness of biofilms to provide deep killing of biofilm inhabitants still provides a challenge. The liposomal phospholipid bilayer easily fuses with bacterial cell membranes to release high antimicrobial-doses directly inside bacteria. Arguably, protection against de-activation of antibiotics in liposomal nanocarriers and their fusogenicity constitute the biggest advantage of liposomal antimicrobial carriers over antimicrobials free in solution. Many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains, resistant to specific antibiotics, have been demonstrated to be susceptible to these antibiotics when encapsulated in liposomal nanocarriers. Recently, also progress has been made concerning large-scale production and long-term storage of liposomes.

To mitigate these factors, it is important to have a clinically relevant model of burn wound infection that can be utilized for advancing burn wound treatments. Our previous reports have demonstrated the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to generate a biofilm infection within a modified Walker-Mason rat burn model of deep-partial (DPT) and full-thickness (FT) burn wounds (10% total body surface area) in male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-450 g). Here, we further define this model with respect to the host response when challenged with P. aeruginosa infection between the two burn types. Following burn injury and immediate surface exposure to P. aeruginosa, inflammation at the local and systemic levels were monitored for an 11 days period. Compared to burn-only groups, infection with P. aeruginosa further promoted local inflammation in both DPT and FT burn wounds, which was evident by enhanced cellular influx (including neutrophils and monocytes), increased levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, GRO/KC, andMIP-1α), and reduced IL-10. Systemically, only minor changes were seen in circulating white blood cells and cytokines; however, increases in high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) and hyaluronan, as well as decreases in fibronectin were noted particularly in FT burns. Compared to the burn-only group, P. aeruginosa infection resulted in sustained and/or higher levels of HMGB-1 and hyaluronan. Combined with our previous work that defined the burn depth and development of P. aeruginosa biofilms within the wound, this study further establishes this model by defining the host response to the burn and biofilm-infection. Furthermore, this characterization shows several similarities to what is clinically seen and establishes this model for future use in the development and testing of novel therapeutics for burn wound treatment at home and on the battlefield.","authors":[{"name":"Alan J Weaver"},{"name":"Kenneth S Brandenburg"},{"name":"Brian W Smith"},{"name":"Kai P Leung"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DAMPs"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"burn"},{"word":"cytokine"},{"word":"infection"}]},"article106":{"pmid":"31998658","title":"Corrigendum: Transcriptome, Phenotypic, and Virulence Analysis of Streptococcus sanguinis SK36 Wild Type and Its CcpA-Null Derivative (ΔCcpA).","date":"2020-02-10","abs":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2019.00411.].","authors":[{"name":"Yibo Bai"},{"name":"Mengmeng Shang"},{"name":"Mengya Xu"},{"name":"Anyi Wu"},{"name":"Luning Sun"},{"name":"Lanyan Zheng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CcpA"},{"word":"DEGs"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"RNA-seq"},{"word":"Streptococcus sanguinis"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article107":{"pmid":"31998561","title":"Organic acids and 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol: major compounds of Weissella confusa WM36 cell-free supernatant against growth, survival and virulence of Salmonella Typhi.","date":"2020-02-02","abs":"Salmonella Typhi (S.

To acclimate to new environments, the expression of genes in bacteria is controlled directly or indirectly by diverse transcriptional factors. Among them, LysR type transcriptional regulators are well-characterized and abundant in bacteria. In a previous study, comparative proteomic analysis revealed that LysR type carbohydrate-related transcriptional regulator in Xag (LcrX) was more abundant in XVM2, which is a minimal medium, compared with a rich medium. However, the functions of LcrX in Xag have not been characterized. In this study, we generated an LcrX-overexpressing strain, Xag(LcrX), and the knockout mutant strain, XagΔlcrX(EV), to elucidate the functions of LcrX. Bacterial multiplication of Xag(LcrX) in soybean was significantly impaired, indicating that LcrX is related to virulence. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed that LcrX is mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism/transport and inorganic ion transport/metabolism. Based on the results of proteomics analysis, diverse phenotypic assays were carried out. A gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay demonstrated that LcrX specifically bound to the putative promoter regions of genes encoding putative fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and protease. Through a 96-well plate assay under various conditions, we confirmed that the growth of Xag(LcrX) was dramatically affected in the presence of various carbon sources, while the growth of XagΔlcrX(EV) was only slightly changed. Biofilm formation activity was reduced in Xag(LcrX) but enhanced in XagΔlcrX(EV). The production of siderophores was also decreased in Xag(LcrX) but not altered in XagΔlcrX(EV).

There was a strong source-dependence of biofilm development formed by the monocultures, that is, a higher biofilm formation potential for strains from attached aggregates than for those from sludge flocs at both substrate concentrations. Interestingly, the results showed that total biofilm reduction was dominant in the dual-species biofilm sourced from flocs in both LB broth (67.37%) and 0.1× LB broth (64.21%), indicating high interspecific competition in mobile aggregates and the independence of substrate concentrations. However, biofilm reduction was higher (33.68%) than induction (19.37%) for the biofilms formed by surface-attached aggregates in LB broth, while the opposite trend was apparent in 0.1× LB broth, suggesting the occurrence of indeterministic processes for biofilm formation and important roles of substrate concentrations. In addition, the more closely related phylogenetic relationships of cocultures from mobile aggregates were consistent with higher competition compared with those from surface-attached aggregates.

Adhesion to streptococci is driven by interaction of the minor fimbrial antigen (Mfa1) with streptococcal antigen I/II. We identified the region of antigen I/II required for this interaction and developed small molecule mimetics that inhibited P. gingivalis adherence. However, the functional motifs of Mfa1 involved in the interaction with antigen I/II remain uncharacterized. A series of N- and C-terminal peptide fragments of Mfa1 were expressed and tested for inhibition of P. gingivalis adherence to S. gordonii. This approach identified residues 225-400 of Mfa1 as essential for P. gingivalis adherence. Using the three-dimensional structure of Mfa1, a putative binding cleft was identified using SiteMap and five small molecule mimetics could dock in this site. Site-specific mutation of residues in the predicted cleft, including R240A, W275A, D321A and A357P inhibited the interaction of Mfa1 with streptococci, whereas mutation of residues not in the predicted cleft (V238A, I252F and ΔK253) had no effect. Complementation of an Mfa1-deficient P. gingivalis strain with wild-type mfa1 restored adherence to streptococci, whereas complementation with full-length mfa1 containing the R240A or A357P mutations did not restore adherence.

Subsequently, the antibacterial activity of phytosynthesized AgNPs on MDR K. pneumoniae strains was investigated by broth microdilution assay and agar well-diffusion method. Finally (in the last step), the antibiofilm activity of phytosynthesized AgNPs was determined using microtiter plate assay and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) methods for the analysis of type 3 fimbriae (mrkA) and quorum-sensing system (luxS) gene expression. The results of this study showed that the phytosynthesized AgNPs had a spherical nanostructure with the mean size of 17.60 nm. The AgNPs exhibited dose-dependent antibacterial activity. The results of the microtiter plate and RT-PCR methods show that AgNPs inhibited the biofilm formation in MDR K. pneumoniae strains, and the expressions of mrkA and luxS genes were downregulated significantly in MDR strains after treatment with a subminimum inhibitory concentration of AgNPs. In conclusion, AgNPs effectively prevent the formation of biofilms and kill bacteria in established biofilms, which suggests that AgNPs might be a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections caused by MDR K. pneumoniae strains.","authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Foroohimanjili"},{"name":"Amir Mirzaie"},{"name":"Seyed Mohammad Mehdi Hamdi"},{"name":"Hassan Noorbazargan"},{"name":"Mojtaba Hedayati Ch"},{"name":"Aghigh Dolatabadi"},{"name":"Hossein Rezaie"},{"name":"Faezeh M Bishak"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"Mespilus germanica"},{"word":"antibacterial activity"},{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"antiquorum sensing"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"}]},"article129":{"pmid":"31993700","title":"Distinct Profiles in Microbial Diversity on Carbon Steel and Different Welds in Simulated Marine Microcosm.","date":"2020-01-29","abs":"The main studies on the corrosion of metals induced by microorganisms are directed only to the surface of the metal, without considering the presence of welds between these surfaces.

Its ability to form biofilms, which exhibit high tolerance to antifungal treatments, has been considered as an important virulence factor. However, the mechanisms involving antifungal resistance in biofilms and the impact of host niche environments on these processes are still poorly defined. In this study, we performed a whole-transcriptome analysis of C. glabrata biofilm cells exposed to different environmental conditions and constraints in order to identify the molecular pathways involved in fluconazole resistance and understand how acidic pH niches, associated with the presence of acetic acid, are able to modulate these responses. We show that fluconazole treatment induces gene expression reprogramming in a carbon source and pH-dependent manner. This is particularly relevant for a set of genes involved in DNA replication, ergosterol, and ubiquinone biosynthesis. We also provide additional evidence that the loss of mitochondrial function is associated with fluconazole resistance, independently of the growth condition. Lastly, we propose that C. glabrata Mge1, a cochaperone involved in iron metabolism and protein import into the mitochondria, is a key regulator of fluconazole susceptibility during carbon and pH adaptation by reducing the metabolic flux towards toxic sterol formation. These new findings suggest that different host microenvironments influence directly the physiology of C. glabrata, with implications on how this pathogen responds to antifungal treatment. Our analyses identify several pathways that can be targeted and will potentially prove to be useful for developing new antifungals to treat biofilm-based infections.","authors":[{"name":"Rosana Alves"},{"name":"Stavroula L Kastora"},{"name":"Alexandra Gomes-Gonçalves"},{"name":"Nuno Azevedo"},{"name":"Célia F Rodrigues"},{"name":"Sónia Silva"},{"name":"Liesbeth Demuyser"},{"name":"Patrick Van Dijck"},{"name":"Margarida Casal"},{"name":"Alistair J P Brown"},{"name":"Mariana Henriques"},{"name":"Sandra Paiva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobials"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Cellular microbiology"},{"word":"Next-generation sequencing"},{"word":"Pathogens"}]},"article131":{"pmid":"31993140","title":"Evaluation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties of proanthocyanidins from Chinese bayberry (Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zucc.) leaves against Staphylococcus epidermidis.","date":"2020-01-31","abs":"Staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged in recent years as one of the most important opportunistic pathogens owing to its ability to attach to processing surfaces in the food industry.

This system regulates behaviors including but not limited to virulence and biofilm formation. We focused on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human opportunistic pathogen that is involved in acute and chronic lung infections and which disproportionately affects people with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa infections are becoming increasingly challenging to treat with the spread of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, QS disruption approaches, known as quorum quenching, are appealing due to their potential to control the virulence of resistant strains. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa is known to simultaneously utilize two main QS circuits, one based on C4-AHL, the other with 3-oxo-C12-AHL. Here, we evaluated the effects of signal disruption on 39 cystic fibrosis clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, including drug resistant strains. We used two enzymes capable of degrading AHLs, known as lactonases, with distinct substrate preference: one degrading 3-oxo-C12-AHL, the other degrading both C4-AHL and 3-oxo-C12-AHL. Two lactonases were used to determine the effects of signal disruption on the clinical isolates, and to evaluate the importance of the QS circuits by measuring effects on virulence factors (elastase, protease, and pyocyanin) and biofilm formation. Signal disruption results in at least one of these factors being inhibited for most isolates (92%). Virulence factor activity or production were inhibited by up to 100% and biofilm was inhibited by an average of 2.3 fold. Remarkably, the treatments led to distinct inhibition profiles of the isolates; the treatment with the lactonase degrading both signaling molecules resulted in a higher fraction of inhibited isolates (77% vs. 67%), and the simultaneous inhibition of more virulence factors per strain (2 vs. 1.5). This finding suggests that the lactonase AHL preference is key to its inhibitory spectrum and is an essential parameter to improve quorum quenching strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Kathleen Mahan"},{"name":"Ryan Martinmaki"},{"name":"Isabel Larus"},{"name":"Rakesh Sikdar"},{"name":"Jordan Dunitz"},{"name":"Mikael Elias"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"lactonase"},{"word":"quorum quenching"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"signaling"}]},"article135":{"pmid":"31993033","title":"Water Flow and Light Availability Influence on Intracellular Geosmin Production in River Biofilms.","date":"2020-01-31","abs":"Hydro-morphological alterations in water bodies caused by climate change and human activities affects the ecosystem functioning and generate important water quality problems. Some of these alterations can generate an increase in cyanobacterial blooms, which are associated with the appearance of bad taste and odorous compounds such as geosmin. The factors that trigger their production are still unclear, and this inability to predict geosmin episodes provokes economic problems for water supply companies. This study aims to evaluate the effects of water flow and light availability on biofilm development and intracellular geosmin formation. A mesocosm experiment was performed between February-April, 2019. The mesocosms were a set of 10 outdoor 3 m long flumes, with a continuous water supply from the Ter river (Catalonia, NE Spain). Two light intensities were established: natural light and light reduced to 80%, combined with five gradual water flows from 0.09 to 1.10 L/s. Water samples were taken to analyze nutrients, and biofilm samples, to analyze geosmin concentration, chlorophyll a and the community. Geosmin in biofilm was detected in those treatments in which Oscillatoria sp. appeared. The concentration of intracellular geosmin was higher at lower water flows (0.09 and 0.18 L/s), and the highest (2.12 mg/g) was found in the flume with the lowest water flow (0.09 L/s) and irradiation (20%). This flume was the one that presented a greater concentration of Oscillatoria sp. (21% of the community). It stands out that, when geosmin in biofilm was found, the dissolved inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus ratio decreased, from an average of 417:1 to 14:1. This was mainly due to an increase in inorganic phosphorus concentration generated by a change in the nutrient uptake capacity of the community's biofilm. The results obtained in this study indicated the potential implications for stream ecosystem management to control geosmin appearance. Likewise, they could be used as an early warning system, establishing that in times of drought, which lead to a general decrease in river water flow, the situation could be optimal for the appearance and development of geosmin producing cyanobacteria in low-flow areas near the river banks.","authors":[{"name":"Carmen Espinosa"},{"name":"Meritxell Abril"},{"name":"Helena Guasch"},{"name":"Núria Pou"},{"name":"Lorenzo Proia"},{"name":"Marta Ricart"},{"name":"Marc Ordeix"},{"name":"Laia Llenas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"geosmin"},{"word":"light availability"},{"word":"mesocosms"},{"word":"water flow"}]},"article136":{"pmid":"31992930","title":"Effects of powdered rifampin and vancomycin solutions on biofilm production of staphylococcus aureus on orthopedic implants.","date":"2020-01-31","abs":"Hardware infections in orthopedic surgery, specifically those involving biofilm producing bacteria, are troublesome and are highly resistant to systemic antibiotics.

Breaking down the matrix renders biofilms more susceptible to physical disruption and to treatments such as antibiotics. Different species of bacteria, and different strains within the same species, produce different types of matrix polymers. This suggests that targeting specific polymers for disruption may be more effective than nonspecific approaches to disrupting biofilm matrixes. In this study, we treated Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms with enzymes that are specific to different matrix polymers. We measured the resulting alteration in biofilm mechanics using bulk rheology and changes in structure using electron microscopy. We find that, for biofilms grown in vitro, the effect of enzymatic treatment is greatest when the enzyme is specific to a dominant matrix polymer. Specifically matched enzymatic treatment tends to reduce yield strain and yield stress and increase the rate of biofilm drying, due to increased diffusivity as a result of network compromise. Electron micrographs qualitatively suggest that well-matched enzymatic treatments reduce long-range structure and shorten connecting network fibers. Previous work has shown that generic glycoside hydrolases can cause dispersal of bacteria from in vivo and ex vivo biofilms into a free-swimming state, and thereby make antibiotic treatment more effective. For biofilms grown in wounded mice, we find that well-matched treatments that result in the greatest mechanical compromise in vitro induce the least dispersal ex vivo. Moreover, we find that generic glycoside hydrolases have no measurable effect on the mechanics of biofilms grown in vitro, while previous work has shown them to be highly effective at inducing dispersal in vivo and ex vivo. This highlights the possibility that effective approaches to eradicating biofilms may depend strongly on the growth environment.","authors":[{"name":"Kristin N Kovach"},{"name":"Derek Fleming"},{"name":"Marilyn J Wells"},{"name":"Kendra P Rumbaugh"},{"name":"Vernita Diane Gordon"}],"keywords":[]},"article142":{"pmid":"31990521","title":"Purposely Designed Hierarchical Porous Electrodes for High Rate Microbial Electrosynthesis of Acetate from Carbon Dioxide.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Carbon-based products are crucial to our society, but their production from fossil-based carbon is unsustainable.

Cell-free supernatants of B. amyloliquefaciens B-1895 and B. subtilis KATMIRA1933 showed higher antimicrobial activity against biofilms of P. mirabilis isolated from humans as compared with biofilms of sheep isolates. According to our knowledge, this is the first report evaluating the anti-biofilm activity of probiotic spore-forming bacilli against clinical and animal UTI isolates of P. mirabilis.

Recent analyses suggest that Pel production proceeds via a synthase-dependent polysaccharide secretion pathway, which in Gram-negative bacteria is defined by an outer membrane β-barrel porin, a periplasmic tetratricopeptide repeat-containing scaffold protein, and an inner membrane-embedded synthase. Polymerization is catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase domain of the synthase component of these systems, which is allosterically regulated by cyclic 3',5'-dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). However, while the outer membrane and periplasmic components of the Pel system have been characterized, the inner membrane complex required for Pel polymerization has yet to be defined. To address this, we examined over 500 pel gene clusters from diverse species of Proteobacteria This analysis identified an invariant set of four syntenic genes, three of which, pelD, pelE, and pelG, are predicted to reside within the inner membrane, while the fourth, pelF, encodes a glycosyltransferase domain. Using a combination of gene deletion analysis, subcellular fractionation, coimmunoprecipitation, and bacterial two-hybrid assays, we provide evidence for the existence of an inner membrane complex of PelD, PelE, and PelG. Furthermore, we show that this complex interacts with PelF in order to facilitate its localization to the inner membrane. Mutations that abolish c-di-GMP binding to the known receptor domain of PelD had no effect on complex formation, suggesting that c-di-GMP binding stimulates Pel production through quaternary structural rearrangements. Together, these data provide the first experimental evidence of an inner membrane complex involved in Pel polysaccharide production.","authors":[{"name":"Gregory B Whitfield"},{"name":"Lindsey S Marmont"},{"name":"Alex Ostaszewski"},{"name":"Jacquelyn D Rich"},{"name":"John C Whitney"},{"name":"Matthew R Parsek"},{"name":"Joe J Harrison"},{"name":"P Lynne Howell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pel polysaccharide"},{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"}]},"article153":{"pmid":"31988024","title":"Noninvasive detection of microleakage in all-ceramic crowns using quantitative light-induced fluorescence technology.","date":"2020-01-28","abs":"The early noninvasive detection of crown microleakage is very important for tooth maintenance and preservation.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the fungal extract against test pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was 1000 µg/mL. Sub-MIC concentrations (250 and 500 µg/mL) of fungal extract reduced the QS regulated virulence phenotypes such as the production of pyocyanin, chitinase, protease, elastase, and staphylolytic activity in P. aeruginosa PAO1 by 84.15%, 73.15%, 67.37%, 62.37%, and 33.65%, respectively. Moreover, it also reduced the production of exopolysaccharides (74.99%), rhamnolipid (68.01%), and alginate (54.98%), and inhibited the biofilm formation of the bacteria by 90.54%. In silico analysis revealed that the metabolite of P. sydowiana PPR binds to the bacterial QS receptor proteins (LasR and RhlR) similar to their respective natural signalling molecules.

The fundamental understanding of membrane biofouling is limited despite years of research, as the means of microbial interactions and response to the conditions on the membrane surface are complicated. Here, we discuss studies that investigated the microbial diversity of fouled high-pressure membranes. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene have shown that Burkholderiales, Pseudomonadales, Rhizobiales, Sphingomonadales and Xanthomonadales frequently obtain a high relative abundance on fouled membranes. The bacterial communities present in the diverse feed water types and in pre-treatment compartments are different from the communities on the membrane, because high-pressure membrane filtration provides a selective environment for certain bacterial groups. The biofilms that form within the pre-treatment compartments do not commonly serve as an inoculum for the subsequent high-pressure membranes. Besides bacteria also fungi are detected in the water treatment compartments. In contrast to bacteria, the fungal community does not change much throughout membrane cleaning. The stable fungal diversity indicates that they are more significant in membrane biofouling than previously thought. By reviewing the biodiversity and ecology of microbes in the whole high pressure membrane filtration water chain, we have been able to identify potentials to improve biofouling control. These include modulation of hydrodynamic conditions, nutrient limitation and the combination of cleaning agents to target the entire membrane microbiome.","authors":[{"name":"Hendrik J de Vries"},{"name":"Alfons J M Stams"},{"name":"Caroline M Plugge"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Fungi"},{"word":"Membrane biofouling"},{"word":"Microbiota"},{"word":"Nanofiltration"},{"word":"Reverse osmosis"}]},"article159":{"pmid":"31986397","title":"Bacterial community dynamics and disinfection impact in cooling water systems.","date":"2020-02-24","abs":"Understanding the bacterial dynamics in cooling towers is imperative for the assessment of disinfection efficiency and management of microbial risks linked to aerosol formation.

To address this, 1724 published papers concentrating on three types of microbial aggregates, namely granules, biofilm, and flocs were compiled. A quantitative meta-analysis was carried out to compare the standard error of nitrogen removal efficiencies among these three microbial aggregates. The data sources of this meta-analysis comprised articles on granules (42%), followed by those on biofilm (33%) and flocs (25%). The granular sludge appeared to be competent in achieving the highest average nitrogen removal efficiencies of 81.1%, followed by biofilm (80.8%). Flocs provided comparatively poor removal of nitrogen pollutants with the lowest removal efficiency of 74.1%. Biofilm had the highest abundance of functional microbial communities with 43.4% on Candidatus Kuenenia and 11.2% on Candidatus Brocadia, which were detected in the anammox system as common genera.

To solve this problem a critical understanding of the vibro-acoustic behaviour of the scaler tip and the associated cavitation dynamics is necessary.

A systematic parametric study has been carried out for the cavitation volume around the scaler tip in terms of the frequency, amplitude and power of the tip vibration. The numerical results indicate that the amount of cavitation around the scaler tip increases with the frequency and amplitude of the vibration.

SA with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups can interact with the hydroxyl groups of PLX via hydrogen bonding. A stronger interaction of SA with PLX407 was found when compared to the interaction between SA and PLX188. The PLX-CA beads gave a higher CZ entrapment efficiency than the CA beads. The highest PLX content used created an amorphous form of CZ in the beads because of the CZ solubilization by the PLX micelles.

Considering the importance of the detrimental impact of biofouling, it has received much attention in the scientific community and from concerned stakeholders. With the development of nanotechnology and the nowadays widespread use of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), concerns have been raised regarding their fate in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Safety aspects and public health issues are critical in the management of handling nanomaterials and their nanowastes. The interactions of various types of nanoparticles (NPs) with planktonic bacteria have also received attention due to their antimicrobial properties. However, their behavior in regard to biofilms is not well understood although, in the environment, most of the bacteria prefer living in sessile communities. The question appears relevant considering the need to build knowledge on the fate of nanoparticles and the fact that no one can exclude the risk of accumulation of nanoparticles in biofilms and on surfaces leading to a form of nanofouling involving both engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) and nanoplastics. The present analysis of recent research accounts allows in identifying that (1) research activities related to water remediation systems have been mostly oriented on the impact of NPs on pre-existing biofilms, (2) experimental designs are restricted to few scenarios of exposure, usually limited to relative short-time periods although nanofouling could favour the development of multi-resistant bacterial species through sub-lethal exposures over prolong periods of time (3) nanofouling in other systems in which biofilms develop remains to be addressed, and (4) new research directions are required for investigating the mechanisms involved and the subsequent impact of nanofouling on bacterial consortium responses encountered in a variety of environments such as those prevailing in food production/processing settings.

Most of the bacterial isolates were susceptible to Ofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Gentamicin, and Cefepime and resistant to Ceftazidime, Nitrofurantoin, Ampicillin, and Nalidixic acid. Isolate RB33-V recorded resistant against 11 antibiotics tested, and RB42-V was found susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested. Among the seven heavy metals tested, the highest of 39 bacteria showed resistance to zinc, and least of 9 bacteria recorded resistance against cadmium. Isolate RB20-III was susceptible to all heavy metals tested, and RB23-III was found resistance for six heavy metals tested. A higher correlation was observed with zinc and multiple antibiotic resistance, and Ceftazidime resistance was most frequently associated with all the heavy metals tested. These bacteria grow optimally under neutral-alkali conditions and susceptible to acidic conditions, and they can withstand a broad range of temperatures and salt concentrations. They are very poor in phosphate solubilization. Further, the bacteria recorded varied results for beneficial traits, hemolytic, and DNase activity. The results of bacterial characterization indicated that this bacterial community is of multi-origin in nature and are assisting the host-plant in withstanding the adverse and fluctuating conditions of the Yamuna river by reducing the toxic effect of heavy metals, antibiotics and other xenobiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Duraivadivel P"},{"name":"Gowtham H G"},{"name":"Hariprasad P"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic"},{"word":"Heavy metal"},{"word":"Indole acetic acid"},{"word":"Water hyacinth"},{"word":"Yamuna"}]},"article177":{"pmid":"31981410","title":"Synthesis of Catechin-Rare Earth Complex with Efficient and Broad-Spectrum Anti-Biofilm Activity.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"Biofilm is the crucial reason of clinical infections.

Using virgin polymers that have not being exposed to the environment as a reference, DRS peaks can be attributed to the microorganisms attached to the polymer surface with time. The polymers tested were low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). For LDPE strips for all sampling times in the field, the development of the peaks among 10 similar samples was rather uniform in terms of peak wavelength with time. For PET strips during the early sampling time, the development of the peaks among 10 similar samples was rather uniform in terms of peak wavelength but varied in terms of intensity. This last observation phased out with longer exposure times that the peaks had similar distribution in terms of peak wavelength and intensity. Similar experiments were run for longer exposure times both in an oligotrophic laboratory bioreactor and in the marine environment. In both cases, the biofilm on PET samples seems to reach a steady state faster than LDPE with similar peaks found on both samples DRS proved to be a robust and useful tool to study the formation of biofilm on plastic samples without any pretreatment and without sample destruction.

The maximum production was found to be 3.46 mM by addition of peptone as the main source of nitrogen with a concentration of 1.5 g/L. The optimal parameter values were temperature 37 °C, pH 6, incubation time 72 h and inoculum concentration 1 mL. The crude exopolysaccharide was purified by removing the cells, then the protein, then dialysis and finally ethanol precipitation of the exopolysaccharide. This method modification increased exopolysaccharide production to 0.6 g/L. The exopolysaccharide produced showed antitumor activity against Erlich tumor cells. It is promising for application on a large scale for different types of cancer cell lines.","authors":[{"name":"Rakan H Yousef"},{"name":"Othman A S Baothman"},{"name":"Wesam H Abdulaal"},{"name":"Mohamed K Abo-Golayel"},{"name":"Anas A Darwish"},{"name":"Said S Moselhy"},{"name":"Youssri M Ahmed"},{"name":"Khalid Rehman Hakeem"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Ajwa date seeds"},{"word":"Antitumor"},{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"Exopolysaccharides"},{"word":"Purification"}]},"article192":{"pmid":"31977126","title":"Effect of different Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains on dual-species biofilms formed with Porphyromonas gingivalis or Dialister pneumosintes.","date":"2020-03-27","abs":"There are five evolutionarily divergent clades of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, with possible differences in phenotype and virulence potential among strains.

Generally considered a harmless commensal, these bacteria are studied for their plant-growth promotion (PGP) and biocontrol characteristics. Intriguingly, P. brassicacearum is closely related to P. corrugata, which is classified as an opportunistic phytopathogen. Twenty-one P. brassicacearum genomes have been sequenced to date. In the current review, genomes of P. brassicacearum and strains from the P. corrugata clade were mined for regions associated with PGP, biocontrol and pathogenicity. We discovered that 'beneficial' bacteria and those classified as plant pathogens have many genes in common; thus, only a fine line separates beneficial/harmless commensals from those capable of causing disease in plants. The genotype and physiological state of the plant, the presence of biotic/abiotic stressors, and the ability of bacteria to manipulate the plant immune system collectively contribute to how the bacterial-plant interaction plays out. Because production of extracellular metabolites is energetically costly, these compounds are expected to impart a fitness advantage to the producer. P. brassicacearum is able to reduce the threat of nematode predation through release of metabolites involved in biocontrol. Moreover this bacterium has the unique ability to form biofilms on the head of Caenorhabditis elegans, as a second mechanism of predator avoidance. Rhizobacteria, plants, fungi, and microfaunal predators have occupied a shared niche for millions of years and, in many ways, they function as a single organism.

We use a very general mathematical model, based on a multipole representation and probabilistic simulations, to ascertain the spatial distribution of microorganisms in films of different viscosities. Our results reveal that microorganisms can be distributed symmetrically or asymmetrically across the height of the film, depending on their morphology and the ratio of the film's viscosity to that of the fluid substrate. Long-flagellated, elongated bacteria exhibit stable swimming parallel to the liquid-liquid interface when the bacterial film is less viscous than the underlying fluid. Bacteria with shorter flagella on the other hand, swim away from the liquid-liquid interface and accumulate at the free surface.

The catheter has a retention cuff that is inflated to secure the catheter in the bladder and a novel irrigation cuff proximal to the urethral-bladder junction capable of providing periurethral irrigation from the urethral-bladder junction to the meatus. Uniform periurethral irrigation was demonstrated in an ex vivo porcine model by adding a dye to the antimicrobial urethral irrigation solution. An in vitro biofilm colonization model was adapted to study the ability of periurethral irrigation with a newly developed antimicrobial combination consisting of polygalacturonic acid + caprylic acid (PG + CAP) to prevent axial colonization of the extraluminal urethral indwelling catheter shaft by common uropathogens. The extraluminal surface of control catheters that were not irrigated formed biofilms along the entire axial urethral tract after 24 hours. Significant (p < 0.001) inhibition of colonization was seen against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (EC), and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (KB). For other common uropathogens including Candida albicans (CA), Proteus mirabilis (PR), and Enterococcus faecalis (EF), a first irrigation treatment completely inhibited colonization of half of the indwelling catheter closest to the bladder and a second treatment largely disinfected the remaining intraurethral portion of the catheter towards the meatus.

In this review, we present current knowledge on the diversity of bacterial cell envelopes, including these atypical Firmicutes.

The effect of increasing BOD concentration to the removal rate constants could be divided into two groups; 1) compounds influenced by increasing loading of BOD: atenolol, propranolol, venlafaxine, citalopram, metoprolol, iohexol, and diclofenac 2) compounds only little or not influenced by increasing concentration of BOD: sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole, trimethoprim, iomeprol, and carbamazepine. Though BOD clearly had effects on the degradation, no indications towards a complete stop of the degradation were observed under any circumstances. The different biofilter materials influenced (indirectly) the removal of micropollutants: While the overall best performance was seen in the filtralite biofilter, the stonewool biofilter generally had the lowest removal rate constants.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of pH, ethanol and NaCl concentrations after 24 and 48 h incubation times at 37 °C, also modeling the results with artificial neural network (ANN). For this purpose, after both incubation times, the effect of each parameter was studied, separately and also in combination at the levels in which the highest biofilm was formed.

Adding the ethanol and NaCl stimulated biofilm formation, but the inhibitory effect was observed at high concentrations of ethanol and NaCl and very acidic or highly alkaline pH levels. The more incubation time also led to an increase in biofilm formation.

The mechanism of bactericidal action by aminoglycosides is well-known, by which it terminates the cytoplasmic protein synthesis. However, the potentials of aminoglycosides become hindered when facing the evolution of bacterial resistance mechanisms. Among multiple resistance mechanisms displayed by bacteria against antibiotics, the formation of biofilm is the mechanism that provides a barrier for antibiotics to reach the cellular level. Bacteria present in the biofilm also get protection against the impact of host immune responses, harsh environmental conditions, and other antimicrobial treatments. Hence, with the multifaceted resistance developed by biofilm-forming pathogenic bacteria, antibiotics are therefore discontinued for further applications. However, the recent research developed several alternative strategies such as optimization of the active concentration, modification of the environmental conditions, modification of the chemical structure, combinatorial application with other active agents, and formulation with biocompatible carrier materials to revitalize and exploit the new potential of aminoglycosides.

Employing natural substrates in the human body such as glucose and oxygen, cascade reactions can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill tumor cells, but cascade reactions may also have potential as a direly needed, novel bacterial infection-control strategy. ROS can disintegrate the EPS matrix of infectious biofilm, disrupt bacterial cell membranes, and damage intra-cellular DNA. Application of cascade reactions producing ROS as a new infection-control strategy is still in its infancy. The main advantages for infection-control cascade reactions include the fact that they are non-antibiotic based and induction of ROS resistance is unlikely. However, the amount of ROS generated is generally low and antimicrobial efficacies reported are still far <3-4 log units necessary for clinical efficacy. Increasing the amounts of ROS generated by adding more substrate bears the risk of collateral damage to tissue surrounding an infection site. Collateral tissue damage upon increasing substrate concentrations may be prevented by locally increasing substrate concentrations, for instance, using smart nanocarriers. Smart, pH-responsive nanocarriers can self-target and accumulate in infectious biofilms from the blood circulation to confine ROS production inside the biofilm to yield long-term presence of ROS, despite the short lifetime (nanoseconds) of individual ROS molecules. Increasing bacterial killing efficacies using cascade reaction components containing nanocarriers constitutes a first, major challenge in the development of infection-control cascade reactions. Nevertheless, their use in combination with clinical antibiotic treatment may already yield synergistic effects, but this remains to be established for cascade reactions. Furthermore, specific patient groups possessing elevated levels of endogenous substrate (for instance, diabetic or cancer patients) may benefit from the use of cascade reaction components containing nanocarriers.","authors":[{"name":"Yuanfeng Li"},{"name":"Guang Yang"},{"name":"Yijin Ren"},{"name":"Linqi Shi"},{"name":"Rujiang Ma"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ROS"},{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"cascade reaction"},{"word":"glucose"},{"word":"hydrogen peroxide"},{"word":"infection"}]},"article224":{"pmid":"31969984","title":"Biofilm formation displays intrinsic offensive and defensive features of Bacillus cereus.","date":"2020-01-26","abs":"Biofilm formation is a strategy of many bacterial species to adapt to a variety of stresses and has become a part of infections, contaminations, or beneficial interactions.

We report that floating and biofilm cells are populations that differentiate metabolically, with members of each subpopulation developing different branches of certain metabolic pathways. Secondly, biofilm populations rearrange nucleotides, sugars, amino acids, and energy metabolism. Thirdly, this metabolic rearrangement coexists with: the synthesis of the extracellular matrix, sporulation, reinforcement of the cell wall, activation of the ROS detoxification machinery and production of secondary metabolites. This strategy contributes to defend biofilm cells from competitors.

We found that a genomic region putatively dedicated to the synthesis of a capsular polysaccharide (eps2) was overexpressed in a biofilm cell population compared to in a planktonic population, while we detected no change in the transcript abundance from another genomic region (eps1) also likely to be involved in polysaccharide production. Preliminary biofilm assays suggested a mild role for the products of the eps2 region in biofilm formation and no function for the products of the eps1 region. The aim of this work was to better define the roles of these two regions in B. cereus multicellularity. We demonstrate that the eps2 region is indeed involved in bacterial adhesion to surfaces, cell-to-cell interaction, cellular aggregation and biofilm formation, while the eps1 region appears to be involved in a kind of social bacterial motility.

The antimicrobial behavior of ZnO nanoparticle is due to formation of H₂O₂ as reactive oxygen species (ROS) to which the bacterial cells are permeable. H₂O₂ is a powerful oxidizing agents that oxidized the mycobacterial elements like DNA and proteins which results into the toxicity of the bacteria cell.","authors":[{"name":"Atul Kumar"},{"name":"Suman Gahlyan"},{"name":"Rajesh Thakur"},{"name":"Sunita Devi"},{"name":"Surender Duhan"}],"keywords":[]},"article233":{"pmid":"31968224","title":"Characterization of biofilm formation and induction of apoptotic DNA fragmentation by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae on polarized human airway epithelial cells.","date":"2020-02-20","abs":"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common airway commensal and opportunistic pathogen that persists within biofilm communities in vivo.

Biofilm abundance and community composition were investigated along spatial and temporal gradients using field surveys and microarray analyses, respectively. Given the recognized role of Sphaerotilus in organically enriched environments, additional analyses were pursued to specifically characterize its abundance: a consensus sthA sequence was determined via comparison of whole metagenome sequences with a previously identified sthA sequence, the primers developed for this gene were used to characterize relative Sphaerotilus abundance using quantitative real-time PCR, and a Sphaerotilus strain was isolated to validate the determined sthA sequence. Results indicated that biofilm abundance was stimulated by elevated antecedent chemical oxygen demand concentrations, a surrogate for deicer concentrations, with minimal biofilm volumes observed when antecedent chemical oxygen demand concentrations remained below 48 mg/L. Biofilms were composed of diverse communities (including sheathed bacterium Thiothrix) whose composition appeared to shift in relation to antecedent temperature and chemical oxygen demand. The relative abundance of sthA correlated most strongly with heterotrophic biofilm volume (positive) and dissolved oxygen (negative), indicating that Sphaerotilus was likely a consistent biofilm member and thrived under low oxygen conditions. Additional investigations identified the isolate as a new strain of Sphaerotilus montanus (strain KMKE) able to use deicer components as carbon sources and found that stream dissolved oxygen concentrations related inversely to biofilm volume as well as to antecedent temperature and chemical oxygen demand. The airport setting provides insight into potential consequences of widescale adoption of organic deicers for roadway deicing.","authors":[{"name":"Michelle A Nott"},{"name":"Heather E Driscoll"},{"name":"Minoru Takeda"},{"name":"Mahesh Vangala"},{"name":"Steven R Corsi"},{"name":"Scott W Tighe"}],"keywords":[]},"article236":{"pmid":"31967575","title":"Are we There Yet?

The lifestyle-specific stress response of colonic microbiota, both natural and fermentation produced, has not been addressed before. Planktonic and sessile artificial colonic microbiota delivered by PolyFermS continuous fermentation models can provide a controllable and reproducible alternative to fecal transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disorders. We therefore characterized planktonic and sessile microbiota produced in two PolyFermS models inoculated with immobilized fecal microbiota and comparatively tested their levels of tolerance of frozen storage (-80°C) and freeze-dried storage (4°C) for 9 months to mimic preservation strategies for therapeutic applications. Sessile microbiota harbored next to shared taxa a unique community distinguishable from planktonic microbiota. Synergistetes and Proteobacteria were highly represented in sessile microbiota, while Firmicutes were more abundant in planktonic microbiota. The community structure and metabolic activity of both microbiota, monitored during standardized reactivation batch fermentations, were better preserved after frozen storage than dried storage, indicated by higher Bray-Curtis similarity and enhanced recovery of metabolite production. For both lifestyles, reestablishment of Bacteroidaceae was impaired after frozen and dried storage along with reduced propionate formation. In contrast, butyrate production was maintained after reactivation despite compositional rearrangements within the butyrate-producing community. Unexpectedly, the rate of recovery of metabolite production was lower after preservation of sessile than planktonic microbiota. We speculate that higher functional dependencies between microbes might have led to the lower stress tolerance of sessile than planktonic microbiota.","authors":[{"name":"Lea Bircher"},{"name":"Clarissa Schwab"},{"name":"Annelies Geirnaert"},{"name":"Anna Greppi"},{"name":"Christophe Lacroix"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FMT"},{"word":"bacterial lifestyle"},{"word":"colonic microbiota"},{"word":"cryopreservation"},{"word":"lyophilization"}]},"article241":{"pmid":"31964715","title":"Mechanism underlying autoinducer recognition in the Vibrio cholerae DPO-VqmA quorum-sensing pathway.","date":"2020-03-20","abs":"Quorum sensing is a bacterial communication process whereby bacteria produce, release, and detect extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers to coordinate collective behaviors. In the pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the quorum-sensing autoinducer 3,5-dimethyl-pyrazin-2-ol (DPO) binds the receptor and transcription factor VqmA. The DPO-VqmA complex activates transcription of vqmR, encoding the VqmR small RNA, which represses genes required for biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Here, we show that VqmA is soluble and properly folded and activates basal-level transcription of its target vqmR in the absence of DPO. VqmA transcriptional activity is increased in response to increasing concentrations of DPO, allowing VqmA to drive the V. cholerae quorum-sensing transition at high cell densities. We solved the DPO-VqmA crystal structure to 2.0 Å resolution and compared it with existing structures to understand the conformational changes VqmA undergoes upon DNA binding. Analysis of DPO analogs showed that a hydroxyl or carbonyl group at the 2'-position is critical for binding to VqmA. The proposed DPO precursor, a linear molecule, N-alanyl-aminoacetone (Ala-AA), also bound and activated VqmA. Results from site-directed mutagenesis and competitive ligand-binding analyses revealed that DPO and Ala-AA occupy the same binding site. In summary, our structure-function analysis identifies key features required for VqmA activation and DNA binding and establishes that, whereas VqmA binds two different ligands, VqmA does not require a bound ligand for folding or basal transcriptional activity. However, bound ligand is required for maximal activity.","authors":[{"name":"Xiuliang Huang"},{"name":"Olivia P Duddy"},{"name":"Justin E Silpe"},{"name":"Jon E Paczkowski"},{"name":"Jianping Cong"},{"name":"Brad R Henke"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3,5-dimethyl-pyrazin-2-ol (DPO)"},{"word":"N-alanyl-aminoacetone (Ala-AA)"},{"word":"Vibrio cholerae"},{"word":"VqmA"},{"word":"autoinducer"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"binding"},{"word":"crystallography"},{"word":"gene regulation"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article242":{"pmid":"31964697","title":"Genomic Differences between Listeria monocytogenes EGDe Isolates Reveal Crucial Roles for SigB and Wall Rhamnosylation in Biofilm Formation.","date":"2020-03-12","abs":"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive firmicute that causes foodborne infections, in part due to its ability to use multiple strategies, including biofilm formation, to survive adverse growth conditions.

By sequencing the genomes of four laboratory reference strains of the commonly used L. monocytogenes EGDe, we showed that each isolate contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with the reference genome. We discovered that two SNPs, contained in two independent genes within one of the isolates, impacted biofilm formation. Using bacterial genetics and phenotypic assays, we confirmed that rsbU and rmlA influence biofilm formation. RsbU is the upstream regulator of the alternative sigma factor SigB, and mutation of either rsbU or sigB increased biofilm formation. In contrast, deletion of rmlA, which encodes the first enzyme for TDP-l-rhamnose biosynthesis, resulted in a reduction in the amount of biofilm formed. Further analysis of biofilm formation in a strain that still produces TDP-l-rhamnose but which cannot decorate the wall teichoic acid with rhamnose (rmlT mutant) showed that it is the decorated wall teichoic acid that is required for adhesion of the cells to surfaces.

They are efficient but often rely on sophisticated and costly syntheses, and present significant risks of leakage and photobleaching damages, which is detrimental for mainstream applications. Another approach consists of exploiting the distance-dependent plasmonic properties of metallic nanoparticles. Still, assembling nanoparticles into dispersible colloidal pH-sensitive sensors remains a challenge.

One way that C. albicans controls its metabolism is through the glucose repression pathway, where expression of alternative carbon source utilization genes is repressed in the presence of its preferred carbon source, glucose. Here we carry out genetic and gene expression studies that identify transcription factors Mig1 and Mig2 as mediators of glucose repression in C. albicans. The well-studied Mig1/2 orthologs ScMig1/2 mediate glucose repression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; our data argue that C. albicans Mig1/2 function similarly as repressors of alternative carbon source utilization genes. However, Mig1/2 functions have several distinctive features in C. albicans. First, Mig1 and Mig2 have more co-equal roles in gene regulation than their S. cerevisiae orthologs. Second, Mig1 is regulated at the level of protein accumulation, more akin to ScMig2 than ScMig1. Third, Mig1 and Mig2 are together required for a unique aspect of C. albicans biology, the expression of several pathogenicity traits.

P. aeruginosa hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) is the effector protein and the hallmark of T6SS. Although T6SS is ubiquitous and affects ecology and human health, its general mechanism and physiological role are still not fully understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the impact of the P. aeruginosa T6SS on biofilm formation and environmental adaptation. To this end, we collected P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, divided them into strong biofilm formation (SBF) and nonbiofilm formation (NBF) groups based on their biofilm-forming ability, and compared their associated clinical characteristics. The duration of hospitalization was longer in patients infected with SBF than those infected with NBF strains. The expression levels of T6SS-related genes (hcp1 and hcp3) and a quorum-sensing gene (lasR) were higher in the SBF group as compared to those in the NBF group. In addition, the expression level of lasR was negatively associated with that of hcp1, but was positively associated with those of hcp2 and hcp3. Moreover, we evaluated the expression of T6SS- and biofilm-associated genes in planktonic and biofilm cells of the P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, and constructed strain PAO1△clpV1 to study the adaptation characteristics of H1-T6SS. The expression levels of hcp1, hcp2, hcp3, lasR, and other biofilm-associated genes were significantly higher in PAO1 biofilm cells as compared to those of planktonic cells. However, except for swarming ability as a vital feature for biofilm formation, there were no significant differences in the biofilm-forming ability and expression of biofilm-associated genes, adherence ability, growth characteristics, resistance to acid and osmotic pressure, surface structure, and morphology between the PAO1△clpV1 and PAO1 wild-type strains. Collectively, our results suggest that T6SS might play a role in biofilm formation and that H1-T6SS does not contribute to environmental adaptation in P. aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Lihua Chen"},{"name":"Yaru Zou"},{"name":"Asmaa Abbas Kronfl"},{"name":"Yong Wu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"clpV1"},{"word":"Type VI secretion system"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"environmental adaptation"}]},"article257":{"pmid":"31961254","title":"Physiological and Transcriptional Response of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae to Berberine, an Emerging Chemical Control.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"Berberine, a botanical drug, has great ability to inhibit the growth of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.

Ultimately, these studies dismiss the corrosion mechanism as a function of the local microbiome. Sixty spine hardware constructs were examined immediately after explantation for biofilm formation. Marked rod sections were imaged using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Backscatter mode was employed to better image the topology of the surface. There is clear differentiation between discoloration due to corrosion vs mechanical damage. Under scanning electron microscopy backscatter electron shadow examination, the authors noted that not all biofilm was removed using the surgical wipes. Corrosion pits were noticeably larger and numerous in areas of biofilm. In areas not associated with biofilms, there were few pits even if mechanical wear was evident. There is no evidence that the surface corrosion is modified between clinically diagnosed infected and noninfected patients. The surface damage present on explanted Ti6Al4V spine rods is uniquely similar to damage found in other industries where microbial-influenced corrosion is prevalent. Given that similar anaerobic, sulfur-reducing bacteria reside in and on human tissues, it is most likely that corrosion observed on explanted hardware is the result of microbial-influenced corrosion and not from inflammatory or other processes. Using analysis methods from other industries to characterize the microbiome present on explanted hardware is necessary.

We used atomic force microscopy to explore the contribution of gtfB and gtfC, as well as enamel-surface roughness, on the initial attachment of S. mutans. Adhesion forces of four S. mutans strains (wild-type, ΔgtfB, ΔgtfC, and ΔgtfBC), onto etched enamel surfaces, were determined. Force curves showed that, with increasing etching time from 0 to 10 s, the forces of all strains increased accordingly with acid-exposure time, the adhesion forces of wild-type strains were significantly greater than those of mutant strains (p < .05), and the forces of the three mutants were similar (p < .05).

This social habit has tremendous effects on oral and general health of khat chewers. Khat may affect bacterial species in plaque biofilms on oral rehabilitation materials. This preliminary case-controlled study aimed to assess and compare the effect of khat chewing on bacterial biodiversity between non-khat chewers (NKC) and khat chewers (KC) in oral biofilms on oral rehabilitation materials using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty participants were organized into 2 equal groups of NKC and KC, each containing 5 subgroups related to filling material type. Some participants had amalgam (A) or composite (C) restorations, while others had feldspathic porcelain (FP), nickel chromium (NC), and zirconia ceramic (ZC) crowns or bridges. Oral biofilm samples were collected from all participants, DNA was extracted, and samples were subjected to PCR. Bacterial species were then identified and counted. PCR products were sequenced to detect similarity. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of the current study samples were compared with 16S rRNA gene sequences from GenBank using BLAST on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. RESULTS The Streptococcus sp. was the most common bacterial species among our participants (40; 80%), followed by Lactobacillus and Veillonella spp., accounting for 12% (6) and 8% (4), respectively. Streptococcus sp. was observed equally among NKC and KC, but Lactobacillus and Veillonella spp. were higher in KC and NKC, respectively.

We also investigated the bacterial mRNA expression of biofilm-associated genes (fliC, csgA, and fimA) by quantitative real-time PCR assays. LCEE was found to suppress the growth, time-kill curve, and spread of EPEC. It also reduced the biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological analysis using transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that LCEE diminished the function of flagella resulting in reduced motility and biofilm formation. The mRNA expression of all three biofilm associated genes was downregulated under LCEE treatment. Extracts of the fruit of LCE inhibit the motility and biofilm formation of EPEC as a result of the inhibition of flagella development and function.

Indeed, the ability of Salmonella to form a biofilm seems to significantly contribute to its persistence in food production areas and clinical settings. Plant extracts and phytochemicals appear as promising sources of novel antimicrobials due to their cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, great structural diversity, and lower possibility of antimicrobial resistance development in comparison to synthetic chemicals. Research on these agents mainly attributes their antimicrobial activity to a diverse array of secondary metabolites.

However, a largely unexplored issue is the mechanism through which QQ bacteria interact with biofilm-forming bacteria. Here, we explore inter-species interactions during biofilm development (using 96-well polystyrene plates in a static incubator) between the QQ bacterium Rhodococcus sp. BH4 and sludge bacteria. Experimental results revealed that strain BH4 provoked both competitive (76%) and cooperative (24%) interactions (P < 0.05) in dual-species biofilms after 24 h of incubation (mature biofilm), implying that signal destruction by strain BH4 was strain-dependent. Besides hike in the biofilm biomass (~21%), amount of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (25-30 times) and particle size (3.5 times) in the Serratia sp. JSB1 biofilm were increased by str. BH4. This suggests that strain BH4 may only have quenching effects against certain bacteria, and that such effects are overlooked at the community level. Taken together, present results imply that in a given biofilm community, not all QS-bacteria interact similarly with Rhodococcus sp.

Biofilms of S. mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mitis were formed on saliva-coated glass slips in the absence or presence of d-galactose and evaluated by staining with 1 % crystal violet. d-Galactose significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of S. mutans at concentrations ranging from 2 μM to 200 mM but increased the biofilm formation of S. oralis and S. mitis at concentrations of 2-200 mM. d-Galactose significantly inhibited three glucosyltransferase genes, gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD. The effect of d-galactose in the form of solution and paste was evaluated using bovine teeth. Pretreatment with 100 mM d-galactose on bovine teeth resulted in significantly reduced S. mutans biofilm formation.

Adsorption of micropollutants onto granular activated carbon (GAC) in fixed-bed filters is often applied as a polishing step in the production of drinking water. Activated carbon can act as a carrier material for biofilm, hence biodegradation can be an additional removal mechanism for micropollutants in GAC filters. To assess the potential of biofilm to biodegrade micropollutants, it is necessary to distinguish adsorption from biodegradation as a removal mechanism. We performed experiments at 5 °C and 20 °C with biologically active and autoclaved GAC to assess the biodegradation of micropollutants by the biofilm grown on the GAC surface. Ten micropollutants were selected as model compounds. Three of them, iopromide, iopamidol and metformin, were biodegraded by the GAC biofilm. Additionally, we observed that temperature can increase or decrease adsorption, depending on the micropollutant studied. Finally, we compared the adsorption capacity of GAC used for more than 100,000 bed volumes and fresh GAC.

An economical and easy modification method with the carbon nanomaterials was applied. The carbon nanomaterials increased the electrochemically active surface areas and biomass content of the anodes and correspondingly effectively enhanced the generation of electricity and the removal rates of loss on ignition (LOI) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (phenanthrene and pyrene). During the steady period from 50 d to 110 d, the GO-SMFCs favored the enrichment of EAB and thus output the highest voltages of 30.60-48.61 mV. The GR-SMFCs and GO-SMFCs generated high electric power of approximate 0.98 ± 0.14 kJ and 0.87 ± 0.04 kJ, followed by CNT-SMFCs (0.57 ± 0.06 kJ) and GF-SMFCs (0.49 ± 0.07 kJ) during the 110 d operation.

The resultant coating has aggregation-induced emission character which can be used to observe the uniformity of the coating on a catheter and has a potential application as a fluorescence probe. It has been demonstrated that the PAA-co-PFDA/PHMB complex nanoparticle coatings can resist bacterial adhesion in physiological environment and exhibit excellent antibacterial activity in infection environment. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the PAA-co-PFDA/PHMB complex nanoparticle coated catheters exhibited excellent antibacterial activity and possessed good biocompatibility. This method is simple and scalable, which is important for future commercialization. The attractive multifunctional properties of the PAA-co-PFDA/PHMB complex nanoparticles, such as antifouling, antimicrobial, emission, and pH-responsive release character, have great potential application in a wide range of biomedical fields.","authors":[{"name":"Wenting Li"},{"name":"Hongxia Zhang"},{"name":"Xuelian Li"},{"name":"Huan Yu"},{"name":"Chaoyue Che"},{"name":"Shifang Luan"},{"name":"Yufang Ren"},{"name":"Sen Li"},{"name":"Peng Liu"},{"name":"Xiaoting Yu"},{"name":"Xue Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorododecyl acrylate"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"biocompatibility"},{"word":"fluorescence"},{"word":"poly(acrylic acid)"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"31951139","title":"Model-informed drug development in pulmonary delivery: Preclinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling for evaluation of treatments against chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections.","date":"2020-01-17","abs":"Antibiotic resistance is a major public health threat worldwide and among others, about 80% of cystic fibrosis patients have chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) lung infection resistant to many current antibiotics. Novel treatment strategies are therefore urgently needed. For lung infections, direct delivery of treatments to the site of action in the airway can achieve a higher local concentration with minimal systemic exposure and hence, avoid risks of unwanted systemic adverse effects. Previously, a rat preclinical disease model for PA chronic lung infections has been reported. However, the role of this disease model in the development of new treatment has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this study, tobramycin was used as a model antibiotic to evaluate the application of this preclinical disease model for PA treatments. The obtained data were used for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modelling. Plasma samples of tobramycin following pulmonary delivery via different types of dosing methods as well as growth and efficacy data from the chronic lung infection disease model following tobramycin treatment were collected for analysis and modelling. The developed PKPD model incorporates a semi-mechanistic description on biofilm development in chronic infections to allow a description of drug action on bacteria in different states (i.e. planktonic, biofilm and latent) and describes the available data from the efficacy study. The PKPD model can be used to support the application of the preclinical lung infection disease model by providing a quantitative description of the drug exposure-response relationship and a mechanistic platform to integrate all available PK and PKPD data with predictive capacity. With the support of appropriate experimental designs, the model can be further extended for other applications to, for instance, study the transition of bacteria between states and describe drug actions on biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Tom Aacute S Sou"},{"name":"Irena Kukavica-Ibrulj"},{"name":"Roger C Levesque"},{"name":"Lena E Friberg"},{"name":"Christel A S Bergström"}],"keywords":[]},"article302":{"pmid":"31950405","title":"Cadaverine reverse transporter (CadB protein) contributes to the virulence of Aeromonas veronii TH0426.","date":"2020-01-17","abs":"Aeromonas veronii is one of the main pathogens causing sepsis and ulcer syndrome in freshwater fish.

Currently, most of the research on A. veronii focuses on its isolation, identification, and drug susceptibility, whereas research on its virulence factors and pathogenesis mechanisms is relatively rare. In this study, we identified and obtained the highly expressed TH0426 cadaverine reverse transporter (CadB) of A. veronii. We used efficient suicide plasmid-mediated homologous recombination to delete the cadB gene in TH0426 and constructed a cadB deletion strain. The LD50 of ΔcadB was 93.2 times higher than that of TH0426 in zebrafish, the toxicity of ΔcadB was 9.5 times less than that of TH0426 in EPC cells, and the biofilm formation ability of ΔcadB was 5.6-fold greater than that of TH0426. In addition, motility detection results indicated that ΔcadB had lost its swimming ability. The results of flagellar staining and TEM demonstrated that ΔcadB shed the flagella. In summary, the virulence and adhesion of A. veronii TH0426 were significantly decreased by the deletion of cadB, which might provide a theoretical basis for research into A. veronii virulence factors.","authors":[{"name":"LuoTao Tao"},{"name":"YuanHuan Kang"},{"name":"Lei Zhang"},{"name":"Qiumei Shi"},{"name":"Ying Li"},{"name":"Tonglei Wu"},{"name":"Aidong Qian"},{"name":"WuWen Sun"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Shan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aeromonas veronii TH0426"},{"word":"CadB"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article303":{"pmid":"31949170","title":"Proton pump inhibitors act synergistically with fluconazole against resistant Candida albicans.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"The incidence of resistant Candida isolates, especially Candida albicans, has increased continuously.

This study aimed to determine the interactions of common clinically proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and fluconazole both in vitro and in vivo and to further explore the possible mechanisms. In vitro, the tested PPIs all acted synergistically with fluconazole against both resistant C. albicans planktonic cells and biofilms preformed for ≤12 h with the minimum inhibitory concentration of fluconazole decreased from >512 μg/mL to 1-4 μg/mL. In vivo, PPIs plus fluconazole prolonged the survival rate of infected Galleria mellonella larvae by two-fold compared with that for the fluconazole monotherapy group and significantly reduced the tissue damage of infected larvae. Mechanism studies showed that PPIs significantly suppressed efflux pump activity, which is the common resistance mechanism of C. albicans, and significantly inhibited the virulence factors: phospholipase activity and morphology switching. These findings will provide new insights into antifungal agent discovery and potential approaches for the treatment of candidiasis caused by resistant C. albicans.","authors":[{"name":"Mengjiao Lu"},{"name":"Haiying Yan"},{"name":"Cuixiang Yu"},{"name":"Lei Yuan"},{"name":"Shujuan Sun"}],"keywords":[]},"article304":{"pmid":"31948958","title":"Metagenomic Sequences of Three Drinking Water and Two Shower Hose Biofilm Samples Treated with or without Copper-Silver Ionization.","date":"2020-02-04","abs":"We announce five shotgun metagenomics data sets from two Norwegian premise plumbing systems.

Its composition may change when pathogenic microorganisms become dominating. Therefore, dental biofilm or plaque has been frequently investigated in the context of oral health and disease. Furthermore, its potential as an alternative matrix for analytical purposes has also been recognized in other disciplines like archeology, food sciences, and forensics. Thus, a careful in-depth characterization of dental plaque is worthwhile. Most of the conducted studies focused on the screening of microbial populations in dental plaque. Their lipid membranes, on the other hand, may significantly impact substance (metabolite) exchange within microbial colonies as well as xenobiotics uptake and incorporation into teeth. Under this umbrella, a comprehensive lipidomic profiling for determination of lipid compositions of in vivo dental plaque samples and of in vitro cultivated biofilm as surrogate matrix to be used for analytical purposes has been performed in this work. An untargeted lipidomics workflow utilizing a ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF) platform together with comprehensive SWATH (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra) acquisition and compatible software (MS-DIAL) that comprises a vast lipid library has been adopted to establish an extensive lipidomic fingerprint of dental plaque. The main lipid components in dental plaque were identified as triacylglycerols, followed by cholesterol, cholesteryl esters as well as diacylglycerols, and various phospholipid classes. In vivo plaque is a rare matrix which is usually available in very low amounts. When higher quantities for specific research assays are required, efficient ways to produce an appropriate surrogate matrix are mandatory. A potential surrogate matrix substituting dental plaque was prepared by cultivation of in vitro biofilm from saliva and similarities and differences in the lipidomics profile to in vivo plaque were mapped by statistical evaluation post-analysis. It was discovered that most lipid classes were highly elevated in the in vitro biofilm samples, in particular diacylglycerols, phosphatidylglycerols, and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). Furthermore, an overall shift from even-chain lipid species to odd-chain lipids was observed in the cultivated biofilms. On the other hand, even-chain phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lysoPCs, cholesteryl esters, and cholesterol-sulfate were shown to be specifically increased in plaque samples.

Mixed-volatile organic compound (VOC) utilization and biofilm-forming capabilities were evaluated to explain the dominance of Methylobacterium species in the ECs. The superior growth of all Methylobacterium species could be possible under mixed-VOC conditions.

Pili are some of the major contributors to the aggregator lifestyle, and succinoglycan exopolysaccharide production may be responsible for the biofilm formation. However, the coexistence of these two lifestyle Methylobacterium groups enhanced their biofilm formation compared to that with each single culture.","authors":[{"name":"Chulwoo Park"},{"name":"Hye Su Jung"},{"name":"Soyoon Park"},{"name":"Che Ok Jeon"},{"name":"Woojun Park"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Methylobacterium"},{"word":"aggregation"},{"word":"air-conditioning systems"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"genomes"},{"word":"volatile organic compounds"}]},"article321":{"pmid":"31941634","title":"A novel feedforward control strategy for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) in aerobic granular sludge sequential batch reactor (AGS-SBR).","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The nitrogen removal in the aerobic granular sludge sequential batch reactor (AGS-SBR) can be achieved by the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) mode, or by the separated nitrification and denitrification stages.

Bacterial adhesion to foreign material is one of the key risk factors associated with periprosthetic joint infection. The foreign material with large adhesion area might be also the UHMWPE (Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene) particles released during the wear process from the surface of articulating components. The purpose of this study is to evaluate potential adhesion areas of wear particles in relation to diverse distribution of the size and shapes of wear particles in periprosthetic tissue and to assess an increase in the risk of infectious complications associated with an increase in the adhesion area of wear particles. MATERIAL AND METHODS The size and morphology of model and real UHMWPE particles were determined with the use of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. By determining the morphological descriptors, the surfaces of individual particles for different distributions of polyethylene particles were calculated. When measuring the model wear particles, 6 model situations were simulated, in which comparisons with the control measurement by the BET (Brunauer-Emmet-Teller) method were made. RESULTS The variability of individual morphological descriptors demonstrates the effect on the total surface of particles. The calculated coefficient defines how many times the particle surface increases when corrected to the given descriptor (elongation, flattening, roughness, porosity). The total area of real wear particles at 1 year is 4,622 cm2, at 20 years it is 92,440 cm2. Based on our calculations, the area of particles where a biofilm is actually formed (approximately 50 bacteria may adhere to a particle of 3µm in diameter) is 809.5 cm2 at 1 year and 16,190 cm2 at 20 years. DISCUSSION According to the measurements, the size of the potential adhesion area of metal parts and polyethylene particles becomes equal already after several weeks of endoprosthesis usage and after a few years it is many times larger. The question is whether the risk of bacterial adhesion, i.e. also the risk of infectious complications of TEP actually increases. The clinical practice suggests that the number of infections e.g. 10, 15 or 20 years after the primary implantation is not statistically higher, despite the confirmed growth of potential adhesion area in the form of UHMWPE particles. This fact could be explained by a partially equal regulatory pathway of infection and polyethylene disease. The immune system stimulated by wear particles might better resist the hematogenic infection. CONCLUSIONS The study outcomes clearly indicate that the area of polyethylene wear particles considerably increases over time. In spite of the fact that only approximately 10% of wear particles show parameters (also with respect to the size of particles and bacteria) for potential bacterial adhesion, this area is many times larger than the area of metal parts of the endoprosthesis.

In addition, cell viability was confirmed by MTT assay. This MTT assay measures cell viability via metabolic activity, and the color intensity of the formazan correlates viable cells.

In planktonic cells, these changes were accompanied by decreasing and increasing adherence to hydrophobic surface and fibronectin, respectively.

Stream biofilms provide multiple functions in stream ecosystems, but their functional response to PPCP contaminants such as ciprofloxacin is unclear. To establish the effect of ciprofloxacin on aquatic biofilms, we colonized biofilms in situ on tiles (n = 80) at four sites along an urban stream in Gainesville, Florida, including two sites above and two sites below a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We then incubated the tiles and associated biofilms in the laboratory for 6 d exposing biofilms to either 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 μg/L (target concentrations) of ciprofloxacin. At the end of the 6 d laboratory exposure, we quantified gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), and biomass (as chlorophyll a) of biofilms, and calculated response ratios for each response. All response metrics were significantly differed across sites (p < 0.01). Ciprofloxacin significantly decreased GPP (p < 0.05) regardless of treatment concentration, most notably at the site immediately below the WWTP, where there was no measurable GPP on any ciprofloxacin-treated biofilms. In contrast, respiration (R) was not significantly affected by ciprofloxacin, despite an apparent increase in R at the WWTP site. However, the WWTP site R was significantly different from the most upstream and downstream sites (p < 0.001) but was not significantly different from a nearby site upstream of the WWTP (p > 0.05). These results indicate that chronic exposure to ciprofloxacin through WWTP effluent can alter ecosystem functions performed by biofilms, which can have consequences for higher trophic levels and stream processes.

Degradation experiments in the laboratory were performed in dark and light conditions, as well as after antibiotic supply, in order to characterize the eventual interactions between photoautotrophs and heterotrophs activity during glyphosate degradation. Fifty percent of the initial concentration of glyphosate (0.6 mM) was transformed into aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) after 9 days in presence or absence of light. Accordingly, the photoautotrophic DOM supply was not stimulating glyphosate degradation by microbial heterotrophs. This lack of response was probably explained by the low net primary production values and weak dissolved organic carbon production recorded in light treatments. The supply of the antibiotic drastically stopped glyphosate transformation demonstrating the central role of bacteria in the biodegradation of the herbicide. Glyphosate also modified the structure of prokaryotes assemblages in the consortium by increasing the relative abundances of Alphaproteobacteria and slightly decreasing those of Gammaproteobacteria.

Since the SaePQRS regulatory system is involved in the transcriptional control of multiple S. aureus virulence factors, the expression of several additional virulence genes was examined within a developing biofilm by introducing fluorescent gene reporter plasmids into wild-type S. aureus and isogenic regulatory mutants and growing these strains in a microfluidic system that supplies the bacteria with a constant flow of media while simultaneously imaging developing biofilms in 5-min intervals. This study demonstrated that multiple virulence genes, including nuc, were expressed stochastically within a specialized subpopulation of cells in nascent biofilms.

In this study, the ability of thymol (a monoterpenoid phenol isolated from plants) to inhibit biofilm formation and to eliminate mature biofilms, was assessed. We found that thymol could inhibit biofilm formation and remove mature biofilms by inhibiting the production of polysaccharide intracellular adhesin (PIA) and the release of extracellular DNA (eDNA).

Comparative histopathological analyses revealed that thymol reduced the pathological changes and inflammatory responses in the wounds. Assessments of white blood cell counts and serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels showed reduced inflammation and an increased immune response following treatment with thymol and vancomycin.

Previous studies suggested that certain bacteria employ the Cas proteins of CRISPR-Cas systems to target their own genes, which also alters the virulence during invasion of mammals. However, whether CRISPR-Cas systems in Salmonella have similar functions during bacterial invasion of host cells remains unknown. Here, we systematically analyzed the genes that are regulated by Cas3 in a type I-E CRISPR-Cas system and the virulence changes due to the deletion of cas3 in Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. Compared to the cas3 gene wild-type (cas3 WT) Salmonella strain, cas3 deletion upregulated the lsrFGBE genes in lsr (luxS regulated) operon related to quorum sensing (QS) and downregulated biofilm-forming-related genes and Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) genes related to the type three secretion system (T3SS). Consistently, the biofilm formation ability was downregulated in the cas3 deletion mutant (Δcas3). The bacterial invasive and intracellular capacity of Δcas3 to host cells was also reduced, thereby increasing the survival of infected host cells and live chickens. By the transcriptome-wide screen (RNA-Seq), we found that the cas3 gene impacts a series of genes related to QS, the flagellum, and SPI-1-T3SS system, thereby altering the virulence phenotypes.

Furthermore, adhesion and motility-associated factors, such as Cwp84, SlpA, and flagella, have shown to increase the adhesion efficiency to host epithelia, cell internalization, and the formation of biofilm. Finally, biofilm confers to C. difficile protection from antibiotics and acts as a reservoir for spores that allow the persistence of the infection in the host. In this review, we describe the key virulence factors of C. difficile that have been associated with recurrent infections.","authors":[{"name":"Laura Tijerina-Rodríguez"},{"name":"Licet Villarreal-Treviño"},{"name":"Rayo Morfín-Otero"},{"name":"Adrián Camacho-Ortíz"},{"name":"E Garza-González"}],"keywords":[]},"article360":{"pmid":"31933178","title":"Effects of human β-defensin 3 fused with carbohydrate-binding domain on the function of type III secretion system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides are considered to be one of the candidate antimicrobial agents for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection in the future.

Phages have evolved multiple mechanisms to target their bacterial hosts, such as high-affinity, environmentally hardy receptor-binding proteins. However, traditional phage therapy suffers from multiple challenges stemming from the use of an exponentially replicating, evolving entity whose biology is not fully characterized (e.g., potential gene transduction). To address this problem, we conjugate the phages to gold nanorods, creating a reagent that can be destroyed upon use (termed phanorods). Chimeric phages were engineered to attach specifically to several Gram-negative organisms, including the human pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae, and the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris The bioconjugated phanorods could selectively target and kill specific bacterial cells using photothermal ablation. Following excitation by near-infrared light, gold nanorods release energy through nonradiative decay pathways, locally generating heat that efficiently kills targeted bacterial cells. Specificity was highlighted in the context of a P. aeruginosa biofilm, in which phanorod irradiation killed bacterial cells while causing minimal damage to epithelial cells. Local temperature and viscosity measurements revealed highly localized and selective ablation of the bacteria. Irradiation of the phanorods also destroyed the phages, preventing replication and reducing potential risks of traditional phage therapy while enabling control over dosing. The phanorod strategy integrates the highly evolved targeting strategies of phages with the photothermal properties of gold nanorods, creating a well-controlled platform for systematic killing of bacterial cells.","authors":[{"name":"Huan Peng"},{"name":"Raymond E Borg"},{"name":"Liam P Dow"},{"name":"Beth L Pruitt"},{"name":"Irene A Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"gold nanorods"},{"word":"phage therapy"}]},"article364":{"pmid":"31932380","title":"Minocycline-EDTA-Ethanol Antimicrobial Catheter Lock Solution Is Highly Effective In Vitro for Eradication of Candida auris Biofilms.","date":"2020-03-26","abs":"Candida auris is an emerging pathogen that can cause virulent central-line-associated bloodstream infections.

We found that mupirocin increased the ability of MRSA cells to attach to surfaces and form biofilms. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) demonstrated that mupirocin treatment promoted thicker biofilm formation, which also correlated with the production of extracellular DNA (eDNA). Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) results revealed that this effect was largely due to the involvement of holin-like and antiholin-like proteins (encoded by the cidA gene), which are responsible for modulating cell death and lysis during biofilm development. We found that cidA expression levels significantly increased by 6.05- to 35.52-fold (P < 0.01) after mupirocin administration. We generated a cidA-deficient mutant of the USA300 S. aureus strain.

Importantly, polymicrobial infection with P. aeruginosa elicited significantly higher S. maltophilia counts in bronchoalveolar lavages and lung tissue homogenates. This increase in bacterial load was directly correlated with the density of the P. aeruginosa population and required viable P. aeruginosa bacteria. Microscopic analysis of biofilms formed in vitro revealed that S. maltophilia formed well-integrated biofilms with P. aeruginosa, and these organisms colocalize in the lung during dual-species infection.

Entering one of the two colonization programs, swarming motility or sessility, involves differential regulation of many genes, resulting in a dramatic shift in physiology and behavior. V. parahaemolyticus has evolved complex regulation to control these two processes that have opposing outcomes. One mechanism relies on the balance of the second messenger c-di-GMP, where high c-di-GMP favors biofilm formation. V. parahaemolyticus possesses four homologous regulators, the Scr transcription factors, that belong in a Vibrio-specific family of W[F/L/M][T/S]R motif transcriptional regulators, some members of which have been demonstrated to bind c-di-GMP. In this work, we explore the role of these Scr regulators in biofilm development. We show that each protein binds c-di-GMP, that this binding requires a critical R in the binding motif, and that the biofilm-relevant activities of CpsQ, CpsS, and ScrO but not ScrP are dependent upon second messenger binding. ScrO and CpsQ are the primary drivers of biofilm formation, as biofilms are eliminated when both of these regulators are absent. ScrO is most important for capsule expression. CpsQ is most important for RTX-matrix protein expression, although it contributes to capsule expression when c-di-GMP levels are high. Both regulators contribute to O-antigen ligase expression. ScrP works oppositely in a minor role to repress the ligase gene. CpsS plays a regulatory checkpointing role by negatively modulating expression of these biofilm-pertinent genes under fluctuating c-di-GMP conditions.

Several abiotic factors such as water temperature, pipe material and disinfection regime affect the colonization of cooling towers by L. pneumophila. The local physical and biological factors promoting the growth of L. pneumophila in water systems and its spatial distribution are not well understood. Therefore, we built a lab-scale cooling tower to study the dynamics of L. pneumophila colonization in relationship to the resident microbiota and spatial distribution. The pilot was filled with water from an operating cooling tower harboring low levels of L. pneumophila. It was seeded with Vermamoeba vermiformis, a natural host of L. pneumophila, and then inoculated with L. pneumophila. After 92 days of operation, the pilot was disassembled, the water was collected, and biofilm was extracted from the pipes. The microbiome was studied using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes amplicon sequencing. The communities of the water and of the biofilm were highly dissimilar. The relative abundance of Legionella in water samples reached up to 11% whereas abundance in the biofilm was extremely low (≤0.5%). In contrast, the host cells were mainly present in the biofilm. This suggests that L. pneumophila grows in host cells associated with biofilm and is then released back into the water following host cell lysis. In addition, water temperature shaped the bacterial and eukaryotic community of the biofilm, indicating that different parts of the systems may have different effects on Legionella growth.","authors":[{"name":"Adriana Torres Paniagua"},{"name":"Kiran Paranjape"},{"name":"Mengqi Hu"},{"name":"Emilie Bédard"},{"name":"Sébastien P Faucher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cooling towers"},{"word":"Legionella pneumophila"},{"word":"Microbiome"},{"word":"Pilot"},{"word":"Temperature"}]},"article371":{"pmid":"31931147","title":"Activity of pulmonary vancomycin exposures versus planktonic and biofilm isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from cystic fibrosis sputum.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"Vancomycin is commonly used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease.

This work reports the development of an efficient electroactive bacterial community within ceramic-based MFCs fed with human urine in the absence of sludge inoculum. The results show the development of a uniform bacterial community with power output levels equal to or higher than those generated from MFCs inoculated with sludge.

The results showed that the efficiency of enzymatic cleaning was 87.1% when it was evaluated at 55°C for 30 min, and with a medium of pH 8.5. No difference was found from the efficacy in eliminating dairy fouling observed for the chemical cleaning (86.9%). The fluorescence microscopy proved useful for determining the organic solid components in the outer layer of the dairy fouling. The fouling spatial disposition in 3 dimensions, obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy, showed that it was formed of 51.3% sugars, 9.3% fats, and 39.4% proteins, with the enzymatic cleaning of these compounds being homogeneous, compared with chemical cleaning. The protein and lipid contents were in the surface layer, whereas sugars were located in the innermost part that contributes to the Maillard reaction during fouling formation. After enzymatic cleaning, the reduction in the concentration of Ca and P was 71.61 and 74.67%, respectively, compared with fouling intact. Thus, enzymatic cleaning, without the accumulation of Na from chemical cleaning, leaves 1.5 times less mineral than chemical cleaning. Knowing the content and structure of fouling in the industry helps to formulate better products to achieve proper levels of cleanliness.

One of them is quorum quenching (QQ) that disrupts microbial communication.

There are different techniques used for testing QS/QQ, including chromatography-mass spectroscopy, bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, fluorescence, electrochemistry, and colorimetry. They all enable qualitative and quantitative measurements of QS/QQ molecules. This article gathers the information about the mechanisms of QS and QQ, and their effect on microbial biofilm formation.

Methods The present study was undertaken to investigate the biofilm-forming ability, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production of seven uropathogenic isolates comprising both Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The morphological, cultural and biochemical tests for the identification of the isolates, antibiotic susceptibility test, detection of ESBL production, biofilm formation on 96-well microtiter plate and Congo red agar (CRA) media are performed. Results The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles obtained in this study showed that the most active drugs gentamicin, amikacin and imipenem (100% sensitivity) were followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (85% sensitivity), co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin (57% sensitivity) ceftazidime and kanamycin (50% sensitivity). All the isolates showed resistance to amoxicillin followed by ceftriaxone and cefotaxime (71% resistance), and the scenario gets more complicated because of the production of ESBL by five isolates (three E. coli isolates and two K. pneumoniae). The strains were also able to form biofilm as tested on CRA medium and by microtiter plate assay. The correlation between ESBL, non-ESBL and biofilm-producing E. coli and K. pneumonia was determined along with the multiple drug resistance patterns of E. coli and K. pneumonia. Conclusions The findings of the study indicate that the emergence and rapid spread of such multidrug-resistant pathogens are of great concern.

Effects of increasingly stressful levels of air pollutants on the microbial structure of biofilms within BTFs are not well understood, especially for VOCs such as styrene. To investigate the relationship between biofilm biodiversity and operational stability, the temporal dynamics of a biofilm from a biotrickling filter subjected to stepwise increasing levels of air polluted with styrene was investigated using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). As styrene contaminant loads were increased, microbial community composition was distinctly altered and diversity was initially reduced in early stages but gradually stabilized and increased diversity in later stages, suggesting a recovery and acclimatization period within the microbial community during incremental exposure of the pollutant. Although temporary reductions in known styrene-degrading bacterial genera (Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus) occurred under increased styrene loads, stable BTF performance was maintained due to functional redundancy. New candidate genera for styrene degradation (Azoarcus, Dokdonella) were identified in conditions of high styrene loads, and may have supported the observed stable BTF performance throughout the experiment. Styrene inlet load was found to be important modulator of community composition and may have been partly responsible for the observed temporary reductions of Pseudomonas. Notable differences between dominant genera detected via pyrosequencing compared to species detected by PCR-DGGE suggests that simultaneous implementation of both techniques is valuable for fully characterizing dynamic microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Kevin J Portune"},{"name":"M Carmen Pérez"},{"name":"Javier Álvarez-Hornos"},{"name":"Carmen Gabaldón"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biotrickling filter"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Pyrosequencing"},{"word":"Styrene"},{"word":"qPCR"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"31927002","title":"Suppressing the phenotypic virulence factors of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli using marine polysaccharide.","date":"2020-02-20","abs":"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is one of the keystone pathogen that cause 80-90% of community acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) and Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs).
