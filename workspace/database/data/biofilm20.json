New anti-Pseudomonas compounds and strategies are necessary, as the current antimicrobial approaches for the inhibition of biofilm formation and, above all, the eradication of formed biofilms are ineffective. Compounds that belong to the furoxan family, which are well-known NO donors, have recently been shown to display anti-Pseudomonas activity. The present study investigates three furoxan compounds that are substituted at the hetero-ring with electron-withdrawing groups (NO2, CN, CONH2) for their effects on P. aeruginosa PAO1 growth and biofilm formation/dispersal. Of the furoxans tested, only 3-nitro-4-phenylfuroxan (KN455) inhibited the growth of suspended P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures. Furthermore, KN455 inhibited the formation of both younger and older biofilms with very high yields and thus proved itself to be toxic to planktonic subpopulations. It also displayed moderate eradicating power. The activity of KN455 does not appear to be related to its capacity to release small amounts of NO. Interestingly, the isomer 4-nitro-3-phenylfuroxan (KN454), included for comparison, displayed a comparable antibiofilm rate, but did not show the same antimicrobial activity against suspended cells and planktonic subpopulations. While hypotheses as to the mechanism of action have been formulated, further investigations are necessary to shed light onto the antimicrobial activity of this furoxan.","authors":[{"name":"Viviana Teresa Orlandi"},{"name":"Fabrizio Bolognese"},{"name":"Barbara Rolando"},{"name":"Stefano Guglielmo"},{"name":"Loretta Lazzarato"},{"name":"Roberta Fruttero"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"furazans"},{"word":"furoxans"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"30299574","title":"Multiple roles and diverse regulation of the Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway in Candida albicans.","date":"2019-07-29","abs":"Candida albicans is a major fungal pathogen of humans, causing both superficial and life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised people. The conserved Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway plays a key role in regulating multiple traits important for the virulence of C. albicans such as cell growth, yeast-hyphal transition, white-opaque switching, sexual reproduction and biofilm development. Diverse external signals influence cell physiology by activating this signaling pathway. The key components of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway include two Ras GTPases (Ras1 and Ras2), an adenylyl cyclase (Cyr1, also known as Cdc35), two cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (Pde1 and Pde2) and the catalytic (Tpk1 and Tpk2) and regulatory (Bcy1) subunits of PKA kinase. Activation of this pathway dramatically alters the gene expression profile via several transcription factors, leading to the activation of specific biological processes. Here, we review the progress made in the past two decades to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway senses diverse environmental cues and controls specific cellular responses and its connection with other signaling pathways in C. albicans.","authors":[{"name":"Guanghua Huang"},{"name":"Qian Huang"},{"name":"Yujia Wei"},{"name":"Yue Wang"},{"name":"Han Du"}],"keywords":[]},"article2":{"pmid":"30299554","title":"Nitric oxide inhibits biofilm formation by Vibrio fischeri via the nitric oxide sensor HnoX.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Nitric oxide (NO) is an important defense molecule secreted by the squid Euprymna scolopes and sensed by the bacterial symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, via the NO sensor HnoX. HnoX inhibits colonization through an unknown mechanism. The genomic location of hnoX adjacent to hahK, a recently identified positive regulator of biofilm formation, suggested that HnoX may inhibit colonization by controlling biofilm formation, a key early step in colonization. Indeed, the deletion of hnoX resulted in early biofilm formation in vitro, an effect that was dependent on HahK and its putative phosphotransfer residues. An allele of hnoX that encodes a protein with increased activity severely delayed wrinkled colony formation. Control occurred at the level of transcription of the syp genes, which produce the polysaccharide matrix component. The addition of NO abrogated biofilm formation and diminished syp transcription, effects that required HnoX. Finally, an hnoX mutant formed larger symbiotic biofilms. This work has thus uncovered a host-relevant signal controlling biofilm and a mechanism for the inhibition of biofilm formation by V. fischeri. The study of V. fischeri HnoX permits us to understand not only host-associated biofilm mechanisms, but also the function of HnoX domain proteins as regulators of important bacterial processes.","authors":[{"name":"Cecilia M Thompson"},{"name":"Alice H Tischler"},{"name":"Denise A Tarnowski"},{"name":"Mark J Mandel"},{"name":"Karen L Visick"}],"keywords":[]},"article3":{"pmid":"30298931","title":"Synergistic antibacterial effects of Buddleja albiflora metabolites with antibiotics against Listeria monocytogenes.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"Some plants of Buddleja genus possessed antimicrobial activity.

This leads to a significant reduction in P gingivalis virulence potential, including its ability to colonize on the surface of Streptococcus gordonii, to invade human oral epithelial cells, and to produce gingipains. In this study, we showed that SAPP had minimal cytotoxicity to human oral keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts. We observed that SAPP directly bound to the cell surface of P gingivalis, and that alterations in the sequence at the N-terminus of SAPP diminished its abilities to interact with P gingivalis cells and repressed the expression of virulence genes. Most strikingly, we demonstrated using an ex-vivo assay that besides its inhibitory activity against P gingivalis colonization, SAPP could also reduce the levels of several other oral Gram-negative bacteria strongly associated with periodontitis in multispecies biofilms.

The integration of health-promoting probiotics into naturally fermented milk products could make a profound impact on human health. Here, we characterize the bacterial community composition of a naturally fermented milk product (lait caillé) from northern Senegal, prepared in wooden bowls (lahals) with a bacterial biofilm to steer the fermentation process. We incorporated a probiotic starter culture containing the most documented probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (generic strain name yoba 2012) into the local fermentation process. Bar-coded 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of lait caillé samples indicated that the bacterial community of lait caillé has high species richness with over 100 bacterial genera; however, few have high abundance. In contrast to the diverse bacterial compositions of other characterized naturally fermented milk products, the composition of lait caillé predominantly consists of the lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus and Lactobacillus, resembling the bacterial composition in regular yogurt. The bacterial community composition of lait caillé varies geographically based on the presence of some genera, including Lactoccoccus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacillus, but this trend is not consistent within production communities. The diversity of bacterial communities is much higher in the lahal biofilm than in the naturally fermented milk products, which is in turn greater than in commercial yogurts. Addition of a starter culture with L. rhamnosus yoba 2012 to milk in lahals led to substantial growth of this probiotic bacterium during the fermentation process. Two independent quantitative PCR-analyses specific for L. rhamnosus yoba 2012 indicated a 20- to 60-fold increase in the total number of probiotic bacteria in the first batch after inoculation. A similar increase of the probiotic was observed in a variation of lait caillé prepared with carbohydrate-rich millet granules (thiakry) added prior to fermentation.

The Mannich bases seemed to block Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway by inhibiting second messenger activity required for hyphal induction and biofilm formation.

Here, we track the evolution of pellicle biofilms formed through genetic division of labour and ask whether partially deficient partners can evolve autonomy. Pellicles of Bacillus subtilis rely on an extracellular matrix composed of exopolysaccharide (EPS) and the fibre protein TasA. In monocultures, ∆eps and ∆tasA mutants fail to form pellicles, but, facilitated by cooperation, they succeed in co-culture. Interestingly, cooperation collapses on an evolutionary timescale and ∆tasA gradually outcompetes its partner ∆eps. Pellicle formation can evolve independently from division of labour in ∆eps and ∆tasA monocultures, by selection acting on the residual matrix component, TasA or EPS, respectively. Using a set of interdisciplinary tools, we unravel that the TasA producer (∆eps) evolves via an unconventional but reproducible substitution in TasA that modulates the biochemical properties of the protein. Conversely, the EPS producer (ΔtasA) undergoes genetically variable adaptations, all leading to enhanced EPS secretion and biofilms with different biomechanical properties. Finally, we revisit the collapse of division of labour between Δeps and ΔtasA in light of a strong frequency versus exploitability trade-off that manifested in the solitarily evolving partners. We propose that such trade-off differences may represent an additional barrier to evolution of division of labour between genetically distinct microorganisms.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Dragoš"},{"name":"Marivic Martin"},{"name":"Carolina Falcón García"},{"name":"Lara Kricks"},{"name":"Patrick Pausch"},{"name":"Thomas Heimerl"},{"name":"Balázs Bálint"},{"name":"Gergely Maróti"},{"name":"Gert Bange"},{"name":"Daniel López"},{"name":"Oliver Lieleg"},{"name":"Ákos T Kovács"}],"keywords":[]},"article12":{"pmid":"30297525","title":"A Nonfimbrial Adhesin of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Mediates Biofilm Biogenesis.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by polymicrobial biofilms.

However, in the absence of fimbriae, A. actinomycetemcomitans still retains the potential to form robust biofilms, suggesting that other surface macromolecules participate in biofilm development. Here, isogenic mutant strains lacking EmaA structures, but still expressing fimbriae, were observed to have reduced biofilm potential. In strains lacking both EmaA and fimbriae, biofilm mass was reduced by 80%. EmaA enhanced biofilm formation in different strains, independent of the fimbriation state or serotype. Confocal microscopy revealed differences in cell density within microcolonies between the EmaA positive and mutant strains. EmaA-mediated biofilm formation was found to be independent of the glycosylation state and the precise three-dimensional conformation of the protein, and thus this function is uncorrelated with collagen binding activity.

In addition to the general recalcitrance of biofilm bacteria, high bacterial loads in biofilm-associated infections significantly diminish the efficacy of antimicrobials due to a low per-cell antibiotic concentration.

In the present study, we applied automated confocal microscopy on Pseudomonas aeruginosa to monitor dynamic killing of biofilm-grown bacteria by tobramycin and colistin in real time. We revealed that the time required for surviving bacteria to repopulate the biofilm could be taken as a measure for effectiveness of the antimicrobial treatment. It depends on the (i) nature and concentration of the antibiotic, (ii) duration of antibiotic treatment, (iii) application as monotherapy or combination therapy, and (iv) interval of drug administration. The vicious cycle of killing and repopulation of biofilm bacteria could also be broken in an in vivo model system by applying successive antibiotic dosages at intervals that do not allow full reconstitution of the biofilm communities. Treatment regimens that consider the important aspects of antimicrobial killing kinetics bear the potential to improve control of biofilm regrowth.

Here, we have investigated the production and functional activities of EVs in a surface-associated microbial community or biofilm of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Crowded communities like biofilms are a context in which EVs are likely to function. Biofilms are noteworthy because they are encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix and because biofilm cells exhibit extreme tolerance to antimicrobial compounds. We found that biofilm EVs are distinct from those produced by free-living planktonic cells and display strong parallels in composition to biofilm matrix material. The functions of biofilm EVs were delineated with a panel of mutants defective in orthologs of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) subunits, which are required for normal EV production in diverse eukaryotes. Most ESCRT-defective mutations caused reduced biofilm EV production, reduced matrix polysaccharide levels, and greatly increased sensitivity to the antifungal drug fluconazole. Matrix accumulation and drug hypersensitivity of ESCRT mutants were reversed by addition of wild-type (WT) biofilm EVs. Vesicle complementation showed that biofilm EV function derives from specific cargo proteins. Our studies indicate that C. albicans biofilm EVs have a pivotal role in matrix production and biofilm drug resistance.

Immunocompromised individuals, such as those undergoing chemotherapy, are most susceptible to fungal infections. With a growing population of immunocompromised patients, there are many reports of increasing numbers of infections and of fungal strains resistant to current antifungals. One way to treat drug-resistant infections is to administer combinations of drugs to patients. Azoles are the most prescribed antifungals, as they are broad-spectrum and orally bioavailable. Terfenadine (TERF) and ebastine (EBA) are second-generation antihistamines, with EBA being used in many countries. In this study, we explored combinations of seven azole antifungals and two antihistamines (TERF and EBA) against a panel of 13 Candida fungal strains. We found 55 out of 91 combinations tested of TERF and EBA against the various fungal strains to be synergistic with the azoles. To evaluate the efficiency of these combinations to inhibit fungal growth, we performed time-kill assays. We also investigated the ability of these combinations to disrupt biofilm formation. Finally, we tested the specificity of the combinations towards fungal cells by mammalian cytotoxicity assays.

To address this, we investigated the physiological role of Acp3 in P. aeruginosa. We found that expression of Acp3 dramatically increases in the log phase of cell growth and that its transcription is under the control of the QS regulators LasR and RhlR. Deletion of acp3 from P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 results in thicker biofilm formation, increased resistance of the strain to hydrogen peroxide, and higher persistence in a mouse infection model. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) experiments revealed several novel protein-binding partners of Acp3, including KatA, the major catalase in P. aeruginosa. Acp3 was found to repress the catalase activity of KatA and, consistent with inhibition by Acp3, less reactive oxygen species are present in the acp3 deletion strain. Overall, our study reveals that Acp3 has a distinct function from that of the canonical AcpP and may be involved in the oxidative stress response.","authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen"},{"name":"Bo Wang"},{"name":"Jordon D Gruber"},{"name":"Yong-Mei Zhang"},{"name":"Christopher Davies"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. aeruginosa"},{"word":"acyl carrier protein"},{"word":"catalase"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article26":{"pmid":"30294311","title":"Characterization and Salt Response in Recurrent Halotolerant Exiguobacterium sp.

A halotolerant Exiguobacterium strain was isolated from Salar de Huasco (Chilean Altiplano), a well-known shallow lake area with variable salinity levels, little human intervention, and extreme environmental conditions, which makes it ideal for the study of resistant mechanisms and the evolution of adaptations. This bacterial genus has not been extensively studied, although its cosmopolitan location indicates that it has high levels of plasticity and adaptive capacity. However, to date, there are no studies regarding the tolerance and resistance to salinity and osmotic pressure. We set out to characterize the Exiguobacterium sp. SH31 strain and describe its phenotypical and genotypical response to osmotic stress. In this context, as a first step to characterize the response to the SH31 strain to salinity and to establish the bases for a molecular study, we proposed to compare its response under three salt conditions (0, 25, and 50 g/l NaCl). Using different physiology, genomic, and transcriptomic approaches, we determined that the bacterium is able to grow properly in a NaCl concentration of up to 50 g/l; however, the best growth rate was observed at 25 g/l. Although the presence of flagella is not affected by salinity, motility was diminished at 25 g/l NaCl and abolished at 50 g/l. Biofilm formation was induced proportionally with increases in salinity, which was expected. These phenotypic results correlated with the expression of related genes: fliG and fliS Motility); opuBA and putP (transport); glnA, proC, gltA, and gbsA (compatible solutes); ywqC, bdlA, luxS y pgaC (biofilm and stress response); and therefore, we conclude that this strain effectively modifies gene expression and physiology in a differential manner when faced with different concentrations of NaCl and these modifications aid survival.","authors":[{"name":"Francisco Remonsellez"},{"name":"Juan Castro-Severyn"},{"name":"Coral Pardo-Esté"},{"name":"Pablo Aguilar"},{"name":"Jonathan Fortt"},{"name":"Cesar Salinas"},{"name":"Sergio Barahona"},{"name":"Joice León"},{"name":"Bárbara Fuentes"},{"name":"Carlos Areche"},{"name":"Klaudia L Hernández"},{"name":"Daniel Aguayo"},{"name":"Claudia P Saavedra"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chilean Altiplano"},{"word":"Exiguobacterium"},{"word":"environmental pressure"},{"word":"extremophile"},{"word":"halotolerant"}]},"article27":{"pmid":"30293004","title":"Eco-friendly non-biocide-release coatings for marine biofouling prevention.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Environmental concerns have been changing the way of looking for solutions to problems.

In order to minimize these side effects, two biocides, Irgarol (I) and Econea (E), were covalently attached to polyurethane (PU) and foul-release silicone based (PDMS) marine paints through an isocyanate linker.

Distinct microbial assemblages between microplastics and surrounding waters have been well documented; however, there is insufficient knowledge regarding biofilm colonization of plastic and non-plastic substrates, despite the fact that microbial communities generally aggregate on natural solid surfaces. In this study, the effects of substrate type on microbial communities were evaluated by incubation of biofilms on microplastic substrates (polyethylene and polypropylene) and natural substrates (cobblestone and wood) for 21 days under controlled conditions. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that the alpha diversity (richness, evenness, and diversity) was lower in the microplastic-associated communities than in those on the natural substrates, indicating substrate-type-coupled species sorting. Distinct community structure and biofilm composition were observed between these two substrate types. Significantly higher abundances of Pirellulaceae, Phycisphaerales, Cyclobacteriaceae, and Roseococcus were observed on the microplastic substrates compared with the natural substrates. Simultaneously, the functional profiles (KEGG) predicted by Tax4Fun showed that the pathways of amino acid metabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were increased in biofilms on the microplastic substrates. The findings illustrate that microplastic acts as a distinct microbial habitat (compared with natural substrates) that could not only change the community structure but also affect microbial functions, potentially impacting the ecological functions of microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Lingzhan Miao"},{"name":"Peifang Wang"},{"name":"Jun Hou"},{"name":"Yu Yao"},{"name":"Zhilin Liu"},{"name":"Songqi Liu"},{"name":"Tengfei Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Metabolic pathways"},{"word":"Microplastic"},{"word":"Species sorting"},{"word":"Substrate type"}]},"article29":{"pmid":"30292933","title":"Towards biomimics of cell membranes: Structural effect of phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP","date":"2019-03-22","abs":"Phosphoinositide (PIP) lipids are anionic phospholipids playing a fundamental role for the activity of several transmembrane and soluble proteins.

Moreover, biofilms represent a medical challenge since the inherent antibiotic resistance of their producers demands the use of high doses of antibiotics over prolonged periods. Frequently, these therapeutic measures fail, contributing to bacterial persistence, therefore demanding the development of novel antimicrobials. Esters of bicyclic amines (EBAs), which are strong inhibitors of Streptococcus pneumoniae growth, were initially designed as inhibitors of pneumococcal choline-binding proteins on the basis of their structural analogy to the choline residues in the cell wall. However, instead of mimicking the characteristic cell chaining phenotype caused by exogenously added choline on planktonic cultures of pneumococcal cells, EBAs showed an unexpected lytic activity. In this work we demonstrate that EBAs display a second, and even more important, function as cell membrane destabilizers. We then assayed the inhibitory and disintegrating activity of these molecules on pneumococcal biofilms. The selected compound (EBA 31) produced the highest effect on S. pneumoniae (encapsulated and non-encapsulated) biofilms at very low concentrations. EBA 31 was also effective on mixed biofilms of non-encapsulated S. pneumoniae plus non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, two pathogens frequently forming a self-produced biofilm in the human nasopharynx.

DAIR (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 6.27; P = .01) and MRSA infection (aHR, 4.07; P = .009) were independently associated with treatment failure. Rifampin-based combination treatments exhibited independent protective effects on recurrence (aHR, 0.23; P = .02). In conclusion, among patients with S aureus spinal implant infections, MRSA and DAIR were independent risk factors for treatment failure, and these risk factors were present in the majority of patients. In this difficult-to-treat population, the overall treatment failure rate was 36%; rifampin may improve the outcomes of patients with S aureus spinal implant infections.","authors":[{"name":"Oh-Hyun Cho"},{"name":"In-Gyu Bae"},{"name":"Song Mi Moon"},{"name":"Seong Yeon Park"},{"name":"Yee Gyung Kwak"},{"name":"Baek-Nam Kim"},{"name":"Shi Nae Yu"},{"name":"Min Hyok Jeon"},{"name":"Tark Kim"},{"name":"Eun Ju Choo"},{"name":"Eun Jung Lee"},{"name":"Tae Hyong Kim"},{"name":"Seong-Ho Choi"},{"name":"Jin-Won Chung"},{"name":"Kyung-Chung Kang"},{"name":"Jung Hee Lee"},{"name":"Yu-Mi Lee"},{"name":"Mi Suk Lee"},{"name":"Ki-Ho Park"}],"keywords":[]},"article45":{"pmid":"30290269","title":"Molecular docking, and anti-biofilm activity of gold-complexed sulfonamides on Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-01-28","abs":"The antibacterial activity of sulfadiazine Au-PPh","authors":[{"name":"Caren Rigon Mizdal"},{"name":"Sílvio Terra Stefanello"},{"name":"Pablo Andrei Nogara"},{"name":"Félix Alexandre Antunes Soares"},{"name":"Lenice de Lourenço Marques"},{"name":"Marli Matiko Anraku de Campos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Gold-complexed sulfonamides"},{"word":"LasR"},{"word":"PA01"}]},"article46":{"pmid":"30290265","title":"Role of cell division protein divIVA in Enterococcus faecalis pathogenesis, biofilm and drug resistance: A future perspective by in silico approaches.","date":"2019-01-28","abs":"Antibiotics resistance is the major problem in clinical settings which leads to the emergence of drug resistant bacteria.

The results reported here reveal that when the potential of the electrode is changed from relatively oxidizing (0.40 V vs. SHE) to reducing (-0.55 V vs. SHE) and then back to oxidizing, 70% of c-Cyt residing closest to the biofilm/electrode (within hundreds of nm from the electrode surface) appear to remain trapped in the reduced state, requiring as long as 12 hours to be re-oxidized. c-Cyt storing electrons cannot contribute to EET, yet turnover current resulting from cellular oxidation of acetate coupled with EET to the electrode surface is unaffected. This suggests that a relatively small fraction of c-Cyt residing closest to the biofilm/electrode interface is involved in EET while the majority store electrons. The results also reveal that biomass density at the biofilm/electrode interface increases rapidly during lag phase, reaching its maximum value at the onset of exponential biofilm growth when turnover current begins to rapidly increase.","authors":[{"name":"Joel Golden"},{"name":"Matthew D Yates"},{"name":"Michelle Halsted"},{"name":"Leonard Tender"}],"keywords":[]},"article48":{"pmid":"30288586","title":"Effect of thyme essential oil against Bacillus cereus planktonic growth and biofilm formation.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of thyme essential oil (TEO) on the planktonic growth and biofilm formation of Bacillus cereus (B. cereus).

Molecular characterization was performed using massively parallel sequencing to obtain a taxonomic and functional gene classification. Also, samples from the drainage system were evaluated because microorganisms may travel over the 12-meter column of the pool water of the Brazilian Nuclear Power Plant (Angra1), which has been functioning since 1985.

Ustilaginomycetes (Basidiomycota) was the major class contributor (70%) in the SFP and FTC reflecting the little diversity in these sites; nevertheless, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes (Bacilli) were present in small proportions. Mapping total reads against six fungal reference genomes indicate that there is, in fact, a high abundance of fungal sequences in samples collected from SFP and FTC. Analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2 regions and the protein found in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells, cytochrome b (cytb) grouped our sample fungi in the clade 7 as Ustilago and Pseudozyma.

These populations evolved for 90 days (approximately 600 generations) under all combinations of high or low carbon availability and selection for either planktonic or biofilm modes of growth. Populations that evolved in environments with shared selection pressures (either level of carbon availability or mode of growth) were more genetically similar to each other than populations from environments that shared neither characteristic. However, not all shared selection pressures led to parallel evolution. Genetic parallelism between low-carbon biofilm and low-carbon planktonic populations was very low despite shared selection for growth under low-carbon conditions, suggesting that evolution in low-carbon environments may generate stronger trade-offs between biofilm and planktonic modes of growth. For all environments, a population's fitness in a particular environment was positively correlated with the genetic similarity between that population and the populations that evolved in that particular environment. Although genetic similarity was low between low-carbon environments, overall, evolution in similar environments led to higher levels of genetic parallelism and that genetic parallelism, in turn, was correlated with fitness in a particular environment.","authors":[{"name":"Caroline B Turner"},{"name":"Christopher W Marshall"},{"name":"Vaughn S Cooper"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Burkholderia"},{"word":"experimental evolution"},{"word":"nutrient limitation"},{"word":"parallel evolution"},{"word":"whole‐population sequencing"}]},"article57":{"pmid":"30283433","title":"Bicarbonate Inhibits Bacterial Growth and Biofilm Formation of Prevalent Cystic Fibrosis Pathogens.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"We investigated the effects of bicarbonate on the growth of several different bacteria as well as its effects on biofilm formation and intracellular cAMP concentration in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The antimicrobial properties of the tubular 3D constructs were determined in vitro and in vivo using an infected (Actinomyces naeslundii) dentin tooth slice model and a canine method of periapical disease, respectively. The in vitro data indicated significant antimicrobial activity and the ability to eliminate bacterial biofilm inside dentinal tubules. In vivo histological findings demonstrated that, using the EB procedure, the tubular 3D triple antibiotic-eluting construct allowed the formation of an appropriate environment that led to apex closure and the ingrowth of a thin layer of osteodentin-like tissue into the root canal.

Bacterial resistance to phage infection, however, limits the usefulness of phage therapies and could destabilise community structures, especially if individual resistance mutations provide cross-resistance against multiple phages. We currently understand very little about the evolution of cross-resistance in bacteria-phage interactions. Here we show that the network structure of cross-resistance among spontaneous resistance mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa evolved against each of 27 phages is highly modular. The cross-resistance network contained both symmetric (reciprocal) and asymmetric (nonreciprocal) cross-resistance, forming two cross-resistance modules defined by high within- but low between-module cross-resistance. Mutations conferring cross-resistance within modules targeted either lipopolysaccharide or type IV pilus biosynthesis, suggesting that the modularity of cross-resistance was structured by distinct phage receptors. In contrast, between-module cross-resistance was provided by mutations affecting the alternative sigma factor, RpoN, which controls many lifestyle-associated functions, including motility, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing. Broader cross-resistance range was not associated with higher fitness costs or weaker resistance against the focal phage used to select resistance. However, mutations in rpoN, providing between-module cross-resistance, were associated with higher fitness costs than mutations associated with within-module cross-resistance, i.e., in genes encoding either lipopolysaccharide or type IV pilus biosynthesis. The observed structure of cross-resistance predicted both the frequency of resistance mutations and the ability of phage combinations to suppress bacterial growth. These findings suggest that the evolution of cross-resistance is common, is likely to play an important role in the dynamic structure of bacteria-phage communities, and could inform the design principles for phage therapy treatments.","authors":[{"name":"Rosanna C T Wright"},{"name":"Ville-Petri Friman"},{"name":"Margaret C M Smith"},{"name":"Michael A Brockhurst"}],"keywords":[]},"article67":{"pmid":"30281429","title":"Flexible Platform for In Situ Impedimetric Detection and Bioelectric Effect Treatment of Escherichia Coli Biofilms.","date":"2020-02-21","abs":"This paper reports a platform for real-time monitoring and treatment of biofilm formation on three-dimensional biomedical device surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Ryan C Huiszoon"},{"name":"Sowmya Subramanian"},{"name":"Pradeep Ramiah Rajasekaran"},{"name":"Luke A Beardslee"},{"name":"William E Bentley"},{"name":"Reza Ghodssi"}],"keywords":[]},"article68":{"pmid":"30281074","title":"Locking Hemodialysis Catheters With Trimethoprim-Ethanol-Ca-EDTA to Prevent Bloodstream Infections: A Randomized, Evaluator-blinded Clinical Trial.","date":"2020-03-27","abs":"Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) often result from intraluminal microbial colonization and are associated with morbidity, mortality, and substantial costs.

The regulatory influences that control Yptb Hms-ECM production and biofilm formation are not fully understood. In this study, negative regulators of biofilm production in Yptb were identified. Inactivation of the BarA/UvrY two-component system or the CsrB regulatory RNA increased binding of Congo Red dye, which correlates with extracellular polysaccharide production. These mutants also produced biofilms that were substantially more cohesive than the wild type strain. Disruption of uvrY was not sufficient for Yptb to cause proventricular blockage during infection of Xenopsylla cheopis fleas. However, this strain was less acutely toxic toward fleas than wild type Yptb. Flow cytometry measurements of lectin binding indicated that Yptb BarA/UvrY/CsrB mutants may produce higher levels of other carbohydrates in addition to poly-GlcNAc Hms-ECM. In an effort to characterize the relevant downstream targets of the BarA/UvrY system, we conducted a proteomic analysis to identify proteins with lower abundance in the csrB::Tn5 mutant strain. Urease subunit proteins were less abundant and urease enzymatic activity was lower, which likely reduced toxicity toward fleas. Loss of CsrB impacted expression of several potential regulatory proteins that may influence biofilms, including the RcsB regulator. Overexpression of CsrB did not alter the Congo-red binding phenotype of an rcsB::Tn5 mutant, suggesting that the effect of CsrB on biofilms may require RcsB. These results underscore the regulatory and compositional differences between Yptb and Y. pestis biofilms.

In the present study, we characterized the AS87_RS09170 gene in R. anatipestifer strain Yb2.

Western blot analysis demonstrated that the biotin-dependent enzyme was present in smaller quantities in the mutant strain Yb2ΔbioF compared to that of the wide-type strain Yb2, suggesting that the biotin biosynthesis was defective. The mutant strain Yb2ΔbioF displayed a decreased growth rate at the exponential phase in tryptic soy broth culture and in BeaverBeads Streptavidin treated tryptic soy broth culture, but recovered when biotin was supplemented.

In this study, we characterized a hypothetical mannitol metabolism and transportation gene cluster (Ms5571-Ms5576), designated as mmt operon, whose expression significantly contributes to the biofilm formation in Mycobacterium smegmatis. We showed that in the operon the Ms5575 gene encodes a GntR-like transcriptional repressor and the Ms5576 gene encodes a mannitol 2-dehydrogenase which can produce D-mannitol from D-mannose. Strikingly, the D-mannitol molecule can derepress the negative regulation of Ms5575 on the mmt operon to stimulate the operon's expression. Consistently, addition of D-mannitol into the medium can obviously induce mycobacterial biofilm formation. Furthermore, we found that Ms0179 positively regulates the mmt operon through its downstream regulator Ms0180. Ms0180 directly binds the mmt operon to positively regulate its expression. Both Ms0179 and Ms0180 significantly affect the mycobacterial biofilm formation.

Little is known, however, about the causes of this diversification and its impact on patient health. Here, we show experimentally that, consistent with ecological theory of diversification, the nutritional conditions of the CF airway can cause rapid and extensive diversification of P. aeruginosa Mucin, the substance responsible for the increased viscosity associated with the thick mucus layer in the CF airway, had little impact on within-population diversification but did promote divergence among populations. Furthermore, in vitro evolution recapitulated traits thought to be hallmarks of chronic infection, including reduced motility and increased biofilm formation, and the range of phenotypes observed in a collection of clinical isolates. Our results suggest that nutritional complexity and reduced dispersal can drive evolutionary diversification of P. aeruginosa independent of other features of the CF lung such as an active immune system or the presence of competing microbial species.

APEC are a subgroup of extra intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and poultry are considered potential sources of foodborne ExPEC to humans. Currently, APEC infections in poultry are controlled by antibiotics and/or vaccination; however, their effect is limited due to emergence of antibiotic resistant strains and infections with heterologous serotypes. Therefore, novel approaches are needed. Here, using the bioluminescent quorum sensing (QS) autoinducer 2 (AI-2) indicator Vibrio harveyi BB170, we screened the cell free culture supernatant of APEC O78 prepared from cultures grown in the presence of 4,182 small molecules (SMs; 100 μM). A total of 69 SMs inhibited > 75% of APEC O78 AI-2 activity in the indicator bacteria. Ten SMs that showed highest AI-2 inhibition were selected for further studies. Most of these SMs inhibited the AI-2 activity of other APEC serotypes and significantly reduced APEC O78 biofilm formation and motility. Most compounds showed minimal toxicity on human intestinal cells (Caco-2), chicken macrophage (HD-11), and chicken and sheep red blood cells, and reduced APEC survival in HD-11 and THP-1 macrophages. The SMs induced no or minimal toxicity and conferred protection against APEC in wax moth larval model. SMs affected the expression of APEC O78 QS, virulence, biofilm and motility associated genes providing insight on their potential mode(s) of action. Further testing in chickens will facilitate development of these SMs as novel therapeutics to control APEC in poultry and thereby also reduce zoonotic transmission.","authors":[{"name":"Yosra A Helmy"},{"name":"Loic Deblais"},{"name":"Issmat I Kassem"},{"name":"Dipak Kathayat"},{"name":"Gireesh Rajashekara"}],"keywords":[{"word":"APEC"},{"word":"autoinducer-2"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chicken"},{"word":"gene expression"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"macrophages"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"quorum sensing inhibitors"},{"word":"virulence"},{"word":"wax moth model"}]},"article115":{"pmid":"30270674","title":"Dopamine-functionalized sulphated hyaluronic acid as a titanium implant coating enhances biofilm prevention and promotes osseointegration.","date":"2019-09-09","abs":"A series of new hyaluronan derivatives was synthesized and tested as an antibiotic release system by antibacterial and osseointegration assays.

Our scaffolded cultivation is highly effective at stimulating an attachment/biofilm phenotype and causes large changes to metabolite profiles for the microbes investigated.

Broad spectrum antibiotics are commonly administered to prevent and treat musculoskeletal infections. Local antibiotics are applied to the wound site to increase therapeutic concentrations without increasing systemic toxicity, however, may hinder local tissue recovery. Rifampin has been shown to eradicate mature Staphylococcal biofilms and its use proven for treating musculoskeletal infections. In this study, a spontaneously healing defect model in a rat was used to investigate the impact rifampin powder has on endogenous bone healing in both a sterile and contaminated wound. No significant differences were identified in bone volume fraction via microcomputed tomography, radiological scoring, or histology between an empty defect and animals that received vancomycin or rifampin powder in a sterile wound. When applied to a contaminated musculoskeletal wound, the rifampin powder had significantly greater bone formation compared to the control, as measured by microcomputed tomography, plain radiology, and histology. In addition, the animals treated with rifampin powder had reduced bacteria, reduced white blood cell count and reduced number of clinical indications of infection. Interestingly, while the vancomycin group still displayed signs of infection via quantitative microbiology, plain radiology, and histology, there was significant bone formation within the defect and reduction of systemic signs of infection. We demonstrated that the use of rifampin powder allows bone to heal in both a sterile and contaminated model of musculoskeletal infection. To our knowledge, this is the first time the direct impact of local antibiotics on bone healing has been investigated. Published 2018.

This study aimed to detect the function of RcsAB in virulence and in biofilm and CPS formation. In addition, the transcriptional regulation of the galF gene in K. pneumoniae was studied. To determine the function of rcsAB gene, the wild-type K. pneumoniae strain NTUH-K2044 and the rcsAB knockout and complemented strains were used. The results showed decreased virulence, biofilm formation, and CPS levels in the rcsAB knockout strain. Complementation of the knockout by introducing an rcsAB fragment on an expression plasmid partially restored the virulence, biofilm, and CPS functions of the knockout strain. It indicated that the rcsAB genes might affect CPS formation and virulence of K. pneumonia. RT-qPCR, EMSA and DNase I footprinting assays were conducted to identify the transcriptional regulation of galF by RcsAB. RcsAB was seen to bind to the galF promoter-proximal region, and the binding site was further identified to be located from -177 bp to -152 bp upstream of the galF promoter. In conclusion, RcsAB could regulate the transcription of the galF gene positively by binding to the galF promoter DNA directly, and then affects the CPS formation of K. pneumonia.","authors":[{"name":"Dan Peng"},{"name":"Xuan Li"},{"name":"Pin Liu"},{"name":"Xipeng Zhou"},{"name":"Mei Luo"},{"name":"Kewen Su"},{"name":"Shuai Chen"},{"name":"Zhongshuang Zhang"},{"name":"Qiang He"},{"name":"Jingfu Qiu"},{"name":"Yingli Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CPS"},{"word":"Klebsiella pneumonia"},{"word":"RcsAB"},{"word":"galF"}]},"article123":{"pmid":"30269857","title":"Pseudomonas sp.

This study further found that A. baumannii also has IAA productive capability, primarily involving the ipdC gene, and transcriptome and spent media analysis of wild-type and mutant cultures grown in minimal media revealed that A. baumannii likely produces IAA through the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway. Exogenously applied IAA improved tolerance against oxidative stress in wild-type A. baumannii and iacA mutants unable to degrade IAA, but not in ipdC mutants incapable of producing IAA, suggesting that endogenous IAA is important for stress tolerance. Meanwhile, ipdC mutants also had reduced virulence against human A549 epithelial cells as compared to wild-type. Endogenously produced IAA was found to enhance root growth in A. baumannii and kidney bean plant co-cultures, indicating that A. baumannii can interact with plants through the production and degradation of IAA.

Slime production was evaluated in 708 staphylococcal isolates recovered from cases of subclinical mastitis in a field study in 2198 ewes performed in an extensive countrywide field investigation across Greece. Isolates were studied by means of microbiological and molecular methods. Of these strains, 262 were characterised as slime-producing, 227 as weak slime-producing and 219 as non slime-producing.

Subclinical mastitis caused specifically by slime-producing staphylococci was detected in 337 ewes: prevalence in population sampled was 0.153. A multivariable mixed-effects model revealed that milking mode (highest prevalence in hand-milked flocks) and flock management system (highest prevalence in semi-intensive flocks) were the two factors associated with increased prevalence of mastitis in flocks.

Notably, C. acnes isolates exhibit marked heterogeneity and can be divided into at least 6 phylotypes by multilocus sequence typing. It is becoming increasingly evident that biofilm formation is a relevant factor for C. acnes virulence, but information on biofilm formation by diverse C. acnes isolates is limited. In this study we performed a first comparative analysis of 58 diverse skin- or implant-isolates covering all six C. acnes phylotypes to investigate biofilm formation dynamics, biofilm morphology and attachment properties to abiotic surfaces. The results presented herein suggest that biofilm formation correlates with the phylotype, rather than the anatomical isolation site. IA1 isolates, particularly SLST sub-types A1 and A2, showed highest biofilm amounts in the microtiter plate assays, followed by isolates of the IC, IA2 and II phylotypes. Microscopic evaluation revealed well-structured three-dimensional biofilms and relatively high adhesive properties to abiotic surfaces for phylotypes IA1, IA2 and IC. Representatives of phylotype III formed biofilms with comparable biomass, but with less defined structures, whereas IB as well as II isolates showed the least complex three-dimensional morphology. Proteinase K- and DNase I-treatment reduced attachment rates of all phylotypes, therefore, indicating that extracellular DNA and proteins are critical for adhesion to abiotic surfaces. Moreover, proteins seem to be pivotal structural biofilm components as mature biofilms of all phylotypes were proteinase K-sensitive, whereas the sensitivity to DNase I-treatment varied depending on the phylotype.","authors":[{"name":"Torben Kuehnast"},{"name":"Fatih Cakar"},{"name":"Theresa Weinhäupl"},{"name":"Andreas Pilz"},{"name":"Sanja Selak"},{"name":"M Alexander Schmidt"},{"name":"Christian Rüter"},{"name":"Stefan Schild"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acne vulgaris"},{"word":"Attachment"},{"word":"Cutibacterium acnes"},{"word":"Implant"},{"word":"Phylotypes"},{"word":"Propionibacterium acnes"},{"word":"Skin"}]},"article133":{"pmid":"30268755","title":"Identification of potential inhibitors of sortase A: Binding studies, in-silico docking and protein-protein interaction studies of sortase A from Enterococcus faecalis.","date":"2019-01-09","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) is a Gram positive multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterium contributing about 70% of total enterococcal infections.

Eradicating mature biofilms is especially challenging because of the protection of the extracellular matrix and slow growth of biofilm cells. Recently, we reported that established biofilms can be effectively removed (e.g. 99.9% dispersion of 48 h Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms) by shape memory polymer-based dynamic changes in surface topography. Here, we demonstrate that such biofilm dispersion also sensitizes biofilm cells to conventional antibiotics. For example, shape recovery in the presence of 50 µg/mL tobramycin reduced biofilm cell counts by more than 3 logs (2,479-fold) compared to the static flat control. The observed effects were attributed to the disruption of biofilm structure and increase in cellular activities as evidenced by an 11.8-fold increase in intracellular level of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and 4.1-fold increase in expression of the rrnB gene in detached cells. These results can help guide the design of new control methods to better combat biofilm associated antibiotic-resistant infections. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Microbial infections are challenging due to high-level antibiotic resistance of biofilm cells. The protection of an extracellular matrix and slow growth of biofilm cells render conventional antibiotics ineffective. Thus, it is important to develop new technologies that can remove mature biofilms and sensitize biofilm cells to antibiotics. Recently, we demonstrated that dynamic change in surface topography can remove 48 h Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms by 99.9%. In this study, we investigated how shape recovery triggered dispersion affect the physiology of biofilm cells and associated antibiotic susceptibility. These results are helpful for understanding biofilm dispersion and developing more effective control methods.","authors":[{"name":"Sang Won Lee"},{"name":"Huan Gu"},{"name":"James Bryan Kilberg"},{"name":"Dacheng Ren"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ATP"},{"word":"Antibiotic susceptibility"},{"word":"Antifouling"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Removal"},{"word":"Shape memory polymer"}]},"article138":{"pmid":"30267753","title":"Novel combination proliposomes containing tobramycin and clarithromycin effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"Tobramycin (TOB) and clarithromycin (CLA) can potentially be used synergistically for the treatment of respiratory infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.

Here, the binding process, adsorption characteristics, and the contribution of fractional polarity of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of anaerobic granular sludge (AGS) and activated sludge (AS) to the nano-ZnO and nano-CuO adsorption were investigated. Briefly, CuO-NPs can be more efficiently adsorbed by the EPS-AGS than that of ZnO-NPs (1.31 ± 0.08 g/g VS vs 0.53 ± 0.04 g/g VS), and a smaller diameter of nanoparticles benefited the adsorption processes. Hydrophobic EPS (HPO-A and HPO-N) within these two sludge were more effective in removing nano-CuO and ZnO than were the hydrophilic fraction. For example, HPO-A and HPO-N obtained from AGS showed a relatively higher adsorption abilities (in g/g VS) of 2.09 ± 0.12 and 2.27 ± 0.14, respectively, for nano-CuO, much higher than HPI (0.76 ± 0.04 g/g VS).

A number of genome-wide characterizations of lysine-acetylated proteins, or acetylomes, in bacteria have demonstrated that lysine acetylation occurs on proteins with a wide diversity of functions, including central metabolism, transcription, chemotaxis, and cell size regulation. Bacillus subtilis is a model organism for studies of sporulation, motility, cell signaling, and multicellular development (or biofilm formation). In this work, we investigated the role of global protein lysine acetylation in multicellular development in B. subtilis. We analyzed the B. subtilis acetylome under biofilm-inducing conditions and identified acetylated proteins involved in multicellularity, specifically, swarming and biofilm formation. We constructed various single and double mutants of genes known to encode enzymes involved in global protein lysine acetylation in B. subtilis. Some of those mutants showed a defect in swarming motility while others demonstrated altered biofilm phenotypes. Lastly, we picked two acetylated proteins known to be important for biofilm formation, YmcA (also known as RicA), a regulatory protein critical for biofilm induction, and GtaB, an UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase that synthesizes a nucleotide sugar precursor for biosynthesis of exopolysaccharide, a key biofilm matrix component. We performed site-directed mutagenesis on the acetylated lysine codons in ymcA and gtaB, respectively, and assayed cells bearing those point mutants for biofilm formation. The mutant alleles of ymcA(K64R), gtaB(K89R), and gtaB(K191R) all demonstrated a severe biofilm defect. These results indicate the importance of acetylated lysine residues in both YmcA and GtaB. In summary, we propose that protein lysine acetylation plays a global regulatory role in B. subtilis multicellularity.","authors":[{"name":"Alicyn Reverdy"},{"name":"Yun Chen"},{"name":"Evan Hunter"},{"name":"Kevin Gozzi"},{"name":"Yunrong Chai"}],"keywords":[]},"article147":{"pmid":"30265315","title":"Impact of hydrologic boundaries on microbial planktonic and biofilm communities in shallow terrestrial subsurface environments.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Subsurface environments contain a large proportion of planetary microbial biomass and harbor diverse communities responsible for mediating biogeochemical cycles important to groundwater used by human society for consumption, irrigation, agriculture and industry.

Here, we synthesize current information on the diversity and activity of shallow freshwater subsurface habitats, discuss the challenges associated with sampling planktonic and biofilm communities across spatial, temporal and geological gradients, and discuss how biofilms may be constrained within shallow terrestrial subsurface aquifers. We suggest that merging traditional activity measurements and sequencing/-omics technologies with hydrological parameters important to sediment biofilm assembly and stability will help delineate key system parameters. Ultimately, integration will enhance our understanding of shallow subsurface ecophysiology in terms of bulk-flow through porous media and distinguish the respective activities of sessile microbial communities from more transient planktonic communities to ecosystem service and maintenance.","authors":[{"name":"H J Smith"},{"name":"A J Zelaya"},{"name":"K B De León"},{"name":"R Chakraborty"},{"name":"D A Elias"},{"name":"T C Hazen"},{"name":"A P Arkin"},{"name":"A B Cunningham"},{"name":"M W Fields"}],"keywords":[]},"article148":{"pmid":"30265307","title":"Hyperencapsulated mucoid pneumococcal isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis have increased biofilm density and persistence in vivo.","date":"2019-03-07","abs":"Mucoid bacteria, predominately Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are commonly associated with decline in pulmonary function in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), and are thought to persist at least in part due to a greater propensity toward forming biofilms.

Iron-oxide mats in acidic (pH 2-4), high-temperature (> 65 °C) springs of Yellowstone National Park contain relatively simple microbial communities and are well-characterized geochemically. Consequently, these communities are excellent model systems for studying the metabolic activity of individual populations and key microbial interactions. The primary goals of the current study were to integrate data collected in situ with in silico calculations across process-scales encompassing enzymatic activity, cellular metabolism, community interactions, and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as well as to predict and quantify the functional limits of autotroph-heterotroph interactions. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data were used to reconstruct carbon and energy metabolisms of an important autotroph (Metallosphaera yellowstonensis) and heterotroph (Geoarchaeum sp. OSPB) from the studied Fe(III)-oxide mat communities. Standard and hybrid elementary flux mode and flux balance analyses of metabolic models predicted cellular- and community-level metabolic acclimations to simulated environmental stresses, respectively. In situ geochemical analyses, including oxygen depth-profiles, Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates, stable carbon isotopes and mat biomass concentrations, were combined with cellular models to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions important to community structure-function. Integration of metabolic modeling with in situ measurements, including the relative population abundance of autotrophs to heterotrophs, demonstrated that Fe(III)-oxide mat communities operate at their maximum total community growth rate (i.e. sum of autotroph and heterotroph growth rates), as opposed to net community growth rate (i.e. total community growth rate subtracting autotroph consumed by heterotroph), as predicted from the maximum power principle. Integration of multiscale data with ecological theory provides a basis for predicting autotroph-heterotroph interactions and community-level cellular organization.","authors":[{"name":"Kristopher A Hunt"},{"name":"Ryan M Jennings"},{"name":"William P Inskeep"},{"name":"Ross P Carlson"}],"keywords":[]},"article163":{"pmid":"30260744","title":"Adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis on Er:YAG Laser-Irradiated Dental Enamel: Effect of Surface Roughness.","date":"2020-01-14","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Bernardo Teutle-Coyotecatl"},{"name":"Rosalía Contreras-Bulnes"},{"name":"Rogelio J Scougall-Vilchis"},{"name":"Argelia Almaguer-Flores"},{"name":"Victor I García-Pérez"},{"name":"Laura Emma Rodríguez-Vilchis"},{"name":"Jesús A Arenas-Alatorre"}],"keywords":[{"word":"colonization"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"microorganisms"},{"word":"microscopy"},{"word":"preventive dentistry"},{"word":"pulsed lasers"}]},"article164":{"pmid":"30260708","title":"Stabilized collagen matrix dressing improves wound macrophage function and epithelialization.","date":"2020-02-04","abs":"Decellularized matrices of biologic tissue have performed well as wound care dressings.

Although all Citrus spp. are susceptible to this pathogen, they are resistant to other Xanthomonas species, exhibiting non-host resistance (NHR), for example, to the brassica pathogen X. campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) and a gene-for-gene host defence response (HDR) to the canker-causing X. fuscans ssp. aurantifolii (Xfa) strain C. Here, we examine the plant factors associated with the NHR of C. limon to Xcc. We show that Xcc induced asymptomatic type I NHR, allowing the bacterium to survive in a stationary phase in the non-host tissue. In C. limon, this NHR shared some similarities with HDR; both defence responses interfered with biofilm formation, and were associated with callose deposition, induction of the salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway and the repression of abscisic acid (ABA) signalling. However, greater stomatal closure was seen during NHR than during HDR, together with different patterns of accumulation of reactive oxygen species and phenolic compounds and the expression of secondary metabolites. Overall, these differences, independent of Xcc type III effector proteins, could contribute to the higher protection elicited against canker development. We propose that Xcc may have the potential to steadily activate inducible defence responses. An understanding of these plant responses (and their triggers) may allow the development of a sustained and sustainable resistance to citrus canker.","authors":[{"name":"María A Chiesa"},{"name":"Roxana A Roeschlin"},{"name":"María A Favaro"},{"name":"Facundo Uviedo"},{"name":"Laura Campos-Beneyto"},{"name":"Rodrigo D'Andrea"},{"name":"José Gadea"},{"name":"María R Marano"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PAMP-triggered immunity"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"canker disease"},{"word":"glucosinolates"},{"word":"protection"},{"word":"salicylic acid"},{"word":"stomatal immunity"}]},"article166":{"pmid":"30260081","title":"Optical coherence tomography follow-up of patients treated from periodontal disease.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is one of the most important imaging modalities for biophotonics applications.

In environmental and clinical settings, most bacteria form biofilms as a way to protect themselves against extracellular stress. However, much remains to be known about ICE transfer in biofilms. Using ICEBs1 from Bacillus subtilis, we show that the natural conjugation efficiency of this ICE is greatly affected by the ability of the donor and recipient to form a biofilm. ICEBs1 transfer considerably increases in biofilm, even at low donor/recipient ratios. Also, while there is a clear temporal correlation between biofilm formation and ICEBs1 transfer, biofilms do not alter the level of ICEBs1 excision in donor cells. Conjugative transfer appears to be favored by the biophysical context of biofilms. Indeed, extracellular matrix production, particularly from the recipient cells, is essential for biofilms to promote ICEBs1 transfer.

Here, we demonstrate the antibacterial activity of chlorate against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a representative pathogen that can inhabit hypoxic or anoxic host microenvironments during infection. Aerobically grown P. aeruginosa cells are tobramycin sensitive but chlorate tolerant. In the absence of oxygen or an alternative electron acceptor, cells are tobramycin tolerant but chlorate sensitive via Nar-dependent reduction. The fact that chlorite, the product of chlorate reduction, is not detected in culture supernatants suggests that it may react rapidly and be retained intracellularly. Tobramycin and chlorate target distinct populations within metabolically stratified aggregate biofilms; tobramycin kills cells on the oxic periphery, whereas chlorate kills hypoxic and anoxic cells in the interior. In a matrix populated by multiple aggregates, tobramycin-mediated death of surface aggregates enables deeper oxygen penetration into the matrix, benefiting select aggregate populations by increasing survival and removing chlorate sensitivity. Finally, lasR mutants, which commonly arise in P. aeruginosa infections and are known to withstand conventional antibiotic treatment, are hypersensitive to chlorate. A lasR mutant shows a propensity to respire nitrate and reduce chlorate more rapidly than the wild type does, consistent with its heightened chlorate sensitivity. These findings illustrate chlorate's potential to selectively target oxidant-starved pathogens, including physiological states and genotypes of P. aeruginosa that represent antibiotic-tolerant populations during infections.","authors":[{"name":"Melanie A Spero"},{"name":"Dianne K Newman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Nar"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chlorate"},{"word":"nitrate reduction"},{"word":"prodrug"}]},"article186":{"pmid":"30254118","title":"CdrA Interactions within the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Matrix Safeguard It from Proteolysis and Promote Cellular Packing.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Biofilms are robust multicellular aggregates of bacteria that are encased in an extracellular matrix.

Together, these results support the idea of the importance of multibiomolecular components in matrix stability and led us to propose a model in which CdrA-CdrA interactions can enhance cell-cell packing in an aggregate that is resistant to physical shear, while Psl-CdrA interactions enhance aggregate integrity in the presence of self-produced and exogenous proteases.","authors":[{"name":"Courtney Reichhardt"},{"name":"Cynthis Wong"},{"name":"Daniel Passos da Silva"},{"name":"Daniel J Wozniak"},{"name":"Matthew R Parsek"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CdrA"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Psl"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"elastase"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides"}]},"article187":{"pmid":"30254117","title":"Antagonistic Pleiotropy in the Bifunctional Surface Protein FadL (OmpP1) during Adaptation of Haemophilus influenzae to Chronic Lung Infection Associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Tracking bacterial evolution during chronic infection provides insights into how host selection pressures shape bacterial genomes. The human-restricted opportunistic pathogen nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) infects the lower airways of patients suffering chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes to disease progression. To identify bacterial genetic variation associated with bacterial adaptation to the COPD lung, we sequenced the genomes of 92 isolates collected from the sputum of 13 COPD patients over 1 to 9 years. Individuals were colonized by distinct clonal types (CTs) over time, but the same CT was often reisolated at a later time or found in different patients. Although genomes from the same CT were nearly identical, intra-CT variation due to mutation and recombination occurred. Recurrent mutations in several genes were likely involved in COPD lung adaptation. Notably, nearly a third of CTs were polymorphic for null alleles of ompP1 (also called fadL), which encodes a bifunctional membrane protein that both binds the human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (hCEACAM1) receptor and imports long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Our computational studies provide plausible three-dimensional models for FadL's interaction with hCEACAM1 and LCFA binding. We show that recurrent fadL mutations are likely a case of antagonistic pleiotropy, since loss of FadL reduces NTHi's ability to infect epithelia but also increases its resistance to bactericidal LCFAs enriched within the COPD lung. Supporting this interpretation, truncated fadL alleles are common in publicly available NTHi genomes isolated from the lower airway tract but rare in others. These results shed light on molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathoadaptation and guide future research toward developing novel COPD therapeutics.","authors":[{"name":"Javier Moleres"},{"name":"Ariadna Fernández-Calvet"},{"name":"Rachel L Ehrlich"},{"name":"Sara Martí"},{"name":"Lucía Pérez-Regidor"},{"name":"Begoña Euba"},{"name":"Irene Rodríguez-Arce"},{"name":"Sergey Balashov"},{"name":"Ester Cuevas"},{"name":"Josefina Liñares"},{"name":"Carmen Ardanuy"},{"name":"Sonsoles Martín-Santamaría"},{"name":"Garth D Ehrlich"},{"name":"Joshua Chang Mell"},{"name":"Junkal Garmendia"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CEACAM1"},{"word":"FadL/OmpP1"},{"word":"Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"adaptive evolution"},{"word":"antagonistic pleiotropic"},{"word":"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"},{"word":"comparative genomics"},{"word":"convergent evolution"},{"word":"free fatty acids"},{"word":"in situ evolution"}]},"article188":{"pmid":"30254075","title":"Polyamine function in archaea and bacteria.","date":"2019-11-30","abs":"Most of the phylogenetic diversity of life is found in bacteria and archaea, and is reflected in the diverse metabolism and functions of bacterial and archaeal polyamines.

To systematically characterize such systems, we study semi-penetrable self-propelled rods in two dimensions, with a propulsion force that decreases with increasing local rod density, by employing Brownian dynamics simulations. Volume exclusion and quorum sensing both lead to phase separation; however, the structure of the systems and the rod dynamics vastly differ. Quorum sensing enhances the polarity of the clusters, induces perpendicularity of rods at the cluster borders, and enhances cluster formation. For systems where the rods essentially become passive at high densities, formation of asters and stripes is observed. Systems of rods with larger aspect ratios show more ordered structures compared to those with smaller aspect ratios, due to their stronger alignment, with almost circular asters for strongly density-dependent propulsion force. With increasing range of the quorum-sensing interaction, the local density decreases, asters become less stable, and polar hedgehog clusters and clusters with domains appear.","authors":[{"name":"Clara Abaurrea Velasco"},{"name":"Masoud Abkenar"},{"name":"Gerhard Gompper"},{"name":"Thorsten Auth"}],"keywords":[]},"article191":{"pmid":"30253368","title":"Effect of anaerobic/aerobic duration on nitrogen removal and microbial community in a simultaneous partial nitrification and denitrification system under low salinity.","date":"2018-11-15","abs":"In this study, the simultaneous partial nitrification and denitrification (SPND) process was investigated in a hybrid sequencing batch biofilm reactor (HSBBR) fed with synthetic wastewater with 1.2% salinity.

The highest organic matter removal efficiency was obtained at An/Ae hour ratio of 0/6.5, with an average chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 89.6% at the steady state. Similarly high nitrogen removal efficiencies were achieved at An/Ae hour ratios of 1/5.5, 1.5/5 and 2/4.5,with over 92% of average total nitrogen removed.

In this study, bioreporter E. coli MC4100/pTGM strain was used to probe the bioavailability of tetracycline sorbed by smectite clay, a class of common soil minerals. Batch sorption experiments were conducted to prepare clay samples with a wide range of sorbed tetracycline concentration. The bioreporter was incubated with tetracycline-sorbed clay at different clay/solution ratios and water contents, as well as using dialysis tubings to prevent the direct contact between bacterial cells and clay particles. The expression of antibiotic resistance genes from the bioreporter was measured using a flow cytometer as a measurement of bioavailability/selective pressure. The direct contact of bioreporter cells to clay surfaces represented an important pathway facilitating bacterial access to clay-sorbed tetracycline. In clay-water suspensions, reducing solution volume rendered more bacteria to attach to clay surfaces enhancing the bioavailability of clay-sorbed tetracycline. The strong fluorescence emission from bioreporter cells on clay surfaces indicated that clay-sorbed tetracycline was still bioavailable to bacteria. The formation of biofilms on clay surfaces could increase bacterial access to clay-sorbed tetracycline. In addition, desorption of loosely sorbed tetracycline into bulk solution contributed to bacterial exposure and activation of the antibiotic resistance genes. Tetracycline sorbed by soil geosorbents could exert selective pressure on the surrounding microbial communities via bacterial exposure to tetracycline in solution from desorption and to the geosorbent-sorbed tetracycline as well.","authors":[{"name":"Yingjie Zhang"},{"name":"Stephen A Boyd"},{"name":"Brian J Teppen"},{"name":"James M Tiedje"},{"name":"Wei Zhang"},{"name":"Dongqiang Zhu"},{"name":"Hui Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Bioavailability"},{"word":"E. coli"},{"word":"Smectite clay"},{"word":"Tetracycline"}]},"article193":{"pmid":"30252918","title":"Candida albicans Sfl1/Sfl2 regulatory network drives the formation of pathogenic microcolonies.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can infect oral mucosal surfaces while being under continuous flow from saliva. Under specific conditions, C. albicans will form microcolonies that more closely resemble the biofilms formed in vivo than standard in vitro biofilm models. However, very little is known about these microcolonies, particularly genomic differences between these specialized biofilm structures and the traditional in vitro biofilms. In this study, we used a novel flow system, in which C. albicans spontaneously forms microcolonies, to further characterize the architecture of fungal microcolonies and their genomics compared to non-microcolony conditions. Fungal microcolonies arose from radially branching filamentous hyphae that increasingly intertwined with one another to form extremely dense biofilms, and closely resembled the architecture of in vivo oropharyngeal candidiasis. We identified 20 core microcolony genes that were differentially regulated in flow-induced microcolonies using RNA-seq. These genes included HWP1, ECE1, IHD1, PLB1, HYR1, PGA10, and SAP5. A predictive algorithm was utilized to identify ten transcriptional regulators potentially involved in microcolony formation. Of these transcription factors, we found that Rob1, Ndt80, Sfl1 and Sfl2, played a key role in microcolony formation under both flow and static conditions and to epithelial surfaces. Expression of core microcolony genes were highly up-regulated in Δsfl1 cells and down-regulated in both Δsfl2 and Δrob1 strains. Microcolonies formed on oral epithelium using C. albicans Δsfl1, Δsfl2 and Δrob1 deletion strains all had altered adhesion, invasion and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, epithelial cells infected with deletion mutants had reduced (SFL2, NDT80, and ROB1) or enhanced (SFL2) immune responses, evidenced by phosphorylation of MKP1 and c-Fos activation, key signal transducers in the hyphal invasion response. This profile of microcolony transcriptional regulators more closely reflects Sfl1 and Sfl2 hyphal regulatory networks than static biofilm regulatory networks, suggesting that microcolonies are a specialized pathogenic form of biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Andrew D McCall"},{"name":"Rohitashw Kumar"},{"name":"Mira Edgerton"}],"keywords":[]},"article194":{"pmid":"30252837","title":"Formation of phenotypic lineages in Salmonella enterica by a pleiotropic fimbrial switch.","date":"2019-01-16","abs":"The std locus of Salmonella enterica, an operon acquired by horizontal transfer, encodes fimbriae that permit adhesion to epithelial cells in the large intestine.

One potential difference is oxygen availability, which is frequently increased under conditions of inflammation and is known to regulate bacterial virulence. Hence, we hypothesized that oxygen influences C. concisus physiology.

Furthermore, sturdiness of intrinsic disorder and its capability to ignore harsh conditions provides some interesting and important advantages to its carriers, at the molecular (e.g., the cell wall-anchored accumulation-associated protein playing a crucial role in intercellular adhesion within the biofilm of Staphylococcus epidermidis), supramolecular (e.g., protein complexes, biologic liquid-liquid phase transitions, and proteinaceous membrane-less organelles), and organismal levels (e.g., the recently popularized case of the microscopic animals, tardigrades, or water bears, that use intrinsically disordered proteins to survive desiccation).","authors":[{"name":"Vladimir N Uversky"}],"keywords":[{"word":"conformational stability"},{"word":"intrinsically disordered protein"},{"word":"liquid-liquid phase transition"},{"word":"membrane-less organelle"},{"word":"protein-protein interaction"}]},"article203":{"pmid":"30250480","title":"Role of Microbes in the Development of Alzheimer's Disease: State of the Art - An International Symposium Presented at the 2017 IAGG Congress in San Francisco.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"This article reviews research results and ideas presented at a special symposium at the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics (IAGG) Congress held in July 2017 in San Francisco. Five researchers presented their results related to infection and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prof. Itzhaki presented her work on the role of viruses, specifically HSV-1, in the pathogenesis of AD. She maintains that although it is true that most people harbor HSV-1 infection, either latent or active, nonetheless aspects of herpes infection can play a role in the pathogenesis of AD, based on extensive experimental evidence from AD brains and infected cell cultures. Dr. Miklossy presented research on the high prevalence of bacterial infections that correlate with AD, specifically spirochete infections, which have been known for a century to be a significant cause of dementia (e.g., in syphilis). She demonstrated how spirochetes drive senile plaque formation, which are in fact biofilms. Prof. Balin then described the involvement of brain tissue infection by the Chlamydia pneumoniae bacterium, with its potential to use the innate immune system in its spread, and its initiation of tissue damage characteristic of AD. Prof. Fülöp described the role of AD-associated amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide as an antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral innate immune effector produced in reaction to microorganisms that attack the brain. Prof. Barron put forward the novel hypothesis that, according to her experiments, there is strong sequence-specific binding between the AD-associated Aβ and another ubiquitous and important human innate immune effector, the cathelicidin peptide LL-37. Given this binding, LL-37 expression in the brain will decrease Aβ deposition via formation of non-toxic, soluble Aβ/LL-37 complexes. Therefore, a chronic underexpression of LL-37 could be the factor that simultaneously permits chronic infections in brain tissue and allows for pathological accumulation of Aβ. This first-of-its-kind symposium opened the way for a paradigm shift in studying the pathogenesis of AD, from the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which so far has been quite unsuccessful, to a new infection hypothesis, or perhaps more broadly, innate immune system dysregulation hypothesis, which may well permit and lead to the discovery of new treatments for AD patients.","authors":[{"name":"Tamàs Fülöp"},{"name":"Ruth F Itzhaki"},{"name":"Brian J Balin"},{"name":"Judith Miklossy"},{"name":"Annelise E Barron"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alzheimer’s disease"},{"word":"Chlamydia pneumoniae"},{"word":"HSV-1"},{"word":"LL-37"},{"word":"amyloid beta"},{"word":"infections"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"spirochetes"}]},"article204":{"pmid":"30250246","title":"Strain-level diversity drives alternative community types in millimetre-scale granular biofilms.","date":"2019-09-03","abs":"Microbial communities are often highly diverse in their composition, both at a coarse-grained taxonomic level, such as genus, and at a highly resolved level, such as strains, within species. This variability can be driven by either extrinsic factors such as temperature and or by intrinsic ones, for example demographic fluctuations or ecological interactions. The relative contributions of these factors and the taxonomic level at which they influence community composition remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulty in identifying true community replicates assembled under the same environmental parameters. Here, we address this problem using an activated granular sludge reactor in which millimetre-scale biofilm granules represent true community replicates. Differences in composition are then expected to be driven primarily by biotic factors. Using 142 shotgun metagenomes of single biofilm granules we found that, at the commonly used genus-level resolution, community replicates varied much more in their composition than would be expected from neutral assembly processes. This variation did not translate into any clear partitioning into discrete community types, that is, distinct compositional states, such as enterotypes in the human gut. However, a strong partition into community types did emerge at the strain level for the dominant organism: genotypes of Candidatus Accumulibacter that coexisted in the metacommunity (the reactor) excluded each other within community replicates (granules). Individual granule communities maintained a significant lineage structure, whereby the strain phylogeny of Accumulibacter correlated with the overall composition of the community, indicating a high potential for co-diversification among species and communities. Our results suggest that due to the high functional redundancy and competition between close relatives, alternative community types are most probably observed at the level of recently differentiated genotypes but not at higher orders of genetic resolution.","authors":[{"name":"Gabriel E Leventhal"},{"name":"Carles Boix"},{"name":"Urs Kuechler"},{"name":"Tim N Enke"},{"name":"Elzbieta Sliwerska"},{"name":"Christof Holliger"},{"name":"Otto X Cordero"}],"keywords":[]},"article205":{"pmid":"30249968","title":"Antibacterial Properties of Silicone Membranes after a Simple Two-Step Immersion Process in Iodine and Silver Nitrate Solutions.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"　Silicone is widely used in packing materials, medical equipment, and separation membranes.

To directly test roles for AI-2 in maturation and maintenance of NTHi biofilms, we generated an NTHi 86-028NP mutant in which luxS transcription was under the control of the xylA promoter (NTHi 86-028NP luxS xylA::luxS), rendering AI-2 production inducible by xylose. Comparison of biofilms under inducing and noninducing conditions revealed a biofilm defect in the absence of xylose, whereas biofilm maturation increased following xylose induction. The removal of xylose resulted in the interruption of luxS expression and biofilm dispersal. Measurement of luxS transcript levels by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) showed that luxS expression peaked as biofilms matured and waned before dispersal. Transcript profiling revealed significant changes following the induction of luxS, including increased transcript levels for a predicted family 8 glycosyltransferase (NTHI1750; designated gstA); this result was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. An isogenic NTHi 86-028NP gstA mutant had a biofilm defect, including decreased levels of sialylated matrix and significantly altered biofilm structure. In experimental chinchilla infections, we observed a significant decrease in the number of bacteria in the biofilm population (but not in effusions) for NTHi 86-028NP gstA compared to the parental strain. Therefore, we conclude that AI-2 promotes NTHi biofilm maturation and the maintenance of biofilm integrity, due at least in part to the expression of a probable glycosyltransferase that is potentially involved in the synthesis of the biofilm matrix.","authors":[{"name":"Bing Pang"},{"name":"Chelsie E Armbruster"},{"name":"Gayle Foster"},{"name":"Brian S Learman"},{"name":"Uma Gandhi"},{"name":"W Edward Swords"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"otitis media"},{"word":"quorum signal"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"30249747","title":"Heterogeneity of Ly6G","date":"2019-05-21","abs":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature monocytes and granulocytes.

During degradation, c-di-GMP is first linearized to 5'-phosphoguanylyl-(3',5')-guanosine (pGpG) and subsequently hydrolyzed to two GMPs by a previously unknown enzyme, which was recently identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease oligoribonuclease (Orn). Mutants of orn accumulated pGpG, which inhibited the linearization of c-di-GMP. This product inhibition led to elevated c-di-GMP levels, resulting in increased aggregate and biofilm formation. Thus, the hydrolysis of pGpG is crucial to the maintenance of c-di-GMP homeostasis. How species that utilize c-di-GMP signaling but lack an orn ortholog hydrolyze pGpG remains unknown. Because Orn is an exoribonuclease, we asked whether pGpG hydrolysis can be carried out by genes that encode protein domains found in exoribonucleases. From a screen of these genes from Vibrio cholerae and Bacillus anthracis, we found that only enzymes known to cleave oligoribonucleotides (orn and nrnA) rescued the P. aeruginosa Δorn mutant phenotypes to the wild type. Thus, we tested additional RNases with demonstrated activity against short oligoribonucleotides. These experiments show that only exoribonucleases previously reported to degrade short RNAs (nrnA, nrnB, nrnC, and orn) can also hydrolyze pGpG. A B. subtilisnrnA nrnB mutant had elevated c-di-GMP, suggesting that these two genes serve as the primary enzymes to degrade pGpG. These results indicate that the requirement for pGpG hydrolysis to complete c-di-GMP signaling is conserved across species. The final steps of RNA turnover and c-di-GMP turnover appear to converge at a subset of RNases specific for short oligoribonucleotides.","authors":[{"name":"Mona W Orr"},{"name":"Cordelia A Weiss"},{"name":"Geoffrey B Severin"},{"name":"Husan Turdiev"},{"name":"Soo-Kyoung Kim"},{"name":"Asan Turdiev"},{"name":"Kuanqing Liu"},{"name":"Benjamin P Tu"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"Wade C Winkler"},{"name":"Vincent T Lee"}],"keywords":[{"word":"RNA degradation"},{"word":"cyclic-di-GMP signaling"},{"word":"dinucleotide hydrolysis"},{"word":"nanoRNase"},{"word":"pApA"},{"word":"pGpG"}]},"article210":{"pmid":"30249706","title":"Planktonic Interference and Biofilm Alliance between Aggregation Substance and Endocarditis- and Biofilm-Associated Pili in Enterococcus faecalis.","date":"2019-09-19","abs":"Like many bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis encodes a number of adhesins involved in colonization or infection of different niches.

Because different regulatory pathways have been reported for AS and Ebp, here, we examined if they are coexpressed on the same cells and what is the functional impact of coexpression on individual cells and within a population. We found that while Ebp are only expressed on a subset of cells, when Ebp and AS are expressed on the same cells, pili interfere with AS-mediated clumping and impede AS-mediated conjugative plasmid transfer during planktonic growth. However, when the population density increases, horizontal gene transfer rates normalize and are no longer affected by pilus expression. Instead, at higher cell densities during biofilm formation, Ebp and AS differentially contribute to biofilm development and structure, synergizing to promote maximal biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Irina Afonina"},{"name":"Xin Ni Lim"},{"name":"Rosalind Tan"},{"name":"Kimberly A Kline"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"aggregation substance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"endocarditis- and biofilm-associated pili"},{"word":"horizontal gene transfer"}]},"article211":{"pmid":"30249182","title":"Rhodoliths holobionts in a changing ocean: host-microbes interactions mediate coralline algae resilience under ocean acidification.","date":"2018-11-20","abs":"Life in the ocean will increasingly have to contend with a complex matrix of concurrent shifts in environmental properties that impact their physiology and control their life histories.

In the article we explored how the above-presented C. albicans fitness and virulence attributes provided a robust response to the environmental stress exerted by sulfones upon C. albicans; C. albicans fitness and virulence attributes are fungal properties whose inactivation attenuates virulence.

Expression level of pv1 gene was also analysed. Twenty-two S. aureus strains were isolated, and phenotype and genotype specific examinations for S. aureus isolates were carried out. Molecular identification was done by PCR using species-specific 16S rRNA primer pairs and finally 22 isolates were found to be positive as S. aureus. The antibiotic responsiveness of all these isolates and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of MRSA isolates were determined using the broth dilution method with vancomycin. Antibiogram analysis of isolated S. aureus strains with respect to different antimicrobial agents revealed antibiotic resistance ranging from 27 to 91%. The results of MIC for vancomycin showed 95% of strains to be VSSA and 5% to be VISA. 68% isolates were resistant to methicillin.

E. coli O157:H7 growth was notably promoted (P < 0.05), while biofilm formation was inhibited in the presence of montmorillonite (P < 0.05), which is attributed to the suppression of colanic acid (CA) production and an increase in bacterial motility.

Upon exposure to goethite, notably slower bacterial growth and higher biomass of biofilm were observed as compared to the control (P < 0.05). Goethite stimulated the synthesis of CA to encase cells in a protective biofilm in response to the tight association between bacteria and goethite, which could cause bacterial death.

For flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge, this rate-limiting effect of diffusion is often lumped in model parameters, like the half-saturation coefficients of Monod kinetics in activated sludge models (ASM). Yet, an explicit description of the reaction-diffusion process with biofilm models is more common for aerobic granular sludge. This work investigates whether apparent half-saturation coefficients could have applications for aerobic granular sludge as well and examines the implications of this simplification. To this end, the macroscopic reaction rates predicted with a one-dimensional biofilm (1D) model were fitted with Monod kinetics. The results showed that the macroscale rates could indeed be described using apparent kinetics, at the very least over a time scale where the microbial population distribution stays fixed. However, the coefficients were sensitive to changes in the microbial population distribution, which can be affected by long-term changes in operating conditions. Also the activity of organisms that compete for the same substrates affect the parameter value. Be that as it may, apparent kinetics also depend on the operating conditions for flocculent and anaerobic granular sludge, but they have still been used successfully for design and optimization. Therefore, the last section of this work illustrates that they may also have applications for aerobic granular sludge. A simple model for ammonium removal using apparent half-saturation coefficients for oxygen and ammonium is applied to a full-scale reactor, taking advantage of the batch-wise operation and on-line monitoring data for regular recalibration.","authors":[{"name":"Janis E Baeten"},{"name":"Mark C M van Loosdrecht"},{"name":"Eveline I P Volcke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ASM"},{"word":"Biofilm modelling"},{"word":"Diffusion"},{"word":"Granular sludge"},{"word":"Half-saturation coefficient"},{"word":"Monod"}]},"article245":{"pmid":"30242260","title":"In-vivo shift of the microbiota in oral biofilm in response to frequent sucrose consumption.","date":"2019-10-31","abs":"Caries is associated with shifts of microbiota in dental biofilms and primarily driven by frequent sucrose consumption.

Significant data have been generated to demonstrate the effectiveness of SeNPs alone or in combination with other reagents. Their activities are demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo experimentation; yet, the levels of efficacy need to be improved, particularly when compared with those of pharmaceutical drugs (such as antibiotics and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs). However, promising evidence suggests decreased toxicity when using SeNPs, and more importantly their ability to perform as an interfacing biomaterial with cells and tissues. SeNPs have demonstrated unique antibacterial properties: they inhibit bacterial adhesion, growth, and/or quorum sensing and as a result prevent biofilm formation on medical devices, to name a few. Therefore, as with other nanomaterials, SeNPs warrant further study as part of the biomaterial-based therapeutic toolkit as an alternative to traditional pharmaceutical agents. This paper will provide a succinct review of recent studies on SeNPs to critically assess the findings in the light of effectiveness, particularly highlighting the roles of the cellular interface. Finally, an outlook of the potential of SeNPs will be presented to highlight the need for more intensive studies of material stability, mechanistic understanding at subcellular levels, and investigations into their combinational and/or synergistic effects with other bioactive reagents including pharmaceutical drugs.","authors":[{"name":"Victoria le Ching Tan"},{"name":"Angelica Hinchman"},{"name":"Richard Williams"},{"name":"Phong A Tran"},{"name":"Kate Fox"}],"keywords":[]},"article252":{"pmid":"30241381","title":"Influence of Eugenia uniflora Extract on Adhesion to Human Buccal Epithelial Cells, Biofilm Formation, and Cell Surface Hydrophobicity of Candida spp. from the Oral Cavity of Kidney Transplant Recipients.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"This study evaluated the influence of the extract of Eugenia uniflora in adhesion to human buccal epithelial cells (HBEC) biofilm formation and cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) of Candida spp. isolated from the oral cavity of kidney transplant patients.

The multilayer films consisting of antibiotic gentamicin (Gen), tannic acid, and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were fabricated and coated on magnetic nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions. To achieve controlled drug release and improved biocompatibility, biodegradable hyaluronic acid was capped on the outer surface as a responsive shell.

The nanoplatform could be employed as a powerful nanocarrier for small molecular Gen and AgNPs delivery and on-demand release in response to bacterial infection microenvironment. The nanocomposites also showed satisfying antibacterial capacities against planktonic Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Intriguingly, with magnetic field navigation (NdFeB, 2000 gauss), the nanocomposites could be guided to handily penetrate into S. aureus biofilm and performed dual-responsive release, showing significantly enhanced biofilm disruption. Moreover, excess reactive oxygen species production resulting from the nanocomposites contributed to the decomposition of biofilm matrix and ultimate biofilm eradication. As a consequence, the ingenious antibacterial nanoplatform could be promising for combating biofilm infections while overcoming bacterial resistances with extra environmental factors such as magnetic field.","authors":[{"name":"Xi Wang"},{"name":"Juan Wu"},{"name":"Peili Li"},{"name":"Lina Wang"},{"name":"Jie Zhou"},{"name":"Gaoke Zhang"},{"name":"Xin Li"},{"name":"Bingcheng Hu"},{"name":"Xiaodong Xing"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ROS"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gentamicin"},{"word":"magnetic guidance"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"},{"word":"stimuli-responsive"}]},"article256":{"pmid":"30240117","title":"Canavalia ensiformis-derived lectin inhibits biofilm formation of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes.","date":"2019-01-25","abs":"A lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) derived from Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean) exhibits high-binding affinity to carbohydrates on bacterial cell surfaces.

This process could underlie the observed clinical association between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. However, the role of PPAD in host colonization by P. gingivalis and, subsequently, in triggering periodontitis is not known. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to delineate the role of PPAD in bacterial biofilm formation, and to define whether adherence to, invasion of, and host responses to bacteria of gingival keratinocytes depend on PPAD activity. We studied these aspects using PPAD-competent and PPAD-incompetent strains of P. gingivalis, and demonstrated that neither biofilm formation nor its composition was affected by PPAD activity. Similarly, flow cytometry revealed that PPAD did not impact the ability of P. gingivalis to adhere to and, subsequently, invade keratinocytes. Network analyses of gene expression patterns, however, revealed a group of host genes that were sensitive to PPAD activity (CXCL8, IL36G, CCL20, and IL1B). These genes can be categorized as potent immune modulators belonging to the interleukin 1 system, or chemoattractants of lymphocytes and neutrophils. Thus, we conclude that PPAD, although it is a potent modulator of the immune response, does not affect bacterial biofilm formation or the ability of P. gingivalis to adhere to and invade gingival epithelial cells.","authors":[{"name":"Ardita Aliko"},{"name":"Marta Kamińska"},{"name":"Brith Bergum"},{"name":"Katarzyna Gawron"},{"name":"Małgorzata Benedyk"},{"name":"Richard J Lamont"},{"name":"Stanisław Malicki"},{"name":"Nicolas Delaleu"},{"name":"Jan Potempa"},{"name":"Piotr Mydel"}],"keywords":[]},"article262":{"pmid":"30236955","title":"Bacteriophage Sb-1 enhances antibiotic activity against biofilm, degrades exopolysaccharide matrix and targets persisters of Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2019-03-25","abs":"Most antibiotics have limited or no activity against bacterial biofilms, whereas bacteriophages can eradicate biofilms.

The 45 identified Salmonella strains revealed the following virulence properties: swimming and swarming motility 45(100%); S-layer 39(86.67%); haemolytic activity 40(88.89%); lipase activity 43(95.56%); protease activity 43(95.56%); gelatinase production 43(95.56%); and DNA degrading activity 41(91.11%). The variation in the formation of biofilm-based on the diversity of Salmonella species was observed with higher percentage of Salmonella Typhimurium strains as strong biofilms producers under different environmental conditions. For surface hydrophobicity using bacterial adherence to hydrocarbons, 25(55.56%) were hydrophilic while 20(44.44%) were moderately hydrophobic from the 45 Salmonella isolates. Using salting aggregation test for surface hydrophobicity, all selected isolates 45(100%) was hydrophilic. Autoaggregation index for the 12 selected Salmonella isolates ranged from 15.2-47.2%, while the autoaggragation index for the 12 selected test bacteria ranged from 26.2-71.3%. Coaggragation between the 12 selected test bacteria and 12 Salmonella isolates ranged from 12.5-81.0%. The occurrence of pathogenic species of Salmonella from ready-to-eat shrimps could be detrimental to the consumers. Findings on the physiological conditions of biofilms formed by the foodborne pathogenic Salmonella and the cell surface characteristics therein are crucial for the advancement of methods for controlling Salmonella from ready-to-eat foods.","authors":[{"name":"Abeni Beshiru"},{"name":"Isoken H Igbinosa"},{"name":"Etinosa O Igbinosa"}],"keywords":[]},"article266":{"pmid":"30235334","title":"Manganese acquisition is essential for virulence of Enterococcus faecalis.","date":"2019-04-03","abs":"Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient that is not readily available to pathogens during infection due to an active host defense mechanism known as nutritional immunity. To overcome this nutrient restriction, bacteria utilize high-affinity transporters that allow them to compete with host metal-binding proteins. Despite the established role of Mn in bacterial pathogenesis, little is known about the relevance of Mn in the pathophysiology of E. faecalis. Here, we identified and characterized the major Mn acquisition systems of E. faecalis. We discovered that the ABC-type permease EfaCBA and two Nramp-type transporters, named MntH1 and MntH2, work collectively to promote cell growth under Mn-restricted conditions. The simultaneous inactivation of EfaCBA, MntH1 and MntH2 (ΔefaΔmntH1ΔmntH2 strain) led to drastic reductions (>95%) in cellular Mn content, severe growth defects in body fluids (serum and urine) ex vivo, significant loss of virulence in Galleria mellonella, and virtually complete loss of virulence in rabbit endocarditis and murine catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) models. Despite the functional redundancy of EfaCBA, MntH1 and MntH2 under in vitro or ex vivo conditions and in the invertebrate model, dual inactivation of efaCBA and mntH2 (ΔefaΔmntH2 strain) was sufficient to prompt maximal sensitivity to calprotectin, a Mn- and Zn-chelating host antimicrobial protein, and for the loss of virulence in mammalian models. Interestingly, EfaCBA appears to play a prominent role during systemic infection, whereas MntH2 was more important during CAUTI. The different roles of EfaCBA and MntH2 in these sites could be attributed, at least in part, to the differential expression of efaA and mntH2 in cells isolated from hearts or from bladders. Collectively, this study demonstrates that Mn acquisition is essential for the pathogenesis of E. faecalis and validates Mn uptake systems as promising targets for the development of new antimicrobials.","authors":[{"name":"Cristina Colomer-Winter"},{"name":"Ana L Flores-Mireles"},{"name":"Shannon P Baker"},{"name":"Kristi L Frank"},{"name":"Aaron J L Lynch"},{"name":"Scott J Hultgren"},{"name":"Todd Kitten"},{"name":"José A Lemos"}],"keywords":[]},"article267":{"pmid":"30235145","title":"Molecular Communications Pulse-Based Jamming Model for Bacterial Biofilm Suppression.","date":"2019-05-20","abs":"Studies have recently shown that the bacteria survivability within biofilms is responsible for the emergence of superbugs.

In this paper, we use proteomic data from a wet lab experiment to identify the communication channels that are vital to these processes. We also identified the main proteins from each channel and propose the use of jamming signals from synthetically engineered bacteria to suppress the production of those proteins. This biocompatible technique is based on synthetic biology and enables the inhibition of biofilm formation. We analyze the communications performance of the jamming process by evaluating the path loss for a number of conditions that include different engineered bacterial population sizes, distances between the populations, and molecular signal power. Our results show that sufficient molecular pulse-based jamming signals are able to prevent the biofilm formation by creating lossy communications channels (almost -3 dB for certain scenarios). From these results, we define the main design parameters to develop a fully operational bacteria-based jamming system.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel P Martins"},{"name":"Kantinan Leetanasaksakul"},{"name":"Michael Taynnan Barros"},{"name":"Arinthip Thamchaipenet"},{"name":"William Donnelly"},{"name":"Sasitharan Balasubramaniam"}],"keywords":[]},"article268":{"pmid":"30234663","title":"Tympanostomy tube otorrhea in children: prevention and treatment.","date":"2019-02-25","abs":"One in two children treated with tympanostomy tubes, experience episodes of otorrhea whilst their tubes are in place.

A previous study of our research group had demonstrated the effectiveness of the bacteriocin nisin to inhibit the growth of enological LAB, and its activity had been tested in culture broths. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of controlling the growth of bacteria in wine by the use of nisin in combination with sulfur dioxide, and to study nisin production by the natural producer Lactococcus lactis LM29 under enological conditions. Our results showed that L. lactis LM29 produced nisin in the presence of 2 and 4% ethanol (v/v), while higher concentrations of ethanol fully inhibited the production of nisin. We obtained a nisin enriched active extract (NAE) from the cell-free supernatant of a culture of L. lactis LM29 in MRS broth containing 60% (v/v) sterile grape juice, and the extract was fully active in inhibiting the growth of the enological LAB tested by the microtiter method. Moreover, the nisin concentration of the obtained NAE could actually prevent the formation of an undesirable biofilm of LAB strains. Finally, our results of wine ageing under winery conditions showed that the use of 50 mg/L nisin decreased fourfold the concentration of sulfur dioxide required to prevent LAB growth in the wines.","authors":[{"name":"Rocío Fernández-Pérez"},{"name":"Yolanda Sáenz"},{"name":"Beatriz Rojo-Bezares"},{"name":"Myriam Zarazaga"},{"name":"Juan M Rodríguez"},{"name":"Carmen Torres"},{"name":"Carmen Tenorio"},{"name":"Fernanda Ruiz-Larrea"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Lactococcus lactis"},{"word":"bacteriocin"},{"word":"lactic acid bacteria"},{"word":"nisin"},{"word":"sulfur dioxide"},{"word":"wine"},{"word":"winemaking"}]},"article271":{"pmid":"30233227","title":"Chronic tonsillitis and biofilms: a brief overview of treatment modalities.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Recurrent tonsillitis is described as when an individual suffers from several attacks of tonsillitis per year.

The diverse nature of EAEC is such that not all strains cause disease. Conversely, certain strains of EAEC possess additional virulence determinants associated with the ability to cause severe diarrhoea and other symptoms, which might be life-threatening in vulnerable patients. The EAEC virulence factors described to date are either encoded on the large virulence plasmid of EAEC (plasmid of aggregative adherence) or on pathogenicity islands on the chromosome. Testing of food and faecal samples involves the detection of EAEC-associated traits in the matrix followed by isolation of the organism and confirmation of the presence of EAEC-associated genes using PCR. The variability of the plasmid structure and virulence gene sequences and the possibility that this mobile genetic element may be lost has necessitated the inclusion of chromosomal markers in the molecular screening assays. There is evidence in the literature of foodborne transmission of EAEC, but currently no evidence of a zoonotic reservoir. Fimbriae-mediated adhesion and biofilm formation are likely to be involved in both clinical manifestations of infection and attachment to foodstuffs. Multidrug resistance appears to be common in EAEC and geographically widespread. Whole-genome sequencing has revealed the mosaic genomic structure of EAEC and provided evidence that horizontal gene transfer and recombination are the driving force for acquisition of novel genome features and potentially novel pathogenic mechanisms.

The results showed that the settleability of process Ⅰ was the best, followed by process Ⅲ and Ⅱ. Under the different operating conditions, the dominant bacteria and microbial community structure of the system changed significantly. The relative amount of Thiothrix was the dominant bacteria affecting the sludge settleability.

The anaerobic zone of process I had an inhibitory effect on the growth of the bacterium, while the anoxic zone of process Ⅱ stimulated its dominant growth. At the same time, comparison showed that the microbial population diversity was highest in process Ⅰ. followed by processes Ⅱ and Ⅲ. The introduction of anoxic and anaerobic zones led to the increase of system function and environmental complexity, and increased microbial community diversity. Analyses of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and fluorescence characteristics showed that the changes in microbial community structure had a significant effect on the composition and content of EPS, which aggravated the process of improving or deteriorating settleability. The sludge settleability was found to be positively correlated with the ratio of protein and polysaccharide in loosely bound EPS.","authors":[{"name":"Dan-Dan Wen"},{"name":"Lin-Jiang Yuan"},{"name":"Xi Chen"},{"name":"Yang Wang"},{"name":"Tong-Tong Shen"},{"name":"Xiao-Bo Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biological treatment"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"fluorescence characteristics"},{"word":"microbial community structure"},{"word":"sludge settleability"}]},"article289":{"pmid":"30229610","title":"[Characteristics of Denitrifying Phosphorus Removal by A","date":"2019-04-03","abs":"Low C/N domestic sewage was treated by an A","authors":[{"name":"Jian-Ming Huang"},{"name":"Zhi-Chao Zhao"},{"name":"Long-Ju Zheng"},{"name":"Zhao-Wei Shao"},{"name":"Fang-Jiao An"},{"name":"Yong-Zhi Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"aeration flow"},{"word":"biological aerated filter (BAF)"},{"word":"effective packing height"},{"word":"low C/N"},{"word":"low temperature"},{"word":"ratio of denitrifying phosphorus to nitrogen (ΔPO43-/ΔNO3--N)"}]},"article290":{"pmid":"30229238","title":"Preoperative Skin-Surface Cultures Can Help to Predict the Presence of Propionibacterium in Shoulder Arthroplasty Wounds.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Propionibacterium species are commonly cultured from specimens harvested at the time of revision shoulder arthroplasty.

Multiple mucosa-associated pathogens have evolved a mechanism of rapid adaptation, termed the phasevarion, which facilitates a coordinated regulation of numerous genes throughout the bacterial genome. This epigenetic regulation occurs via phase variation of a DNA methyltransferase, Mod. The phasevarion of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) significantly affects the severity of experimental otitis media and regulates several disease-related processes. However, the role of the NTHI phasevarion in biofilm formation is unclear. The present study shows that the phasevarions of multiple NTHI clinical isolates regulate in vitro biofilm formation under disease-specific microenvironmental conditions. The impact of phasevarion regulation was greatest under alkaline conditions that mimic those known to occur in the middle ear during disease. Under alkaline conditions, NTHI strains that express the ModA2 methyltransferase formed biofilms with significantly greater biomass and less distinct architecture than those formed by a ModA2-deficient population. The biofilms formed by NTHI strains that express ModA2 also contained less extracellular DNA (eDNA) and significantly less extracellular HU, a DNABII DNA-binding protein critical for biofilm structural stability. Stable biofilm structure is critical for bacterial pathogenesis and persistence in multiple experimental models of disease. These results identify a role for the phasevarion in regulation of biofilm formation, a process integral to the chronic nature of many infections. Understanding the role of the phasevarion in biofilm formation is critical to the development of prevention and treatment strategies for these chronic diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Kenneth L Brockman"},{"name":"Patrick N Azzari"},{"name":"M Taylor Branstool"},{"name":"John M Atack"},{"name":"Benjamin L Schulz"},{"name":"Freda E-C Jen"},{"name":"Michael P Jennings"},{"name":"Lauren O Bakaletz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNABII"},{"word":"HU"},{"word":"NTHI"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"otitis media"},{"word":"phasevarion"}]},"article294":{"pmid":"30228191","title":"Archaic and alternative chaperones preserve pilin folding energy by providing incomplete structural information.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Adhesive pili are external component of fibrous adhesive organelles and help bacteria attach to biotic or abiotic surfaces. The biogenesis of adhesive pili via the chaperone-usher pathway (CUP) is independent of external energy sources. In the classical CUP, chaperones transport assembly-competent pilins in a folded but expanded conformation. During donor-strand exchange, pilins subsequently collapse, producing a tightly packed hydrophobic core and releasing the necessary free energy to drive fiber formation. Here, we show that pilus biogenesis in non-classical, archaic, and alternative CUPs uses a different source of conformational energy. High-resolution structures of the archaic Csu-pili system from Acinetobacter baumannii revealed that non-classical chaperones employ a short donor strand motif that is insufficient to fully complement the pilin fold. This results in chaperone-bound pilins being trapped in a substantially unfolded intermediate. The exchange of this short motif with the longer donor strand from adjacent pilin provides the full steric information essential for folding, and thereby induces a large unfolded-to-folded conformational transition to drive assembly.

In addition, the need is increasing dramatically as the population ages with increasing tooth retention in seniors. Traditional materials for cavity restorations are usually bioinert and replace the decayed tooth volumes. This article reviews cutting-edge research on the synthesis and evaluation of a new generation of bioactive dental polymers that not only restore the decayed tooth structures, but also have therapeutic functions. These materials include polymeric composites and bonding agents for tooth cavity restorations that inhibit saliva-based microcosm biofilms, bioactive resins for tooth root caries treatments, polymers that can suppress periodontal pathogens, and root canal sealers that can kill endodontic biofilms. These novel compositions substantially inhibit biofilm growth, greatly reduce acid production and polysaccharide synthesis of biofilms, and reduce biofilm colony-forming units by three to four orders of magnitude. This new class of bioactive and therapeutic polymeric materials is promising to inhibit tooth decay, suppress recurrent caries, control oral biofilms and acid production, protect the periodontium, and heal endodontic infections.","authors":[{"name":"Ke Zhang"},{"name":"Bashayer Baras"},{"name":"Christopher D Lynch"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Mary Anne S Melo"},{"name":"Yuncong Li"},{"name":"Mark A Reynolds"},{"name":"Yuxing Bai"},{"name":"Lin Wang"},{"name":"Suping Wang"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"bonding agents"},{"word":"caries inhibition"},{"word":"oral biofilms"},{"word":"periodontal pathogens"},{"word":"polymeric composites"}]},"article298":{"pmid":"30227294","title":"Biological As(III) oxidation in biofilters by using native groundwater microorganisms.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Arsenic (As) contamination in drinking water represents a worldwide threat to human health.

In this study, we report on this intrinsic antibacterial effect exhibited by two distinct CP phases: an amorphous CP (ACP) and hydroxyapatite (HAp). The effect is prominent against a number of regular bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but also their multidrug-resistant (MDR) analogues. Although ACP and HAp displayed similar levels of activity against Gram-negative organisms, ACP proved to be more effective against the Gram-positive ones, with respect to which HAp was mostly inert, yet this trend became reversed for the MDR strains. In addition to the intrinsic antimicrobial effect of CP nanoparticles, we have also observed a synergistic effect between the nanoparticles and certain antibiotics. Both forms of CP were engaged in a synergistic relationship with a variety of concomitantly delivered antibiotics, including ampicillin, kanamycin, oxacillin, vancomycin, minocycline, erythromycin, linezolid, and clindamycin, and enabled even antibiotics completely ineffective against particular bacterial strains to significantly suppress their growth. This relationship was complex; depending on a particular CP phase, bacterial strain and antibiotic, the antibacterial activity (i) intensified proportionally to the nanoparticle concentration, (ii) plateaued immediately after the introduction of nanoparticles in minute amounts, or (iii) exhibited concentration-dependent minima due to stress-induced biofilm formation. These findings present grounds for the further optimization of CP properties and maximization of this intriguing effect, which could in the long run make this material comparable in activity to the inorganics of choice for this application, including silver, copper, or zinc oxide, while retaining its superb safety profile and positive eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cell selectivity.","authors":[{"name":"Victoria M Wu"},{"name":"Sean Tang"},{"name":"Vuk Uskoković"}],"keywords":[{"word":"amorphous"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"calcium phosphate"},{"word":"hydroxyapatite"},{"word":"multidrug-resistant"},{"word":"nanoparticle"},{"word":"synergy"}]},"article303":{"pmid":"30226395","title":"Integration Host Factor Is Essential for Biofilm Formation, Extracellular Enzyme, Zeamine Production, and Virulence in Dickeya zeae.","date":"2019-07-12","abs":"Dickeya zeae is a globally important pathogenic bacterium that infects many crops, including rice, maize, potato, and banana.

To facilitate interrogation of the core enterococcal genetic determinants for competitive fitness in the GI tract, biofilm formation, intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, and survival in the environment, we generated an arrayed, sequence-defined set of chromosomal transposon insertions in OG1RF. We used an orthogonal pooling strategy in conjunction with Illumina sequencing to identify a set of mutants with unique, single Himar-based transposon insertions. The mutants contained insertions in 1,926 of 2,651 (72.6%) annotated open reading frames and in the majority of hypothetical protein-encoding genes and intergenic regions greater than 100 bp in length, which could encode small RNAs. As proof of principle of the usefulness of this arrayed transposon library, we created a minimal input pool containing 6,829 mutants chosen for maximal genomic coverage and used an approach that we term SMarT (sequence-defined mariner technology) transposon sequencing (TnSeq) to identify numerous genetic determinants of bile resistance in E. faecalis OG1RF.

The incidences of infection have become more problematic attributable to emerging drug resistance and biofilm formation. These challenges suggest the need for new antimicrobial agents against S. aureus. In present work, we purified a fungal xenobiotic (FI3) which elicits a potent antimicrobial activity against a list of tested microbes including methicillin sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin resistance (MRSA) S. aureus. The cell growth of MSSA and MRSA were completely ceased with the 1× minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); 32 µg/mL and 128 µg/mL, respectively. The cell viability severely decreased within 90 min, due to disturbance of membrane homeostasis. This bactericidal effect was enhanced at lower pH (pH 4) with a speculation to retain positive charge. The FI3 potently disrupts biofilm adherence at 64 µg/mL and found to be a safe with no toxic effect on mammalian tissue. FI3 also leads to increase the potency of tested antibiotics. Taken together, we established that FI3 has a potent antimicrobial activity against tested microbes and safer to human tissue.

Extracellular matrices (ECM) and slanted glass coverslips are (SGC) used as biofilm substrates and biofilms have been investigated by SEM, confocal and crystal violet staining. ECM has shown enhanced biofilm formation under dynamic conditions rather than static conditions. SGC biofilm yield assay has shown higher levels of continuous layers and packed thicker biofilm formation with glass coverslip inserts, up to 1.7 to 3 times higher biofilm formation, than when compared with no glass coverslip inserts. A media immersed ECM study revealed that biofilm grown on extracellular matrixes formed thread-like pili structures, and that these structures had contact with the ECM and also showed excellent cell-to-cell interaction. In summary, A. baumannii showed higher biofilm formation capacities with ECM, while the prominent results were directly related with the biofilm formation capacity of A. baumannii. For the initial step of biofilm formation, adherence is an important factor and, consequently, strains with a comparatively high capability to adhere to extracellular matrices and slanted glass coverslips provide a new method of enhanced biofilm growth for in vitro assays.

Many virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa are controlled by the cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing (QS). QS depends on the synthesis, release, and groupwide response to extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. P. aeruginosa possesses two canonical LuxI/R-type QS systems, LasI/R and RhlI/R, that produce and detect 3OC12-homoserine lactone and C4-homoserine lactone, respectively. Previously, we discovered that RhlR regulates both RhlI-dependent and RhlI-independent regulons, and we proposed that an alternative ligand functions together with RhlR to control the target genes in the absence of RhlI. Here, we report the identification of an enzyme, PqsE, which is the alternative-ligand synthase. Using biofilm analyses, reporter assays, site-directed mutagenesis, protein biochemistry, and animal infection studies, we show that the PqsE-produced alternative ligand is the key autoinducer that promotes virulence gene expression. Thus, PqsE can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.

Three phylogenetically distinct flagellar gene clusters (FGCs) have been identified in Rhodobacteraceae that have been named fla1, fla2 and fla3 according to their relative abundance. In addition to the flagellar-dependent swimming and swarming motility, pilus-dependent twitching mediates bacterial locomotion. Furthermore, filament independent modes of motility, namely gliding and sliding, have been described for various microorganisms. However, no mode of motility other than swimming has so far been described for roseobacters. In the present study, we investigated motility, distribution of flagellar systems and the phylogeny of 120 genome-sequenced Rhodobacteraceae. The phylogenetically broad taxon sampling that included 114 type strains revealed the presence of at least ten distinct clades that were statistically well supported. The investigation of the actual physiological capacity for swimming motility on soft agar plates showed that only about half of the 120 tested strains were motile under the tested conditions. Seven strains developed a conspicuous dendritic motility phenotype that was reminiscent of the swarming motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The observed dendritic motility in two strains (i.e. Sulfitobacter pseudonitzschiae DSM 26842 and Roseovarius pacificus DSM 29589) was particularly surprising because they did not harbor any genes of the FGC. Accordingly, it was concluded that this form of dendritic motility was independent of a flagellum.

The present work adopted powdered activated carbon (PAC) as ballasting agent to achieve robust separation effect and efficiency of bio-refractory DOM from the bio-chemically treated cassava distillery wastewater (BTDWW). More than 90% of DOC could be removed at the PAC and Fe(III)-coagulant dosage of 1.40 g/L and 0.84 g/L as Fe when the BTDWW was neutral. PAC should be dosed before coagulant in order to mix well with the DOM in the BTDWW. The analyses of DOM in effluent reveal that PAC facilitated the removal of lignin breakdown products which could not be well eliminated by regular coagulation; the removal of DOM with MW < 5 kDa was mostly enhanced. The characteristics of flocs demonstrate that PAC reinforced the interaction between Fe(III) species and DOM by providing more reaction sites. The sedimentation could be completed within the initial 5 min, and the highest settling velocity was almost 8 times higher than that of the only Fe(III)-involved flocs. The large size and favorable robustness of PAC-involved flocs enabled decent sedimentation even though their stretched structure might not be desirable in regular coagulation.

Consequently, novel procedures are required, that would decrease the take-up of NAC but not reduce its antibacterial properties.

Native NAC inhibited growth of planktonic cells for the tested bacteria at concentration 0.25% w/v. Inhibition with equivalent solutions of the polymer derivatives was less effective due to the lack of SH groups. However, the tested polymers proved to be quite effective in eradication of mature biofilms.

In our previous work, the high phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of a clogging biofilm, developed in a simple aromatic hydrocarbon (BTEX)-contaminated groundwater well was uncovered. The determination of relationships between different groups of biofilm bacteria and certain metabolic traits has been omitted so far. Therefore, by setting up new biofilm-based enrichment microcosms, the research goal of the present study was to identify the aerobic/hypoxic BTEX-degrading and/or prolific biofilm-forming bacteria. The initial bacterial community composition as well as temporal dynamics due to the selective enrichment has been determined. The obtained results indicated that the concentration of dissolved oxygen may be a strong selective force on the evolution and final structure of microbial communities, developed in hydrocarbon-contaminated environments. Accordingly, members of the genus Malikia proved to be the most dominant community members of the aerobic BTEX-degrading enrichments. Acidovorax spp. dominated the oxygen-limited/hypoxic setup. During the study, a strain collection of 23 different bacterial species was obtained.

In the intracellular model, environment-driven gene expression and metabolism were captured using statistical regression and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, respectively. In the cellular model, growth, death, and type IV pili- and flagella-dependent movement were based on the bacteria's intracellular state. We implemented the extracellular model as a three-dimensional diffusion model used to describe glucose, oxygen, and autoinducer 2 gradients within the biofilm and bulk fluid. We validated the model by comparing simulation results to empirical quantitative biofilm profiles, gene expression, and metabolic concentrations.

Based on our in silico studies, planktonic bacteria had higher metabolite concentrations in the glycolysis and citric acid cycle pathways, with higher gene expression levels in flagella and lipopolysaccharide-associated genes. Conversely, sessile bacteria had higher metabolite concentrations in the autoinducer 2 pathway, with type IV pili, autoinducer 2 export, and cellular respiration genes upregulated in comparison with planktonic bacteria.

The SPLUNC1Δα4 showed markedly reduced biofilm prevention compared to the parent protein. Surprisingly, the 30-residue long α4 motif alone demonstrated minimal biofilm prevention activities. However, structural optimization of the α4 motif resulted in a modified peptide (α4M1) with significantly enhanced antibiofilm properties against methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus, including six different clinical strains of MRSA and the well-known USA300.

In this paper, the effect of a galU mutation leading to a dysfunctional UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDPG:PP) on in vitro biofilm biomass, adherence to lung epithelial cells and macrophage phagocytosis is studied.

Quorum sensing (QS) enables bacteria to communicate with one another and by doing so they can modulate their behavior in a cell-density dependent manner. In bacteria, quorum sensing molecules (QSMs) are known to control several factors such as virulence factor production, antibiotic production, biofilm formation, and gene regulation. Herein, we demonstrate the applicability of whole cell biosensing systems for the early identification of food contamination via detection of QSMs. Additionally, we have developed a portable system for detection of bacterial contamination using microdots of immobilized whole cell-based biosensors on paper that boast nanomolar level detection of QSMs in two different food matrices, namely beef and milk.

These communities can build up in a variety of different environments from industrial equipment to medical devices resulting in damage, loss of productivity and disease. They also have great potential for economic and societal benefits as bioremediation agents and renewable energy sources. The great potential benefits and threats of biofilms has encouraged researchers across disciplines to study biofilm characteristics and antibiofilm strategies resulting in chemists, physicists, material scientists, and engineers, to develop beneficial biofilm applications and prevention methods. The ultimate outcome is a wealth of knowledge and innovative technology. However, without extensive formal training in microbes and biofilm research, these scientists find a daunting array of established techniques for growing, quantifying and characterizing biofilms while trying to design experiments and develop innovative laboratory protocols. This mini-review focuses on enriching interdisciplinary efforts and understanding by overviewing a variety of quantitative and qualitative biofilm characterization methods to assist the novice researcher in assay selection. This review consists of four parts. Part 1 is a brief overview of biofilms and the unique properties that demand a highly interdisciplinary approach. Part 2 describes the classical quantification techniques including colony forming unit (CFU) counting and crystal violet staining, but also introduces some modern methods including ATP bioluminescence and quartz crystal microbalance. Part 3 focuses on the characterization of biofilm morphology and chemistry including scanning electron microscopy and spectroscopic methods. Finally, Part 4 illustrates the use of software, including ImageJ and predictive modeling platforms, for biofilm analysis.

The objective of this study is to understand how marine bacteria isolated from biofilms in the Mediterranean Sea interact and compete with each other when cultivated in multispecies biofilms. Four strains (Persicivirga mediterranea TC4, Polaribacter sp. TC5, Shewanella sp. TC10 and TC11) with different phenotypical traits and abilities to form a biofilm have been selected from a previous study. Here, the results show that these strains displayed a different capacity to form a biofilm in static versus dynamic conditions where one strain, TC11, was highly susceptible to the flux. These bacteria appeared to be specialized in the secretion of one or two exopolymers. Only TC5 seemed to secrete inhibitory molecule(s) in its supernatant, with a significant effect on TC10. Most of the strains negatively impacted each other, except TC4 and TC10, which presented a synergetic effect in the two and three species biofilms. Interestingly, these two strains produced a newly secreted compound when grown in dual-species versus mono-species biofilms. TC5, which induced a strong inhibition on two of its partners in dual-species biofilms, outfitted the other bacteria in a four-species biofilm. Therefore, understanding how bacteria respond to interspecific interactions should help comprehending the dynamics of bacterial populations in their ecological niches.","authors":[{"name":"Richard Guillonneau"},{"name":"Claudine Baraquet"},{"name":"Alexis Bazire"},{"name":"Maëlle Molmeret"}],"keywords":[{"word":"competition"},{"word":"marine bacteria"},{"word":"matrix components"},{"word":"multispecies biofilm"},{"word":"synergy"}]},"article362":{"pmid":"30214202","title":"Chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol nanoscale liquid film-forming system facilitates MRSA-infected wound healing by enhancing antibacterial and antibiofilm properties.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most predominant and fatal pathogens at wound infection sites.

However, the effect of ultrasonic scaling performed as a part of professional tooth cleaning on 3Y-TZP dental prostheses, especially in conjunction with low-temperature degradation (LTD), has not been fully investigated. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of ultrasonic scaling and LTD on the surface properties of 3Y-TZP in relation to bacterial adhesion on the treated surface. 3Y-TZP specimens (4 × 4 × 2 mm) were polished and then subjected to autoclaving at 134°C for 100 h to induce LTD, followed by 10 rounds of ultrasonic scaling using a steel scaler tip for 1 min each. Surface roughness, crystalline structure, wettability, and hardness were analyzed by optical interferometry, X-ray diffraction analysis, contact angle measurement, and nano-indentation technique, respectively. Subsequently, bacterial adhesion onto the treated 3Y-TZP surface was evaluated using Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis. The results demonstrated that the combination of ultrasonic scaling and LTD significantly increased the Sa value (surface roughness parameter) of the polished 3Y-TZP surface from 1.6 nm to 117 nm. LTD affected the crystalline structure, causing phase transformation from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase, and decreased both the contact angle and surface hardness. However, bacterial adhesion was not influenced by these changes in surface properties. The present study suggests that ultrasonic scaling may be acceptable for debridement of 3Y-TZP dental prostheses because it did not facilitate bacterial adhesion even in the combination with LTD, although it did cause slight roughening of the surface.","authors":[{"name":"Kosuke Nakazawa"},{"name":"Keisuke Nakamura"},{"name":"Akio Harada"},{"name":"Midori Shirato"},{"name":"Ryoichi Inagaki"},{"name":"Ulf Örtengren"},{"name":"Taro Kanno"},{"name":"Yoshimi Niwano"},{"name":"Hiroshi Egusa"}],"keywords":[]},"article372":{"pmid":"30212463","title":"Flexibility and constraint: Evolutionary remodeling of the sporulation initiation pathway in Firmicutes.","date":"2019-01-15","abs":"The evolution of signal transduction pathways is constrained by the requirements of signal fidelity, yet flexibility is necessary to allow pathway remodeling in response to environmental challenges. A detailed understanding of how flexibility and constraint shape bacterial two component signaling systems is emerging, but how new signal transduction architectures arise remains unclear. Here, we investigate pathway remodeling using the Firmicute sporulation initiation (Spo0) pathway as a model. The present-day Spo0 pathways in Bacilli and Clostridia share common ancestry, but possess different architectures. In Clostridium acetobutylicum, sensor kinases directly phosphorylate Spo0A, the master regulator of sporulation. In Bacillus subtilis, Spo0A is activated via a four-protein phosphorelay. The current view favors an ancestral direct phosphorylation architecture, with the phosphorelay emerging in the Bacillar lineage. Our results reject this hypothesis. Our analysis of 84 broadly distributed Firmicute genomes predicts phosphorelays in numerous Clostridia, contrary to the expectation that the Spo0 phosphorelay is unique to Bacilli. Our experimental verification of a functional Spo0 phosphorelay encoded by Desulfotomaculum acetoxidans (Class Clostridia) further supports functional phosphorelays in Clostridia, which strongly suggests that the ancestral Spo0 pathway was a phosphorelay. Cross complementation assays between Bacillar and Clostridial phosphorelays demonstrate conservation of interaction specificity since their divergence over 2.7 BYA. Further, the distribution of direct phosphorylation Spo0 pathways is patchy, suggesting multiple, independent instances of remodeling from phosphorelay to direct phosphorylation. We provide evidence that these transitions are likely the result of changes in sporulation kinase specificity or acquisition of a sensor kinase with specificity for Spo0A, which is remarkably conserved in both architectures. We conclude that flexible encoding of interaction specificity, a phenotype that is only intermittently essential, and the recruitment of kinases to recognize novel environmental signals resulted in a consistent and repeated pattern of remodeling of the Spo0 pathway.","authors":[{"name":"Philip Davidson"},{"name":"Rory Eutsey"},{"name":"Brendan Redler"},{"name":"N Luisa Hiller"},{"name":"Michael T Laub"},{"name":"Dannie Durand"}],"keywords":[]},"article373":{"pmid":"30212364","title":"Is PASH Syndrome a Biofilm Disease?: A Case Series and Review of the Literature.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"When occurring together, pyoderma gangrenosum, severe acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa have been described as PASH syndrome.

The bacterial suspension foam is stabilized with Cremodan as a surfactant and viscosified with Xanthan preventing water drainage. Further foam stabilization occurs through cellulose formation across the foam network. As bacterial cellulose formation is influenced by the viscosity of the growth media, we fine-tuned the concentration of Xanthan to allow for bacterial cellulose formation while avoiding water drainage caused by gravity. With this simple approach, we were able to design 3D bacterial cellulose foams without any additional processing steps. We argue that this templating approach can further be used to design foamy biofilms for biotechnological approaches, increasing the surface area and therefore the yield by improving the exchange of nutrients and metabolic products.","authors":[{"name":"Patrick A Rühs"},{"name":"Flavian Storz"},{"name":"Yuly A López Gómez"},{"name":"Matthias Haug"},{"name":"Peter Fischer"}],"keywords":[]},"article379":{"pmid":"30210803","title":"GePMI: A statistical model for personal intestinal microbiome identification.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Human gut microbiomes consist of a large number of microbial genomes, which vary by diet and health conditions and from individual to individual.

The mechanisms of biofilm formation and stress resistance, however, remain ambiguous. By analyzing biofilm and planktonic cell transcriptomes, this study observed that MIG1 (encoding a transcription factor) expression in cells increases during the biofilm formation process. To identify the role of MIG1 in yeast biofilm formation and the ethanol resistance of these cells, MIG1 was deleted and complemented in S. cerevisiae 1308. Results showed the MIG1 deletion mutant strain demonstrated weaker biofilm formation ability both on fibers and plastic than the wild-type and these could be restored by expressing MIG1 in deletion mutant. To verify the ability of MIG1 to regulate the expression of FLO genes, which encode adhesions responsible for yeast biofilm formation, FLO gene transcription levels were measured via qRT-PCR. Relative to wild-type S. cerevisiae, the adhesion genes FLO1, 5, and 9 which also demonstrate increased expression in the transcriptome of yeast cells during biofilm formation, but not FLO11, were down-regulated in the MIG1 mutant strain. Additionally, the MIG1 mutant lost a majority of its flocculation ability, which depended on cell-cell adhesions and its slightly invasive growth ability, dependent on cell-substrate adhesion. Deleting FLO1, 5, and 9 decreased biofilm formation on plastics, suggesting these FLO genes contribute to the biofilm formation process alongside FLO11. Moreover, the ethanol tolerance of yeast decreased in the MIG1 deletion mutant as well as the FLO11 deletion mutant, resulting in reduced biofilm formation during fermentation. It remains possible that in the later period of fermentation, when ethanol has accumulated, an over-expression of the FLO1, 5, and 9 genes regulated by MIG1 would enhanced cell-cell adhesions and thus protect cells in the outer layer of biofilms from ethanol, a function primarily dependent on cell-cell adhesions. This work offers a possible explanation for how biofilm formation is regulated during the immobilized fermentation process, and can enhance environmental tolerance in industrial production.","authors":[{"name":"Leyun Yang"},{"name":"Cheng Zheng"},{"name":"Yong Chen"},{"name":"Hanjie Ying"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"ethanol resistance"},{"word":"flocculation genes"},{"word":"transcription factor MIG1"}]},"article384":{"pmid":"30209945","title":"Label-Free Proteomic Approach to Characterize Protease-Dependent and -Independent Effects of sarA Inactivation on the Staphylococcus aureus Exoproteome.","date":"2019-12-28","abs":"The staphylococcal accessory regulator A ( sarA) impacts the extracellular accumulation of Staphylococcus aureus virulence factors at the level of intracellular production and extracellular protease-mediated degradation.

In contrast, NTHI continuously exposed to heme-iron traffics through the endolysosomal pathway for degradation. The use of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that prior heme-iron status does not appear to influence NTHI internalization through endocytic pathways. However, inhibition of macropinocytosis altered the intracellular fate of transiently restricted NTHI for degradation in the endolysosomal pathway.

Fecal microbiota from mice housed in a control environment representing 2,200 meters (NC group) above sea level with 16% Oxygen and mice that were placed in a hypobaric chamber representing 5000 meters (HC group) above sea level with 11% Oxygen for 30 days, were analyzed by the HiSeq Illumina sequencing platform. The results showed a significant difference in beta diversity observed between the two groups, while no significant difference was observed in alpha diversity. Compared with the NC group, the relative abundance of class Epsilonproteobacteria, phlym Actinobacteria, class Erysipelotrichia and genus Helicobacter were significantly lower (P<0.05), while the relative abundance of genus Alistipes was increased in the HC group; Phenotypic analysis showed no significant difference in aerobic, anaerobic, facultatively anaerobic, potentially pathogenic, stress tolerant, mobile element, biofilms formation, gram negative and gram positive between HC group and NC group; Functional analysis results showed significant differences in 34 gene functional metabolic pathways (carbohydrate digestion and absorption, energy metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, etc) between HC group and NC group. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to high altitude and low oxygen had the potential to change the intestinal microbial communities, which potentially may modulate metabolic processes in mice.","authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang"},{"name":"Lefei Jiao"},{"name":"Ruixin Liu"},{"name":"Yu Zhang"},{"name":"Qiaorong Ji"},{"name":"Huan Zhang"},{"name":"Xiang Gao"},{"name":"Yan Ma"},{"name":"Hai Ning Shi"}],"keywords":[]},"article396":{"pmid":"30208004","title":"The influence of dissolved oxygen on partial nitritation/anammox performance and microbial community of the 200,000 m","date":"2019-01-28","abs":"Mainstream partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A), coupled with excess biological phosphorus removal, in a 200,000 m","authors":[{"name":"Yeshi Cao"},{"name":"Bee Hong Kwok"},{"name":"Mark C M van Loosdrecht"},{"name":"Glen Daigger"},{"name":"Hui Yi Png"},{"name":"Wah Yuen Long"},{"name":"Ooi Kian Eng"}],"keywords":[]},"article397":{"pmid":"30207891","title":"Evaluation of Bacteriophage Anti-Biofilm Activity for Potential Control of Orthopedic Implant-Related Infections Caused by Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2019-01-14","abs":"Despite significant advancements in surgical protocols and biomaterials for orthopedics, peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains a leading cause of implant failure.

Immobilization was achieved using a simple, green process that does not require any linker or activator. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses showed successful attachment of both nisin and lysozyme onto the SNCC. The efficacy of the conjugated nanocellulose against the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus was tested in terms of bacterial growth, cell viability, and biofilm formation/removal. The results show that the minimum inhibitory concentration of the conjugated nanocellulose is higher than that of lysozyme and nisin in free form, which was expected given that immobilization reduces the possible spatial orientations of these proteins. We observed that free nisin is not active against S. aureus after 24 h of exposure due to either deactivation of free nisin or development of resistance in S. aureus against free nisin. Interestingly, we did not observe this phenomenon when the bacteria were exposed to antibacterials immobilized on nanocellulose, suggesting that immobilization of antibacterial agents onto SNCC effectively retains their activity over long time periods. We suggest that antibacterial SNCC is a promising candidate for the development of antibacterial wound dressings.","authors":[{"name":"Mandana Tavakolian"},{"name":"Mira Okshevsky"},{"name":"Theo G M van de Ven"},{"name":"Nathalie Tufenkji"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial activity"},{"word":"lysozyme"},{"word":"nanocrystalline cellulose"},{"word":"nisin"},{"word":"wound dressing"}]},"article399":{"pmid":"30207500","title":"Insights into Bacterial Milk Spoilage with Particular Emphasis on the Roles of Heat-Stable Enzymes, Biofilms, and Quorum Sensing.","date":"2019-11-07","abs":"Milk spoilage caused by psychrotrophic bacteria and their heat-stable enzymes is a serious challenge for the dairy industry. In many studies, spoilage has been explored based on the simplistic view of undesirable enzymes produced by planktonic cells. Recently, biofilms and quorum sensing (QS) have been suggested as important factors in the deterioration of milk, which opens new avenues for investigation of the processes and challenges. Production and heat stability of enzymes are enhanced in biofilms, mainly because of inherent differences in physiological states and protective shielding by extracellular polymeric substances. QS plays a key role in modulating expression of hydrolytic enzymes and biofilm formation. To date, few studies have been conducted to investigate the complex interplays of enzyme production, biofilm formation, and QS. This review provides novel insights into milk spoilage with particular emphasis on the roles of biofilms and QS and summarizes potential effective strategies for controlling the spoilage of milk.","authors":[{"name":"Lei Yuan"},{"name":"Faizan A Sadiq"},{"name":"Mette Burmølle"},{"name":"Tongjie Liu"},{"name":"Guoqing He"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Milk spoilage"},{"word":"Psychrotrophic bacteria"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"}]}}
