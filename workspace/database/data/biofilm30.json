In its sister species Candida albicans, the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway regulates fungal adhesion and dimorphism, both of which correlate closely with virulence. CaTpk1 and CaTpk2, the catalytic subunits of PKA, not only share redundant functions in hyphal growth, adhesion, and biofilm formation, but also have distinct roles in stress responses and pathogenesis, respectively. However, studies on PKA in the emerging fungal pathogen C. tropicalis are limited. Our results suggest that Tpk1 is involved in cell wall integrity and drug tolerance. The tpk2/tpk2 mutants, which have no protein kinase A activity, have reduced hyphal growth and adhesion. In addition, the tpk1/tpk1 tpk2/tpk2 double deletion mutant demonstrated delayed growth and impaired hyphal formation. In a murine model of systemic infection, both TPK1 and TPK2 were required for full virulence. We further found that EFG1 and HWP1 expression is regulated by PKA, while BCR1, FLO8, GAL4, and RIM101 are upregulated in the tpk1/tpk1 tpk2/tpk2 mutant. This study demonstrates that Tpk1 is involved in drug tolerance and cell wall integrity, while Tpk2 serves as a key regulator in dimorphism and adhesion. Both Tpk1 and Tpk2 are required for growth and full virulence in C. tropicalis.","authors":[{"name":"Chi-Jan Lin"},{"name":"Chia-Yen Wu"},{"name":"Shang-Jie Yu"},{"name":"Ying-Lien Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. tropicalis"},{"word":"PKA"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"hyphal growth"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"29253985","title":"Protective effects of natural and partially degraded konjac glucomannan on Bifidobacteria against antibiotic damage.","date":"2018-08-21","abs":"This study was to evaluate the protective effects of a dietary fiber, konjac glucomannan (KGM) from the plant tuber of Amorphohallus konjac on Bifidobacteria against antibiotic damage.

Also, biofilm formation as well as quorum sensing, extracellular enzymes, flagella, pili/fimbriae, small colony variant, other virulence or virulence-associated factors, the antibiotic resistance factors, and their implications are considered. Low outer membrane permeability, natural MDR efflux systems, and/or resistance genes, resistance mechanisms like the production of two inducible chromosomally encoded β-lactamases, and lack of carefully compiled patient history are factors that pose great challenges to the S. maltophilia control arsenals. The fluoroquinolone, some tetracycline derivatives and trimethoprim-sulphamethaxole (TMP-SMX) were reported as effective antibiotics with good therapeutic outcome. However, TMP-SMX resistance and allergies to sulfa together with high toxicity of fluoroquinolone are notable setbacks.

In this work, we investigated the impact of different cell surface molecules, including cell surface proteins, wall teichoic acids, lipoteichoic acids, and exopolysaccharides, on the transfer and acquisition of ICESt3 from Streptococcus thermophilus The transfer of ICESt3 from wild-type (WT) donor cells to mutated recipient cells increased 5- to 400-fold when recipient cells were affected in lipoproteins, teichoic acids, or exopolysaccharides compared to when the recipient cells were WT. These mutants displayed an increased biofilm-forming ability compared to the WT, suggesting better cell interactions that could contribute to the increase of ICESt3 acquisition. Microscopic observations of S. thermophilus cell surface mutants showed different phenotypes (aggregation in particular) that can also have an impact on conjugation. In contrast, the same mutations did not have the same impact when the donor cells, instead of recipient cells, were mutated. In that case, the transfer frequency of ICESt3 decreased compared to that with the WT. The same observation was made when both donor and recipient cells were mutated.

Enterococcus faecium is a human pathogen that causes nosocomial bacteremia and at the present time, it is well known that most of the chronic infections are biofilm-based. Recent evidence suggested that subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of antibiotics have an important role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance and induction on biofilm formation. Based on this information, we aimed to determine the effect of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations on biofilm formation and the role of the antibiotic concentrations on the enterococcal surface protein gene (esp). To determine the impact of clinically important antibiotics on biofilm production, crystal violet assay was used.

The binding of inducer molecule to receptor activates the target gene, which then performs the necessary function in bacteria. In the past few years, several investigations have been conducted to explore the QS circuit in various bacteria, but still this information is insufficient to fully understand the bacterial gene expression cascade. In the present review, we summarize the QS architecture and their associated gene regulation in four Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is well established that S. aureus, B. cereus, and S. pneumoniae are potent human pathogen. A detailed understanding of QS circuit in these bacteria would be useful in preparation of customized medicine in future.

This study developed a lab-scale compact biofilm reactor to realize an efficient nitrogen removal performance by step-feed, intermittent aeration, and immobilization technique. The results show that an efficient simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) process took place by feeding with synthetic wastewater under high C/N ratio of 2 and with real sewage as well, mainly due to the step-feed. The average removal efficiency of total inorganic nitrogen arrived at 72.7 and 63.3% for synthetic wastewater and real sewage, respectively. Besides the step-feed operation, the intermittent aeration was adopted to enhance SND, which allowed hydraulic behavior of compact biofilm reactor following the model of completely stirred tank reactor. The high-throughput sequencing analysis indicates that Sphaerotilus became the dominant genera with relative abundance of 30.29% under high C/N ratio, and the nitrifiers were not greatly inhibited. Moreover, the immobilization technique helped restore microbial activity under low temperature, promoting the satisfactory nitrogen removal performance of recovered microorganism to be rebuilt by feeding nutrient solution. Overall, the long-term SND process and maintaining effective biofilm activity can be established in the compact biofilm reactor through several improving alternatives.","authors":[{"name":"Ming Zeng"},{"name":"Jie Hu"},{"name":"Denghui Wang"},{"name":"Hongting Wang"},{"name":"Yaochen Wang"},{"name":"Nan Wu"},{"name":"Zongpeng Zhang"},{"name":"Chang Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biological wastewater treatment"},{"word":"C/N ratio"},{"word":"Embedded microorganism"},{"word":"Polyvinyl alcohol"},{"word":"Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification"}]},"article34":{"pmid":"29243115","title":"Activity of taurolidine gels on ex vivo periodontal biofilm.","date":"2018-12-17","abs":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of two different taurolidine (TAU) gels in comparison with a 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel on an ex vivo subgingival biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Luca Pirracchio"},{"name":"Aline Joos"},{"name":"Nina Luder"},{"name":"Anton Sculean"},{"name":"Sigrun Eick"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Periodontal therapy"}]},"article35":{"pmid":"29242901","title":"Designed Host Defense Peptides for the Treatment of Bacterial Keratitis.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"To limit corneal damage and potential loss of vision, bacterial keratitis must be treated aggressively.

Therefore, the antibacterial activity of prolonged exposure to moderate SMF (170 mT) and its possible synergistic activity with alkaline pH (pH = 9) were evaluated in the study. The ability to form a biofilm under these conditions was examined by crystal violet assay. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the relative expression of stress (dnaK and groEL) and virulence (efaA, ace, gelE and fsrC) related genes. As the results indicated, cell proliferation was inhibited after 120 h of SMF exposure. What's more, the combined treatment of SMF and alkaline pH showed significantly improved antimicrobial action when compared to single SMF and alkaline pH treatment for more than 24 h and 72 h respectively. However, the ability to form a biofilm was also enhanced under SMF and alkaline pH treatments. SMF can induce stress response by up-regulating the expression of dnaK and elevate virulence gene expression (efaA and ace). These responses were more significant and more genes were up-regulated including groEL, gelE and fsrC when exposed to SMF and alkaline pH simultaneously.

Acid production by S. mutans was evaluated by a colorimetric L-lactate assay and pH measurement of bacterial cultures. Buffering capacity was assessed by a pH titration assay. Soy milk supported the most biofilm growth, while the least was observed with unsweetened almond milk (both p < 0.001). Among almond milks, sucrose-sweetened milk led to the highest level of biofilm formation (p < 0.001), while the least was observed with unsweetened milk (p < 0.05). Sucrose-sweetened almond milk yielded the lowest pH (4.56 ± 0.66), followed by soy milk and bovine milk; the highest pH was with unsweetened almond milk (6.48 ± 0.5). When analyzed by pH titration, the unsweetened almond milk displayed the weakest buffering capacity while bovine milk showed the highest (p < 0.001). These results suggest that the almond milk beverages, except those that are sweetened with sucrose, possess limited cariogenic properties, while soy milk exhibits the most cariogenic potential.

Recent structure-function analyses suggested an ATPase-dependent role of the Rio proteins to regulate their dynamic association with the nascent pre-SSU. However, the evolutionary origin of this feature and the detailed molecular mechanism that allows controlled activation of the catalytic activity remained to be determined. In this work we provide functional evidence showing a conserved role of the archaeal Rio proteins for the synthesis of the SSU in archaea. Moreover, we unravel a conserved RNA-dependent regulation of the Rio ATPases, which in the case of Rio2 involves, at least, helix 30 of the SSU rRNA and the P-loop lysine within the shared RIO domain. Together, our study suggests a ribosomal RNA-mediated regulatory mechanism enabling the appropriate stimulation of Rio2 catalytic activity and subsequent release of Rio2 from the nascent pre-40S particle.

In laboratory column experiments (reported previously), it was observed that complete dechlorination of cis-dichloroethene to ethene was sustained at high flow velocity (0.51 m/d), but that dechlorination failed at medium or low flow velocity (0.080 or 0.036 m/d). The mathematical model applied here accounts for transport of chlorinated ethenes in flowing groundwater, mass transfer of chlorinated ethenes between mobile groundwater and stationary biofilms, and diffusion and biodegradation within the biofilms. Monod kinetics with competitive inhibition are used to describe biodegradation. Nearly all parameters needed to solve the model are estimated independently from batch and nonreactive transport experiments. Comparing the model predictions to the experimental results permits the evaluation of three hypothesized biological limitations: insufficient supply of electron donor, decay of dechlorinators' biomass, and reduction in bacterial metabolism rates. Any of these three limitations are able to adequately describe observed experimental data, but insufficient supply of electron donor is the most plausible explanation for failure of dechlorination. Therefore, an important conclusion of this investigation is that insufficient hydrogen production occurs if groundwater flow is too slow to provide adequate flux of electron donor. Model simulations were in good agreement with experimental results for both successful and unsuccessful dechlorination, suggesting the model is a valid tool for describing transport and reductive dechlorination. An implication of our findings is that in engineered or natural bioremediation of chloroethene-contaminated groundwater, not only must the proper dechlorinating organisms be present, but also proper groundwater flow conditions must be maintained or else dechlorination may fail.","authors":[{"name":"Itza Mendoza-Sanchez"},{"name":"Robin L Autenrieth"},{"name":"Thomas J McDonald"},{"name":"Jeffrey A Cunningham"}],"keywords":[]},"article54":{"pmid":"29236466","title":"Honokiol-Inspired Analogs as Inhibitors of Oral Bacteria.","date":"2019-06-14","abs":"The oral microbiome is a complex ecological niche where both commensal and pathogenic bacteria coexist.

Recent longitudinal studies have suggested that caries is most strongly correlated with total sugar intake, contrasting with the prevailing view that intake frequency is the primary determinant. To explore this possibility, we employed a computational model for supragingival plaque to systematically sample combinations of sugar frequency and total amount, allowing their independent contributions on the ratio of aciduric (i.e. cariogenic) to non-aciduric bacteria to be unambiguously determined. Sugar frequency was found to be irrelevant for either very high or very low daily total amounts as the simulated biofilm was predicted to be always or never cariogenic, respectively. Frequency was a determining factor for intermediate total amounts of sugar, including the estimated average human consumption. An increased risk of caries (i.e. high prevalence of aciduric/non-aciduric species) was predicted for high intake frequencies. Thus, both total amount and frequency of sugar intake may combine to influence plaque cariogenicity.

After a 3-week feeding period to induce secondary caries, the molars were harvested for the evaluation of the secondary caries. Lesion depth (LD) and mineral loss (ML) were measured via a micro-CT method, and a modified Keyes scoring method yielded scores for the caries lesions. Statistical analysis was divided into 2 parts: a correlation analysis between 2 evaluations with one-way ANOVA and a least-significant differences (LSD) test, and an evaluation of anticaries adhesives with a paired samples t test. The results showed that: (1) secondary caries was successfully produced in rats; (2) there was a correlation between the modified Keyes scoring method and micro-CT in the evaluation of the secondary caries; (3) the adhesive containing DMADDM significantly reduced both LD and ML (according to micro-CT), and also lowered the scores (based on the modified Keyes scoring method). This suggests that the novel DMADDM adhesive could perform an anticaries function in vivo via the secondary caries animal model which was also developed and testified in research. Secondary caries is one of the major reasons leading to the failure of caries restoration treatment. As a solution, anticaries adhesives perform well in biofilm inhibition in vitro.

The goal of the present study was to further unravel the anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm properties of PHS in both static and dynamic in vitro biofilm models against a full salivary inoculum. After 3 h under static conditions, bacterial adherence on PHS-treated cover glass slides was reduced by 60% compared to the untreated surface. After 6 and 24 h under static conditions, no significant differences in bacterial adherence were observed between PHS-treated and untreated cover glass slides. However, under dynamic conditions, i.e., the presence of shear forces, virtually no bacterial adherence was observed for up to 16 h on PHS-coated surfaces. Besides, PHS showed a strong bactericidal activity on salivary biofilms. Treatment of a 3- and 6-h statically grown biofilm resulted in a 99 and 94% reduction of viable cells, respectively, which was effectuated within minutes. In principle, these anti-adherence and anti-biofilm properties make PHS a promising candidate ingredient for use in oral care products aimed at oral microbial control.","authors":[{"name":"Floris J Bikker"},{"name":"Michel A Hoogenkamp"},{"name":"Amine Malhaoui"},{"name":"Kamran Nazmi"},{"name":"Jessica Neilands"},{"name":"Bastiaan P Krom"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-adherence properties"},{"word":"Anti-biofilm properties"},{"word":"Phytosphingosine"},{"word":"Prevention"},{"word":"Saliva"}]},"article78":{"pmid":"29232578","title":"Hetero-Diels-Alder reactions of novel 3-triazolyl-nitrosoalkenes as an approach to functionalized 1,2,3-triazoles with antibacterial profile.","date":"2018-01-01","abs":"The generation and reactivity of 3-triazolyl-nitrosoalkenes are reported for the first time.

During infection, bacteria in biofilms exhibit slow growth and a low metabolic state due to O₂ limitation imposed by intense O₂ consumption of polymorphonuclear leukocytes or metabolically active bacteria in the biofilm periphery. Due to variable O₂ availability throughout the infection, pathogen growth can involve aerobic, microaerobic and anaerobic metabolism. This has serious implications for the antibiotic treatment of infections (e.g., in chronic wounds or in the chronic lung infection of cystic fibrosis patients), as antibiotics are usually optimized for aerobic, fast-growing bacteria.

This intricate host-microbe relationship is a result of the long-term coevolution between the two. While the inheritance of mutational changes in the host evolution is almost exclusively vertical, the main mechanism of bacterial evolution is horizontal gene exchange. The gut conditions, with stable temperature, continuous food supply, constant physicochemical conditions, extremely high concentration of microbial cells and phages, and plenty of opportunities for conjugation on the surfaces of food particles and host tissues, represent one of the most favorable ecological niches for horizontal gene exchange. Thus, the gut microbial system genetically is very dynamic and capable of rapid response, at the genetic level, to selection, for example, by antibiotics. There are many other factors to which the microbiota may dynamically respond including lifestyle, therapy, diet, refined food, food additives, consumption of pre- and probiotics, and many others. The impact of the changing selective pressures on gut microbiota, however, is poorly understood. Presumably, the gut microbiome responds to these changes by genetic restructuring of gut populations, driven mainly via horizontal gene exchange. Thus, our main goal is to reveal the role played by horizontal gene exchange in the changing landscape of the gastrointestinal microbiome and potential effect of these changes on human health in general and autoimmune diseases in particular.","authors":[{"name":"Aaron Lerner"},{"name":"Torsten Matthias"},{"name":"Rustam Aminov"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dysbiome"},{"word":"environment"},{"word":"gut"},{"word":"horizontal gene transfer"},{"word":"intestine"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"probiotics"}]},"article87":{"pmid":"29230206","title":"Anaerobic Corrosion of 304 Stainless Steel Caused by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous bacterium capable of forming problematic biofilms in many environments.

Actually, thousands of bacterial and around one hundred of fungal phylotypes can colonize the oral cavity. Taxonomic profiling combined with functional expression analysis has revealed that Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans and prominent periodontopathogens are not always present or numerically important in candidiasis, caries, or periodontitis lesions. However, C. albicans combined with Streptococcus spp. co-increase their virulence in invasive candidiasis, early childhood caries or peri-implantitis. As Candida species and many other fungi are also members of oral microcosms in healthy individuals, mixed fungal-bacterial biofilm models are increasingly valuable investigative tools, and new fungal-bacterial species combinations need to be investigated. Here we review the key points and current methods for culturing in vitro mixed fungal-bacterial models of oral biofilms. According to ecosystem under study (health, candidiasis, caries, periodontitis), protocol design will select microbial strains, biofilm support (polystyrene plate, cell culture, denture, tooth, implant), pre-treatment support (human or artificial saliva) and culture conditions. Growing mixed fungal-bacterial biofilm models in vitro is a difficult challenge. But reproducible models are needed, because oral hygiene products, food and beverage, medication, licit and illicit drugs can influence oral ecosystems. So, even though most oral fungi and bacteria are not cultivable, in vitro microbiological models should still be instrumental in adapting oral care products, dietary products and care protocols to patients at higher risk of oral diseases. Microbial biofilm models combined with oral epithelial cell cultures could also aid in understanding the inflammatory reaction.","authors":[{"name":"Marlene Chevalier"},{"name":"Stephane Ranque"},{"name":"Isabelle Prêcheur"}],"keywords":[]},"article98":{"pmid":"29228246","title":"Clinical impact of Candida spp. biofilm production in a cohort of patients with candidemia.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Persistent candidemia refers to the continued isolation of the same Candida species in the blood of a candidemic patient despite appropriate therapy.

A total of 55 isolates of Candida were tested and characterized in two groups: (i) group I, which included seven patients with persistent candidemia, and (ii) group II, which included 18 patients with nonpersistent candidemia. Microorganisms were identified at the species level by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Biofilm quantification was evaluated by the crystal violet staining method and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). Molecular tests confirmed the identification of Candida albicans (92% group I and 94% group II) and Candida dubliniensis isolates (8% group I and 6% group II). All 55 isolates were able to form biofilms, but a higher biofilm mass was produced by C. albicans/C. dubliniensis strains cultured from the persistent group (P < .05).

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of E. faecalis biofilm formation in a sample of clinical isolates and to explore the virulence factors associated with biofilm formation in those isolates. A total of 265 E. faecalis isolates were collected from patients in Shenzhen, China. Virulence genes were detected within the genomes of the microbes by polymerase chain reaction. The isolates were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on housekeeping genes. Biofilms were detected by crystal violet staining. The expression levels of the clinical E. faecalis isolates' genes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence of biofilm formation among E. faecalis clinical isolates was 47.2%. MLST yielded 44 different sequence types (STs). The main STs were ST16 and ST179; the ST16 isolates were more likely to form strong or medium biofilm than the ST179 isolates (p < 0.001). Strong or medium biofilm formation was more common in linezolid-resistant isolates than in linezolid-sensitive isolates (p = 0.001). Biofilm formation was more frequently detected in enterococcal surface protein (esp+), surface aggregating protein (asa1+), cytolysin A (cylA+), or aggregation substance (agg+) positive isolates than in isolates that were negative (-) for these virulence factors. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that cylA [odds ratio (OR) 4.083, p < 0.001] was a risk factor for weak biofilm formation, and that esp (OR 8.207, p < 0.001) was a risk factor for strong or medium biofilm formation. The expression of cylA was raised (4.02 to 6.00-fold) in weak biofilm isolates compared to the biofilm-negative isolates, and the expression of esp was greatly elevated (11.39 to 134.08-fold) in strong biofilm isolates compared to biofilm-negative isolates.

We show that those changes may drive pathogen establishment in new environments with harmful consequences for freshwater species, but also for the human population. Based on the reviewed literature, we recommend reconstructing the recent past of anthropogenic impact through sediment analyses, to focus efforts on small, but highly productive waterbodies, and to collect data on the occurrence and variability of microorganisms, biofilms, plankton species and key species, such as amphibians due to their bioindicator value for ecosystem health and water quality.

Antibiotic resistance is a global problem that has developed through continuous antibiotic use, combinatorial antibiotic use, pesticide-antibiotic cross-resistance, and horizontal gene transfer, as well as various other modes. Pesticide-antibiotic cross-resistance and the subsequent expansion of drug-resistant bacteria are critically documented in this review, the primary focus of which is to assess the impact of indiscriminate pesticide use on the development of microbial communities with parallel pesticide and multidrug resistance. The consumption of pesticide-contaminated food products and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics by humans and in livestock animals have favored the development of both antibiotic and pesticide-resistant bacterial flora via natural selection. Pesticide resistance mainly develops through defensive bacterial adaptations such as biofilm formation, induced mutations, and horizontal/vertical gene transfer through plasmids or transposons, as well as through the increased expression of certain hydrolytic enzymes. Pesticide resistance genes are always transferred as gene clusters, and they may also carry genes essential for antibiotic resistance. Moreover, for some induced mutations, the mutated active site of the affected enzyme may allow degradation of both pesticides and antibiotics, resulting in cross-resistance. A few studies have shown that the sub-lethal exposure of wild-type strains to herbicides induces antibiotic resistance. This review concludes that xenobiotic exposure leads to cross-resistance in wild microbial flora, which requires further study to develop therapeutic approaches to overcome the threats of MDR bacteria and superbugs.","authors":[{"name":"Kirubakaran Rangasamy"},{"name":"Murugan Athiappan"},{"name":"Natarajan Devarajan"},{"name":"Gopinath Samykannu"},{"name":"Javid A Parray"},{"name":"K N Aruljothi"},{"name":"Nowsheen Shameem"},{"name":"Abdulaziz A Alqarawi"},{"name":"Abeer Hashem"},{"name":"Elsayed Fathi Abd Allah"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cross-resistance"},{"word":"Induced mutations"},{"word":"Pesticides and antibiotics"},{"word":"Plasmids"},{"word":"Transposons"}]},"article118":{"pmid":"29222953","title":"Bacterial community changes in copper and PEX drinking water pipeline biofilms under extra disinfection and magnetic water treatment.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"To study the stability of biofilms and water quality in pilot scale drinking water copper and PEX pipes in changing conditions (extra disinfection, magnetic water treatment, MWT).","authors":[{"name":"J Inkinen"},{"name":"B Jayaprakash"},{"name":"M Ahonen"},{"name":"T Pitkänen"},{"name":"R Mäkinen"},{"name":"A Pursiainen"},{"name":"J W Santo Domingo"},{"name":"H Salonen"},{"name":"M Elk"},{"name":"M M Keinänen-Toivola"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PEX"},{"word":"bacterial community"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"changing conditions"},{"word":"copper"},{"word":"disinfection"},{"word":"drinking water"},{"word":"magnetic water treatment"}]},"article119":{"pmid":"29221859","title":"Photodynamic Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (PACT), using Toluidine blue O inhibits the viability of biofilm produced by Candida albicans at different stages of development.","date":"2018-09-19","abs":"Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungus producing both superficial and systemic infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

This study aimed to evaluate in situ the substantivity and antiplaque effect on the plaque-like biofilm (PL-biofilm) of two solutions, a traditional formulation that contains EO with alcohol (T-EO) and an alcohol-free formulation of EO (Af-EO). Eighteen healthy adults performed a single mouthwash of: T-EO, Af-EO, and sterile water (WATER) after wearing an individualized disk-holding splint for 2 days. The bacterial viability (BV) and thickness of the PL-biofilm were quantified at baseline, 30 s, and 1, 3, 5, and 7 h post-rinsing (Test 1). Subsequently, each volunteer wore the splint for 4 days, applying two daily mouthwashes of: T-EO, Af-EO, and WATER. The BV, thickness, and covering grade (CG) of the PL-biofilm were quantified (Test 2). Samples were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy after staining with the LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ solution. To conduct the computations of the BV automatically, a Matlab toolbox called Dentius Biofilm was developed. In test 1, both EO antiseptics had a similar antibacterial effect, reducing BV after a single rinse compared to the WATER, and keeping it below baseline levels up to 7 h post-rinse (P < 0.001). The mean thickness of the PL-biofilm after rinsing was not affected by any of the EO formulations and ranged from 18.58 to 20.19 μm. After 4 days, the T-EO and Af-EO solutions were significantly more effective than the WATER, reducing the BV, thickness, and CG of the PL-biofilm (P < 0.001). Although, both EO antiseptics presented a similar bactericidal activity, the Af-EO rinses led to more significant reductions in the thickness and CG of the PL-biofilm than the T-EO rinses (thickness = 7.90 vs. 9.92 μm, P = 0.012; CG = 33.36 vs. 46.61%, P = 0.001). In conclusion, both essential oils antiseptics had very high immediate antibacterial activity and substantivity in situ on the 2-day PL-biofilm after a single mouthwash. In the 4-day PL-biofilm, both essential oils formulations demonstrated a very good antiplaque effect in situ, although the alcohol-free formula performed better at reducing the biofilm thickness and covering grade.","authors":[{"name":"Victor Quintas"},{"name":"Isabel Prada-López"},{"name":"María J Carreira"},{"name":"David Suárez-Quintanilla"},{"name":"Carlos Balsa-Castro"},{"name":"Inmaculada Tomás"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-infective agents"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"essential oils"},{"word":"fluorescence"},{"word":"local"},{"word":"microscopy"}]},"article126":{"pmid":"29217094","title":"Treatment of infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria.","date":"2019-05-22","abs":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria are a heterogeneous group of microorganisms that can often cause human infection, although they may also be considered to be contaminants or colonisers on occasions.

To test this scenario, we simulated the inflow of treated wastewater into a temperate lake using a continuous culture system with a gradient of concentration of microplastic particles. We followed the effect of microplastics on the microbial community structure and on the occurrence of integrase 1 (int1), a marker associated with mobile genetic elements known as a proxy for anthropogenic effects on the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. The abundance of int1 increased in the plastisphere with increasing microplastic particle concentration, but not in the water surrounding the microplastic particles.

Further genomic characterization revealed that these isolates had potential for arsenic resistance (due to presence of arsB gene in all isolates), an anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide oxidoreductase (in three isolates) and lacked the MarR-type transcriptional regulator gene rrpB (in all but one isolate) earlier shown to be involved in better survival under oxidative and aerobic stress. As putative virulence factors were concerned, there were differences between the water isolates in the presence of genes coding for cytolethal distending toxin (cdtABC), Type VI secretion system and sialylated LOS, as well as in biofilm formation. However, all isolates were motile and could adhere to and invade the human HT-29 colon cancer cell line in vitro and induce IL-8 secretion suggesting potential to infect humans.

Of >100 potential OxyR-controlled genes, 40 were strategically selected that were not predicted to be involved in the direct response to oxidative stress (e.g., catalase, peroxidase, etc.) and screened such genes by RT-PCR analysis for potentially positive or negative control by OxyR. Differences were found in 7 of 40 genes when comparing an oxyR mutant vs. PAO1 expression that was confirmed by ß-galactosidase reporter assays. Among these, phnW, encoding 2-aminoethylphosphonate:pyruvate aminotransferase, exhibited reduced expression in the oxyR mutant compared to wild-type bacteria. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated binding of OxyR to the phnW promoter and DNase I footprinting analysis also revealed the sequences to which OxyR bound. Interestingly, a phnW mutant was more susceptible to t-butyl-hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) treatment than wild-type bacteria.

We conclude that by promoting the expression of arginine biosynthetic genes, especially argB gene, the ciaR mutation reduced polysaccharide production, resulting in the formation of a fragile biofilm in Streptococcus sanguinis.","authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhu"},{"name":"Xiuchun Ge"},{"name":"Victoria Stone"},{"name":"Xiangzhen Kong"},{"name":"Fadi El-Rami"},{"name":"Yan Liu"},{"name":"Todd Kitten"},{"name":"Ping Xu"}],"keywords":[]},"article139":{"pmid":"29214175","title":"What Healthcare Workers Should Know about Environmental Bacterial Contamination in the Intensive Care Unit.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Intensive care unit- (ICU-) acquired infections are a major health problem worldwide.

Bacteria contaminate inanimate surfaces and equipment of the patient zone and healthcare area, generating a reservoir of potential pathogens, including multidrug resistant species. Traditional terminal cleaning methods have limitations. Indeed patients who receive a bed from prior patient carrying bacteria are exposed to an increased risk (odds ratio 2.13, 95% confidence intervals 1.62-2.81) of being colonized and potentially infected by the same bacterial species of the previous patient. Biofilm formation, even on dry surfaces, may play a role in reducing the efficacy of terminal cleaning procedures since it enables bacteria to survive in the environment for a long period and provides increased resistance to commonly used disinfectants. No-touch methods (e.g., UV-light, hydrogen peroxide vapour) are under investigation and further studies with patient-centred outcomes are needed, before considering them the standard of terminal cleaning in ICUs.

Accurate identification of C. difficile relative to the overall gut microbiome may be useful in assessments of colonization in research studies or as a prognostic indicator for patients with CDI. To investigate the burden of C. difficile at the species level relative to the overall gut microbiome, we applied a high-resolution method for 16S rRNA sequence assignment to previously published gut microbiome studies of CDI and other patient populations. We identified C. difficile in 131 of 156 index cases of CDI (average abundance 1.78%), and 18 of 211 healthy controls (average abundance 0.008%). We further detected substantial levels of C. difficile in a subset of infants that persisted over the first two to 12 months of life. Correlation analysis of C. difficile burden compared to other detected species demonstrated consistent negative associations with C. scindens and multiple Blautia species. These analyses contribute insight into the relative burden of C. difficile in the gut microbiome for multiple patient populations, and indicate that high-resolution 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis may prove useful in the development and evaluation of new therapies for CDI.","authors":[{"name":"Ninalynn Daquigan"},{"name":"Anna Maria Seekatz"},{"name":"K Leigh Greathouse"},{"name":"Vincent B Young"},{"name":"James Robert White"}],"keywords":[]},"article141":{"pmid":"29214046","title":"High-resolution bacterial 16S rRNA gene profile meta-analysis and biofilm status reveal common colorectal cancer consortia.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common cancer worldwide, with a growing incidence among young adults. Multiple studies have presented associations between the gut microbiome and CRC, suggesting a link with cancer risk.

Complementing these taxonomic studies is the newly recognized phenomenon that bacterial organization into biofilm structures in the mucus layer of the gut is a consistent feature of right-sided (proximal), but not left-sided (distal) colorectal cancer. In the present study, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and biofilm quantification in a new cohort of patients from Malaysia, followed by a meta-analysis of eleven additional publicly available data sets on stool and tissue-based CRC microbiota using Resphera Insight, a high-resolution analytical tool for species-level characterization.

Functional beta diversity was strongly correlated with taxonomic beta diversity in both the stream and lake microbial communities. Lake microbial assemblages displayed greater predicted metabolic potentials of many metabolism pathways while the microbial assemblages in stream biofilms were more abundant in xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism and lipid metabolism.

Its pathogenicity is associated with its virulence factors, resistance to antibiotics, and ability to form biofilm (BF). MRSA-BF infections in immunosuppressed patients pose great difficulties to clinical treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study aimed to establish a model of MRSA-BF infection in rats with cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppression. For this, rats were administered CTX on days 1 and 4. White blood cells (WBC) were counted, then rats were inoculated with a clinical MRSA 17546 (t037) on day 5. Rats were sacrificed on days 6-10 and tissue samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS Using the dose of CTX: 150 (mg/kg) + 100 (mg/kg) is better than the other 2 programs as the survival rates of the immunocompromised rats were higher than in the other 2 immunosuppressive groups. The survival rate was not different between rats in the clean environment and in the SPF environment. However, the survival rate was affected by the sample acquisitions. Importantly, WBC counts started to decline on day 4, and then started to rise on day 9. Moreover, MRSA-BFs were formed earlier in immunosuppressed rats compared to the normal rats, as shown by scanning electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS The study successfully established an immunosuppressed rat model of MRSA-BF infection, which provides methodological and data support for establishment of such animal models and is useful reference for related research. Our results may help further investigation of MRSA-BF infection.","authors":[{"name":"Tangjuan Liu"},{"name":"Yan Chen"},{"name":"Guan Bi"},{"name":"Jin Luo"},{"name":"Zhongye Du"},{"name":"Jinliang Kong"},{"name":"Yiqiang Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article149":{"pmid":"29212050","title":"Nitrogen loading affects microbes, nitrifiers and denitrifiers attached to submerged macrophyte in constructed wetlands.","date":"2018-10-09","abs":"Submerged macrophytes and biofilms are important components of wetlands.

Membrane based purification methods are used extensively in water treatment, and a major challenge for them is biofouling. The buildup of microbes and their extracellular polymeric matrix clog the purification membranes and reduce their efficiency. To understand the early stages of bacterial fouling on water purification membranes, we have used desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI MS), where ion formation occurs in ambient conditions and the ionization event is surface sensitive. Biosurfactants at the air-water interface generated by microorganisms as a result of quorum sensing, influence the water-membrane interface and are important for the bacterial attachment. We show that these biosurfactants produced by bacteria can be indicator molecular species signifying initiation of biofilms on membrane surfaces, demonstrated by specific DESI MS signatures. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the best studied models for biofilm formation, this process is mediated by rhamnolipids forewarning bacterial fouling. Species dependent variation of such molecules can be used for the precise identification of the microorganisms, as revealed by studies on P. aeroginosa (ATCC 25619). The production of biosurfactants is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level by the quorum-sensing (QS) response. Thus, secretion of these extracellular molecules across the membrane surface allows rapid screening of the biofilm community. We show that, the ambient ionization mass spectrometry can detect certain toxic heavy metals present in water, using surfactant-metal complexes as analytes. We believe that such studies conducted on membranes in various input water streams will help design suitable membrane processes specific to the input streams.","authors":[{"name":"Swathy Jakka Ravindran"},{"name":"Ramesh Kumar"},{"name":"Amitava Srimany"},{"name":"Ligy Philip"},{"name":"Thalappil Pradeep"}],"keywords":[]},"article151":{"pmid":"29211887","title":"Genomic insights into the non-histamine production and proteolytic and lipolytic activities of Tetragenococcus halophilus KUD23.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Tetragenococcus halophilus KUD23, a non-histamine producer, was isolated from a traditional Korean high-salt fermented soybean paste, doenjang.

Monospecies and mixed biofilms were developed of each strain, on 96-well microtiter plates for 48 h.

For the in vivo study, twenty-four mice received topical applications of monospecie or mixed suspensions of each strain. After 48 h, yeasts were recovered from the mice and quantified by CFU/mL count. In the biofilm assays, the results for the CFU/mL count and the XTT assay showed that the two species studied were capable of forming high levels of in vitro monospecie biofilm. In mixed biofilm, the CFU of C. krusei increased (p=0.0001) and C. glabrata decreased (p=0.0001). The metabolic activity observed in XTT assay of mixed biofilm was significantly reduced compared with a single C. glabrata biofilm (p=0.0001).

Of note, sessile bacteria not only persist but also concur preventing the effectors and regulators of the physiological inflammation to operate. Thus, it is urgent to design biologically sound experimental approaches aimed to extract, at the earliest stage, immune signatures of mono-bacteria planktonic to biofilm developmental transition in vivo and ex vivo.

In addition, filamentation is pivotal for robust biofilm development, which represents another major virulence factor for candidiasis and further complicates treatment. Targeting pathogenic mechanisms rather than growth represents an attractive yet clinically unexploited approach in the development of novel antifungal agents. Here, we performed large-scale phenotypic screening assays with 30,000 drug-like small-molecule compounds within ChemBridge's DIVERSet chemical library in order to identify small-molecule inhibitors of C. albicans filamentation, and our efforts led to the identification of a novel series of bioactive compounds with a common biaryl amide core structure.

In addition to filamentation, this compound also inhibited C. albicans biofilm formation. This leading compound also demonstrated in vivo activity in clinically relevant murine models of invasive and oral candidiasis. Overall, our results indicate that compounds within this series represent promising candidates for the development of novel anti-virulence approaches to combat C. albicans infections.","authors":[{"name":"Jesus A Romo"},{"name":"Christopher G Pierce"},{"name":"Ashok K Chaturvedi"},{"name":"Anna L Lazzell"},{"name":"Stanton F McHardy"},{"name":"Stephen P Saville"},{"name":"Jose L Lopez-Ribot"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"anti-virulence factor"},{"word":"antifungal drugs"},{"word":"filamentation"},{"word":"large-scale phenotypic screening"}]},"article162":{"pmid":"29208541","title":"Biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles using β-1, 3 glucan binding protein and their antibacterial, antibiofilm and cytotoxic potential.","date":"2018-08-22","abs":"The present study reports the biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles using crustacean immune molecule β-1, 3 glucan binding protein (β-GBP) purified from the haemolymph of blue swimmer crab Portunus pelagicus.

Chemical composition of the oils was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antibacterial activity of the oils and their major constituents were investigated using the broth microdilution method (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)). Susceptibility test, anti-adhesion, anti-biofilm, checkerboard and time-kill assays were also carried out. Physiological changes of the bacterial cells after exposure to the oils were observed under the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). O. stamineus and F. deltoidea oils mainly consisted of sesquiterpenoids (44.6% and 60.9%, respectively), and β-caryophyllene was the most abundant compound in both oils (26.3% and 36.3%, respectively). Other compounds present in O. stamineus were α-humulene (5.1%) and eugenol (8.1%), while α-humulene (5.5%) and germacrene D (7.7%) were dominant in F. deltoidea. The oils of both plants showed moderate to strong inhibition against all tested bacteria with MIC and MBC values ranging 0.63-2.5 mg/mL. However, none showed any inhibition on monospecies biofilms.

Pigmentation in S. lacrymans was stimulated by 13 different bacteria and cell-wall-damaging enzymes (lytic enzymes and proteases), but not by lysozyme or mechanical damage. The use of protease inhibitors with Bacillus subtilis or heat-killed bacteria during co-culturing with S. lacrymans significantly reduced pigmentation indicating that enzymatic hyphal damage and/or released peptides, rather than mechanical injury, was the major cause of systemic pigment induction. Conversely, no significant pigmentation by bacteria was observed from P. involutus.

Upon confirming that the methanolic crude extract of these isolates do not display direct bactericidal activities, they were tested for capacity to rescue Caenorhabditis elegans infected with P. aeruginosa strain PA14. A hexane partition of the extract from one isolate, designated as Streptomyces sp. CCB-PSK207, could promote the survival of PA14 infected worms by more than 60%.

Tested on PA14, the partition also did not affect bacterial growth or its ability to colonize host gut. The production of biofilm, protease, and pyocyanin in PA14 were uninterrupted, although there was an increase in elastase production. In lys-7::GFP worms, this partition was shown to induce the expression of lysozyme 7, an important innate immunity defense molecule that was repressed during PA14 infection.

The results indicated that reductions in the dry weight and acidogenicity of biofilms due to periodic fluoride treatment occurred in a concentration dependent manner. The reduction in dry weight without affecting bacterial cell viability was observed mainly due to the inhibitory effect of fluoride on gtfB and gtfC gene expression, which suppresses EPS production and avoids reduction of the pH below the critical point on the tooth surface.

Thus, there is a clear need for effective preventative measures, such as thin coatings that can be applied onto medical devices to stop the attachment, proliferation, and formation of device-associated biofilms. However, fungi being eukaryotes, the challenge is greater than for bacterial infections because antifungal agents are often toxic towards eukaryotic host cells. Whilst there is extensive literature on antibacterial coatings, a far lesser body of literature exists on surfaces or coatings that prevent attachment and biofilm formation on medical devices by fungal pathogens. Here we review strategies for the design and fabrication of medical devices with antifungal surfaces. We also survey the microbiology literature on fundamental mechanisms by which fungi attach and spread on natural and synthetic surfaces. Research in this field requires close collaboration between biomaterials scientists, microbiologists and clinicians; we consider progress in the molecular understanding of fungal recognition of, and attachment to, suitable surfaces, and of ensuing metabolic changes, to be essential for designing rational approaches towards effective antifungal coatings, rather than empirical trial of coatings.","authors":[{"name":"Carla Giles"},{"name":"Stephanie J Lamont-Friedrich"},{"name":"Thomas D Michl"},{"name":"Hans J Griesser"},{"name":"Bryan R Coad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial surface"},{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"Fungal disease"},{"word":"Medical devices"},{"word":"Mold"},{"word":"Mycoses"},{"word":"Surface modification"},{"word":"Yeast"}]},"article190":{"pmid":"29198862","title":"Towards smart biocide-free anti-biofilm strategies: Click-based synthesis of cinnamide analogues as anti-biofilm compounds against marine bacteria.","date":"2018-02-16","abs":"A set of triazole-based analogues of N-coumaroyltyramine was designed to discover potential leads that may help in the control of bacterial biofilms. the most potent compounds act as inhibitors of biofilm development with EC50 closed to ampicillin (EC50 = 11 μM) without toxic effect on bacterial growth even at high concentrations(100 μM).","authors":[{"name":"C Sall"},{"name":"M Ayé"},{"name":"O Bottzeck"},{"name":"A Praud"},{"name":"Y Blache"}],"keywords":[{"word":"1,3 Cycloadditions"},{"word":"Anti-biofilm"},{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Click chemistry"},{"word":"Triazole"}]},"article191":{"pmid":"29198821","title":"In vitro antagonistic activity and the protective effect of probiotic Bacillus licheniformis Dahb1 in zebrafish challenged with GFP tagged Vibrio parahaemolyticus Dahv2.","date":"2018-08-13","abs":"In vitro antagonistic activity and the protective effect of probiotic Bacillus licheniformis Dahb1 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) challenged with GFP tagged Vibrio parahaemolyticus Dahv2 was studied.

The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 090 is one of the food-borne pathogens associated with food poisoning that leads to an outbreak of perilous human infections worldwide. The development of resistance in bacteria and diffusion of coated synthetic preservatives into food are the major problem in food packaging industries. In the present work, we have developed a new food wrap method by cross-linking cinnamaldehyde on low-density polyethylene (Cin-C-LDPE) using novel photocrosslinker technology. The cinnamaldehyde showed potent antimicrobial activity (145mg/mL of MIC) against MRSA 090 and radical scavenging activity (RSA). The cinnamaldehyde was successfully cross-linked to LDPE and exhibited excellent antibiofilm properties against MRSA090 compared to bare LDPE. This positive interaction of developed Cin-C-LDPE against MRSA090 biofilm was confirmed by SEM and FT-IR studies, and results showed the damaged cell membrane architecture, inturn abridged adherence of MRSA090. The Cin-C-LDPE wrapped chicken, mutton, cheese, and grapes showed 2.5±0.15 log MRSA 090 reduction at the end of 10th day compared to the bare LDPE wrapped food samples. This clearly concludes that for the first time we have developed a novel Cin-C-LDPE food wrap technology effectively involved in biocidal activity against MRSA090.

It is known that frequent carbohydrate consumption or reduced saliva flow can lead to caries, and excessive plaque accumulation increases the risk of periodontal diseases. However, when these disease drivers are present, while some individuals appear to be susceptible, others are more tolerant or resilient to suffering from undesirable changes in their oral microbiome. Health-maintaining mechanisms that limit the effect of disease drivers include the complex set of metabolic and functional interrelationships that develop within dental biofilms and between biofilms and the host. In contrast, positive feedback loops can develop within these microbial communities that disrupt resilience and provoke a large and abrupt change in function and structure of the ecosystem (a microbial regime shift), which promotes dysbiosis and oral disease. For instance, acidification due to carbohydrate fermentation or inflammation in response to accumulated plaque select for a cariogenic or periopathogenic microbiota, respectively, in a chain of self-reinforcing events. Conversely, in tolerant individuals, health-maintaining mechanisms, including negative feedback to the drivers, can maintain resilience and promote resistance to and recovery from disease drivers. Recently studied health-maintaining mechanisms include ammonia production, limiting a drop in pH that can lead to caries, and denitrification, which could inhibit several stages of disease-associated positive feedback loops. Omics studies comparing the microbiome of, and its interaction with, susceptible and tolerant hosts can detect markers of resilience. The neutralization or inhibition of disease drivers, together with the identification and promotion of health-promoting species and functions, for example, by pre- and probiotics, could enhance microbiome resilience and lead to new strategies to prevent disease.","authors":[{"name":"B T Rosier"},{"name":"P D Marsh"},{"name":"A Mira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"ecology"},{"word":"oral health"},{"word":"periodontal diseases"},{"word":"prebiotics"},{"word":"probiotics"}]},"article211":{"pmid":"29194975","title":"Biofilm recruitment under nanofiltration conditions: the influence of resident biofilm structural parameters on planktonic cell invasion.","date":"2019-01-18","abs":"It is now generally accepted that biofouling is inevitable in pressure-driven membrane processes for water purification.

In such a scenario, an understanding of the fate of planktonic cells, such as those entering with the feed water, has important implications with respect to contact killing particularly for membranes with antimicrobial properties. This study thus sought to investigate the fate of planktonic cells in a model nanofiltration biofouling system. Here, the interaction between auto-fluorescent Pseudomonas putida planktonic cells and 7-day-old Pseudomonas fluorescens resident biofilms was studied under permeate flux conditions in a nanofiltration cross flow system.

Knowledge of factors contributing to the initiation and progression of pocket formation is important and may result in the development of better preventive measures and improve healing outcomes after therapeutic interventions. The periodontal pocket is a pathologically deepened gingival sulcus. In healthy periodontal conditions, the defense mechanisms are generally sufficient to control the constant microbiological challenge through a normally functioning junctional epithelium and the concentrated powerful mass of inflammatory and immune cells and macromolecules transmigrating through this epithelium. In contrast, destruction of the structural integrity of the junctional epithelium, which includes disruption of cell-to-cell contacts and detachment from the tooth surface, consequently leading to pocket formation, disequilibrates this delicate defense system. Deepening of the pocket apically, and also horizontal expansion of the biofilm on the tooth root, puts this system to a grueling test. There is no more this powerful concentration of defense cells and macromolecules that are discharged at the sulcus bottom and that face a relatively small biofilm surface in the gingival sulcus. In a pocket situation, the defense cells and the macromolecules are directly discharged into the periodontal pocket and the majority of epithelial cells directly face the biofilm. The thinning of the epithelium and its ulceration increase the chance for invasion of microorganisms and their products into the soft connective tissue and this aggravates the situation. Depending on the severity and duration of disease, a vicious circle may develop in the pocket environment, which is difficult or impossible to break without therapeutic intervention.","authors":[{"name":"Dieter D Bosshardt"}],"keywords":[]},"article216":{"pmid":"29194441","title":"Candida albicans FRE8 encodes a member of the NADPH oxidase family that produces a burst of ROS during fungal morphogenesis.","date":"2020-03-21","abs":"Until recently, NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes were thought to be a property of multicellularity, where the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NOX acts in signaling processes or in attacking invading microbes through oxidative damage. We demonstrate here that the unicellular yeast and opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is capable of a ROS burst using a member of the NOX enzyme family, which we identify as Fre8. C. albicans can exist in either a unicellular yeast-like budding form or as filamentous multicellular hyphae or pseudohyphae, and the ROS burst of Fre8 begins as cells transition to the hyphal state. Fre8 is induced during hyphal morphogenesis and specifically produces ROS at the growing tip of the polarized cell. The superoxide dismutase Sod5 is co-induced with Fre8 and our findings are consistent with a model in which extracellular Sod5 acts as partner for Fre8, converting Fre8-derived superoxide to the diffusible H2O2 molecule. Mutants of fre8Δ/Δ exhibit a morphogenesis defect in vitro and are specifically impaired in development or maintenance of elongated hyphae, a defect that is rescued by exogenous sources of H2O2. A fre8Δ/Δ deficiency in hyphal development was similarly observed in vivo during C. albicans invasion of the kidney in a mouse model for disseminated candidiasis. Moreover C. albicans fre8Δ/Δ mutants showed defects in a rat catheter model for biofilms. Together these studies demonstrate that like multicellular organisms, C. albicans expresses NOX to produce ROS and this ROS helps drive fungal morphogenesis in the animal host.","authors":[{"name":"Diego C P Rossi"},{"name":"Julie E Gleason"},{"name":"Hiram Sanchez"},{"name":"Sabrina S Schatzman"},{"name":"Edward M Culbertson"},{"name":"Chad J Johnson"},{"name":"Christopher A McNees"},{"name":"Carolina Coelho"},{"name":"Jeniel E Nett"},{"name":"David R Andes"},{"name":"Brendan P Cormack"},{"name":"Valeria C Culotta"}],"keywords":[]},"article217":{"pmid":"29194412","title":"A New Dihydrochromone Dimer and Other Secondary Metabolites from Cultures of the Marine Sponge-Associated Fungi Neosartorya fennelliae KUFA 0811 and Neosartorya tsunodae KUFC 9213.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"A previously unreported dihydrochromone dimer, paecilin E (","authors":[{"name":"Decha Kumla"},{"name":"Tin Shine Aung"},{"name":"Suradet Buttachon"},{"name":"Tida Dethoup"},{"name":"Luís Gales"},{"name":"José A Pereira"},{"name":"Ângela Inácio"},{"name":"Paulo M Costa"},{"name":"Michael Lee"},{"name":"Nazim Sekeroglu"},{"name":"Artur M S Silva"},{"name":"Madalena M M Pinto"},{"name":"Anake Kijjoa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Neosartorya fennelliae"},{"word":"Neosartorya tsunodae"},{"word":"Trichocomaceae"},{"word":"antibacterial activity"},{"word":"chromanol derivative"},{"word":"dankasterone A"},{"word":"dihydrochromone dimer"},{"word":"marine sponge-associated fungi"},{"word":"paecilin E"}]},"article218":{"pmid":"29194382","title":"Liposomal and Deoxycholate Amphotericin B Formulations: Effectiveness against Biofilm Infections of Candida spp.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"candidiasis is the primary fungal infection encountered in patients undergoing prolonged hospitalization, and the fourth leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections.

Comparing F. nucleatum-infected and uninfected GF(P4) cells the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in host defense mechanisms (i.e., immune responses and defense responses), whereas comparing F. nucleatum-infected and uninfected GF(P22) cells the DEGs were involved in cell maintenance (i.e., TGF-β signaling, skeletal development).

However, when treated correctly, chances of recovery are good. The most important step in correct diagnosis and management of PJI is the detection of the causative germ. In the last years, the use of sonication in the diagnostic process has become more important. However, this diagnostic methodology has been controversially discussed when used in combination with antibiotic loaded bone cement (PMMA), which is frequently used in joint replacement surgeries. The aim of this study was thus to analyse in vitro bacterial growth in sonication fluid cultures obtained from antibiotic loaded PMMA which were contaminated with various bacterial biofilms. Sonication fluid obtained from antibiotic loaded PMMA (Copal G+V and Copal G+C) and plain Palacos R (control) contaminated either with S. aureus, E. faecalis, S. sanguinis or P.acnes, were analysed for bacterial re-growth in a standardised in-vitro setting. In vitro bacterial growth was not interfered by released antibiotics from sonication of antibiotic loaded PMMA for S. aureus, E. faecalis and S. sanguinis. However, for P. acnes bacterial counts were affected by the released antibiotics as well as by the time delay between sonication and analysis. The in-vitro data suggest sonication to be an easy and sensitive diagnostic modality to detect easy-to-detect bacteria, however, results are alarming for the difficult-to-detect bacteria P. acnes, indicating that further attention and research is necessary to improve the detection of difficult-to-detect bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Martin Clauss"},{"name":"Esther Laschkolnig"},{"name":"Susanne Graf"},{"name":"Klaus-Dieter Kühn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Periprosthetic joint infection"},{"word":"bone cement"},{"word":"in vitro"},{"word":"sonication"}]},"article236":{"pmid":"29187848","title":"Kaempferol Inhibits the Primary Attachment Phase of Biofilm Formation in Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The ability to form biofilms on surfaces makes Staphylococcus aureus the main pathogenic factor in implanted medical device infections.

In many of the known yeast cell adhesion proteins, there are amino acid sequences predicted to form amyloid-like β-aggregates. These sequences mediate amyloid formation in vitro. In vivo, these sequences mediate a phase transition from a disordered state to a partially ordered state to create patches of adhesins on the cell surface. These β-aggregated protein patches are called adhesin nanodomains, and their presence greatly increases and strengthens cell-cell interactions in fungal cell aggregation. Nanodomain formation is slow (with molecular response in minutes and the consequences being evident for hours), and strong interactions lead to enhanced biofilm formation. Unique among functional amyloids, fungal adhesin β-aggregation can be triggered by the application of physical shear force, leading to cellular responses to flow-induced stress and the formation of robust biofilms that persist under flow. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that this phenomenon may be widespread. Analysis of fungal abscesses shows the presence of surface amyloids in situ, a finding which supports the idea that phase changes to an amyloid-like state occur in vivo. The amyloid-coated fungi bind the damage-associated molecular pattern receptor serum amyloid P component, and there may be a consequential modulation of innate immune responses to the fungi. Structural data now suggest mechanisms for the force-mediated induction of the phase change. We summarize and discuss evidence that the sequences function as triggers for protein aggregation and subsequent cellular aggregation, both in vitro and in vivo.","authors":[{"name":"Peter N Lipke"},{"name":"Stephen A Klotz"},{"name":"Yves F Dufrene"},{"name":"Desmond N Jackson"},{"name":"Melissa C Garcia-Sherman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae"},{"word":"adhesins"},{"word":"amyloids"},{"word":"avidity"},{"word":"beta aggregation"},{"word":"catch bonding"},{"word":"mannoproteins"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"29187066","title":"Pilot-scale sorption studies of diethylketone in the presence of Cd","date":"2019-09-09","abs":"The effect of pH on the sorption capacity of vermiculite towards cadmium and nickel was tested in batch systems and it was shown that the sorption percentages increase with an increase in the mass of vermiculite and with an increase in the initial pH.

In this study, the biofilm formation, morphotype, and motility of 13 Salmonella strains belonging to three different subspecies and isolated from poultry houses was evaluated. To simulate food chain conditions, four different growth media (Tryptic Soy Broth at 1/20 dilution, milk at 1/20 dilution, tomato juice, and chicken meat juice), two different surfaces (stainless steel and polystyrene) and two temperatures (6 °C and 22 °C) were used to evaluate the biofilm formation. The morphotype, motility, and biofilm formation of Salmonella was temperature-dependent. Biofilm formation was significantly higher with 1/20 Tryptic Soy Broth in all the surfaces and temperatures tested, in comparison with the other growth media. The laboratory growth medium 1/20 Tryptic Soy Broth enhanced biofilm formation in Salmonella. This could explain the great differences in biofilm formation found between this growth medium and food residues. However, Salmonella strains were able to produce biofilm on the presence of food residues in all the conditions tested. Therefore, the Salmonella strain can use food residues to produce biofilm on common surfaces of the food chain.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria further intensifies the clinical predicament as it directly impacts public health due to diminished potency of current antibiotics. In addition, there is an escalating concern with respect to biofilm-associated infections that are refractory to the presently available antimicrobial armory, leaving almost no therapeutic option.

The past decade has witnessed a substantial upsurge in the global use of nanomedicines as innovative tools for combating the high rates of antimicrobial resistance. Antibacterial activity of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) has been extensively reported. The microbes are eliminated either by microbicidal effects of the NPs, such as release of free metal ions culminating in cell membrane damage, DNA interactions or free radical generation, or by microbiostatic effects coupled with killing potentiated by the host's immune system. This review encompasses the magnitude of multidrug resistance in nosocomial infections, bacterial evasion of the host immune system, mechanisms used by bacteria to develop drug resistance and the use of nanomaterials based on metals to overcome these challenges.

The use of polymer-based nanomaterials and nanocomposites, alone or functionalized with ligands, antibodies or antibiotics, as alternative antimicrobial agents for treating severe bacterial infections is also discussed.

ATP values were reduced under both types of limitation, yet more severely in the absence of oxygen. Using transposon-insertion sequencing (Tn-seq), we identified fitness determinants in these two energy-limited states. Multiple genes encoding general functions like transcriptional regulation and energy generation were required for fitness during carbon or oxygen limitation, yet many specific genes, and thus specific activities, differed in their relevance between these states. For instance, the global regulator RpoS was required during both types of energy limitation, while other global regulators such as DksA and LasR were required only during carbon or oxygen limitation, respectively. Similarly, certain ribosomal and tRNA modifications were specifically required during oxygen limitation. We validated fitness defects during energy limitation using independently generated mutants of genes detected in our screen.

The torque is provided by stator units, ion motive force-powered ion channels known to assemble and disassemble dynamically in the BFM. This turnover is mechanosensitive, with the number of engaged units dependent on the viscous load experienced by the motor through the flagellum. However, the molecular mechanism driving BFM mechanosensitivity is unknown. Here, we directly measure the kinetics of arrival and departure of the stator units in individual motors via analysis of high-resolution recordings of motor speed, while dynamically varying the load on the motor via external magnetic torque. The kinetic rates obtained, robust with respect to the details of the applied adsorption model, indicate that the lifetime of an assembled stator unit increases when a higher force is applied to its anchoring point in the cell wall. This provides strong evidence that a catch bond (a bond strengthened instead of weakened by force) drives mechanosensitivity of the flagellar motor complex. These results add the BFM to a short, but growing, list of systems demonstrating catch bonds, suggesting that this molecular strategy is a widespread mechanism to sense and respond to mechanical stress. We propose that force-enhanced stator adhesion allows the cell to adapt to a heterogeneous environmental viscosity and may ultimately play a role in surface-sensing during swarming and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Ashley L Nord"},{"name":"Emilie Gachon"},{"name":"Ruben Perez-Carrasco"},{"name":"Jasmine A Nirody"},{"name":"Alessandro Barducci"},{"name":"Richard M Berry"},{"name":"Francesco Pedaci"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"bacterial flagellar motor"},{"word":"catch bond"},{"word":"mechanosensitivity"},{"word":"molecular motor"}]},"article256":{"pmid":"29183674","title":"Effects of different sterilization methods on surface characteristics and biofilm formation on zirconia in vitro.","date":"2019-02-01","abs":"The current laboratory study was to investigate the effect of different sterilization treatments on surface characteristics of zirconia, and biofilm formation on zirconia surface after exposure to these sterilization treatments.","authors":[{"name":"Aifang Han"},{"name":"James K H Tsoi"},{"name":"Jukka P Matinlinna"},{"name":"Yu Zhang"},{"name":"Zhuofan Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Colour"},{"word":"Gamma ray"},{"word":"Sterilization methods"},{"word":"UV"},{"word":"Zirconia"}]},"article257":{"pmid":"31294198","title":"Impact of chlorhexidine digluconate and temperature on curli production in Escherichia coli-consequence on its adhesion ability.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Chlorhexidine-Digluconate (CHX-Dg) is a biocide widely used as disinfectant or antiseptic in clinical and domestic fields.

These events can also produce persistent effects in the environment for several years after the eruption, with increased concentrations of suspended particles and the introduction of elements in the water column. On 4th June 2011, the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle Volcanic Complex (40.59°S-72.11°W, 2200m.a.s.l.) erupted explosively in southern Chile. The area affected by the volcano was devastated; a thick layer of volcanic ash (up to 30cm) was deposited in areas 50 km east of the volcano towards Argentina. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of volcanic ash deposits on stream ecosystems four years after the eruption, comparing biofilm stoichiometry, alkaline phosphatase activity, and primary producer's assemblage in streams which were severely affected by the volcano with unaffected streams. We confirmed in the laboratory that ash deposited in the catchment of affected streams still leach phosphorus (P) into the water four years after eruption. Results indicate that affected streams still receive volcanic particles and that these particles release P, thus stream water exhibits high P concentration. Biofilm P content was higher and the C:P ratio lower in affected streams compared to unaffected streams. As a consequence of less P in unaffected streams, the alkaline phosphatase activity was higher compared to affected streams. Cyanobacteria increased their abundances (99.9% of total algal biovolume) in the affected streams suggesting that the increase in P may positively affect this group. On the contrary, unaffected streams contained a diatom dominant biofilm. In this way, local heterogeneity was created between sub-catchments located within 30 km of each other. These types of events should be seen as opportunities to gather valuable ecological information about how severe disturbances, like volcanic eruptions, shape landscapes and lotic systems for several years after the event.","authors":[{"name":"Uara Carrillo"},{"name":"Verónica Díaz-Villanueva"},{"name":"Beatriz Modenutti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cyanobacteria"},{"word":"Disturbance"},{"word":"Nutrient ratios"},{"word":"P-limitation"},{"word":"Volcanic eruptions"}]},"article259":{"pmid":"29182855","title":"Bacterial Adhesion to Ultrafiltration Membranes: Role of Hydrophilicity, Natural Organic Matter, and Cell-Surface Macromolecules.","date":"2019-09-17","abs":"Insight into the mechanisms underlying bacterial adhesion is critical to the formulation of membrane biofouling control strategies.

We show that hydrophilic polydopamine (PDA) coatings decrease bacterial adhesion forces at short bacterium-membrane contact times. Further, we find that adhesion forces are weakened by the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) conditioning films, owing to the hydrophilicity of NOM. Investigation of the effect of adhesion contact time revealed that PDA coatings are less effective at preventing bioadhesion when the contact time is prolonged to 2-5 s, or when the membranes are exposed to bacterial suspensions under stirring. These results therefore challenge the notion that simple hydrophilic surface coatings are effective as a biofouling control strategy. Finally, we present evidence that adhesion to the UF membrane surface is mediated by cell-surface macromolecules (likely to be outer membrane proteins and pili) which, upon contacting the membrane, undergo surface-induced unfolding.","authors":[{"name":"Sara BinAhmed"},{"name":"Anissa Hasane"},{"name":"Zhaoxing Wang"},{"name":"Aslan Mansurov"},{"name":"Santiago Romero-Vargas Castrillón"}],"keywords":[]},"article260":{"pmid":"29182575","title":"Modification of Bacterial Cellulose Biofilms with Xylan Polyelectrolytes.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The effect of the addition of two [4-butyltrimethylammonium]-xylan chloride polyelectrolytes (BTMAXs) on bacterial cellulose (BC) was evaluated.

The mortality rate of 30% points to the pressing need for new antifungal drugs. The present study aimed at analyzing the inhibitory activity of the N-terminal lactoferrin-derived peptide, further referred to as hLF 1-11, against biofilms produced by clinical isolates of C. parapsilosis characterized for their biofilm forming ability and fluconazole susceptibility. hLF 1-11 anti-biofilm activity was assessed in terms of reduction of biofilm biomass, metabolic activity, and observation of sessile cell morphology on polystyrene microtiter plates and using an in vitro model of catheter-associated C. parapsilosis biofilm production. Moreover, fluctuation in transcription levels of genes related to cell adhesion, hyphal development and extracellular matrix production upon peptide exposure were evaluated by quantitative real time RT-PCR. The results revealed that hLF 1-11 exhibits an inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by all the C. parapsilosis isolates tested, in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of their fluconazole susceptibility. In addition, hLF 1-11 induced a statistically significant dose-dependent reduction of preformed-biofilm cellular density and metabolic activity at high peptide concentrations only. Interestingly, when assessed in a catheter lumen, hLF 1-11 was able to induce a 2-log reduction of sessile cell viability at both the peptide concentrations used in RPMI diluted in NaPB. A more pronounced anti-biofilm effect was observed (3.5-log reduction) when a 10% glucose solution was used as experimental condition on both early and preformed C. parapsilosis biofilm. Quantitative real time RT-PCR experiments confirmed that hLF 1-11 down-regulates key biofilm related genes. The overall findings suggest hLF 1-11 as a promising candidate for the prevention of C. parapsilosis biofilm formation and to treatment of mature catheter-related C. parapsilosis biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Roberta Fais"},{"name":"Mariagrazia Di Luca"},{"name":"Cosmeri Rizzato"},{"name":"Paola Morici"},{"name":"Daria Bottai"},{"name":"Arianna Tavanti"},{"name":"Antonella Lupetti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida parapsilosis"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"catheter-related infection"},{"word":"hLF 1-11"}]},"article267":{"pmid":"29180790","title":"Vanillic acid from Actinidia deliciosa impedes virulence in Serratia marcescens by affecting S-layer, flagellin and fatty acid biosynthesis proteins.","date":"2019-07-12","abs":"Serratia marcescens is one of the important nosocomial pathogens which rely on quorum sensing (QS) to regulate the production of biofilm and several virulence factors.

In such media, bacteria are observed to move efficiently only if they can get out of dead ends by changing drastically their swimming direction, and even to completely reverse it. Even though these reorientations are ubiquitous, we have only recently begun to describe and understand how they happen. In the present work, we visualized the flagella of bacteria swimming in a soft agar solution. The surprising observation that the filaments do not rotate while being flipped from one side of the cell to the other suggests that reversals are driven directly by the motor rather than by the thrust created by the rotating filament. This was confirmed by observing bacteria in a liquid crystal, where the linear movement of bacteria greatly simplifies the analysis. These observations suggest that the reversal and reorientation processes involve a temporary locking of the flagellum's hook, which is the normally flexible joint between the rotary motor and the long helical filament that propels the cell. This newly described locked-hook mode occurs only when the motor switches to a clockwise rotation. That correlates with other phenomena that are triggered by a switch in one direction and not the other.","authors":[{"name":"Ismaël Duchesne"},{"name":"Tigran Galstian"},{"name":"Simon Rainville"}],"keywords":[]},"article270":{"pmid":"29180529","title":"The ABC of Biofilm Drug Tolerance: the MerR-Like Regulator BrlR Is an Activator of ABC Transport Systems, with PA1874-77 Contributing to the Tolerance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms to Tobramycin.","date":"2019-04-17","abs":"A hallmark of biofilms is their tolerance to killing by antimicrobial agents. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, biofilm drug tolerance requires the c-di-GMP-responsive MerR transcriptional regulator BrlR. However, the mechanism by which BrlR mediates biofilm drug tolerance has not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that BrlR activates the expression of at least 7 ABC transport systems, including the PA1874-PA1875-PA1876-PA1877 (PA1874-77) operon, with chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA binding assays confirming BrlR binding to the promoter region of PA1874-77. Insertional inactivation of the 7 ABC transport systems rendered P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms susceptible to tobramycin or norfloxacin. Susceptibility was linked to drug accumulation, with BrlR contributing to norfloxacin accumulation in a manner dependent on multidrug efflux pumps and the PA1874-77 ABC transport system. Inactivation of the respective ABC transport system, furthermore, eliminated the recalcitrance of biofilms to killing by tobramycin but not norfloxacin, indicating that drug accumulation is not linked to biofilm drug tolerance. Our findings indicate for the first time that BrlR, a MerR-type transcriptional activator, activates genes encoding several ABC transport systems, in addition to multiple multidrug efflux pump genes.

Wounds were evaluated histopathologically 4, 7 or 10 days post-infection. Photoplanimetry evaluated necrotic areas. P. aeruginosa biofilm suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor levels centrally in BALB/c wounds but increased peripheral levels 4-7 days post-infection. Central zones of the burn wound displayed lower levels of central vascular endothelial growth factor as observed 4 and 7 days post-infection in BALB/c mice compared to their C3H/HeN counterparts. Biofilm suppressed early, centrally located S100A8/A9 in BALB/c and centrally and peripherally later on in C3H/HeN wounds as compared to uninfected mice. Peripheral polymorphonuclear-dominated inflammation and larger necrosis were observed in BALB/c wounds.

Meloxicam could also significantly inhibit the motilities, production of extracellular matrix, and expression of quorum sensing-related genes and virulence factors of PAO1. Furthermore, synergistic interaction was observed when meloxicam combined with tetracycline, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ceftazidime, and DNase at subminimal inhibitory concentrations against PAO1 bioiflm.

The 3D structure of IGPD protein is essential for discovering novel inhibitors during high-throughput virtual screening. However, to date, the 3D structure of IGPD protein of S. xylosus has not been solved. In this study, a series of computational techniques including homology modeling, Ramachandran Plots, and Verify 3D were performed in order to construct an appropriate 3D model of IGPD protein of S. xylosus. Nine hits were identified from 2,500 compounds by docking studies. Then, these nine compounds were first tested in vitro in S. xylosus biofilm formation using crystal violet staining. One of the potential compounds, baicalin was shown to significantly inhibit S. xylosus biofilm formation. Finally, the baicalin was further evaluated, which showed better inhibition of biofilm formation capability in S. xylosus by scanning electron microscopy. Hence, we have predicted the structure of IGPD protein of S. xylosus using computational techniques. We further discovered the IGPD protein was targeted by baicalin compound which inhibited the biofilm formation in S. xylosus.

The study of modern microbial mat structures can help inform the properties of their ancient counterparts, but modern mineralizing mat systems with morphological similarity to ancient structures are rare. Here, we characterize partially lithified microbial mats containing cm-scale dendrolitic coniform structures from a geothermal pool (Cone Pool) at Little Hot Creek, California, that if fully lithified, would resemble ancient dendrolitic structures known from the rock record. Light and electron microscopy revealed that the cm-scale 'dendrolitic cones' were comprised of intertwined microbial filaments and grains of calcium carbonate. The degree of mineralization (carbonate content) increased with depth in the dendrolitic cones. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed that the dendrolitic cone tips were enriched in OTUs most closely related to the genera Phormidium, Leptolyngbya, and Leptospira, whereas mats at the base and adjacent to the dendrolitic cones were enriched in Synechococcus. We hypothesize that the consumption of nutrients during autotrophic and heterotrophic growth may promote movement of microbes along diffusive nutrient gradients, and thus microbialite growth. Hour-glass shaped filamentous structures present in the dendrolitic cones may have formed around photosynthetically-produced oxygen bubbles-suggesting that mineralization occurs rapidly and on timescales of the lifetime of a bubble. The dendrolitic-conical structures in Cone Pool constitute a modern analog of incipient microbialite formation by filamentous microbiota that are morphologically distinct from any structure described previously. Thus, we provide a new model system to address how microbial mats may be preserved over geological timescales.","authors":[{"name":"James A Bradley"},{"name":"Leslie K Daille"},{"name":"Christopher B Trivedi"},{"name":"Caitlin L Bojanowski"},{"name":"Blake W Stamps"},{"name":"Bradley S Stevenson"},{"name":"Heather S Nunn"},{"name":"Hope A Johnson"},{"name":"Sean J Loyd"},{"name":"William M Berelson"},{"name":"Frank A Corsetti"},{"name":"John R Spear"}],"keywords":[]},"article299":{"pmid":"29176754","title":"The O-specific polysaccharide lyase from the phage LKA1 tailspike reduces Pseudomonas virulence.","date":"2019-07-08","abs":"Pseudomonas phage LKA1 of the subfamily Autographivirinae encodes a tailspike protein (LKA1gp49) which binds and cleaves B-band LPS (O-specific antigen, OSA) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.

Biofilms and biofilm supernatants of Granulicatella elegans CCUG 38949, Granulicatella adiacens CCUG 27809 and Abiotrophia defectiva CCUG 27639 were used to stimulate PBMCs for 24 h. Cytokines produced were first screened using a human cytokine membrane array kit. Further, pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-β, and IL-17 were quantified by ELISA. The cytokine profiler array showed the induction of 15 different cytokines/chemokines including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, MCP-1, MIP-1α/MIP-1β and RANTES. ELISA quantification revealed that G. adiacens biofilm induced significantly higher (P < 0.05) levels of IL-1β, i.e., 1931 (183) pg/ml than G. elegans or A. defectiva. However, in the case of biofilm supernatants A. defectiva was the strongest, inducing 2104 (574) pg/ml. Biofilm supernatants, but not biofilms from all three species induced TNF-α only weakly. IL-17 was undetectable from any of the stimulated samples. In conclusion, Granulicatella and Abiotrophia are potent inducers of inflammatory mediators from human PBMCs.

Despite latitudinal declines of inorganic mercury exposure, MMHg bioaccumulation in aquatic invertebrates did not concomitantly decline. Arctic lakes with greater MMHg in aquatic invertebrates either had (1) higher water MMHg concentrations (reflecting ecosystem MMHg production) or (2) low water concentrations of MMHg, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll, and total nitrogen (reflecting lake sensitivity). The MMHg:DOC ratio of surface water was a strong predictor of lake sensitivity to mercury contamination. Bioaccumulation factors for biofilms and seston in Arctic lakes showed more efficient uptake of MMHg in low DOC systems.

Normally, a part of the host chromatin, SUV39H1, was also found to be associated with the mycobacterial bacilli during infection. Its binding to bacilli was accompanied by trimethylation of the mycobacterial histone-like protein, HupB, which in turn reduced the cell adhesion capability of the bacilli. Importantly, SUV39H1-mediated methylation of HupB reduced the mycobacterial survival inside the host cell. This was also true in mice infection experiments. In addition, the ability of mycobacteria to form biofilms, a survival strategy of the bacteria dependent upon cell-cell adhesion, was dramatically reduced in the presence of SUV39H1.

Excellent bactericidal activity was shown by the Ul-ZnO Nps on Gram positive (Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus pumilis) and Gram negative (Escherichia coliand Proteus vulgaris) bacteria. High antibiofilm potential was noted under both dark and sunlight conditions.

Inhibiting such factors generally results in reduced fungal pathogenicity. Most studies in the past have focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of fungal virulence factor expression during mono-culture, or during interaction with the host. However, a potentially important, second type of interaction has been less well studied thus far - the interplay of fungal pathogens of humans with other microbes found in their natural habitat. Specifically, whether environmental bacteria may impact fungal virulence factor production is largely unknown. In our recent work, we have identified the soil bacterium, Bacillus safensis, as a potent inhibitor of virulence factor production by two major fungal pathogens of humans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans. We determined that the anti-virulence factor mechanism is, at least in part, based on production of bacterial chitinases that target and destabilize the fungal cell surface. These findings describe a cross-kingdom interaction between an environmental bacterium and pathogenic fungi, and highlight the fungal cell wall as an attractive antifungal drug target.","authors":[{"name":"François L Mayer"},{"name":"James W Kronstad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"capsule"},{"word":"chitin"},{"word":"chitinase"},{"word":"filamentation"},{"word":"melanin"}]},"article333":{"pmid":"29167572","title":"Anti-Psl Targeting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms for Neutrophil-Mediated Disruption.","date":"2019-07-03","abs":"Bacterial biofilms are recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy and a major cause of persistent and recurrent infections. New antibody-based therapies may offer potential to target biofilm specific components for host-cell mediated bacterial clearance. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the Psl biofilm exopolysaccharide exhibit protective activity against planktonic bacteria in acute infection models. However, anti-Psl mAb activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that anti-Psl mAbs targeting three distinct Psl epitopes exhibit stratified binding in mature in vitro biofilms and bind Psl within the context of a chronic biofilm infection. These mAbs also exhibit differential abilities to inhibit early biofilm events and reduce biomass from mature biofilms in the presence of neutrophils. Importantly, a mAb mixture with neutrophils exhibited the greatest biomass reduction, which was further enhanced when combined with meropenem, a common anti-Pseudomonal carbapenem antibiotic. Moreover, neutrophil-mediated killing of biofilm bacteria correlated with the evident mAb epitope stratification within the biofilm. Overall, our results suggest that anti-Psl mAbs might be promising candidates for adjunctive use with antibiotics to inhibit/disrupt P. aeruginosa biofilms as a result of chronic infection.","authors":[{"name":"Valerie A Ray"},{"name":"Preston J Hill"},{"name":"C Kendall Stover"},{"name":"Sashwati Roy"},{"name":"Chandan K Sen"},{"name":"Li Yu"},{"name":"Daniel J Wozniak"},{"name":"Antonio DiGiandomenico"}],"keywords":[]},"article334":{"pmid":"29167293","title":"Perioperative Antibiotic Prophylaxis Has No Effect on Time to Positivity and Proportion of Positive Samples: a Cohort Study of 64 Cutibacterium acnes Bone and Joint Infections.","date":"2019-05-24","abs":"If a bone or joint infection is suspected, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is frequently withheld until intraoperative microbiological sampling has been performed.

Chronic wounds are described as not progressing to healing or not being responsive to management in a timely manner. A consensus panel of multidisciplinary wound care professionals was assembled to (1) educate wound care practitioners by identifying key principles of the basic science of chronic wound pathophysiology, highlighting the impact of metalloproteinases and biofilms, as well as the role of the extracellular matrix; and (2) equip practitioners with a systematic strategy for the prevention and healing of acute injuries and chronic wounds based upon scientific evidence and the panel members' expertise. An algorithm is presented that represents a shift in strategy to proactive and early aggressive wound management. With proactive management, adjunct therapies are applied preemptively to acute injuries to reduce wound duration and risk of chronicity. For existing chronic wounds, early aggressive wound management is employed to break the pathophysiology cycle and drive wounds toward healing. Reducing bioburden through debridement and bioburden management and using collagen dressings to balance protease activity prior to the use of advanced modalities may enhance their effectiveness. This early aggressive wound management strategy is recommended for patients at high risk for chronic wound development at a minimum.

Introduction of whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines in the 1940s and acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines in 1990s reduced the mortality due to pertussis. Despite induction of both antibody and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses by aP and wP vaccines, there has been resurgence of pertussis in many countries in recent years. Possible reasons hypothesised for resurgence have ranged from incompliance with the recommended vaccination programmes with the currently used aP vaccine to infection with a resurged clinical isolates characterised by mutations in the virulence factors, resulting in antigenic divergence with vaccine strain, and increased production of pertussis toxin, resulting in dampening of immune responses. While use of these vaccines provide varying degrees of protection against whooping cough, protection against infection and transmission appears to be less effective, warranting continuation of efforts in the development of an improved pertussis vaccine formulations capable of achieving this objective. Major approaches currently under evaluation for the development of an improved pertussis vaccine include identification of novel biofilm-associated antigens for incorporation in current aP vaccine formulations, development of live attenuated vaccines and discovery of novel non-toxic adjuvants capable of inducing both antibody and CMI.

Differences in growth behavior and aggregation in the presence of high salt were observed, but these phenomena did not negatively influence the expression in the quadruple mutant strain when handled as we recommend.

Salmonella can grow on surfaces forming biofilms, contributing to its persistence since biofilms are difficult to eradicate due to the high resistance to antimicrobials and disinfectants. It has been described that there are two crucial biofilm promoting factors in Salmonella: curli and cellulose. The expression of both factors is coordinately regulated by the transcriptional regulator CsgD. Most biofilm studies of Salmonella have been performed by growing bacteria in low osmolarity rich medium and low temperature (25°C). In such conditions, the biofilm is formed at the air-liquid interface (pellicle biofilm). Remarkably, when Salmonella grow in minimal medium, biofilm formation switches from the air-liquid interface to the solid-liquid interface (bottom biofilm). In this report, the switching between pellicle and bottom biofilm has been characterized. Our data indicate that curli, but not cellulose, is crucial for the formation of both kinds of biofilms. In minimal medium, conditions promoting formation of bottom biofilm, a high transcriptional expression of csgD and consequently of the genes involved in the synthesis of curli and cellulose was detected. The nutritional status of the cells seems to be pivotal for the spatial distribution of the biofilms formed. When bacteria is growing in minimal medium the addition of amino acids downregulates the expression of csgB and causes the switch between bottom and pellicle biofilm. The crosstalk between general metabolism and biofilm formation is also highlighted by the fact that the metabolic sensor cAMP modulates the type of biofilm generated by Salmonella. Moreover, cAMP regulates transcriptional expression of csgD and stimulates pellicle biofilm formation, suggesting that the physiological conditions define the type of biofilm formed by Salmonella. The consequences of the switching between pellicle and bottom biofilm during either infection or survival in natural environments remain undercover.","authors":[{"name":"Sonia Paytubi"},{"name":"Cintia Cansado"},{"name":"Cristina Madrid"},{"name":"Carlos Balsalobre"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella"},{"word":"adenylate cyclase"},{"word":"amino acids"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cellulose"},{"word":"curli"},{"word":"nutrient composition studies"}]},"article354":{"pmid":"29163415","title":"Combination Susceptibility Testing of Common Antimicrobials in Vitro and the Effects of Sub-MIC of Antimicrobials on Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The current study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial combination efficacies, and whether the sub-inhibitory concentrations (sub-MIC) of antibiotics can influent on the biofilm formation of S. aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of common antibacterial drugs was determined in vitro against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) alone and in combination with each other by using the broth microdilution method and the checkerboard micro-dilution method analyzed with the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), respectively. Regarding these results, antibacterial drug combinations were categorized as synergistic, interacting, antagonistic and indifferent, and most of the results were consistent with the previous reports. Additionally, the effects of sub-MIC of seven antimicrobials (kanamycin, acetylisovaleryltylosin tartrate, enrofloxacin, lincomycin, colistin sulfate, berberine, and clarithromycin) on S. aureus biofilm formation were determined via crystal violet staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and real-time PCR. Our results demonstrate that all antibiotics, except acetylisovaleryltylosin tartrate, effectively reduced the S. aureus biofilm formation. In addition, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to analyze the relative expression levels of S. aureus biofilm-related genes such as sarA, fnbA, rbf, lrgA, cidA, and eno after the treatment at sub-MIC with all of the six antimicrobials. All antibiotics significantly inhibited the expression of these biofilm-related genes except for acetylisovaleryltylosin tartrate, which efficiently up-regulated these transcripts.

The benefits that bacteria can gain from living in a biofilm, i.e., protection from environmental factors and tolerance to biocides, have been linked to the biofilm structure. Different L. monocytogenes strains build biofilms with diverse structures, and the underlying mechanisms for that diversity are not yet fully known. This work combines quantitative image analysis, cell counts, nutrient uptake data and mathematical modeling to provide a mechanistic insight into the dynamics of the structure of biofilms formed by L. monocytogenes L1A1 (serotype 1/2a) strain. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and quantitative image analysis were used to characterize the structure of L1A1 biofilms throughout time. L1A1 forms flat, thick structures; damaged or dead cells start appearing early in deep layers of the biofilm and rapidly and massively loss biomass after 4 days. We proposed several reaction-diffusion models to explain the system dynamics. Model candidates describe biomass and nutrients evolution including mechanisms of growth and cell spreading, nutrients diffusion and uptake and biofilm decay. Data fitting was used to estimate unknown model parameters and to choose the most appropriate candidate model. Remarkably, standard reaction-diffusion models could not describe the biofilm dynamics.

Here we used an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence that represents over 100 years of soil development to assess how the functional traits of plant associated bacteria respond to soil type, plant species and plant compartment. We isolated and characterized 808 bacterial colonies from the rhizosphere soil and root endosphere of two salt marsh plants, Limonium vulgare and Artemisia maritima, along the chronosequence. From these, a set of 59 strains (with unique BOX-PCR patterns, 16S rRNA sequence and unique to one of the treatments) were further screened for their plant growth promoting traits (siderophore production, IAA production, exoprotease production and biofilm formation), traits associated with bacterial fitness (antibiotic and abiotic stress resistance - pH, osmotic and oxidative stress, and salinity) and metabolic potential. An overall view of functional diversity (multivariate analysis) indicated that the distributional pattern of bacterial functional traits was driven by soil type. Samples from the late succession (Stage 105 year) showed the most restricted distribution, harboring strains with relatively low functionalities, whereas the isolates from intermediate stage (35 year) showed a broad functional profiles. However, strains with high trait performance were largely from stage 65 year. Grouping the traits according to category revealed that the functionality of plant endophytes did not vary along the succession, thus being driven by plant rather than soil type. In opposition, the functionality of rhizosphere isolates responded strongly to variations in soil type as observed for antibiotic resistance (P = 0.014). Specifically, certain Pseudomonas sp. and Serratia sp. strains revealed high resistance against abiotic stress and antibiotics and produce more siderophores, confirming the high plant-growth promoting activity of these two genera. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the functional diversity and adaptation of the microbiome at typical salt marsh plant species across soil types. Specifically, soil type was influential only in the rhizosphere but not on the endosphere, indicating a strong plant-driven effect on the functionality of endophytes.","authors":[{"name":"Miao Wang"},{"name":"Erqin Li"},{"name":"Chen Liu"},{"name":"Alexandre Jousset"},{"name":"Joana F Salles"}],"keywords":[{"word":"functionality"},{"word":"plant selective force"},{"word":"plant-associated bacteria"},{"word":"salt marsh chronosequence"},{"word":"soil type"}]},"article357":{"pmid":"29163396","title":"Synergistic Antifungal Effect of Fluconazole Combined with Licofelone against Resistant Candida albicans.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Candida albicans (C. albicans) is one of the important opportunistic fungal pathogens that is closely associated with disseminated or chronic infections.

GFP-labeled B. subtilis cells were cultured on agar surfaces over a 4-day period during which microscopic images of developing colonies were taken at equal time intervals. The images were used to perform a computerized analysis of few aspects of biofilm development, based on features that characterize the different phenotypes of B. subtilis colonies. Specifically, the analysis focused on the segmented structure of the colonies, consisting of two different regions of sub-populations that comprise the biofilm - a central core region and an expanding region surrounding it. Our results demonstrate that complex biofilm of B. subtillis grown on biofilm-promoting medium [standard lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with manganese and glycerol] is characterized by rapidly developing three-dimensional complex structure observed at its core compared to biofilm grown on standard LB. As the biofilm develops, the core size remains largely unchanged during development and colony expansion is mostly attributed to the expansion in area of outer cell sub-populations. Moreover, when comparing the bacterial growth on biofilm-promoting agar to that of colonies grown on LB, we found a significant decrease in the GFP production of colonies that formed a more complex biofilm. This suggests that complex biofilm formation has a diminishing effect on cell populations at the biofilm core, likely due to a combination of reduced metabolic rate and increased levels of cell death within this region.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah Gingichashvili"},{"name":"Danielle Duanis-Assaf"},{"name":"Moshe Shemesh"},{"name":"John D B Featherstone"},{"name":"Osnat Feuerstein"},{"name":"Doron Steinberg"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"colony morphology"},{"word":"computer-assisted"},{"word":"growth kinetics"},{"word":"image processing"}]},"article360":{"pmid":"29163381","title":"Functional Characterization of Acinetobacter baumannii Lacking the RNA Chaperone Hfq.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The RNA chaperone Hfq is involved in the riboregulation of diverse genes via small RNAs.

In the absence of hfq, A. baumannii exhibited retarded cell growth and was highly sensitive to environmental stress, including osmotic and oxidative pressure, pH, and temperature.

The absence of hfq reduced biofilm formation, airway epithelial cell adhesion and invasion, and survival in macrophage. Further, the hfq mutant induced significantly higher IL-8 levels in airway epithelial cells, which would promote bacterial clearance by the host.

As the CNT loading in the CNT/PCL nanocomposites increased, the microbial proliferation of planktonic cells in the surrounding media also decreased as did the biodegradation rate of PCL samples present in the same reactors. Results from this study demonstrate that the inclusion of CNTs into polymer matrices could increase the environmental persistence of polymers in lakes, landfills, and surface waters.","authors":[{"name":"David G Goodwin"},{"name":"Iruhany Boyer"},{"name":"Thomas Devahif"},{"name":"Cong Gao"},{"name":"Benjamin P Frank"},{"name":"Xier Lu"},{"name":"Leo Kuwama"},{"name":"Tucker B Gordon"},{"name":"JingJing Wang"},{"name":"James F Ranville"},{"name":"Edward J Bouwer"},{"name":"D Howard Fairbrother"}],"keywords":[]},"article370":{"pmid":"29160896","title":"Influence of fracture stability on Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus infection in a murine femoral fracture model.","date":"2019-01-16","abs":"Fracture-related infection (FRI) is a major complication in surgically fixed fractures. Instability of the fracture after fixation is considered a risk factor for infection; however, few experimental data are available confirming this belief. To study whether stable fractures led to higher infection clearance, mouse femoral osteotomies were fixed with either stable or unstable fixation and the surgical site was contaminated with either Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis)or Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)clinical isolates. Infection progression was assessed at different time points by quantitative bacteriology, total cell counts in spleen and lymph node and histological analysis. Operated, non-inoculated mice were used as controls. Two inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) were included in the study to determine the influence of different host background in the outcome. Stable fixation allowed a higher proportion of C57BL/6 mice to clear S. epidermidis inoculation in comparison to unstable fixation. No difference associated with fixation type was observed for BALB/c mice. Inoculation with S. aureus resulted in a more severe infection for both stable and unstable fractures in both mouse strains; however, significant osteolysis around the screws rendered the stable group functionally unstable. Our results suggested that fracture stability could have an influence on S. epidermidis infection, although host factors also played a role. No differences were observed when using S. aureus, due to a more severe infection, leading to osteolysis and loss of stability in both groups. Further studies are required in order to address the biological features underlying the differences observed.","authors":[{"name":"M Sabaté Brescó"},{"name":"L O'Mahony"},{"name":"S Zeiter"},{"name":"K Kluge"},{"name":"M Ziegler"},{"name":"C Berset"},{"name":"D Nehrbass"},{"name":"R G Richards"},{"name":"T F Moriarty"}],"keywords":[]},"article371":{"pmid":"29160874","title":"Biofilm dispersal using nitric oxide loaded nanoparticles fabricated by photo-PISA: influence of morphology.","date":"2018-03-05","abs":"Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) of different morphologies (spheres and worms) were synthesized using a visible light mediated polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) approach.

The ability of strains to form biofilms, which is a multicellular behavior characterized by the aggregation of cells, is predicted to be a conserved strategy for increased persistence and survival. It may also contribute to the increasing number of infections caused by ingestion of contaminated fruits and vegetables. There is a correlation between biofilm formation and the ability of strains to colonize and replicate within the intestines of multiple host species. These strains predominantly cause localized gastroenteritis infections in humans. In contrast, there are salmonellae that cause systemic, disseminated infections in a select few host species; these invasive strains have a narrowed host range, and most are unable to form biofilms. This includes host-restricted Salmonella serovar Typhi, which are only able to infect humans, and atypical gastroenteritis strains associated with the opportunistic infection of immunocompromised patients. From the perspective of transmission, biofilm formation is advantageous for ensuring pathogen survival in the environment. However, from an infection point of view, biofilm formation may be an anti-virulence trait. We do not know if the capacity to form biofilms prevents a strain from accessing the systemic compartments within the host or if loss of the biofilm phenotype reflects a change in a strain's interaction with the host. In this review, we examine the connections between biofilm formation, Salmonella disease states, degrees of host adaptation, and how this might relate to different transmission patterns. A better understanding of the dynamic lifecycle of Salmonella will allow us to reduce the burden of livestock and human infections caused by these important pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Keith D MacKenzie"},{"name":"Melissa B Palmer"},{"name":"Wolfgang L Köster"},{"name":"Aaron P White"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cellulose"},{"word":"curli"},{"word":"gastroenteritis"},{"word":"host adaptation"}]},"article383":{"pmid":"29158706","title":"Comparative study of free and liposome-entrapped chloramphenicol against biofilms of potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated from cooling towers.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"This study aimed to investigate for the first time the in vitro antibiofilm effectiveness of two chloramphenicol liposome formulations against biofilms of potentially pathogenic bacteria associated to corrosion isolated from the water of cooling towers from a Brazilian industry.

Cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) regulates cell functions in response to diverse environmental chemical and physical signals that bacteria perceive. In Burkholderia cenocepacia, the QS signal receptor RpfR degrades intracellular c-di-GMP when it senses the QS signal cis-2-dodecenoic acid, also called Burkholderia diffusible signal factor (BDSF), as a proxy for high cell density. However, it was unclear how this resulted in control of BDSF-regulated phenotypes. Here, we found that RpfR forms a complex with a regulator named GtrR (BCAL1536) to enhance its binding to target gene promoters under circumstances where the BDSF signal binds to RpfR to stimulate its c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity. In the absence of BDSF, c-di-GMP binds to the RpfR-GtrR complex and inhibits its ability to control gene expression. Mutations in rpfR and gtrR had overlapping effects on both the B. cenocepacia transcriptome and BDSF-regulated phenotypes, including motility, biofilm formation, and virulence. These results show that RpfR is a QS signal receptor that also functions as a c-di-GMP sensor. This protein thus allows B. cenocepacia to integrate information about its physical and chemical surroundings as well as its population density to control diverse biological functions including virulence. This type of QS system appears to be widely distributed in beta and gamma proteobacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Chunxi Yang"},{"name":"Chaoyu Cui"},{"name":"Qiumian Ye"},{"name":"Jinhong Kan"},{"name":"Shuna Fu"},{"name":"Shihao Song"},{"name":"Yutong Huang"},{"name":"Fei He"},{"name":"Lian-Hui Zhang"},{"name":"Yantao Jia"},{"name":"Yong-Gui Gao"},{"name":"Caroline S Harwood"},{"name":"Yinyue Deng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BDSF signal"},{"word":"bacterial virulence"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article385":{"pmid":"29158277","title":"High-Dose Daptomycin Is Effective as an Antibiotic Lock Therapy in a Rabbit Model of Staphylococcus epidermidis Catheter-Related Infection.","date":"2019-04-15","abs":"Long-term catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) involving coagulase-negative staphylococci are associated with poor patient outcomes, increased hospitalization, and high treatment costs.

Aerobic granules (AG) are dense, compact, self-immobilized microbial aggregates that allow better sludge-water separation and thereby higher biomass concentrations in the bioreactor than conventional activated sludge aggregates. This brings potential practical advantages in terms of investment cost, energy consumption and footprint. Yet, despite the relevant advances regarding the process of AG formation, instability of AG during long-term operation is still seen as a major barrier for a broad practical application of this technology. This paper presents an up-to-date review of the literature focusing on AG stability, aiming to contribute to the identification of key factors for promoting long-term stability of AG and to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Operational conditions leading to AG disintegration are described, including high organic loads, particulate substrates in the influent, toxic feed components, aerobic feeding and too short famine periods. These operational and influent wastewater composition conditions were shown to influence the micro-environment of AG, consequently affecting their stability. Granule stability is generally favored by the presence of a dense core, with microbial growth throughout the AG depth being a crucial intrinsic factor determining its structural integrity. Accordingly, possible practical solutions to improve granule long-term stability are described, namely through the promotion of minimal substrate concentration gradients and control of microbial growth rates within AG, including anaerobic, plug-flow feeding and specific sludge removal strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Rita D G Franca"},{"name":"Helena M Pinheiro"},{"name":"Mark C M van Loosdrecht"},{"name":"Nídia D Lourenço"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aerobic granules"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"Long-term operation"},{"word":"Mass transfer limitation"},{"word":"Microbial growth rate"},{"word":"Stability"}]},"article389":{"pmid":"29157962","title":"Current and novel approaches for control of dental biofilm.","date":"2018-08-15","abs":"Insights in oral demographics have revealed that a significant percentage of population faces chronic incidences of oral diseases.

In conclusion, via inhibiting growth and regulating microecosystem of biofilm, this novel titanium implant coating with DMADDM was promising in preventing peri-implant disease in an 'ecological manner'.","authors":[{"name":"Bolei Li"},{"name":"Yang Ge"},{"name":"Yao Wu"},{"name":"Jing Chen"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"},{"name":"Minggang Yang"},{"name":"Mingyun Li"},{"name":"Biao Ren"},{"name":"Mingye Feng"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"},{"name":"Xuedong Zhou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimocrobial material"},{"word":"dental implant"},{"word":"dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate"},{"word":"peri-implant diseases"},{"word":"saliva-derived biofilm"}]},"article394":{"pmid":"30671328","title":"Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are amongst the most common nosocomial infections and are also considered among the most common complications associated with indwelling urinary catheters. Most catheter associated infections are derived from the patient's own perineal flora, however the presence of a catheter increases the chance of being colonised by cross transmission of nosocomial bacteria as well. Most episodes of short-term catheter-associated bacteriuria are asymptomatic and are caused by single organisms, while long-term catheterisation promotes multibacterial infections and colonization. With prolonged duration of catheterization bacteriuria is considered universal because of the formation of biofilms on the surface of the catheter. Chronic indwelling catheters are an important reservoir of different multiresistant gram-negative organisms, therefore they are frequently isolated from CAUTIs. Treatment of catheter associated asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended because it will only promote the emergence of resistant organisms without effectively clearing the urine of catheterised patients.","authors":[{"name":"Béla Köves"},{"name":"András Magyar"},{"name":"Peter Tenke"}],"keywords":[]},"article395":{"pmid":"29156392","title":"Biofilms as a sink for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the Yangtze Estuary.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Biofilms are ubiquitous throughout aquatic environments and they are thought to promote the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). This study focused on the occurrence and distribution of five types of ARG in naturally-occurring biofilms, in comparison to associated sediment and water samples, from the Yangtze Estuary, which borders the meta-city of Shanghai, China. The detection frequency and abundances of most ARGs showed the following order: biofilm > sediment > water, which can be attributed to a high level of antibiotics and metals that can accelerate the generation and propagation of ARGs in biofilms. Most of ARG abundances were contributed by extracellular DNA (eDNA) in biofilm and sediment samples. ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetA and tetW) in eDNA were significantly correlated with TOC in both biofilm and sediment samples. Furthermore, both intracellular DNA-associated ARGs per gram of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and eDNA-associated ARGs per gram of non-MBC and were higher in biofilms than sediments, and the partitioning coefficients of ARGs in eDNA between biofilm and water were higher than those between sediment and water. Our results provide new insight for evaluating the occurrence and abundance of ARGs in aquatic environments, confirming that biofilms are a significant sink for ARGs in the estuarine environment.","authors":[{"name":"Xing-Pan Guo"},{"name":"Yi Yang"},{"name":"Da-Pei Lu"},{"name":"Zuo-Shun Niu"},{"name":"Jing-Nan Feng"},{"name":"Yu-Ru Chen"},{"name":"Fei-Yun Tou"},{"name":"Emily Garner"},{"name":"Jiang Xu"},{"name":"Min Liu"},{"name":"Michael F Hochella"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance genes"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Extracellular DNA"},{"word":"Partitioning coefficients"},{"word":"Yangtze estuary"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"29156349","title":"Biopolymer gelatin-coated zinc oxide nanoparticles showed high antibacterial, antibiofilm and anti-angiogenic activity.","date":"2018-02-12","abs":"The use of natural polymers in drug design plays an important role in biomedical applications.

Almost, all microbes mimic multicellular lifestyle to form biofilm by undergoing phenotypic changes to adapt adverse environmental conditions. Many anti-biofilm agents have been experimentally validated to disrupt the biofilms during last three decades. To organize this data, we developed the 'aBiofilm' resource (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/abiofilm/) that harbors a database, a predictor, and the data visualization modules. The database contains biological, chemical, and structural details of 5027 anti-biofilm agents (1720 unique) reported from 1988-2017. These agents target over 140 organisms including Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteria, and fungus. They are mainly chemicals, peptides, phages, secondary metabolites, antibodies, nanoparticles and extracts. They show the diverse mode of actions by attacking mainly signaling molecules, biofilm matrix, genes, extracellular polymeric substances, and many more. The QSAR based predictor identifies the anti-biofilm potential of an unknown chemical with an accuracy of ∼80.00%. The data visualization section summarized the biofilm stages targeted (Circos plot); interaction maps (Cytoscape) and chemicals diversification (CheS-Mapper) of the agents. This comprehensive platform would help the researchers to understand the multilevel communication in the microbial consortium. It may aid in developing anti-biofilm therapeutics to deal with antibiotic drug resistance menace.","authors":[{"name":"Akanksha Rajput"},{"name":"Anamika Thakur"},{"name":"Shivangi Sharma"},{"name":"Manoj Kumar"}],"keywords":[]},"article398":{"pmid":"29155834","title":"Measuring the microbiome of chronic wounds with use of a topical antimicrobial dressing - A feasibility study.","date":"2019-01-18","abs":"Polymicrobial communities colonize all wounds, and biofilms are hypothesized to be a key link to the chronic state and stalled healing. Molecular methods offer greater insight when studying microbial ecology in chronic wounds, as only a small fraction of wound bacteria are cultured by currently available methods and studies have shown little agreement between culture and molecular based approaches. Some interventions, like dressings with oxidized silver, are reported to help the stalled wounds move to a normal healing trajectory but the underlying mechanisms are difficult to measure. One hypothesis is that the use of topical antimicrobial dressings targets the wound microbiome and reduces bioburden.","authors":[{"name":"Lindsay Kalan"},{"name":"Mi Zhou"},{"name":"Michele Labbie"},{"name":"Benjamin Willing"}],"keywords":[]},"article399":{"pmid":"29155404","title":"Carbohydrate source affects the synthesis of silver nanoparticles by Lactobacillus plantarum 1449 and Lactobacillus ruminis 1313.","date":"2019-07-05","abs":"Strains of Lactobacillus have been used for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles.
