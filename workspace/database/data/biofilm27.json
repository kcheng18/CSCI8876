In this study an innovative, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method was applied to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using filamentous fungi Metarhizium robertsii biomass waste. It was shown that these NPs possess prominent antifungal effects against C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis reference strains. Further detailed studies were performed on C. albicans ATCC 90028. AgNPs kill curve (CFU method and esterase-mediated reduction of fluorescein diacetate); fractionally inhibitory concentration index (FICI) with fluconazole (FLC); effect on fungal cell membrane permeability (propidium iodide (PI) staining), membrane lipids profile (HPLC-MS), yeast morphotypes and intracellular reactive oxygen species level (H2DCFDA probe) were investigated. Anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm properties of AgNPs (alone and in combination with FLC) were also tested. Biosafety of AgNPs use was assessed in vitro in cytotoxicity tests against L929 fibroblasts, pulmonary epithelial A549 cell line, and red blood cells. Significant reduction in the viability of yeast cells treated with AgNPs was shown within 6 h. The proportion of C. albicans PI-positive cells increased in a dose and time-dependent manner. Changes in the qualitative and quantitative profile of cell membrane lipids, including significant decline in the quantity of most phospholipid species containing C18:2 and an increase in the amount of phospholipids containing C18:1 acyl species were observed after yeast exposure to AgNPs. CLSM images showed an enhancement in ROS intracellular accumulation in C. albicans treated with biogenic nanosilver. C. albicans transformation from yeast to hyphal forms was also reduced. AgNPs decreased adhesion of yeast to abiotic surfaces, as well as acted synergistically with FLC against sessile population. At fungicidal and fungistatic concentrations, they were non-toxic to mammalian cells. Obtained results confirm suitability of our green synthesis method to produce AgNPs with therapeutic potential against fungal infections.","authors":[{"name":"Barbara Różalska"},{"name":"Beata Sadowska"},{"name":"Aleksandra Budzyńska"},{"name":"Przemysław Bernat"},{"name":"Sylwia Różalska"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"29554105","title":"Sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of colistin and polymyxin B promote Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm formation.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"We investigated the numbers of planktonic and biofilm cells and the expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps and biofilm-related proteins in 10 clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRA) as well as in its standard strain ATCC 19606 in the presence of colistin (CST), polymyxin B (PMB), minomycin (MIN), and tigecycline (TGC) at their respective sub-MICs. The number of planktonic and biofilm cells of ATCC 19606 decreased in the presence of all aforementioned antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner. Cell number also decreased in two representative MDRA strains, R2 and R3, in the presence of MIN and TGC in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the number of biofilm cells in these two strains increased in the presence of CST, while they increased significantly in the presence of PMB in R2 only. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the number of biofilm cells was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding efflux pumps (adeB and adeG) and autoinducer synthase (abaI) in strain R2 and adeB, adeG, adeJ, poly-acetyl-glucosamine-porin (pgaA), and abaI in strain R3 in the presence of CST. It was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding adeB in strain R2 and an outer membrane protein A (ompA) and biofilm-associated protein (bap) in strain R3 in the presence of PMB. These results provide valuable insights into the biofilm formation potency of clinical isolates of MDRA that depends on efflux pumps and biofilm-related genes and its regulation by antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Yoshinori Sato"},{"name":"Yuka Unno"},{"name":"Tsuneyuki Ubagai"},{"name":"Yasuo Ono"}],"keywords":[]},"article2":{"pmid":"29553755","title":"Reversible Self-Assembled Monolayers (rSAMs) as Robust and Fluidic Lipid Bilayer Mimics.","date":"2019-03-12","abs":"Lipid bilayers, forming the outer barrier of cells, display a wide array of proteins and carbohydrates for modulating interfacial biological interactions.

We discovered that in a material library constructed using two metal oxides, the net effect on biofilm formation can be modeled as an addition of the activities of the individual oxides weighted to their relative composition at that particular point on the library. In contrast, for similar material libraries constructed using three metal oxides, there was a nonlinear relation between the amount of dominant metal oxide and the formation of Salmonella biofilms. This nonlinearity resulted in several useful metal oxide combinations that were not expected from the weighted average predictions.

Among the various niches where they are found in the human body, in the oral cavity, the AMPs are secreted by the epithelial cells, defense cells, crevicular fluid, and in the salivary secretions and form the first line of defense against bacterial invasion. The present review gathers information from a number of literature reviews, systematic reviews articles, and original research work to come to a conclusion regarding the use of AMPs. AMPs are miraculous in that they either do not or develop resistance very slowly and hence are supposed to be great candidates for developing antibiotics. Their use in mouthwash formulations, topical applications, etc., as therapeutic modalities has found some success in the past but is still undergoing trials. In periodontal disease, their active role as biomarkers by the relative upregulations and downregulations during disease progression has also been recognized. The early recognition of these biomarker changes can help regulate the progression of periodontal diseases. They also control the development and progression of biofilm formation and might potentially contribute toward the development of therapeutic mimetics, probiotics, and antibiotics in the near future.","authors":[{"name":"Siddharth Mallapragada"},{"name":"Ananya Wadhwa"},{"name":"Pallavi Agrawal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"biomarkers and antibiotics"},{"word":"defense mechanism"},{"word":"innate immune system"}]},"article7":{"pmid":"29551483","title":"Oral, systemic and socioeconomic factors associated with preterm birth.","date":"2019-02-25","abs":"The rates of preterm births have been increasing worldwide.

The evidence accumulated in recent decades indicate that indeed most of the medically relevant microorganisms have a short circulation within the nosocomial environment and a larger one involving the external, i.e. non-nosocomial, and the hospital environments. This evidence suggests that the differences between approaches should yield to a convergent approach aimed at solving the increasing problem represented by infectious diseases for the increasingly less resistant human communities.

Genetic complementation of sgc restored the ability of S. gordonii to sense coaggregation with A. oris. Coaggregation enabled growth of S. gordonii in low/no arginine and disruption of sgc did not affect this ability.

Two-component systems (TCSs) play a crucial role in this process. Here, we describe a novel staphylococcal virulence factor, SpdC, an Abi-domain protein, involved in signal sensing and/or transduction. We have uncovered a functional link between the WalKR essential TCS and the SpdC Abi membrane protein. Expression of spdC is positively regulated by the WalKR system and, in turn, SpdC negatively controls WalKR regulon genes, effectively constituting a negative feedback loop. The WalKR system is mainly involved in controlling cell wall metabolism through regulation of autolysin production. We have shown that SpdC inhibits the WalKR-dependent synthesis of four peptidoglycan hydrolases, SceD, SsaA, LytM and AtlA, as well as impacting S. aureus resistance towards lysostaphin and cell wall antibiotics such as oxacillin and tunicamycin. We have also shown that SpdC is required for S. aureus biofilm formation and virulence in a murine septicemia model. Using protein-protein interactions in E. coli as well as subcellular localization in S. aureus, we showed that SpdC and the WalK kinase are both localized at the division septum and that the two proteins interact. In addition to WalK, our results indicate that SpdC also interacts with nine other S. aureus histidine kinases, suggesting that this membrane protein may act as a global regulator of TCS activity. Indeed, using RNA-Seq analysis, we showed that SpdC controls the expression of approximately one hundred genes in S. aureus, many of which belong to TCS regulons.","authors":[{"name":"Olivier Poupel"},{"name":"Caroline Proux"},{"name":"Bernd Jagla"},{"name":"Tarek Msadek"},{"name":"Sarah Dubrac"}],"keywords":[]},"article29":{"pmid":"29543544","title":"Abundant production of exopolysaccharide by EAEC strains enhances the formation of bacterial biofilms in contaminated sprouts.","date":"2019-04-19","abs":"Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is associated with food-borne outbreaks of diarrhea and growth faltering among children in developing countries. A Shiga toxin-producing EAEC strain of serotype O104:H4 strain caused one of the largest outbreaks of a food-borne infection in Europe in 2011. The outbreak was traced to contaminated fenugreek sprouts, yet the mechanisms whereby such persistent contamination of sprouts could have occurred are not clear. We found that under ambient conditions of temperature and in minimal media, pathogenic Shiga toxin-producing EAEC O104:H4 227-11 and non-Shiga toxin-producing 042 strains both produce high levels of exopolysaccharide structures (EPS) that are released to the external milieu. The exopolysaccharide was identified as colanic acid (CA). Unexpectedly, Shiga-toxin producing EAEC strain 227-11 produced 3-6-fold higher levels of CA than the 042 strain, suggesting differential regulation of the CA in the two strains. The presence of CA was accompanied by the formation of large biofilm structures on the surface of sprouts. The wcaF-wza chromosomal locus was required for the synthesis of CA in EAEC 042. Deletion in the glycosyltransferase wcaE gene abolished the production of CA in 042, and resulted in diminished adherence to sprouts when co-cultured at ambient temperature. In conclusion, this work suggests that copious production of CA may contribute to persistence of EAEC in the environment and suggests a potential explanation for the large Shiga toxin-producing EAEC outbreak in 2011.","authors":[{"name":"Quintin Borgersen"},{"name":"David T Bolick"},{"name":"Glynis L Kolling"},{"name":"Matthew Aijuka"},{"name":"Fernando Ruiz-Perez"},{"name":"Richard L Guerrant"},{"name":"James P Nataro"},{"name":"Araceli E Santiago"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Colanic Acid"},{"word":"EAEC"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"German outbreak"},{"word":"Mechanisms of pathogenesis of gut microbes"},{"word":"capsular antigen"}]},"article30":{"pmid":"29543339","title":"Fungal biofilm inhibition by piperazine-sulphonamide linked Schiff bases: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"We report the synthesis of some new piperazine-sulphonamide linked Schiff bases as fungal biofilm inhibitors with antibacterial and antifungal potential.

First described by Roberts and Evans in the late 1990's, dermatophytoma presents as a dense concentration of fungal hyphae within or under the nail plate and is generally white or yellow/brown in color, and linear (streaks) or round (patches) in shape; primary etiologic organisms are dermatophytes. Oral antifungals have limited success in treating dermatophytoma owing to difficulties accessing and penetrating what is hypothesized to be a fungal biofilm. In this respect, dermatophytoma is generally treated with a combination therapy approach, often including both surgical and pharmacologic intervention for improved outcomes. A post-hoc assessment of Phase II tavaborole onychomycosis studies was conducted in order to assess the prevalence of dermatophytoma and outcomes in patients treated with topical tavaborole. Of the 366 subjects enrolled in the Phase II onychomycosis studies, we identified 102 cases of dermatophytoma; 21 of 86 (24.4%) subjects treated with tavaborole were able to achieve complete resolution of dermatophytoma by day 180, while no subjects on vehicle obtained resolution. Similarly, 23 of 86 subjects (26.7%) treated with tavaborole solution had complete resolution of dermatophytoma by day 360, while only 1 of 16 subjects (6.3%) on vehicle obtained resolution. Moreover, 13 of 19 subjects (68.4%) treated with tavaborole solution were able to sustain resolution, while only 6 of 19 (31.6%) had reoccurrence, of dermatophytoma during the 180-day washout period (day 360).

Parallely, to overcome difficulties of applying raw honey, several product development studies like nanofibrous matrices have been reported. However, one approach concentrated on achieving highest possible honey loading in the nanofiber membranes while other studies have found that only specific honey dilutions result in differential cellular responses on wound healing and re-epithelization. From these results, it can be suggested that high honey loading provides optimum external microenvironment, low-loaded membranes could provide a more conducive internal microenvironment for tissue regeneration. With this hypothesis, this paper sought to evaluate ability of low-honey loaded nanofibers to modulate the anti-oxidant, anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties which are important to be maintained in wound micro-environment. A loading-dependent reduction of biofilm formation and anti-oxidant activity was noted in different concentration ranges investigated. After scratch assay, a certain honey loading (0.5%) afforded the maximum re-epithelization.

Remarkably, Lp.LTA not only interfered with S. aureus biofilm formation, but it also disrupted a pre-formed biofilm. Mechanism studies demonstrated that Lp.LTA inhibited expression of the ica-operon, which is responsible for the production of poly-N-acetylglucosamine, a key molecule required for S. aureus biofilm development. Lp.LTA increased the release of autoinducer-2 from S. aureus, which contributed to the inhibition of S. aureus biofilm formation. Moreover, Lp.LTA treatment enhanced susceptibility of the biofilm to various antibiotics and to macrophages. Interestingly, Lp.LTA without D-alanine moieties was not able to inhibit biofilm formation by S. aureus. In conclusion, the present study suggests that LTA can inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation, and therefore could be applied for preventing and/or treating infectious diseases caused by S. aureus biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Ki Bum Ahn"},{"name":"Jung Eun Baik"},{"name":"Cheol-Heui Yun"},{"name":"Seung Hyun Han"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Lactobacillus plantarum"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"infectious diseases"},{"word":"lipoteichoic acid"}]},"article44":{"pmid":"29535691","title":"Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase ShrA (PA2444) Controls Rugose Small-Colony Variant Formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes many biofilm infections, and the rugose small-colony variants (RSCVs) of this bacterium are important for infection.

We recently showed that Synechocystis sp. Strain PCC 6803 has a functional receptor for ethylene, ethylene response 1 (Etr1), that is involved in various processes such as phototaxis in response to directional light and biofilm formation. Here, we use RNA sequencing to examine the changes in gene transcripts caused by ethylene under phototaxis conditions. Over 500 gene transcripts across many functional categories, of approximately 3700 protein-encoding genes, were altered by application of ethylene. In general, ethylene caused both up- and downregulation of genes within a functional category. However, the transcript levels of amino acid metabolism genes were mainly upregulated and cell envelope genes were mostly downregulated by ethylene. The changes in cell envelope genes correlate with our prior observation that ethylene affects cell surface properties to alter cell motility. Ethylene caused a twofold or more change in 62 transcripts with the largest category of upregulated genes annotated as transporters and the largest category of downregulated genes annotated as glycosyltransferases which sometimes are involved in changing the composition of sugars on the cell surface. Consistent with changes in cell envelope, glycosyltransferase, and transporter gene transcripts, application of ethylene altered the levels of specific sugar moieties on the surface of cells. Light signaling from Etr1 involves two proteins (Slr1213 and Slr1214) and a small, noncoding RNA, carbon stress-induced RNA1 (csiR1). Application of ethylene caused a rapid, but transient, decrease in the transcript levels of etr1, slr1213, and slr1214 and a rapid and prolonged decrease in csiR1 transcript. Deletion of Slr1214 caused a large increase in csiR1 transcript levels and ethylene lowered csiR1 transcript. These data combined with prior reports indicate that ethylene functions as a signal to affect a variety of processes altering the physiology of Synechocystis cells.","authors":[{"name":"Randy F Lacey"},{"name":"Cidney J Allen"},{"name":"Arkadipta Bakshi"},{"name":"Brad M Binder"}],"keywords":[{"word":"RNA‐seq"},{"word":"Synechocystis"},{"word":"ethylene receptor"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substances"}]},"article50":{"pmid":"29534199","title":"Antibiotic resistance genes show enhanced mobilization through suspended growth and biofilm-based wastewater treatment processes.","date":"2019-04-03","abs":"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are known to harbor antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that are disseminated into the environment via effluent.

We used shotgun metagenomics to provide a comprehensive analysis of ARG composition, relationship to mobile genetic elements and co-occurrences with antibiotic production genes (APGs) throughout two full-scale municipal WWTPs, one of which employs biofilm-based secondary treatment and another that uses a suspended growth system. Results showed that abundances of ARGs declined by over 90% per genome equivalent in both types of wastewater treatment processes. However, the fractions of ARGs associated with mobile genetic elements increased substantially between influent and effluent in each plant, indicating significant mobilization of ARGs throughout both treatment processes. Strong positive correlations between ARGs and APGs were found for the aminoglycoside antibiotic class in the suspended growth system and for the streptogramin antibiotic class in the biofilm system. The biofilm and suspended growth WWTPs exhibited similarities in ARG abundances, composition and mobilization trends. However, clear differences were observed for within-plant ARG persistence.

Inhibition kinetics, albeit common in experimental systems, are rarely considered and analytical approaches are either lacking or consider effective diffusivity of the substrate and the biofilm density to remain constant. To address this obvious knowledge gap an analytical procedure to estimate the effectiveness factor (dimensionless substrate mass flux at the biofilm-fluid interface) was developed for a continuum heterogeneous biofilm with multiple limiting-substrate Monod kinetics to different types of inhibition kinetics. The simple perturbation technique, previously validated to quantify biofilm activity, was applied to systems where either the substrate or the inhibitor is the limiting component, and cases where the inhibitor is a reaction product or the substrate also acts as the inhibitor. Explicit analytical equations are presented for the effectiveness factor estimation and, therefore, the calculation of biomass growth rate or limiting substrate/inhibitor consumption rate, for a given biofilm thickness. The robustness of the new biofilm model was tested using kinetic parameters experimentally determined for the growth of Pseudomonas putida CCRC 14365 on phenol. Several additional cases have been analyzed, including examples where the effectiveness factor can reach values greater than unity, characteristic of systems with inhibition kinetics.

Here, we describe the identification of type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems with the first functional antisense RNAs in this pathogen. Through the analysis of deep-sequencing data, we demonstrate the general co-localization with CRISPR arrays for the majority of sequenced C. difficile strains. We provide a detailed characterization of the overlapping convergent transcripts for three selected TA pairs. The toxic nature of small membrane proteins is demonstrated by the growth arrest induced by their overexpression. The co-expression of antisense RNA acting as an antitoxin prevented this growth defect. Co-regulation of CRISPR-Cas and type I TA genes by the general stress response Sigma B and biofilm-related factors further suggests a possible link between these systems with a role in recurrent C. difficile infections. Our results provide the first description of genomic links between CRISPR and type I TA systems within defense islands in line with recently emerged concept of functional coupling of immunity and cell dormancy systems in prokaryotes.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Maikova"},{"name":"Johann Peltier"},{"name":"Pierre Boudry"},{"name":"Eliane Hajnsdorf"},{"name":"Nicolas Kint"},{"name":"Marc Monot"},{"name":"Isabelle Poquet"},{"name":"Isabelle Martin-Verstraete"},{"name":"Bruno Dupuy"},{"name":"Olga Soutourina"}],"keywords":[]},"article69":{"pmid":"29529252","title":"A regulatory RNA is involved in RNA duplex formation and biofilm regulation in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.","date":"2019-07-22","abs":"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are involved in essential biological processes in all three domains of life.

The most abundant ncRNA of this set was found to be resistant to RNase R treatment (RNase R resistant RNA, RrrR(+)) due to duplex formation with a reverse complementary RNA (RrrR(-)). The deletion of the RrrR(+) gene resulted in significantly impaired biofilm formation, while its overproduction increased biofilm yield.

It produces dormant spores, which serve as an infectious vehicle responsible for transmission of the disease and persistence of the organism in the environment. In Bacillus subtilis, the sin locus coding SinR (113 aa) and SinI (57 aa) is responsible for sporulation inhibition. In B. subtilis, SinR mainly acts as a repressor of its target genes to control sporulation, biofilm formation, and autolysis. SinI is an inhibitor of SinR, so their interaction determines whether SinR can inhibit its target gene expression. The C. difficile genome carries two sinR homologs in the operon that we named sinR and sinR', coding for SinR (112 aa) and SinR' (105 aa), respectively. In this study, we constructed and characterized sin locus mutants in two different C. difficile strains R20291 and JIR8094, to decipher the locus's role in C. difficile physiology. Transcriptome analysis of the sinRR' mutants revealed their pleiotropic roles in controlling several pathways including sporulation, toxin production, and motility in C. difficile. Through various genetic and biochemical experiments, we have shown that SinR can regulate transcription of key regulators in these pathways, which includes sigD, spo0A, and codY. We have found that SinR' acts as an antagonist to SinR by blocking its repressor activity. Using a hamster model, we have also demonstrated that the sin locus is needed for successful C. difficile infection. This study reveals the sin locus as a central link that connects the gene regulatory networks of sporulation, toxin production, and motility; three key pathways that are important for C. difficile pathogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Brintha Parasumanna Girinathan"},{"name":"Junjun Ou"},{"name":"Bruno Dupuy"},{"name":"Revathi Govind"}],"keywords":[]},"article72":{"pmid":"29528303","title":"A framework for good biofilm reactor modeling practice (GBRMP).","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"A researcher or practitioner can employ a biofilm model to gain insight into what controls the performance of a biofilm process and for optimizing its performance. While a wide range of biofilm-modeling platforms is available, a good strategy is to choose the simplest model that includes sufficient components and processes to address the modeling goal. In most cases, a one-dimensional biofilm model provides the best balance, and good choices can range from hand-calculation analytical solutions, simple spreadsheets, and numerical-method platforms. What is missing today is clear guidance on how to apply a biofilm model to obtain accurate and meaningful results. Here, we present a five-step framework for good biofilm reactor modeling practice (GBRMP). The first four steps are (1) obtain information on the biofilm reactor system, (2) characterize the influent, (3) choose the plant and biofilm model, and (4) define the conversion processes. Each step demands that the model user understands the important components and processes in the system, one of the main benefits of doing biofilm modeling. The fifth step is to calibrate and validate the model: System-specific model parameters are adjusted within reasonable ranges so that model outputs match actual system performance. Calibration is not a simple 'by the numbers' process, and it requires that the modeler follows a logical hierarchy of steps. Calibration requires that the adjusted parameters remain within realistic ranges and that the calibration process be carried out in an iterative manner. Once each of steps 1 through 5 is completed satisfactorily, the calibrated model can be used for its intended purpose, such as optimizing performance, trouble-shooting poor performance, or gaining deeper understanding of what controls process performance.","authors":[{"name":"Bruce E Rittmann"},{"name":"Joshua P Boltz"},{"name":"Doris Brockmann"},{"name":"Glen T Daigger"},{"name":"Eberhard Morgenroth"},{"name":"Kim Helleshøj Sørensen"},{"name":"Imre Takács"},{"name":"Mark van Loosdrecht"},{"name":"Peter A Vanrolleghem"}],"keywords":[]},"article73":{"pmid":"29527827","title":"Oil type and cross-linking influence growth of Aureobasidium melanogenum on vegetable oils as a single carbon source.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Aureobasidium melanogenum is the main fungus found in a spontaneously formed biofilm on a oil-treated wood.

The isolates were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and clonal complex (CC) classification based on housekeeping genes. Biofilms were detected by crystal violet staining. Greater BF was observed in isolates from young adults (<40 years old) than in those from seniors (≥65 years old; P = 0.002).

Only recent pioneering studies have described the microbial diversity of different Altiplano lakes and revealed their unexpectedly diverse microbial communities. Arsenic metabolism is proposed to be an ancient mechanism to obtain energy by microorganisms. Members of Bacteria and Archaea are able to exploit arsenic as a bioenergetic substrate in either anaerobic arsenate respiration or chemolithotrophic growth on arsenite. Only six aioAB sequences coding for arsenite oxidase and three arrA sequences coding for arsenate reductase from haloarchaea were previously deposited in the NCBI database. However, no experimental data on their expression and function has been reported. Recently, our working group revealed the prevalence of haloarchaea in a red biofilm from Diamante Lake and microbial mat from Tebenquiche Lake using a metagenomics approach. Also, a surprisingly high abundance of genes used for anaerobic arsenate respiration (arr) and arsenite oxidation (aio) was detected in the Diamante's metagenome. In order to study in depth the role of arsenic in these haloarchaeal communities, in this work, we obtained 18 haloarchaea belonging to the Halorubrum genus, tolerant to arsenic. Furthermore, the identification and expression analysis of genes involved in obtaining energy from arsenic compounds (aio and arr) showed that aio and arr partial genes were detected in 11 isolates, and their expression was verified in two selected strains. Better growth of two isolates was obtained in presence of arsenic compared to control. Moreover, one of the isolates was able to oxidize As[III]. The confirmation of the oxidation of arsenic and the transcriptional expression of these genes by RT-PCR strongly support the hypothesis that the arsenic can be used in bioenergetics processes by the microorganisms flourishing in these environments.","authors":[{"name":"Omar Federico Ordoñez"},{"name":"María Cecilia Rasuk"},{"name":"Mariana Noelia Soria"},{"name":"Manuel Contreras"},{"name":"María Eugenia Farías"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Andean Puna"},{"word":"Arsenic"},{"word":"Bioenergetic purposes"},{"word":"Chemolitotrophic growth"},{"word":"Haloarchaea"}]},"article107":{"pmid":"29520354","title":"Group B Streptococcal Maternal Colonization and Neonatal Disease: Molecular Mechanisms and Preventative Approaches.","date":"2020-02-08","abs":"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonizes the gastrointestinal and vaginal epithelium of a significant percentage of healthy women, with potential for ascending intrauterine infection or transmission during parturition, creating a risk of serious disease in the vulnerable newborn.

Using biochemical and biophysical methods coupled with confocal microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, we show that biofilm formation is promoted in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 strain with a loss of function mutation in the arnB gene.

Biofilm-producing yeasts cells acquire an increased resistance to antifungal agents, often leading to therapeutic failure and chronic infection.

In this report, the photoreaction dynamics of BlrP1 and its blue light sensor using a flavin adenine dinucleotide (BLUF) domain were investigated by the time-resolved transient grating method. Only a minor conformational change of the BlrP1-BLUF domain was observed. In contrast, a significant conformational change of the full-length BlrP1 was detected as a diffusion change with a time constant of 21 ms. Interestingly, the extent of the conformational change was concentration-dependent and the dimer form of BlrP1 was found to be the species that exhibited the conformational change. In combination with circular dichroic measurements, a quaternary structural change was determined to be the main origin of the diffusion change. Surprisingly, this conformational change was found to depend strongly on the excitation light intensity. This light-intensity-dependence indicates that the conformational change is induced by the photoexcitation of two monomer units of the dimer.

The implications of these changes for stream ecosystems and food webs is unclear and will depend largely on microbial biofilm responses to concurrent shifts in temperature, light, and resource supply from land. To study those responses, we used nutrient diffusing substrates to manipulate resource supply to biofilm communities along regional gradients in stream temperature, riparian shading, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loading in Arctic Sweden. We found strong nitrogen (N) limitation across this gradient for gross primary production, community respiration and chlorophyll-a accumulation. For unamended biofilms, activity and biomass accrual were not closely related to any single physical or chemical driver across this region. However, the magnitude of biofilm response to N addition was: in tundra streams, biofilm response was constrained by thermal regimes, whereas variation in light availability regulated this response in birch and coniferous forest streams. Furthermore, heterotrophic responses to experimental N addition increased across the region with greater stream water concentrations of DOC relative to inorganic N. Thus, future shifts in resource supply to these ecosystems are likely to interact with other concurrent environmental changes to regulate stream productivity. Indeed, our results suggest that in the absence of increased nutrient inputs, Arctic streams will be less sensitive to future changes in other habitat variables such as temperature and DOC loading.","authors":[{"name":"Maria Myrstener"},{"name":"Gerard Rocher-Ros"},{"name":"Ryan M Burrows"},{"name":"Ann-Kristin Bergström"},{"name":"Reiner Giesler"},{"name":"Ryan A Sponseller"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Arctic"},{"word":"bioassay"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"climate change"},{"word":"colimitation"},{"word":"nitrogen limitation"},{"word":"nutrient addition"},{"word":"stream productivity"}]},"article133":{"pmid":"29516514","title":"Clinical concentrations of peroxidases cause dysbiosis in in vitro oral biofilms.","date":"2018-12-19","abs":"Little is known about the initiation of dysbiosis in oral biofilms, a topic of prime importance for understanding the etiology of, and preventing, periodontitis.

Based on experimental data, an empirical model was developed to directly describe the relationship between methane production, microorganism amount and wall-shear stress. The results showed that DO concentration decreased significantly along the biofilm depth under varied wall-shear stress, and the DO reduction rate was positively related to the intensity of wall-shear stress.

This ability to form biofilms depends on bacterial adhesion to host surfaces, and on the intercellular aggregation contributing to biofilm cohesiveness. Many S. salivarius isolates auto-aggregate, an adhesion process mediated by cell surface proteins. To gain an insight into the genetic factors of S. salivarius that dictate host adhesion and biofilm formation, we developed a screening method, based on the differential sedimentation of bacteria in semi-liquid conditions according to their auto-aggregation capacity, which allowed us to identify twelve mutations affecting this auto-aggregation phenotype. Mutations targeted genes encoding (i) extracellular components, including the CshA surface-exposed protein, the extracellular BglB glucan-binding protein, the GtfE, GtfG and GtfH glycosyltransferases and enzymes responsible for synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides (CwpB, CwpK), (ii) proteins responsible for the extracellular localization of proteins, such as structural components of the accessory SecA2Y2 system (Asp1, Asp2, SecA2) and the SrtA sortase, and (iii) the LiaR transcriptional response regulator. These mutations also influenced biofilm architecture, revealing that similar cell-to-cell interactions govern assembly of auto-aggregates and biofilm formation. We found that BglB, CshA, GtfH and LiaR were specifically associated with bacterial auto-aggregation, whereas Asp1, Asp2, CwpB, CwpK, GtfE, GtfG, SecA2 and SrtA also contributed to adhesion to host cells and host-derived components, or to interactions with the human pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum. Our study demonstrates that our screening method could also be used to identify genes implicated in the bacterial interactions of pathogens or probiotics, for which aggregation is either a virulence trait or an advantageous feature, respectively.","authors":[{"name":"Benoit Couvigny"},{"name":"Saulius Kulakauskas"},{"name":"Nicolas Pons"},{"name":"Benoit Quinquis"},{"name":"Anne-Laure Abraham"},{"name":"Thierry Meylheuc"},{"name":"Christine Delorme"},{"name":"Pierre Renault"},{"name":"Romain Briandet"},{"name":"Nicolas Lapaque"},{"name":"Eric Guédon"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus salivarius"},{"word":"adhesion gene"},{"word":"aggregation"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"commensal bacteria"},{"word":"host interactions"},{"word":"sedimentation"}]},"article137":{"pmid":"29515530","title":"Antibacterial Effect of Copaifera duckei Dwyer Oleoresin and Its Main Diterpenes against Oral Pathogens and Their Cytotoxic Effect.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"This study evaluates the antibacterial activity of the Copaifera duckei Dwyer oleoresin and two isolated compounds [eperu-8(20)-15,18-dioic acid and polyalthic acid] against bacteria involved in primary endodontic infections and dental caries and assesses the cytotoxic effect of these substances against a normal cell line.

Our hypothesis is that the CVLU exudate composition is a biochemical representation of the wound clinical state. Then, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy could be a useful and less-invasive technique to study the clinical state of the ulcer. For this, the aim of this work was to perform a spectral characterization of the exudate from CVLU using FTIR spectroscopy to identify potential healing markers. 45 exudate samples from CVLU, 95% of the strains isolated from CVLU in planktonic and biofilm phenotypes and other related biological samples such as human plasma, serum, urine, blood cells, urea, creatinine, glucose and albumin were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. According to the vibration frequency of biomolecules' (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates) characteristic bonds in the infrared region, different spectral windows were selected and spectral areas of each window were measured. Besides, Savitzky-Golay second derivatives were obtained for all spectra and peaks from each standardized window were detected. FTIR spectroscopy allowed identification of sample types (exudate, plasma, serum, urine) as each one presents a unique relative composition and ratios range. Also, this technique could be useful to identify bacteria in the phenotypic-ulcer state and allows differentiation of whether bacteria are in the biofilm or planktonic form which is unlikely by conventional methods. In this work we found some spectral markers (areas, peaks) that allow identification of several parameters in the exudate such as (a) total cellularity, (b) inflammatory cell load, (c) bacterial load, (d) fibrin amount, and (e) inflammatory proteins. Because the measured areas or founded peaks are concentration-dependent this method could also serve to measure them. Therefore, FTIR spectroscopy could be useful to evaluate patient evolution as all these exudate parameters represent critical negative markers for wound healing.","authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Cerusico"},{"name":"Juan P Aybar"},{"name":"Silvana Lopez"},{"name":"Silvia G Molina"},{"name":"Romina Chavez Jara"},{"name":"Maria Eugenia Sesto Cabral"},{"name":"Juan C Valdez"},{"name":"Aida Ben Altabef"},{"name":"Alberto N Ramos"}],"keywords":[]},"article142":{"pmid":"29513232","title":"Mouthwashes: an in vitro study of their action on microbial biofilms and cytotoxicity to gingival fibroblasts.","date":"2019-01-16","abs":"This study evaluated the in vitro antibiofilm effect of 5 different commercial mouthwashes (Cepacol Traditional, Colgate Plax Fresh Mint, Listerine Cool Mint, Oral-B Complete, and Sensodyne) on Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Previous animal studies have indicated that rnc could decrease the amount of sulcal caries, and that the downregulation of cariogenicity might be due to its capacity to disrupt biofilm formation. However, the biofunctions by which rnc is involved in biofilm formation remain to be elucidated. In this study, we further investigate the role of rnc based on the study of mature biofilm. Scanning electron microscopy and the crystal violet assay were used to detect the biofilm forming ability. The production and distribution of exopolysaccharides within biofilm was analyzed by exopolysaccharide staining. Gel permeation chromatography was used to perform molecular weight assessment. Its adhesion force was measured by atomic force microscopy. The expression of biofilm formation-associated genes was analyzed at the mRNA level by qPCR. Here, we found that rnc could occur and function in biofilm formation by assembling well-structured, exopolysaccharide-encased, stable biofilms in S. mutans. The weakened biofilm forming ability of rnc-deficient strains was associated with the reduction of exopolysaccharide production and bacterial adhesion. Over all, these data illustrate an interesting situation in which an unappreciated regulatory gene acquired for virulence, rnc, most likely has been coopted as a potential regulator of biofilm formation in S. mutans.

The inducing agents produced by S. venezuelae were identified as chloramphenicol and a brominated derivative at subinhibitory concentrations. Upon further characterization of the mobile response, our results demonstrated that subinhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, and spectinomycin all activate a sliding motility response by B. subtilis. Our data are consistent with sliding motility initiating under conditions of protein translation stress. This report underscores the importance of hormesis as an early warning system for potential bacterial competitors and antibiotic exposure.

The rise in resistance has been driven by widespread use, and in some cases misuse, of antibacterial agents in treating a variety of infections. A growing body of research has begun to elucidate the harmful effects of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy on the beneficial host microbiota. To combat these threats, increasing effort is being directed toward the development of precision antimicrobial therapeutics that target key virulence determinants of specific pathogens while leaving the remainder of the host microbiota undisturbed. This includes the recent development of small molecules termed mannosides that specifically target uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC). Mannosides are glycomimetics of the natural mannosylated host receptor for type 1 pili, extracellular appendages that promotes UPEC colonization in the intestine. Type 1 pili are also critical for colonization and infection in the bladder. In both cases, mannosides act as molecular decoys which potently prevent bacteria from binding to host tissues. In mice, oral treatment with mannosides simultaneously clears active bladder infection and removes intestinal UPEC while leaving the gut microbiota structure relatively unchanged. Similar treatment strategies successfully target other pathogens, like adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), an organism associated with Crohn's disease (CD), in mouse models. While not without its challenges, antibiotic-sparing therapeutic approaches hold great promise in a variety of disease systems, including UTI, CD, otitis media (OM), and others. In this perspective we highlight the benefits, progress, and roadblocks to the development of precision antimicrobial therapeutics.","authors":[{"name":"Caitlin N Spaulding"},{"name":"Roger D Klein"},{"name":"Henry L Schreiber"},{"name":"James W Janetka"},{"name":"Scott J Hultgren"}],"keywords":[]},"article160":{"pmid":"29507249","title":"Structural basis for the role of serine-rich repeat proteins from Lactobacillus reuteri in gut microbe-host interactions.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Lactobacillus reuteri, a Gram-positive bacterial species inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates, displays remarkable host adaptation.

Some of these have come to play an important role in the study of cooperation and conflict, largely because, unlike most animals, they can be genetically manipulated and experimentally evolved. However, whereas animal social behavior can be observed and assessed in natural environments, microbes usually cannot, so we know little about microbial social adaptations in nature. This has led to some difficult-to-resolve controversies about social adaptation even for well-studied traits such as bacterial quorum sensing, siderophore production, and biofilms. Here we use molecular signatures of population genetics and molecular evolution to address controversies over the existence of altruism and cheating in social amoebas. First, we find signatures of rapid adaptive molecular evolution that are consistent with social conflict being a significant force in nature. Second, we find population-genetic signatures of purifying selection to support the hypothesis that the cells that form the sterile stalk evolve primarily through altruistic kin selection rather than through selfish direct reproduction. Our results show how molecular signatures can provide insight into social adaptations that cannot be observed in their natural context, and they support the hypotheses that social amoebas in the wild are both altruists and cheaters.","authors":[{"name":"Suegene Noh"},{"name":"Katherine S Geist"},{"name":"Xiangjun Tian"},{"name":"Joan E Strassmann"},{"name":"David C Queller"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Dictyostelium discoideum"},{"word":"altruism"},{"word":"cheating"},{"word":"kin selection"},{"word":"social amoeba"}]},"article162":{"pmid":"29506271","title":"In vitro synergism and anti-biofilm activity of ampicillin, gentamicin, ceftaroline and ceftriaxone against Enterococcus faecalis.","date":"2019-09-13","abs":"Enterococci frequently cause severe biofilm-associated infections such as endocarditis.

However, there is increasing evidence from many studies to suggest that the pumps also play a role in biofilm formation. These studies have involved investigating the effects of efflux pump gene mutagenesis and efflux pump inhibitors on biofilm formation, and measuring the levels of efflux pump gene expression in biofilms. In particular, several key pathogenic species associated with increasing multidrug resistance, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, have been investigated, whilst other studies have focused on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium as a model organism and problematic pathogen. Studies have shown that efflux pumps, including AcrAB-TolC of E. coli, MexAB-OprM of P. aeruginosa, AdeFGH of A. baumannii and AcrD of S. enterica, play important roles in biofilm formation. The substrates for such pumps, and whether changes in their efflux activity affect biofilm formation directly or indirectly, remain to be determined. By understanding the roles that efflux pumps play in biofilm formation, novel therapeutic strategies can be developed to inhibit their function, to help disrupt biofilms and improve the treatment of infections. This review will discuss and evaluate the evidence for the roles of efflux pumps in biofilm formation and the potential approaches to overcome the increasing problem of biofilm-based infections.","authors":[{"name":"Ilyas Alav"},{"name":"J Mark Sutton"},{"name":"Khondaker Miraz Rahman"}],"keywords":[]},"article164":{"pmid":"29506074","title":"Morpholino oligomers tested in vitro, in biofilm and in vivo against multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.","date":"2019-09-16","abs":"Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen and many strains are multidrug resistant.

Populations of 18 native strains of C. jejuni (isolated from raw poultry products) and their subcultures (obtained after 2-3-fold stress exposures to antimicrobial agents in subinhibitory doses) were examined to evaluate the expression of phenotypic antibiotic resistance. Genotypic properties of strains were studied by the PCR with primers that detect the presence of genes for resistance to aminoglycosides (aphA-1, aphA-3, and aphA-7), tetracyclines (tetO), and quinolones (GZgyrA). The majority of test strains of C. jejuni exhibited a high resistance to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline, which reached the maximum value after numerous passages. The expression of antibiotic resistance was greatest in the presence of nalidixic acid and tetracycline. Ciprofloxacin resistance of 33% strains, which were initially resistant to this antibiotic, was increased after 2-3-fold treatment. We revealed a high degree of correspondence between phenotypic and genotypic profiles of antibiotic resistance in food isolates of Campylobacter. One, two, or more genes of aphA were identified in 85% strains phenotypically resistant to aminoglycosides. The tetO gene was found nearly in all strains resistant to tetracycline. Studying the biofilm matrix in C. jejuni after culturing with antibiotics in subinhibitory doses showed that quinolones (particularly nalidixic acid) and tetracyclines potentiate the formation of biofilms and increase the tolerance of Campylobacter to stress exposures. The intensity of biofilm growth was shown to depend little on the effect of macrolides and aminoglycosides.

In humans, it is highly conserved and malformations are extremely rare, suggesting a role for that structure. The Appendix could perform a dual role. First, it is a concentrate of lymphoid tissue resembling Peyer's patches and is the primary site for immunoglobulin A production which is crucial to regulate the density and quality of the intestinal flora. Second, given its shape and position, the Appendix could be a unique niche for commensal bacteria in the body. It is extremely rich in biofilms that continuously shed bacteria into the intestinal lumen. The Appendix contains a microbiota as diverse as that found in the colon and could replenish the large intestine with healthy flora after a diarrhea episode. In conditions of modern medicine hygiene, and people live healthy without their appendix. However, several reports suggest that the effects of appendectomy could be subtler and associated with the development of inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), heart disease but also in less expected disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Lack of an Appendix also predicts a worsen outcome for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, which is the first nosocomial infection in hospitals.

In this study, we treated a metal prosthesis infection model using a combination of ciprofloxacin-loaded temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSL) and alternating magnetic fields (AMF). AMF heating is used to disrupt the biofilm and release the ciprofloxacin-loaded TSL. The three main objectives of this study were to (1) investigate low- and high-temperature-sensitive liposomes (LTSLs and HTSLs) containing the antimicrobial agent ciprofloxacin for temperature-mediated antibiotic release, (2) characterise in vitro ciprofloxacin release and stability and (3) study the efficacy of combining liposomal ciprofloxacin with AMF against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms grown on metal washers. The release of ciprofloxacin from LTSL and HTSL was assessed in physiological buffers. Results demonstrated a lower transition temperature for both LTSL and HTSL formulations when incubated in serum as compared with PBS, with a more pronounced impact on the HTSLs. Upon combining AMF with temperature-sensitive liposomal ciprofloxacin, a 3 log reduction in CFU of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in biofilm was observed.

Bioactive glass is a synthetic silica-based material with excellent mechanical properties able to bond to the host bone tissue. Indeed, when immersed in physiological fluids, bioactive glass reacts, developing an apatite layer on the granule's surface, playing a key role in the osteogenesis process. Moreover, the contact of bioactive glass with biological fluids results in the increase of osmotic pressure and pH due to the leaching of ions from granules' surface, thus making the surrounding environment hostile to microbial growth. The bioactive glass antimicrobial activity is effective against a wide selection of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, either in planktonic or sessile forms.

However, its mode of the action and the compounds responsible for its activities remain obscure. In the present study, we comprehensively investigated the antibacterial activities of ethanol-extracted propolis (EEP) and EEP-derived compounds toward Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone pathogen for periodontal diseases. Broth microdilution and agar dilution assays were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of EEP against a range of oral bacterial species, of which P. gingivalis showed a higher level of sensitivity than oral commensals such as streptococci. Its antibacterial activity toward P. gingivalis was maintained even after extensive heat treatment, demonstrating a high level of thermostability. EEP also induced death of P. gingivalis cells by increasing membrane permeability within 30 min. Spatiotemporal analysis based on high-speed atomic force microscopy revealed that EEP immediately triggered development of aberrant membrane blebs, followed by bleb fusion events on the bacterial surface. Furthermore, we isolated artepillin C, baccharin, and ursolic acid from EEP as antibacterial compounds against P. gingivalis. Of those, artepillin C and baccharin showed bacteriostatic activities with membrane blebbing, while ursolic acid showed bactericidal activity with membrane rupture. In particular, ursolic acid demonstrated a greater ability to affect bacterial membrane potential with increased membrane permeability, probably because of its highly lipophilic nature as compared with other compounds. Taken together, these findings provide mechanistic insight into the antibacterial activities of EEP and its exquisite membrane-targeting antibacterial compounds and imply the applicability of narrow-spectrum therapeutics with EEP for treatment of periodontitis. In addition, the advanced technology utilized in the present study to visualize the nanometer-scale dynamics of microorganisms will contribute to expanding our understanding of the activities of antimicrobials and the mechanism of drug resistance in bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Y Yoshimasu"},{"name":"T Ikeda"},{"name":"N Sakai"},{"name":"A Yagi"},{"name":"S Hirayama"},{"name":"Y Morinaga"},{"name":"S Furukawa"},{"name":"R Nakao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobials/antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM)"},{"word":"membrane blebbing"},{"word":"membrane permeability"},{"word":"membrane potential (ΔΨ)"},{"word":"periodontal disease/periodontitis"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"29493453","title":"Therapeutic Nanotechnology for Bone Infection Treatment - State of the Art.","date":"2018-10-24","abs":"Despite extended, aggressive use of conventional antibiotics, drug treatment of bone infections frequently fails as a combined result of the widespread of drug-resistant bacteria, poor accessibility of many antimicrobials to the deeper portion of the bones, the ease of biofilm formation on the bone surface, and high risk of drug toxicity. Emerging therapeutic nanotechnology offers potential solutions to these issues. In recent years, a number of nanoantimicrobials, i.e. nanoscale devices with intrinsic antibacterial activities or capacity for delivering antibiotics, have been developed for the treatment and prevention of bone infections. These nanoantimicrobials can be designed to have controlled and sustained drug release kinetics, surface-modifications for bone or bacteria targeting, and increased affinity for biofilms. Given the potential value of nanoantimicrobials, clinical application of nanoantimicrobials for bone infection treatment remains scant when compared with the number of ongoing research. It is, therefore, a good time to carefully examine this promising yet relatively uncharted area. This review will extensively discuss the development and state of the art of different classes of nanoantimicrobials for bone infections with emphasis on the treatment aspect and identify the factors that prevent the clinical translation of nanoantimicrobial therapy from bench to bedside.","authors":[{"name":"Pengbo Guo"},{"name":"Hui-Yi Xue"},{"name":"Ho-Lun Wong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Osteomyelitis"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"bone"},{"word":"drug delivery"},{"word":"nanoantimicrobial"},{"word":"nanotechnology"},{"word":"targeted delivery."}]},"article209":{"pmid":"29493443","title":"Antimicrobial and Structural Properties of Metal Ions Complexes with Thiosemicarbazide Motif and Related Heterocyclic Compounds.","date":"2019-11-27","abs":"Antibiotic resistance acquired by various bacterial fungal and viral pathogens poses therapeutic problems of increasing severity. Among the infections that are very difficult to treat, biofilm-associated cases are one of the most hazardous. Complex structure of a biofilm and unique physiology of the biofilm cells contribute to their extremely high resistance to environmental conditions, antimicrobial agents and the mechanisms of host immune response. Therefore, the biofilm formation, especially by multidrugresistant pathogens, is a serious medical problem, playing a pivotal role in the development of chronic and recurrent infections. These factors create a limitation for using traditional chemiotherapeutics and contribute to a request for development of new approaches for treatment of infectious diseases. Therefore, early reports on antimicrobial activity of several complexes of metal ions, bearing thiosemicarbazide or thiosemicarbazones as the ligands, gave a boost to worldwide search for new, more efficient compounds of this class, to be used as alternatives to commonly known drugs. In general, depending on the presence of other heteroatoms, these ligands may function in a di-, tri- or tetradentate forms (e.g., of N,S,-, N,N,S-, N,N,N,S-, N,N,S,S-, or N,S,O-type), which impose different coordination geometries to the resultant complexes.

This paper seeks to explore why chronic wounds fail to heal in relation to the inflammatory cellular dysfunction associated with biofilm development. Findings demonstrate an association between chronic wounds failing to heal, the presence of devitalised tissue and abnormal immune cell activity with a consequential excessive release of harmful matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). This process perpetuates the cycle of wound chronicity and extracellular matrix destruction, which prolongs the inflammatory response, fuelling biofilm formation. Evidence suggests that 'trapping' MMPs may increase new tissue growth but, while devitalised tissue is present, phagocytic cells continue to secrete MMPs and chronicity persists. Consequently, by removing the trigger and implementing effective, sustained debridement of devitalised tissue, both MMP and biofilm production will be diminished, with positive healing outcomes.","authors":[{"name":"Alison Parnham"},{"name":"Chrissie Bousfield"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronic wounds"},{"word":"macrophages"},{"word":"matrix metalloproteases"},{"word":"neutrophils"}]},"article211":{"pmid":"29491853","title":"Cultivation and Genomic Analysis of Candidatus Nitrosocaldus islandicus, an Obligately Thermophilic, Ammonia-Oxidizing Thaumarchaeon from a Hot Spring Biofilm in Graendalur Valley, Iceland.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) within the phylum Thaumarchaeota are the only known aerobic ammonia oxidizers in geothermal environments.

In this study, we physiologically and genomically characterized a newly discovered thaumarchaeon from the deep-branching Nitrosocaldaceae family of which we have obtained a high (∼85%) enrichment from biofilm of an Icelandic hot spring (73°C). This AOA, which we provisionally refer to as Candidatus Nitrosocaldus islandicus, is an obligately thermophilic, aerobic chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizer, which stoichiometrically converts ammonia to nitrite at temperatures between 50 and 70°C. Ca. N. islandicus encodes the expected repertoire of enzymes proposed to be required for archaeal ammonia oxidation, but unexpectedly lacks a nirK gene and also possesses no identifiable other enzyme for nitric oxide (NO) generation. Nevertheless, ammonia oxidation by this AOA appears to be NO-dependent as Ca. N. islandicus is, like all other tested AOA, inhibited by the addition of an NO scavenger. Furthermore, comparative genomics revealed that Ca. N. islandicus has the potential for aromatic amino acid fermentation as its genome encodes an indolepyruvate oxidoreductase (iorAB) as well as a type 3b hydrogenase, which are not present in any other sequenced AOA. A further surprising genomic feature of this thermophilic ammonia oxidizer is the absence of DNA polymerase D genes - one of the predominant replicative DNA polymerases in all other ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota.

P. acnes was isolated from 7/31 devices, and the isolates were categorized by multilocus sequence typing into five different sequence types (STs): ST4 (JK18.2), ST53 (JK17.1), ST69 (JK12.2 and JK13.1), ST124 (JK5.3), ST125 (JK6.2), and unknown ST (JK19.3).

In this study, we characterized HpoR as a novel c-di-GMP effective transcription factor and found a link between the c-di-GMP signal and the antioxidant regulation in Mycobacterium smegmatis. H2O2 stress induces c-di-GMP accumulation in M. smegmatis. High level of c-di-GMP triggers expression of a redox gene cluster, designated as hpoR operon, which is required for the mycobacterial H2O2 resistance. HpoR acts as an inhibitor of the hpoR operon and recognizes a 12-bp motif sequence within the upstream regulatory region of the operon. c-di-GMP specifically binds with HpoR at a ratio of 1:1. Low concentrations of c-di-GMP stimulate the DNA-binding activity of HpoR, whereas high concentrations of the signal molecule inhibit the activity. Strikingly, high level of c-di-GMP de-represses the intracellular association of HpoR with the regulatory region of the hpoR operon in M. smegmatis and enhances the mycobacterial H2O2 resistance. Therefore, we report a novel c-di-GMP effective regulator in mycobacteria, which extends the second messenger's function to bacterial antioxidant defense.","authors":[{"name":"Weihui Li"},{"name":"Meng Li"},{"name":"Lihua Hu"},{"name":"Jingpeng Zhu"},{"name":"Zhiwei Xie"},{"name":"Jiarui Chen"},{"name":"Zheng-Guo He"}],"keywords":[]},"article215":{"pmid":"29489935","title":"Influence of Helicobacter pylori culture supernatant on the ecological balance of a dual-species oral biofilm.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"Dental caries is a chronic progressive disease occurring in the tooth hard tissue due to multiple factors, in which bacteria are the initial cause.

However, antibiotics overuse and misuse have triggered increased multidrug resistance, frustrating the therapeutic outcomes and leading to higher mortalities. Even worse, the tendency of bacteria to form biofilms on living and nonliving surfaces further increases the difficulty in confronting bacteria because the extracellular matrix can act as a robust barrier to prevent the penetration of antibiotics and resist environmental stress. As a result, the inability to completely eliminate bacteria and biofilms often leads to persistent infection, implant failure, and device damage. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop alternative antimicrobial agents while avoiding the generation of bacterial resistance. Taking lessons from natural enzymes for destroying cellular structural integrity or interfering with metabolisms such as proliferation, quorum sensing, and programmed death, the construction of artificial enzymes to mimic the enzyme functions will provide unprecedented opportunities for combating bacteria. Moreover, compared to natural enzymes, artificial enzymes possess much higher stability against stringent conditions, easier tunable catalytic activity, and large-scale production for practical use.

Application of pure 2-TDC to the wild-type strain phenocopies the free-living and symbiotic behaviours of the fadD mutant. Structural features of the MK determine its ability to promote S. meliloti surface translocation, which is mainly mediated by a flagella-independent motility. Transcriptomic analyses showed that 2-TDC induces differential expression of iron uptake, redox and stress-related genes. Interestingly, this MK also influences surface motility and impairs biofilm formation in plant and animal pathogenic bacteria.

The minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBIC) of MRSA biofilms, as determined by IMC, were 5 and 20 mg/mL for daptomycin- and vancomycin-loaded PMMA microparticles, respectively. S. epidermidis biofilms were less susceptible, with a MBIC of 20 mg/mL for daptomycin-loaded PMMA microparticles. Vancomycin-loaded microparticles were ineffective. Adding EUD to the formulation caused a 4- and 16-fold reduction of the MBIC values of daptomycin-loaded microparticles for S. aureus and S. epidermidis, respectively.

Many studies have indicated that surface roughness is the main feature favoring biofilm development in vitro, but its actual influence in vivo has still to be confirmed. In this study, the amount of biofilm formed on differently treated titanium surfaces, showing distinct roughness, has been examined both in vivo and in vitro by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy. In vitro studies availed of biofilm developed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or by salivary bacteria from volunteer donors. In vivo biofilm production was obtained by exposing titanium discs to the oral cavity of healthy volunteers. In vitro experiments showed that P. aeruginosa and, to a lesser extent, salivary bacteria produce more biomass and develop thicker biofilms on laser-treated and sandblasted titanium surfaces with respect to machined ones. In vivo experiments confirmed that bacterial colonization starts on sites of surface unevenness, but failed to disclose biomass differences among biofilms formed on surfaces with different roughness. Our study revealed that biofilm developed in vitro is more easily influenced by surface features than biofilm formed by complex communities in the mouth, where the cooperation of a variety of bacterial species and the presence of a wide range of nutrients and conditions allow bacteria to optimize substrate colonization. Therefore, quantitative differences observed in vitro among surfaces with different characteristics may not be predictive of different colonization rates in vivo.","authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Bevilacqua"},{"name":"Annalisa Milan"},{"name":"Veronica Del Lupo"},{"name":"Michele Maglione"},{"name":"Lucilla Dolzani"}],"keywords":[]},"article230":{"pmid":"29487854","title":"Re-sensitizing Multidrug Resistant Bacteria to Antibiotics by Targeting Bacterial Response Regulators: Characterization and Comparison of Interactions between 2-Aminoimidazoles and the Response Regulators BfmR from Acinetobacter baumannii and QseB from Francisella spp.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"2-aminoimidazole (2-AI) compounds inhibit the formation of bacterial biofilms, disperse preformed biofilms, and re-sensitize multidrug resistant bacteria to antibiotics. 2-AIs have previously been shown to interact with bacterial response regulators, but the mechanism of interaction is still unknown.

Drugs that target the TCS signaling process can inhibit pathogenic behavior, making this a potent new therapeutic approach that has not yet been fully exploited.

These pathogens are able to persist inside the host due to the development of pathogenicity and multidrug resistance traits, often leading to the failure of therapeutic strategies. One specific feature of Candida species pathogenicity is their ability to form biofilms, which protects them from external factors such as host immune system defenses and antifungal drugs. This review focuses on the current threats and challenges when dealing with biofilms formed by Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis, highlighting the differences between the four species. Biofilm characteristics depend on the ability of each species to produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and display dimorphic growth, but also on the biofilm substratum, carbon source availability and other factors. Additionally, the transcriptional control over processes like adhesion, biofilm formation, filamentation, and EPS production displays great complexity and diversity within pathogenic yeasts of the Candida genus. These differences not only have implications in the persistence of colonization and infections but also on antifungal resistance typically found in Candida biofilm cells, potentiated by EPS, that functions as a barrier to drug diffusion, and by the overexpression of drug resistance transporters. The ability to interact with different species in in vivo Candida biofilms is also a key factor to consider when dealing with this problem. Despite many challenges, the most promising strategies that are currently available or under development to limit biofilm formation or to eradicate mature biofilms are discussed.","authors":[{"name":"Mafalda Cavalheiro"},{"name":"Miguel Cacho Teixeira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida genus"},{"word":"antibiofilm strategies"},{"word":"antifungal resistance"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"biofilm regulators"},{"word":"multi-species biofilm"}]},"article232":{"pmid":"29487832","title":"Root canal irrigants influence the hydrophobicity and adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis to root canal dentin: an in vitro study.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"To determine the effect of root canal irrigants on the hydrophobicity and adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) to root canal dentin in vitro.","authors":[{"name":"Venkateshbabu Nagendrababu"},{"name":"Omer Sheriff Sultan"},{"name":"Sreedharan Kannathasan"},{"name":"Amir Shahreza Patel"},{"name":"Ebenezer Chitra"},{"name":"Prasanna Neelakantan"},{"name":"Fabian Davamani"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adherence"},{"word":"Chlorhexidine"},{"word":"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid"},{"word":"Hydrophobicity"},{"word":"Sodium hypochlorite"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"}]},"article233":{"pmid":"29487590","title":"QseC Mediates Osmotic Stress Resistance and Biofilm Formation in Haemophilus parasuis.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Haemophilus parasuis is known as a commensal organism discovered in the upper respiratory tract of swine where the pathogenic bacteria survive in various adverse environmental stress.

We base this observation on four major lines of evidence: (i) a physico-chemical characterization of the soil habitability after an exceptional rain event, (ii) identified biomolecules indicative of potentially active cells [e.g., presence of ATP, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), metabolites, and enzymatic activity], (iii) measurements of in situ replication rates of genomes of uncultivated bacteria reconstructed from selected samples, and (iv) microbial community patterns specific to soil parameters and depths. We infer that the microbial populations have undergone selection and adaptation in response to their specific soil microenvironment and in particular to the degree of aridity. Collectively, our results highlight that even the hyperarid Atacama Desert can provide a habitable environment for microorganisms that allows them to become metabolically active following an episodic increase in moisture and that once it decreases, so does the activity of the microbiota.

Here we review recent literature regarding NTM ecology and transmission, as well as the factors which regulate colony morphotype and pathogenicity.","authors":[{"name":"Tiffany A Claeys"},{"name":"Richard T Robinson"}],"keywords":[]},"article249":{"pmid":"29483163","title":"A Self-Assembling Whole-Cell Vaccine Antigen Presentation Platform.","date":"2019-10-08","abs":"Diarrhea is the most common infection in children under the age of 5 years worldwide.

Here we present a novel, customizable, and self-assembling vaccine platform that exploits the Vibrio cholerae bacterial biofilm matrix for antigen presentation. We use this technology to create a proof-of-concept, live-attenuated whole-cell vaccine that is boosted by spontaneous association of a secreted protein antigen with the cell surface. Sublingual administration of this live-attenuated vaccine to mice confers protection against V. cholerae challenge and elicits the production of antigen-specific IgA in stool. The platform presented here enables the development of antigen-boosted vaccines that are simple to produce and deliver, addressing many of the obstacles to vaccination against diarrheal diseases. This may also serve as a paradigm for the development of broadly protective biofilm-based vaccines against other mucosal infections.","authors":[{"name":"Julie Liao"},{"name":"Daniel R Smith"},{"name":"Jóhanna Brynjarsdóttir"},{"name":"Paula I Watnick"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio cholerae"},{"word":"antigen presentation platform"},{"word":"diarrhea"},{"word":"sublingual"},{"word":"vaccine"}]},"article250":{"pmid":"29483162","title":"PhdA Catalyzes the First Step of Phenazine-1-Carboxylic Acid Degradation in Mycobacterium fortuitum.","date":"2019-03-20","abs":"Phenazines are a class of bacterially produced redox-active metabolites that are found in natural, industrial, and clinical environments.

Photosensitizer (PS), like indocyanine green (ICG), plays a key role in this technique which mainly suffers from the poor stability and concentration-dependent aggregation. An appropriate nanocarrier (NC) with enhanced antibacterial effects could overcome these limitations and improve the efficiency of ICG as a PS. In this study, various ICG-loaded NCs including graphene oxide (GO), GO-carnosine (Car) and GO-Car/Hydroxyapatite (HAp) were synthesized and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Filed Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Zeta Potential and Ultraviolet-Visible spectrometry (UV-Vis). The colony forming unit and crystal violet assays were performed to evaluate the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties of PSs against S. mutans. The quantitative real-time PCR approach was also applied to determine the expression ratio of the gtfB gene in S. mutans. The zeta potential analysis and UV-Vis spectrometry indicated successful loading of ICG onto/into NCs. GO-Car/HAp showed highest amount of ICG loading (57.52%) and also highest aqueous stability after one week (94%). UV-Vis spectrometry analyses disclosed a red shift from 780 to 800 nm for the characteristic peak of ICG-loaded NCs. In the lack of aPDT, GO-Car@ICG showed the highest decrease in bacterial survival (86.4%) which indicated that Car could significantly promote the antibacterial effect of GO. GO@ICG, GO-Car@ICG and GO-Car/HAp@ICG mediated aPDT, dramatically declined the count of S. mutans strains to 91.2%, 95.5% and 93.2%, respectively (P < 0.05). The GO@ICG, GO-Car@ICG, GO-Car/HAp@ICG significantly suppressed the S. mutans biofilm formation by 51.4%, 63.8%, and 56.8%, respectively (P < 0.05).

It could be concluded that the multi-functionalized GO as a novel nanocarrier could significantly enhance the ICG loading, stability, and improve its inhibitory effects as a photosensitizer in aPDT against S. mutans.

Analysis included the following parameters: interproximal clinical attachment level (iCAL) ≥3 mm, interproximal probing depth (iPD) ≥4 mm, number of coronal and interproximal caries, number of missing teeth, ≥1 surfaces with coronal caries, and periodontal profile classes (PPCs). Chi-square was used for bivariate associations. Associations of interdental cleaning with outcomes were assessed with multiple linear regression and generalized logit regression, adjusting for age, race, sex, diabetes, smoking, education, dental visits, and sugar consumption. Nonusers had a significantly higher percentage of sites with iCAL ≥3 mm and iPD ≥4 mm as compared with individuals who used interdental cleaning devices ( P < 0.0001). Individuals with a higher frequency of cleaning (4 to 7×/wk) had a significantly lower extent of sites with iCAL ≥3 mm as compared with lower-frequency cleaning (1 to 3×/wk; P ≤ 0.05). Interdental cleaning users showed lower numbers of coronal caries, interproximal coronal caries, and missing teeth as compared with nonusers ( P < 0.0001). Nonusers had 1.73-times (95% confidence interval, 1.53 to 1.94) higher odds for having ≥1 surfaces of coronal caries as compared with interdental cleaning users, regardless of the weekly frequency.

Pantoea stewartii is transmitted to plants via corn flea beetles, where it first colonizes the apoplast causing water-soaked lesions, and then migrates to the xylem and forms a biofilm that blocks water transport. Bacterial quorum sensing ensures that the exopolysaccharide production necessary for biofilm formation occurs only at high cell density. A genomic-level transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq) analysis was performed to identify additional bacterial genes essential for survival in planta and to provide insights into the plant-microbe interactions occurring during wilt disease. A mariner transposon library of approximately 40 000 mutants was constructed and used to inoculate corn seedlings through a xylem infection model. Cultures of the library grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth served as the in vitro pre-inoculation control. Tn-Seq analysis showed that the number of transposon mutations was reduced by more than 10-fold for 486 genes in planta compared with the library that grew in LB, suggesting that they are important for xylem survival. Interestingly, a small set of genes had a higher abundance of mutants in planta versus in vitro conditions, indicating enhanced strain fitness with loss of these genes inside the host. In planta competition assays retested the trends of the Tn-Seq data for several genes, including two outer membrane proteins, Lon protease and two quorum sensing-associated transcription factors, RcsA and LrhA.

K. pneumoniae virulence has been studied mainly in animal models such as mice and pigs, however, practical, financial, ethical and methodological issues limit the use of mammal hosts. Consequently, the development of simple and cost-effective experimental approaches with alternative host models is needed. In this work we described the use of both, the social amoeba and professional phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum and the fish Danio rerio (zebrafish) as surrogate host models to study K. pneumoniae virulence. We compared three K. pneumoniae clinical isolates evaluating their resistance to phagocytosis, intracellular survival, lethality, intestinal colonization, and innate immune cells recruitment. Optical transparency of both host models permitted studying the infective process in vivo, following the Klebsiella-host interactions through live-cell imaging. We demonstrated that K. pneumoniae RYC492, but not the multiresistant strains 700603 and BAA-1705, is virulent to both host models and elicits a strong immune response. Moreover, this strain showed a high resistance to phagocytosis by D. discoideum, an increased ability to form biofilms and a more prominent and irregular capsule. Besides, the strain 700603 showed the unique ability to replicate inside amoeba cells. Genomic comparison of the K. pneumoniae strains showed that the RYC492 strain has a higher overall content of virulence factors although no specific genes could be linked to its phagocytosis resistance, nor to the intracellular survival observed for the 700603 strain.

The clinical characteristics such as the ulcer duration, size, nature, and grade were associated with biofilm production. Our results suggest that as the size of the ulcer with poor glycemic control increased, the organism was more likely to be positive for biofilm formation.

Comparisons of biofilm production using 3 different conventional methods were performed. The strong producers with the tube adherence method were able to produce biofilm using the cover slip assay method, and the weak producers in tube adherence method had difficulty in producing biofilm using the other 2 methods, indicating that the tube adherence method is the best method for assessing biofilm formation. The strong production of biofilm with the conventional method was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy analysis, because bacteria attached as a distinct layer of biofilm.

The interest in the development of new approaches for the prevention and treatment of biofilm formation has recently increased. The aim of this study was to seek new non-biocidal agents able to inhibit biofilm formation, in order to counteract virulence rather than bacterial growth and avoid the selection of escape mutants. Herein, different essential oils extracted from Mediterranean plants were analyzed for their activity against P. aeruginosa. Results show that they were able to destabilize biofilm at very low concentration without impairing bacterial viability. Since the action is not related to a bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity on P. aeruginosa, the biofilm change of growth in presence of the essential oils was possibly due to a modulation of the phenotype. To this aim, application of machine learning algorithms led to the development of quantitative activity-composition relationships classification models that allowed to direct point out those essential oil chemical components more involved in the inhibition of biofilm production. The action of selected essential oils on sessile phenotype make them particularly interesting for possible applications such as prevention of bacterial contamination in the community and in healthcare environments in order to prevent human infections.

Lipid shell-enveloped polystyrene NPs with high integrity of lipid shells ( cLipid@PSNPs) were prepared by using an electrostatically mediated layer-by-layer approach, where the model polystyrene NPs (PSNPs) were first modified with positively charged poly-l-lysine (PLL) and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), followed by subsequent fusion with zwitterionic, PEGylated small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). The interaction of the PSNPs with SUVs was significantly enhanced by modifying the PSNPs with PLL and DOTAP, which eventually resulted in the formation of cLipid@PSNPs, i.e., Lipid@PLL-PSNPs and Lipid@DOTAP-PSNPs. Improved mucus-penetrating property of cLipid@PSNPs was demonstrated by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring measurements. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements showed that the interaction of the cLipid@PSNPs with bacterial biofilms was significantly promoted. In conclusion, we prepared cLipid@PSNPs via an electrostatically mediated layer-by-layer approach.

Overall, this demonstrates the potential utility of curli fibers as a scaffold for the display of bioactive domains and an untapped approach to rationally modulating host-microbe interactions using bacterial matrix proteins.","authors":[{"name":"Anna M Duraj-Thatte"},{"name":"Pichet Praveschotinunt"},{"name":"Trevor R Nash"},{"name":"Frederick R Ward"},{"name":"Neel S Joshi"}],"keywords":[]},"article291":{"pmid":"29472366","title":"Competitive resource allocation to metabolic pathways contributes to overflow metabolisms and emergent properties in cross-feeding microbial consortia.","date":"2019-09-29","abs":"Resource scarcity is a common stress in nature and has a major impact on microbial physiology. This review highlights microbial acclimations to resource scarcity, focusing on resource investment strategies for chemoheterotrophs from the molecular level to the pathway level. Competitive resource allocation strategies often lead to a phenotype known as overflow metabolism; the resulting overflow byproducts can stabilize cooperative interactions in microbial communities and can lead to cross-feeding consortia. These consortia can exhibit emergent properties such as enhanced resource usage and biomass productivity. The literature distilled here draws parallels between in silico and laboratory studies and ties them together with ecological theories to better understand microbial stress responses and mutualistic consortia functioning.","authors":[{"name":"Ross P Carlson"},{"name":"Ashley E Beck"},{"name":"Poonam Phalak"},{"name":"Matthew W Fields"},{"name":"Tomas Gedeon"},{"name":"Luke Hanley"},{"name":"William R Harcombe"},{"name":"Michael A Henson"},{"name":"Jeffrey J Heys"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chemostat"},{"word":"consortia"},{"word":"emergent property"},{"word":"overflow metabolism"},{"word":"resource allocation"}]},"article292":{"pmid":"29472308","title":"Systematic Complex Haploinsufficiency-Based Genetic Analysis of Candida albicans Transcription Factors: Tools and Applications to Virulence-Associated Phenotypes.","date":"2019-03-29","abs":"Genetic interaction analysis is a powerful approach to the study of complex biological processes that are dependent on multiple genes. Because of the largely diploid nature of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, genetic interaction analysis has been limited to a small number of large-scale screens and a handful for gene-by-gene studies. Complex haploinsufficiency, which occurs when a strain containing two heterozygous mutations at distinct loci shows a phenotype that is distinct from either of the corresponding single heterozygous mutants, is an expedient approach to genetic interactions analysis in diploid organisms. Here, we describe the construction of a barcoded-library of 133 heterozygous TF deletion mutants and deletion cassettes for designed to facilitate complex haploinsufficiency-based genetic interaction studies of the TF networks in C. albicans We have characterized the phenotypes of these heterozygous mutants under a broad range of in vitro conditions using both agar-plate and pooled signature tag-based assays. Consistent with previous studies, haploinsufficiency is relative uncommon. In contrast, a set of 12 TFs enriched in mutants with a role in adhesion were found to have altered competitive fitness at early time points in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis. Finally, we characterized the genetic interactions of a set of biofilm related TFs in the first two steps of biofilm formation, adherence and filamentation of adherent cells. The genetic interaction networks at each stage of biofilm formation are significantly different indicating that the network is not static but dynamic.","authors":[{"name":"Virginia E Glazier"},{"name":"Thomas Murante"},{"name":"Kristy Koselny"},{"name":"Daniel Murante"},{"name":"Marisol Esqueda"},{"name":"Gina A Wall"},{"name":"Melanie Wellington"},{"name":"Chiung-Yu Hung"},{"name":"Anuj Kumar"},{"name":"Damian J Krysan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"complex haploinsufficiency"},{"word":"disseminated candidiasis"},{"word":"haploinsufficiency"},{"word":"hyphal morphogenesis"}]},"article293":{"pmid":"29471691","title":"Streptococcus pneumoniae quorum sensing and biofilm formation are affected by Thymus daenensis, Satureja hortensis, and Origanum vulgare essential oils.","date":"2018-11-16","abs":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Thymus daenensis L., Satureja hortensis L., and Origanum vulgare L. essential oils (EOs) on the planktonic growth, biofilm formation, quorum sensing (QS), and competence system (CS) of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Owing to the limited number of available drugs, it is necessary to search for novel antifungal compounds. In the present work, we assessed the antifungal efficacy of three thiazole derivatives (1, 2, and 3). We conducted in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate their effects on important virulence factors, such as capsule and biofilm formation. In addition, the phagocytosis index of murine macrophages exposed to compounds 1, 2, and 3 and the in vivo efficacy of 1, 2, and 3 in Galleria mellonella infected with Cryptococcus spp. were evaluated. All compounds exhibited antifungal activity against biofilms and demonstrated a reduction in biofilm metabolic activity by 43-50% for C. gattii and 26-42% for C. neoformans. Thiazole compounds promoted significant changes in the capsule thickness of C. gattii compared to that of C. neoformans. Further examination of these compounds suggests that they can improve the phagocytosis process of peritoneal murine macrophages in vitro, causing an increase in the phagocytosis rate. Survival percentage was examined in the invertebrate model Galleria mellonella larvae, and only compound 3 could increase the survival at doses of 5 mg/kg after infection with C. gattii (P = .0001) and C. neoformans (P = .0007), similar to fluconazole at 10 mg/kg.

However, the need for external illumination precludes the use of these tools for imaging bacteria in their natural environments, including in deep tissues of whole organisms and in samples that are highly autofluorescent or photosensitive. The need for genetic encoding also complicates the analysis of clinical isolates and environmental samples. Toward expanding the study of bacterial signaling to these systems, we have developed the first chemiluminescent biosensors for cyclic di-GMP. The biosensor design combines the complementation of split luciferase (CSL) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) approaches. Furthermore, we developed a lysate-based assay for biosensor activity that enabled reliable high-throughput screening of a phylogenetic library of 92 biosensor variants. The screen identified biosensors with very large signal changes (∼40- and 90-fold) as well as biosensors with high affinities for cyclic di-GMP ( K","authors":[{"name":"Andrew B Dippel"},{"name":"Wyatt A Anderson"},{"name":"Robert S Evans"},{"name":"Samuel Deutsch"},{"name":"Ming C Hammond"}],"keywords":[]},"article314":{"pmid":"29466418","title":"Evaluation of the biocontrol efficacy of a Serratia marcescens strain indigenous to tea rhizosphere for the management of root rot disease in tea.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The aim of the present study is to evaluate plant growth promoting and biocontrol efficacy of a Serratia marcescens strain ETR17 isolated from tea rhizosphere for the effective management of root rot disease in tea.

Scanning electron microscopic studies on the interaction zone between pathogen and antagonistic bacterial isolate revealed severe deformities in the fungal mycelia. Spectral analyses (LC-ESI-MS, UV-VIS spectrophotometry and HPLC) and TLC indicated the presence of the antibiotics pyrrolnitrin and prodigiosin in the extracellular bacterial culture extracts. Biofilm formation by ETR17 on polystyrene surface was also observed. In vivo application of talc-based formulations prepared with the isolate ETR17 in tea plantlets under green house conditions revealed effective reduction of root-rot disease as well as plant growth promotion to a considerable extent. Viability studies with the ETR17 talc formulation showed the survivability of the isolate up to six months at room temperature. The sustenance of ETR17 (concentration of 8-9x108 cfu g-1) in the soil after the application of talc formulation was recorded by ELISA. Safety studies revealed that ETR17 did not produce hemolysin as observed in pathogenic Serratia strains.

We found that intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations and transcription levels of pel genes were higher in At. thiooxidans biofilm cells compared to planktonic ones.

Strain S3E12, at high concentration, incites HRs on tobacco and corn plantlets while S1E40 does not. Phylogenies based on individual genes and 16S rRNA-gyrB-rpoB-rpoD concatenated sequence data show strains S1E40 and S3E12 clustering in distinct groups. Strain S3E12 consistently clustered with Pseudomonas marginalis, a bacterium causing soft rots on plant tissues. MLSA data suggest that strains S1E40 and S3E12 are novel genotypes. This is consistent with the data of genome-based DNA-DNA homology values that are below the proposed cutoff species boundary. Comparative genomics analysis of the two strains revealed major differences in the type III secretion systems (T3SS) as well as the predicted T3SS secreted effector proteins (T3Es). One nonflagellar (NF-T3SS) and two flagellar T3SSs (F-T3SS) clusters were identified in both strains. While F-T3SS clusters in both strains were relatively conserved, the NF-T3SS clusters differed in the number of core components present. The predicted T3Es also differed in the type and number of CDSs with both strains having unique predicted protease-related effectors. In addition, the T1SS organization of the S3E12 genome has protein-coding sequences (CDSs) encoding for key factors such as T1SS secreted agglutinin repeats-toxins (a group of cytolysins and cytotoxins), a membrane fusion protein (LapC), a T1SS ATPase of LssB family (LapB), and T1SS-associated transglutaminase-like cysteine proteinase (LapP). In contrast, strain S1E40 has all CDSs for the seven-gene operon (pelA-pelG) required for Pel biosynthesis but not S3E12, suggesting that biofilm formation in these strains is modulated differently.

RsmA and RsmF are both members of the CsrA family of RNA-binding proteins and regulate protein synthesis at the posttranscriptional level. RsmA activity is controlled by two small noncoding regulatory RNAs (RsmY and RsmZ). Bioinformatic analyses suggest that RsmY and RsmZ each have 3 or 4 putative RsmA binding sites. Each predicted binding site contains a GGA sequence presented in the loop portion of a stem-loop structure. RsmY and RsmZ regulate RsmA, and possibly RsmF, by sequestering these proteins from target mRNAs. In this study, we used selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) chemistry to determine the secondary structures of RsmY and RsmZ and functional assays to characterize the contribution of each GGA site to RsmY/RsmZ activity.

In particular, oxygen often becomes limited for cells in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms growing in the laboratory or during host colonization. Previously we found that phenazines, antibiotics produced by P. aeruginosa, balance the intracellular redox state of cells in biofilms. Here, we show that genes involved in denitrification are induced in phenazine-null (Δphz) mutant biofilms grown under an aerobic atmosphere, even in the absence of nitrate. This finding suggests that resident cells employ a bet-hedging strategy to anticipate the potential availability of nitrate and counterbalance their highly reduced redox state. Consistent with our previous characterization of aerobically grown colonies supplemented with nitrate, we found that the pathway that is induced in Δphz mutant colonies combines the nitrate reductase activity of the periplasmic enzyme Nap with the downstream reduction of nitrite to nitrogen gas catalyzed by the enzymes Nir, Nor, and Nos. This regulatory relationship differs from the denitrification pathway that functions under anaerobic growth, with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor, which depends on the membrane-associated nitrate reductase Nar. We identified the sequences in the promoter regions of the nap and nir operons that are required for the effects of phenazines on expression. We also show that specific phenazines have differential effects on nap gene expression. Finally, we provide evidence that individual steps of the denitrification pathway are catalyzed at different depths within aerobically grown biofilms, suggesting metabolic cross-feeding between community subpopulations.","authors":[{"name":"Yu-Cheng Lin"},{"name":"Matthew D Sekedat"},{"name":"William Cole Cornell"},{"name":"Gustavo M Silva"},{"name":"Chinweike Okegbe"},{"name":"Alexa Price-Whelan"},{"name":"Christine Vogel"},{"name":"Lars E P Dietrich"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anr"},{"word":"Nap"},{"word":"Nir"},{"word":"RpoS"},{"word":"biofilm physiology"},{"word":"denitrification"},{"word":"nitrate reductase"},{"word":"nitrite reductase"}]},"article323":{"pmid":"29463601","title":"Discovery of Calcium as a Biofilm-Promoting Signal for Vibrio fischeri Reveals New Phenotypes and Underlying Regulatory Complexity.","date":"2019-08-29","abs":"Vibrio fischeri uses biofilm formation to promote symbiotic colonization of its squid host, Euprymna scolopes Control over biofilm formation is exerted at the level of transcription of the symbiosis polysaccharide (syp) locus by a complex set of two-component regulators.

Here, we identify calcium as a signal that promotes biofilm formation by biofilm-competent strains under conditions in which biofilms are not typically observed (growth with shaking). This was true for RscS-overproducing cells as well as for strains in which only the negative regulator binK was deleted. The latter results provided, for the first time, an opportunity to induce and evaluate biofilm formation without regulator overexpression. Using these conditions, we determined that calcium induces both syp-dependent and bacterial cellulose synthesis (bcs)-dependent biofilms at the level of transcription of these loci. The calcium-induced biofilms were dependent on SypF, but SypF's Hpt domain was sufficient for biofilm formation. These data suggested the involvement of another sensor kinase(s) and led to the discovery that both RscS and a previously uncharacterized sensor kinase, HahK, functioned in this pathway.

In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the role of TYPLEX® Chelate (ferric tyrosine), a novel feed additive, in inhibiting Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) biofilm formation and reducing C. jejuni and Escherichia coli (E. coli) colonization in broiler chickens at market age. In an in vitro study, the inhibitory effect on C. jejuni biofilm formation using a plastic bead assay was investigated. The results demonstrated that TYPLEX® Chelate significantly reduces biofilm formation. In an in vivo study, 800 broilers (one d old) were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments in a randomized block design, each having 10 replicate pens with 20 birds per pen. At d 21, all birds were challenged with C. jejuni via seeded litter. At d 42, cecal samples were collected and tested for volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations and C. jejuni and E. coli counts. The results showed that TYPLEX® Chelate reduced the carriage of C. jejuni and E. coli in poultry by 2 and 1 log10 per gram cecal sample, respectively, and increased cecal VFA concentrations. These findings support TYPLEX® Chelate as a novel non-antibiotic feed additive that may help produce poultry with a lower public health risk of Campylobacteriosis.","authors":[{"name":"F Khattak"},{"name":"V Paschalis"},{"name":"M Green"},{"name":"J G M Houdijk"},{"name":"P Soultanas"},{"name":"J Mahdavi"}],"keywords":[]},"article335":{"pmid":"29461810","title":"Microbial Community Composition of Tap Water and Biofilms Treated with or without Copper-Silver Ionization.","date":"2019-09-17","abs":"Copper-silver ionization (CSI) is an in-house water disinfection method primarily installed to eradicate Legionella bacteria from drinking water distribution systems (DWDS).

PCR and direct fluorescent counts can detect viable non-cultivable bacteria, which are not counted by plating procedures. Legionella spp., commonly form such viable non-culturable cells and it is likely that they contribute to the difference between plate count results and those of PCR and fluorescent-antibody detection. However, studies have shown that Legionella is present in the municipal water source in spite of the current filtration and chlorination procedures. Once Legionella reaches the building water system, it settles down into a biofilm layer of stagnant water. By means of this layer, Legionella can protect itself from antimicrobial agents and then multiply. Dental unit waterlines may be contaminated with opportunistic bacteria. The water quality in the dental units should be controlled to eliminate opportunistic pathogens and to provide water for dental treatment that meets public health standards for potable water.","authors":[{"name":"F Carinci"},{"name":"L Scapoli"},{"name":"M Contaldo"},{"name":"R Santoro"},{"name":"A Palmieri"},{"name":"F Pezzetti"},{"name":"D Lauritano"},{"name":"V Candotto"},{"name":"D Mucchi"},{"name":"L Baggi"},{"name":"A Tagliabue"},{"name":"L Tettamanti"}],"keywords":[]},"article340":{"pmid":"29460278","title":"Structural and metabolic responses of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms to hyperosmotic and antibiotic stress.","date":"2019-05-13","abs":"Biofilms alter their metabolism in response to environmental stress.

The bacterial isolates exhibiting lactobacilli-like phenotypic characteristics were identified as members of the L. plantarum group by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and their diversity was evaluated by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR patterns. The selected strains were screened for probiotic potential through in vitro tests. Firstly, bacterial survival was evaluated in an in vitro system simulating the human oro-gastrointestinal tract, using also milk as a carrier matrix. Besides, physiological traits such as antibiotic susceptibility, antimicrobial activity against selected enteric pathogens, and adhesion to abiotic surfaces and to gastric mucin were studied. Considering the resistance to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the results from the biofilm and mucin adhesion tests, a strain-denominated L. plantarum LSC3 was selected for further evaluation of in vitro adhesion ability to intestinal mucosa and immunomodulatory activities. L. plantarum LSC3 was able to adhere efficiently to human enterocyte-like cells (Caco-2 cells), and decreased IL-8 transcription while increasing IL-10 mRNA level, as revealed by transcriptional analysis on LPS-stimulated human (THP-1) macrophages.

In an attempt to better understand the bactericidal action of GO, herein we studied the interactions of GO with Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus cells using physical techniques and chemical probes, respectively. In particular, a novel laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) based elemental fingerprint analysis revealed notable differences between viable and non-viable cells based on the difference in the concentration of trace inorganic elements in complex bacterial systems, which reflect cellular membrane integrity. Lower emission intensities from essential inorganic ions in the GO-treated cells offered explicit evidence on the efflux of intracellular molecules from the bacteria through damaged cell membranes. Furthermore, a detailed structural and morphological investigation of bacterial membrane integrity confirmed GO-induced membrane stress upon direct contact interactions with bacterial cells, resulting in the disruption of cellular membranes. Moreover, the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of an added antioxidant underlined the role of GO-mediated oxidative stress in bacterial cell inactivation. Thus, by correlating the changes in the bacterial elemental compositions with the severe morphological alterations and the high ROS production witnessed herein, we propose that the bactericidal mechanism of GO is likely to be the synergy between membrane and oxidative stress towards both tested species.

Investigating the Ability of Bacteriophage to Augment Antibiotic Activity against Staphylococcus aureus Biofilms.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The inability to effectively treat biofilm-related infections is a major clinical challenge. This has been attributed to the heightened antibiotic tolerance conferred to bacterial cells embedded within biofilms. Lytic bacteriophages (phages) have evolved to effectively infect and eradicate biofilm-associated cells. The current study was designed to investigate the ability of phage treatment to enhance the activity of antibiotics against biofilm-forming Staphylococcus aureus. The biofilm positive S. aureus strain ATCC 35556, the lytic S. aureus phage SATA-8505, and five antibiotics (cefazolin, vancomycin, dicloxacillin, tetracycline, and linezolid), used to treat S. aureus infections, were tested in this study. The ability of the SATA-8505 phage to augment the effect of these antibiotics against biofilm-associated S. aureus cells was assessed by exposing them to one of the five following treatment strategies: (i) antibiotics alone, (ii) phage alone, (iii) a combination of the two treatments simultaneously, (iv) staggered exposure to the phage followed by antibiotics, and (v) staggered exposure to antibiotics followed by exposure to phage. The effect of each treatment strategy on biofilm cells was assessed by enumerating viable bacterial cells. The results demonstrate that the treatment of biofilms with either SATA-8505, antibiotics, or both simultaneously resulted in minimal reduction of viable biofilm-associated cells. However, a significant reduction [up to 3 log colony forming unit (CFU)/mL] was observed when the phage treatment preceded antibiotics. This effect was most pronounced with vancomycin and cefazolin which exhibited synergistic interactions with SATA-8505, particularly at lower antibiotic concentrations. This in vitro study provides proof of principle for the ability of phages to augment the activity of antibiotics against S. aureus biofilms. Our results also demonstrate that therapeutic outcomes can be influenced by the sequence in which these therapeutic agents are administered, and the nature of their interactions. Further investigation into the interactions between lytic phages and antibiotics against various biofilm-forming organisms is important to direct future clinical translation of efficacious antibiotic-phage combination therapeutic strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Dilini Kumaran"},{"name":"Mariam Taha"},{"name":"QiLong Yi"},{"name":"Sandra Ramirez-Arcos"},{"name":"Jean-Simon Diallo"},{"name":"Alberto Carli"},{"name":"Hesham Abdelbary"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"synergy"}]},"article345":{"pmid":"29459646","title":"Poly(butylene succinate)/bamboo powder blends as solid-phase carbon source and biofilm carrier for denitrifying biofilters treating wastewater from recirculating aquaculture system.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"In this study, Poly(butylene succinate)/bamboo powder (PBS/BP) was newly applied and tested for 8 months as the carbon source in two moving bed reactors for nitrate removal in real RAS wastewater (fresh/sea water), with the purposes of simultaneous reducing the cost of PBS packing and effluent DOC.

Bacterial iridescence is created by a unique self-organization of sub-communities of cells, but the mechanisms underlying such living photonic crystals are unknown. In this study, we used Petri dish assays to screen a large panel of potential activators or inhibitors of C. lytica's iridescence. Derivatives potentially interfering with quorum-sensing and other communication or biofilm formation processes were tested, as well as metabolic poisons or algal exoproducts. We identified an indole derivative, 5-hydroxyindole (5HI, 250 µM) which inhibited both gliding and iridescence at the colonial level. 5HI did not affect growth or cell respiration. At the microscopic level, phase-contrast imaging confirmed that 5HI inhibits the gliding motility of cells. Moreover, the lack of iridescence correlated with a perturbation of self-organization of the cell sub-communities in both the WT and a gliding-negative mutant. This effect was proved using recent advances in machine learning (deep neuronal networks). In addition to its effect on colony biofilms, 5HI was found to stimulate biofilm formation in microplates.

This results from the activation of protective changes to cell physiology (decreased outer membrane permeability), resistance transporters (drug efflux pumps), resistant lifestyles (biofilms, persistence) and/or resistance mutations (target mutations, production of antibiotic modification/degradation enzymes). In targeting and interfering with essential physiological mechanisms, antimicrobials themselves are considered as stresses to which protective responses have also evolved.

Despite their prevalence, however, the role for these extracellular enzymes is still relatively unclear. The DNases of the Lancefield group A Streptococcus, S. pyogenes are the best characterized, with a total of eight DNase genes identified so far. Six are known to be associated with integrated prophages. Two are chromosomally encoded, and one of these is cell-wall anchored. Homologues of both prophage-associated and chromosomally encoded S. pyogenes DNases have been identified in other streptococcal species, as well as other unique DNases. A major role identified for streptococcal DNases appears to be in the destruction of extracellular traps produced by immune cells, such as neutrophils, to ensnare bacteria and kill them. These traps are composed primarily of DNA which can be degraded by the secreted and cell-wall-anchored streptococcal DNases. DNases can also reduce TLR-9 signalling to dampen the immune response and produce cytotoxic deoxyadenosine to limit phagocytosis. Upper respiratory tract infection models of S. pyogenes have identified a role for DNases in potentiating infection and transmission, possibly by limiting the immune response or through some other unknown mechanism. Streptococcal DNases may also be involved in interacting with other microbial communities through communication, bacterial killing and disruption of competitive biofilms, or control of their own biofilm production. The contribution of DNases to pathogenesis may therefore be wide ranging and extend beyond direct interference with the host immune response.","authors":[{"name":"Alex Remmington"},{"name":"Claire E Turner"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNases"},{"word":"Streptococcus pyogenes"},{"word":"neutrophil extracellular traps"}]},"article357":{"pmid":"29458564","title":"Veillonella infantium sp. nov., an anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative coccus isolated from tongue biofilm of a Thai child.","date":"2019-12-11","abs":"A strain of a novel anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative coccus was isolated from the tongue biofilm of a Thai child.

Treatment of diabetic foot infections, especially deep-seated ones, remains challenging, in part because impaired blood perfusion and the presence of biofilms can impair the effectiveness of systemic antibiotics. The local application of antibiotics is an emerging field in the treatment of diabetic foot infections, with demonstrable advantages. These include delivery of high concentrations of antibiotics in the affected area, limited systemic absorption, and thus negligible side effects. Biodegradable vehicles, such as calcium sulfate beads, are the prototypical system, providing a good elution profile and the ability to be impregnated with a variety of antibiotics. These have largely superseded the nonbiodegradable vehicles, but the strongest evidence available is for calcium bead implantation for osteomyelitis management. Natural polymers, such as collagen sponge, are an emerging class of delivery systems, although thus far, data on diabetic foot infections are limited. There is recent interest in the novel antimicrobial peptide pexiganan in the form of cream, which is active against most of the microorganisms isolated in diabetic foot infections.

This study was aimed at identifying the changes that occur in S. aureus exposed to the host defense mechanisms during chronic osteomyelitis and evaluating whether these changes affect the virulence of the organism. Genome assessment of two S. aureus isolates collected 13 months apart (HU-85a and HU-85c) from a host with chronic osteomyelitis was made by whole genome sequencing. Agr functionality was assessed by qRT-PCR. Isolates were tested in a rat model of osteomyelitis and the bacterial load (CFU/tibia) and the morphometric osteomyelitic index (OI) were determined. The ability of the isolates to trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines was determined on macrophages in culture. Persistence of S. aureus within the host resulted in an agrC frameshift mutation that likely led to the observed phenotype. The capacity to cause bone tissue damage and trigger proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages of the agr-deficient, unencapsulated derivative (HU-85c) was decreased when compared with those of the isogenic CP8-capsulated parental strain (HU-85a). By comparison, no significant differences were found in the bacterial load or the OI from rats challenged with isogenic Reynolds strains [CP5, CP8, and non-typeable (NT)], indicating that lack of CP expression alone was not likely responsible for the reduced capacity to cause tissue damage in HU-85c compared with HU-85a. The production of biofilm was significantly increased in the isogenic derivative HU-85c.

Among the Candida species, Candida albicans is the most prevalent. The expression of virulence genes is implicated in the pathogenic potential of Candida biofilms. However, the evaluation of microbial gene expression from in vivo biofilm samples is not trivial, specifically, assessment via quantitative PCR (qPCR) can be a challenge because of several species present in clinical samples. Hence, the necessity of primers specificity. The aim of this study was to evaluate through in silico and in vitro analyses the specificity of published primers and newly designed primers for C. albicans virulence genes: ALS1, CAP1, CAT1, EFG1, HWP1, LIP3, PLB1, SAP1, SAP4, SOD1, SOD5 and ACT1 (normalizing gene). In silico analysis was performed through a PubMed search of articles with primer sequences that evaluated gene expression of C. albicans. Then, the sequence similarity of twenty-eight primers was checked through BLASTn and ClustalW2. The analysis of secondary structures was performed using mfold. When the primers did not present satisfactory characteristics (absence of secondary structures, not discrepant Tm of forward and reverse sequences and specificity) following in vitro analysis (i.e., end point PCR), new primers were designed using Beacon Designer™ and sequences obtained from the Candida Genome Database. The selected primers were tested in vitro by end point PCR using a panel of genomic DNA from five different Candida species (C. albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida dubliniensis, Candida krusei, and Candida tropicalis). The resulting PCR products were visualized on agarose gel. qPCR reactions were performed to determine primers' optimal concentration and PCR efficiency. End point PCR demonstrated that published primers for the SAP1 and HWP1 were specific for C. albicans and the one for SOD1 reacted with C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. The sequence of primers designed for ACT1, ALS1 and HWP1 genes were specific for C. albicans, while the ones for CAP1, CAT1, EFG1, LIP3, and PLB1 were detected in C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. After optimization, all primers presented a single peak on melt curves, correlation coefficient of ≅1 and qPCR reaction efficiency of 90-110%, with slope of ≅-3.3.

Therefore, it has to adequately sense and respond to the host defense by expressing appropriate virulence attributes. The most important virulence factor of C. albicans is the yeast-to-hyphae morphogenetic switch, which can be induced by numerous environmental cues, including the amino acid methionine. Here, we show an essential role for methionine permease Mup1 in methionine-induced morphogenesis, biofilm formation, survival inside macrophages and virulence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this process requires conversion of methionine into S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and its decarboxylation by Spe2. The resulting amino-propyl group is then used for biosynthesis of polyamines, which have been shown to activate adenylate cyclase. Inhibition of the SPE2 SAM decarboxylase gene strongly impairs methionine-induced morphogenesis on specific media and significantly delays virulence in the mouse systemic infection model system. Further proof of the connection between methionine uptake and initial metabolism and the cAMP-PKA pathway was obtained by showing that both Mup1 and Spe2 are required for cAMP production in response to methionine. Our results suggest that amino acid transport and further metabolism are interesting therapeutic targets as inhibitors of this may prevent the morphogenetic switch, thereby preventing virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Sanne Schrevens"},{"name":"Griet Van Zeebroeck"},{"name":"Michael Riedelberger"},{"name":"Hélène Tournu"},{"name":"Karl Kuchler"},{"name":"Patrick Van Dijck"}],"keywords":[]},"article378":{"pmid":"29453676","title":"Properties of bacterial communities attached to artificial substrates in a hypereutrophic urban river.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Bacterial communities of biofilms growing on artificial substrates were examined at two time periods (7 and 14 days) and two locations (lentic and lotic areas) in a hypereutrophic urban river of eastern China.

Previously, in 2000, there were concerns by the FDA that PI would degrade the silicone elastomer shell. This change in the DFU represents an important advance that will benefit patients through the permitted use of PI to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination of implant surfaces. What was formerly an off-label practice can be openly practiced by plastic surgeons as an anti-infective and biofilm-mitigation strategy.

The expression of the P. chlororaphis 30-84 phenazine biosynthetic operon (phzXYFABCD) is dependent on the PhzR/PhzI quorum sensing system located immediately upstream of the biosynthetic operon as well as other regulatory systems including Gac/Rsm. Bioinformatic analysis of the sequence between the divergently oriented phzR and phzX promoters identified features within the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of phzX that are conserved only among 2OHPCA producing Pseudomonas. The conserved sequence features are potentially capable of producing secondary structures that negatively modulate one or both promoters. Transcriptional and translational fusion assays revealed that deletion of 90-bp of sequence at the 5'-UTR of phzX led to up to 4-fold greater expression of the reporters with the deletion compared to the controls, which indicated this sequence negatively modulates phenazine gene expression both transcriptionally and translationally. This 90-bp sequence was deleted from the P. chlororaphis 30-84 chromosome, resulting in 30-84Enh, which produces significantly more phenazine than the wild-type while retaining quorum sensing control. The transcriptional expression of phzR/phzI and amount of AHL signal produced by 30-84Enh also were significantly greater than for the wild-type, suggesting this 90-bp sequence also negatively affects expression of the quorum sensing genes. In addition, deletion of the 90-bp partially relieved RsmE-mediated translational repression, indicating a role for Gac/RsmE interaction.

These mechanisms include either modifications of the membrane or changes in the overall energy status, cell morphology, and cell surface properties. Long-term adaptations are dependent on transcriptional regulation, the induction of anabolic pathways, and cell growth. However, to survive sudden environmental changes, bacterial short-term responses are essential to keep the cells alive after the occurrence of an environmental stress factor such as heat shock or the presence of toxic organic solvents. Thus far, two main short-term responses are known. On the one hand, a fast isomerization of cis into trans unsaturated fatty leads to a quick rigidification of the cell membrane, a mechanism known in some genera of Gram-negative bacteria. On the other hand, a fast, effective, and ubiquitously present countermeasure is the release of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from the cell surface leading to a rapid increase in cell surface hydrophobicity and finally to the formation of cell aggregates and biofilms. These immediate response mechanisms just allow the bacteria to stay physiologically active and to employ long-term responses to assure viability upon changing environmental conditions.

ComX is an AI peptide, mostly known for its role in the regulation of bacterial competence and surfactant production in Bacillus subtilis. These two traits are regulated accordingly to the bacterial population size, thus classifying ComX as a quorum sensing signal. ComX also indirectly regulates exoprotease production through the intermediate transcriptional regulator DegQ. We here use this peptide-based AI system (the ComQXPA system) as a model to address exoprotease regulation by ComX in biofilms. We also investigate the potential of ComX regulated proteases to degrade the ComX AI peptide. Results indicate that ComX indeed induces the expression of aprE, the gene for the major serine protease subtilisin, and stimulates overall exoprotease production in biofilms of B. subtilis PS-216 and several other B. subtilis soil isolates. We also provide evidence that these exoproteases can degrade ComX. The ComX biological activity decay is reduced in the spent media of floating biofilms with low proteolytic activity found in the comP and degQ mutants. ComX biological activity decay can be restored by the addition of subtilisin to such media. In contrast, inhibition of metalloproteases by EDTA reduces ComX biological activity decay. This suggests that both serine and metalloproteases, which are induced by ComX, are ultimately capable of degrading this signaling peptide. This work brings novel information on regulation of exoproteases in B. subtilis floating biofilms and reveals that these proteolytic enzymes degrade the AI signaling peptide ComX, which is also a major determinant of their expression in biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Mihael Spacapan"},{"name":"Tjaša Danevčič"},{"name":"Ines Mandic-Mulec"}],"keywords":[{"word":"auto inducing signal"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cell signaling"},{"word":"degradative enzymes"},{"word":"pellicles"},{"word":"protease"},{"word":"quorum quenching"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"29449370","title":"Structural basis for antibody targeting of the broadly expressed microbial polysaccharide poly-N-acetylglucosamine.","date":"2019-04-06","abs":"In response to the widespread emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes, new therapeutic agents are required for many human pathogens.

There is therefore a pressing need for the development of novel treatment strategies that are effective against NTHi biofilm-associated diseases.

Several reports have shown that the treatments with sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of antimicrobial agents influence biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa. The antibiotic ceftazidime (CAZ) is used to treat P. aeruginosa infections, but few studies have examined the effects of β-lactams on biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa. In this study, we investigated the role of sub-MICs of CAZ in the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilms. 1/4 × MIC CAZ reduced the biofilm volume of P. aeruginosa PAO1, as quantified by crystal violet staining. The formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms treated with 1/4 × MIC CAZ were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. They were more heterogeneous than the PAO1 biofilms without CAZ treatment. Furthermore, sub-MICs of CAZ inhibited the twitching motility, which played an important role in mature biofilm formation. 1/4 × MIC CAZ also reduced the gene expressions of lecA, lecB, pel and psl, which mediate the adhesion and polysaccharide matrix synthesis of P. aeruginosa. These effects suggest that sub-MICs of CAZ may affect a number of stages of biofilm formation. Investigating the effects of sub-MIC antibiotics on targeted bacterial biofilm may lead to the development of future antibiotic treatment modalities.","authors":[{"name":"Satoshi Otani"},{"name":"Kazufumi Hiramatsu"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Hashinaga"},{"name":"Kosaku Komiya"},{"name":"Kenji Umeki"},{"name":"Kenji Kishi"},{"name":"Jun-Ichi Kadota"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Ceftazidime"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations"}]},"article399":{"pmid":"29449125","title":"Enhancing the anti-biofilm activity of 5-aryl-2-aminoimidazoles through nature inspired dimerisation.","date":"2018-10-05","abs":"The increased tolerance of biofilms against disinfectants and antibiotics has stimulated research into new methods of biofilm prevention and eradication. In our previous work, we have identified the 5-aryl-2-aminoimidazole core as a scaffold that demonstrates preventive activity against biofilm formation of a broad range of bacterial and fungal species. Inspired by the dimeric nature of natural 2-aminoimidazoles of the oroidin family, we investigated the potential of dimers of our decorated 5-aryl-2-aminoimidazoles as biofilm inhibitors. A synthetic approach towards 2-aminoimidazole dimers linked by an alkyl chain was developed and a total of 48 dimers were synthesized. The linkers were introduced at two different positions, the N1-position or the N2-position, and the linker length and the substitution of the 5-phenyl ring (H, F, Cl, Br) were varied. Although, no clear correlation between linker length and biofilm inhibition was observed, a strong increase in anti-biofilm activity for almost all N1,N1'-linked dimers was obtained, compared to the respective monomers against Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The N2,N2'-linked dimers, having a H- or F-substitution, were also found to show a strong increase in anti-biofilm activity compared to the respective monomers against these three bacterial species and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the obtained growth measurements suggest a broad concentration range with specific biofilm inhibition and no effect on the planktonic growth against Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Tran Thi Thu Trang"},{"name":"Lise Dieltjens"},{"name":"Geert Hooyberghs"},{"name":"Kai Waldrant"},{"name":"Denis S Ermolat'ev"},{"name":"Erik V Van der Eycken"},{"name":"Hans P L Steenackers"}],"keywords":[{"word":"2-Aminoimidazoles"},{"word":"Biofilm inhibition"},{"word":"Dimers"},{"word":"Microwave assisted synthesis"}]}}
