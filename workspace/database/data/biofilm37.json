Hyperflagellated cells form wandering colonies that are capable of moving around on the surface of medium containing ≥1.5% agar. Transposon mutagenesis was used to identify genes critical for motility. In addition to flagellar genes, this mutagenesis identified five nonflagellar structural genes that were important for motility. Of these, the disruption of degSU, wsfP, or PBN151_4312 resulted in a complete loss of flagellin synthesis. Analysis of flagellar gene promoter activity showed that each mutation severely reduced flagellar gene transcription in a different manner. Flagellar gene transcription was induced in liquid medium by the addition of a viscous agent, Ficoll, or by disruption of flagellar stator genes, indicating that flagellar gene transcription was induced in response to restriction of flagellar rotation. Overexpression of DegSU bypassed the requirement of flagellar rotation restriction for induction of flagellar genes. These results indicate that physical restriction of flagellar rotation by physical contact with the surface of solid medium induces flagellar gene transcription through the activation of DegSU.

To this end, we used the lambda recombineering method to generate a fur mutant strain of Pcb1692 and assessed the virulence and fitness of the mutant strain. The results showed that production of siderophores in Pcb1692Δfur increased compared to the Pcb1692 wild-type and the complemented strain Pcb1692Δfur-pfur.

The failure rate of two-stage revision and irrigation and debridement with component retention in PJI suggests that biofilm cells have a high tolerance to antibiotic chemotherapy. Previous work has demonstrated that biofilm cells have high antibiotic tolerance in vitro, but there is little clinical evidence to support these observations. The aim of this study was to determine if retrieved antibiotic spacers from two-stage revision total knee arthroplasty for PJI have evidence of remaining viable bacteria. Antibiotic poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) spacers from two-stage revision total knee arthroplasty for PJI were prospectively collected and analyzed for bacterial 16s rRNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and single genome analysis (SGA). PCR and RT-PCR identified bacterial species on 53.8% (7/13) of these samples. When initial culture negative cases are excluded, 68% (6/9) samples were identified with bacterial species. A more rigorous qRT-PCR analysis showed a strong positive signal for bacterial contamination in 30.7% (4/13) of cases. These patients did not show any clinical evidence of PJI recurrence after 15 months of follow-up. Because the half-life of bacterial rRNA is approximately a few days, the identification of bacteria rRNA on antibiotic PMMA spacers suggests that viable bacteria were present after conclusion of antibiotic therapy.

Interestingly, while E. coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae encode the pgaABCD operon responsible for PGA synthesis, Salmonella lacks it. The evolutionary force driving this difference remains to be determined. Here, we report that Salmonella lost the pgaABCD operon after the divergence of Salmonella and Citrobacter clades, and previous to the diversification of the currently sequenced Salmonella strains. Reconstitution of the PGA machinery endows Salmonella with the capacity to produce PGA in a cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) dependent manner. Outside the host, the PGA polysaccharide does not seem to provide any significant benefit to Salmonella: resistance against chlorine treatment, ultraviolet light irradiation, heavy metal stress and phage infection remained the same as in a strain producing cellulose, the main biofilm exopolysaccharide naturally produced by Salmonella. In contrast, PGA production proved to be deleterious to Salmonella survival inside the host, since it increased susceptibility to bile salts and oxidative stress, and hindered the capacity of S. Enteritidis to survive inside macrophages and to colonize extraintestinal organs, including the gallbladder. Altogether, our observations indicate that PGA is an antivirulence factor whose loss may have been a necessary event during Salmonella speciation to permit survival inside the host.","authors":[{"name":"Maite Echeverz"},{"name":"Begoña García"},{"name":"Amaia Sabalza"},{"name":"Jaione Valle"},{"name":"Toni Gabaldón"},{"name":"Cristina Solano"},{"name":"Iñigo Lasa"}],"keywords":[]},"article31":{"pmid":"28542565","title":"Promiscuous signaling by a regulatory system unique to the pandemic PMEN1 pneumococcal lineage.","date":"2019-02-02","abs":"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a leading cause of death and disease in children and elderly. Genetic variability among isolates from this species is high. These differences, often the product of gene loss or gene acquisition via horizontal gene transfer, can endow strains with new molecular pathways, diverse phenotypes, and ecological advantages. PMEN1 is a widespread and multidrug-resistant pneumococcal lineage. Using comparative genomics we have determined that a regulator-peptide signal transduction system, TprA2/PhrA2, was acquired by a PMEN1 ancestor and is encoded by the vast majority of strains in this lineage. We show that TprA2 is a negative regulator of a PMEN1-specific gene encoding a lanthionine-containing peptide (lcpA). The activity of TprA2 is modulated by its cognate peptide, PhrA2. Expression of phrA2 is density-dependent and its C-terminus relieves TprA2-mediated inhibition leading to expression of lcpA. In the pneumococcal mouse model with intranasal inoculation, TprA2 had no effect on nasopharyngeal colonization but was associated with decreased lung disease via its control of lcpA levels. Furthermore, the TprA2/PhrA2 system has integrated into the pneumococcal regulatory circuitry, as PhrA2 activates TprA/PhrA, a second regulator-peptide signal transduction system widespread among pneumococci. Extracellular PhrA2 can release TprA-mediated inhibition, activating expression of TprA-repressed genes in both PMEN1 cells as well as another pneumococcal lineage. Acquisition of TprA2/PhrA2 has provided PMEN1 isolates with a mechanism to promote commensalism over dissemination and control inter-strain gene regulation.","authors":[{"name":"Anagha Kadam"},{"name":"Rory A Eutsey"},{"name":"Jason Rosch"},{"name":"Xinyu Miao"},{"name":"Mark Longwell"},{"name":"Wenjie Xu"},{"name":"Carol A Woolford"},{"name":"Todd Hillman"},{"name":"Anfal Shakir Motib"},{"name":"Hasan Yesilkaya"},{"name":"Aaron P Mitchell"},{"name":"N Luisa Hiller"}],"keywords":[]},"article32":{"pmid":"28542534","title":"The carriage of interleukin-1B-31*C allele plus Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae increases the risk of recurrent tonsillitis in a Mexican population.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The aim of the present study was to estimate the relative contribution of immunogenetic and microbiological factors in the development of recurrent tonsillitis in a Mexican population.

To assess the immunogenetic component, DNA from peripheral blood was genotyped for the TNFA-308G/A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and for the IL1B -31C/T SNP. Normal microbiota, but no pathogens or potential pathogens, were identified from all control sample cultures. The most frequent pathogenic species detected in tonsils from cases were Staphylococcus aureus (48.6%, 67/138) and Haemophilus influenzae (31.9%, 44/138), which were found more frequently in patient samples than in samples from healthy volunteers (P < 0.0001).

We found that PP_4205 (MqsR) greatly inhibits cell growth in P. putida KT2440 and Escherichia coli, the antitoxin PP_4204 (MqsA) neutralizes the toxicity of the toxin MqsR, and the two genes encoding them are co-transcribed.

Disruption of the mqsA gene which induces mqsR expression increases persister cell formation 53-fold, while overexpressing mqsA which represses mqsR expression reduces persister cell formation 220-fold, suggesting an important role of MqsR in persistence in P. putida KT2440.

In the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, intracellular c-di-GMP levels are modulated by a concise set of three diguanylate cylases (DgcK, DgcP, DgcW) and one phosphodiesterase (PdeH). Two recent studies have reported the negative influence of the c-di-GMP receptor DgrA (PilZ domain protein) on swarming motility indicating a conserved role of this second messenger across the bacterial domain. However, it has been suggested that the degenerated GGDEF protein YdaK and the inactive EAL domain protein YkuI may also function as c-di-GMP receptors regulating potentially other processes than motility. Here we describe a novel c-di-GMP dependent signaling network in B. subtilis regulating the production of an unknown exopolysaccharide (EPS) that leads to strongly altered colony morphologies upon overproduction. The network consists of the c-di-GMP receptor YdaK and the c-di-GMP synthetase DgcK. Both proteins establish a spatially close signal-effector cluster at the membrane. The cytoplasmic DgcP synthetase can complement for DgcK only upon overproduction, while the third c-di-GMP synthetase, DgcW, of B. subtilis is not part of the signaling pathway. Removal of the regulatory EAL domain from DgcW reveals a distinct function in biofilm formation. Therefore, our study is compatible with the local pool signaling hypothesis, but shows that in case of the yda operon, this can easily be overcome by overproduction of non-cognate DGCs, indicating that global pools can also confer signals to regulatory circuits in a Gram-positive bacterium.","authors":[{"name":"Patricia Bedrunka"},{"name":"Peter L Graumann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"c-di-GMP signaling"},{"word":"exopolymeric substances"},{"word":"protein dynamics"},{"word":"signal transduction"}]},"article53":{"pmid":"28536291","title":"Evolution of Bacterial Frenemies.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Chronic polymicrobial infections are associated with increased virulence compared to monospecies infections.

Our objective was to test effects of increasing DOM concentrations from Eucalyptus grandis (one of the most cultivated tree species in the world) leachates on the metabolism (respiration, R; gross primary productivity, GPP) and extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) of freshwater biofilms. To test effects of DOM concentrations on freshwater biofilm functions, we incubated commercial cellulose sponges in a freshwater pond to allow biofilm colonization, and then exposed biofilms to five different concentrations of leaf-litter leachates of E. grandis for five days. To test if responses to DOM concentrations varied with colonization stage of biofilms, we measured treatment effects on biofilms colonizing standard substrates after one, two, three and four weeks of colonization. Increases in leachates concentrations enhanced biofilm heterotrophy, increasing R rates and decreasing GPP. Leachate concentrations did not affect biofilm EEAs, and changes in biofilm metabolism were not explained by treatment-induced changes in biofilm biomass or stoichiometry.

Aquatic plants (i.e., helophytes) can modify subsurface water flowpaths as well as assimilate nutrients and enhance microbial activity in the rhizosphere, yet their ability to increase DIN transformation and removal in WWTP-influenced streams is poorly understood. We examined the influence of helophytes on DIN removal along subsurface water flowpaths and how this was associated with DOC removal and labile C availability. To do so, we used a set of 12 flow-through flumes fed with water from a WWTP effluent. The flumes contained solely sediments or sediments with helophytes. Presence of helophytes in the flumes enhanced both DIN and DOC removal. Experimental addition of a labile C source into the flumes resulted in a high removal of the added C within the first meter of the flumes. Yet, no concomitant increases in DIN removal were observed. Moreover, results from laboratory assays showed significant increases in the potential denitrifying enzyme activity of sediment biofilms from the flumes when labile C was added; suggesting denitrification was limited by C quality. Together these results suggest that lack of DIN removal response to the labile C addition in flumes was likely because potential increases in denitrification by biofilms from sediments were counterbalanced by high rates of mineralization of dissolved organic matter. Our results highlight that helophytes can enhance DIN removal in streams receiving inputs from WWTP effluents; and thus, they can become a relevant bioremediation tool in WWTP-influenced streams.

However, what cue is sensed to notify bacteria that they are attached to the surface has not been known. Here, we show that mechanical shear acts as a cue for surface adhesion and activates cyclic-di-GMP signaling. The magnitude of the shear force, and thereby the corresponding activation of cyclic-di-GMP signaling, can be adjusted both by varying the strength of the adhesion that binds bacteria to the surface and by varying the rate of fluid flow over surface-bound bacteria.

We developed an approach to examine emergent behaviors that couples fluorescent cell tracking with data-driven models. A unique feature of this approach is the ability to identify cell behaviors affecting the observed aggregation dynamics without full knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms. The fluorescent cell tracking revealed large deviations in the behavior of individual cells. Our modeling method indicated that decreased cell motility inside the aggregates, a biased walk toward aggregate centroids, and alignment among neighboring cells in a radial direction to the nearest aggregate are behaviors that enhance aggregation dynamics. Our modeling method also revealed that aggregation is generally robust to perturbations in these behaviors and identified possible compensatory mechanisms.

Our results demonstrate that CLP-4 has strong antibacterial activity in vitro and is a potent bactericidal agent with low spontaneous resistance frequency. At a low concentration of 5 μg/ml, CLP-4 completely inhibited S. mutans UA159 biofilm formation, and at 50 μg/ml, it reduced the viability of established biofilms by >99.99%. We also assessed CLP-4's cytotoxicity and stability against proteolytic digestion. CLP-4 withstood trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion even after treatment for 24 h, and our toxicity studies showed that CLP-4 effective concentrations had negligible effects on hemolysis and the viability of human oral fibroblasts. In summary, our findings showed that CLP-4 is a potent antibacterial and antibiofilm agent with remarkable stability and low nonspecific cytotoxicity. Hence, CLP-4 is a promising novel antimicrobial peptide with potential for clinical application in the prevention and treatment of dental caries.","authors":[{"name":"Kyung R Min"},{"name":"Adriana Galvis"},{"name":"Brandon Williams"},{"name":"Ramanjaneyulu Rayala"},{"name":"Predrag Cudic"},{"name":"Dragana Ajdic"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"cyclic lipopeptide"},{"word":"dental biofilms"},{"word":"dental plaque"}]},"article67":{"pmid":"28533218","title":"Involvement of Two-Component Signaling on Bacterial Motility and Biofilm Development.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Two-component signaling is a specialized mechanism that bacteria use to respond to changes in their environment. Nonpathogenic strains of Escherichia coli K-12 harbor 30 histidine kinases and 32 response regulators, which form a network of regulation that integrates many other global regulators that do not follow the two-component signaling mechanism, as well as signals from central metabolism. The output of this network is a multitude of phenotypic changes in response to changes in the environment. Among these phenotypic changes, many two-component systems control motility and/or the formation of biofilm, sessile communities of bacteria that form on surfaces. Motility is the first reversible attachment phase of biofilm development, followed by a so-called swim or stick switch toward surface organelles that aid in the subsequent phases. In the mature biofilm, motility heterogeneity is generated by a combination of evolutionary and gene regulatory events.","authors":[{"name":"Birgit M Prüß"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CheA"},{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"OmpR"},{"word":"RcsB"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"fimbriae"},{"word":"flagella"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"two-component signaling"}]},"article68":{"pmid":"28532976","title":"Microbiological problems and biofilms associated with Mycobacterium chimaera in heater-cooler units used for cardiopulmonary bypass.","date":"2018-03-08","abs":"The role of heater-cooler units (HCUs) in the transmission of Mycobacterium chimaera during open heart surgery has been recognized since 2013.

In horses, biofilm formation in wounds has been studied to a very limited degree. The objective of this study was thus to investigate the occurrence of biofilm in equine experimental wounds healing by secondary intention. Tissue biopsies from non-contaminated, experimental excisional shoulder and limb wounds were obtained on day 1-2, day 7-10 and day 14-15 post-wounding. Limb wounds were either un-bandaged or bandaged to induce exuberant granulation tissue (EGT) formation and thereby impaired healing. Presence of biofilm in tissue biopsies was assessed by peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Bandaged limb wounds developed EGT and displayed delayed healing, while shoulder and un-bandaged limb wounds healed normally. Biofilm was detected in limb wounds only. At day 14-15 biofilm was significantly more prevalent in bandaged limb wounds than in un-bandaged limb wounds (P=0.003). Further, bandaged limb wounds had a statistically significant increase in biofilm burden from day 7-10 to day 14-15 (P=0.009). The finding that biofilm was most prevalent in bandaged limb wounds with EGT formation suggests that biofilm may be linked to delayed wound healing in horses, as has been observed in humans. The inability to clear bacteria could be related to hypoxia and low-grade inflammation in the EGT, but the interaction between biofilm forming bacteria and wound healing in horses needs further elucidation.","authors":[{"name":"E Jørgensen"},{"name":"L Bay"},{"name":"T Bjarnsholt"},{"name":"L Bundgaard"},{"name":"M A Sørensen"},{"name":"S Jacobsen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial aggregates"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Equine"},{"word":"Experimental wounds"},{"word":"PNA FISH"}]},"article70":{"pmid":"28532805","title":"Efficacy of disinfectants and detergents intended for a pig farm environment where Salmonella is present.","date":"2018-01-03","abs":"Disinfection is a useful component of disease control, although products and chemical groups vary in their activity against different pathogens.

A total of six P. fragi isolates were isolated from aerobically stored spoiled chicken.

Isolates 2 and 25, which readily form biofilms, exhibited improved stationary-phase growth in MAP compared to the control packaging. Changes in the surface properties, including reduced motility, increased aggregation and hydrophobicity, were also induced by MAP. The surface property results were then confirmed via scanning electron microscopy. In addition, significant differences were observed in cell phenotypic characterization between individual isolates tested, which indicated that the responses to MAP exposure were strain-dependent.

The effects of alkyl chain length and charge density and the antimicrobial mechanisms for chlorhexidine, nano-silver, quaternary ammonium methacrylates, and protein-repellent agents were discussed. Synergistic effects of contact-killing and protein-repellent properties were shown to yield the greatest biofilm-inhibition effects. The combination of antimicrobial, protein-repellent, and calcium phosphate nanoparticle remineralization was suggested to provide maximal anticaries effects. In addition, for use orally, cytotoxicity and biocompatibility were important considerations for the new bioactive materials. Furthermore, rather than kill all bacteria, it would be more desirable to modulate the oral biofilm compositions via bioactive resins to suppress cariogenic/pathogenic species and promote benign species. For widespread clinical use of the new antimicrobial and therapeutic materials, whether they would induce bacterial drug resistance needs to be determined, which requires further study. Nonetheless, the new generation of bioactive anticaries resins with therapeutic and biofilm acid-inhibiting properties has the potential to substantially benefit oral health.","authors":[{"name":"L Cheng"},{"name":"K Zhang"},{"name":"N Zhang"},{"name":"M A S Melo"},{"name":"M D Weir"},{"name":"X D Zhou"},{"name":"Y X Bai"},{"name":"M A Reynolds"},{"name":"H H K Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-caries"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"composites and adhesives"},{"word":"modulating biofilm compositions"},{"word":"remineralization"},{"word":"therapeutic"}]},"article80":{"pmid":"28530651","title":"Surface-attached molecules control Staphylococcus aureus quorum sensing and biofilm development.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Bacteria use a process called quorum sensing to communicate and orchestrate collective behaviours, including virulence factor secretion and biofilm formation.

High (>25 mM) versus low (≤5 mM) K+ concentrations in the growth medium affected conformational epitopes of cell surface-localized adhesin P1. At low K+, the expression of stress response elements gcrR and codY, cell-adhesion-associated genes such as spaP and metabolism-associated genes such as bglP was induced at stationary phase (P<0.05), suggesting that K+-mediated regulation is growth phase-dependent and stress-sensitive. Production of the newly discovered secretory protein encoded by SMU_63c was strongly dependent on the availability of K+ and growth phase. This protein is a newly discovered regulator of genetic competence and biofilm cell density. Thus, the influence of K+ on DNA transformation efficiency was also examined. Compared with 25 mM K+ concentration, the presence of low K+ reduced the transformation frequency by 100-fold. Genetic transformation was abolished in a strain lacking a Trk2 system under all K+ concentrations tested. Consistent with these findings, repression of competence-associated genes, comS and comX, was observed under low environmental K+ conditions and in the strain lacking Trk2.

Difficulties derive from biofilm formed on dead bone and eventual implants, with resistance against immunological defences and antimicrobial substances. Biofilm embedded bacteria require up to 1000 times the antibiotic concentration of planktonic bacteria for elimination. Systemic antibiotic treatment alone cannot provide the concentrations required and surgical intervention is always prerequisite for potentially providing a cure. A second issue is that osseous defects are almost always present after surgical debridement, and it is difficult to address their reconstruction. One option is to use bone grafts, either from the patient´s own body or from foreign donors (allografts). Grafts are usually unvascularized and are prone to colonization with bacteria. Loading of allografts with antibiotics may not only protect grafts from bacterial adhesion but, using appropriate processing methods, may also provide high local antibiotic concentrations that may eliminate remaining sessile pathogens. For efficient action as antibiotic carriers, the release of antibiotics should be above the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) for a prolonged period of time. Cleaning the bone from bone marrow opens a large reservoir for storage of antimicrobial substances that, after implantation, may be released to the surrounding in a sustained mode, possibly eliminating remaining biofilm remnants. Removal of bone marrow, leaving a pure matrix, provides increased safety and improved revascularization of the graft. Local provision of antibiotic concentrations above the MBEC may enable simultaneous internal fixation with osteosynthetic material and single stage exchange of infected endoprostheses, resulting in shorter hospital stays with reduced pain and faster rehabilitation of patients.","authors":[{"name":"Heinz Winkler"},{"name":"Peter Haiden"}],"keywords":[{"word":"allograft"},{"word":"antibiotic carrier"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"bone"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"one stage treatment"},{"word":"quality of life."},{"word":"reconstruction"}]},"article86":{"pmid":"28529860","title":"Use of Chlorhexidine Preparations in Total Joint Arthroplasty.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a serious complication after total joint arthroplasty (TJA).

Finally, we present our protocol for irrigation and debridement and exchange of modular components in total joint arthroplasty, incorporating hydrogen peroxide in combination with povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine.","authors":[{"name":"Min Lu"},{"name":"Erik Nathan Hansen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antiseptics"},{"word":"Complications."},{"word":"Hydrogen peroxide"},{"word":"Infection"},{"word":"Irrigation"}]},"article88":{"pmid":"28529857","title":"Local Antimicrobial Treatment in Orthopaedic Surgery.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The purpose of this special issue of Journal of Bone and Joint Infection is to provide orthopaedic surgeons with basic science explanations as to how these local antimicrobials work, clinical evidence that supports these local treatments, and the role of these local treatments against biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Antonia F Chen"},{"name":"Heinz Winkler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"local antimicrobial"},{"word":"orthopaedic surgery"}]},"article89":{"pmid":"28529855","title":"Calcium-Based, Antibiotic-Loaded Bone Substitute as an Implant Coating: A Pilot Clinical Study.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"N Logoluso"},{"name":"L Drago"},{"name":"E Gallazzi"},{"name":"D A George"},{"name":"I Morelli"},{"name":"C L Romanò"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Calcium sulphate"},{"word":"Coating"},{"word":"Hydroxyapatite."},{"word":"Peri-prosthetic infection"}]},"article90":{"pmid":"28529851","title":"Does an Antibiotic-Loaded Hydrogel Coating Reduce Early Post-Surgical Infection After Joint Arthroplasty?","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Carlo Luca Romanò"},{"name":"Kostantinos Malizos"},{"name":"Nicola Capuano"},{"name":"Riccardo Mezzoprete"},{"name":"Michele D'Arienzo"},{"name":"Catherine Van Der Straeten"},{"name":"Sara Scarponi"},{"name":"Lorenzo Drago"}],"keywords":[{"word":"infection"},{"word":"joint prosthesis"}]},"article91":{"pmid":"28529509","title":"A Novel ESAT-6 Secretion System-Secreted Protein EsxX of Community-Associated Staphylococcus aureus Lineage ST398 Contributes to Immune Evasion and Virulence.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The ESAT-6 secretion system (ESS) has been reported to contribute to the virulence and pathogenicity of several Staphylococcus aureus strains such as USA300 and Newman.

By comparing the ess locus of ST398 with the published S. aureus sequence in the NCBI database, we found one gene in the ess locus encoding a novel WXG superfamily protein that is highly conserved only in ST398. LC-MS/MS and Western blot analysis revealed that this protein is a novel secreted protein controlled by the ST398 ESS, and we named the protein EsxX. Although EsxX was not under the control of the accessory gene regulator like many other virulence factors and had no influence on several phenotypes of ST398, such as growth, hemolysis, and biofilm formation, it showed important impacts on immune evasion and virulence in ST398. An esxX deletion mutant led to significantly reduced resistance to neutrophil killing and decreased virulence in murine skin and blood infection models, indicating its essential contribution to the evasion of innate host defense and virulence to support the pathogenesis of ST398 infections.

It is well accepted, that osteoclastic alveolar bone loss is governed exclusively through secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that once degradation of collagen fibers by MMPs occurs, a drop of cellular strains cause immediate release of ATP from marginal gingival fibroblasts, cell deformation and influx of Ca+2. Increased extracellular ATP (eATP) by interacting with P2×7 purinoreceptors, present on fibroblasts and osteoblasts, induces generation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL) that further activates osteoclastic alveolar bone resorption and bone loss. In addition, increased eATP levels may amplify inflammation by promoting leukocyte recruitment and NALP3-inflammasome activation via P2×7. Then, the inflammatory cells secrete cytokines, interleukin IL-1, TNF and RANKL that further trigger alveolar bone resorption. Moreover, eATP can be secreted from periodontal bacteria that may further contribute to inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis. It seems therefore, that eATP is a key modulator that initiates the pathway of alveolar bone resorption and bone loss in patients with periodontal disease. In conclusion, we propose that strain release in gingival fibroblasts aligned on collagen fibers, due to activity of MMP, activates release of ATP that triggers the pathway of alveolar bone resorption in periodontitis.

Biofilm formation is induced by the presence of sucrose, which is a substrate for the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides but not in the presence of oligosaccharides. Nonetheless, in this study, we found that raffinose, which is an oligosaccharide with an intestinal regulatory function and antiallergic effect, induced biofilm formation by S. mutans in a mixed culture with sucrose, which was at concentrations less than those required to induce biofilm formation directly. We analyzed the possible mechanism behind the small requirement for sucrose for biofilm formation in the presence of raffinose. Our results suggested that sucrose contributed to an increase in bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and biofilm formation. Next, we examined how the effects of raffinose interacted with the effects of sucrose for biofilm formation. We showed that the presence of raffinose induced fructan synthesis by fructosyltransferase and aggregated extracellular DNA (eDNA, which is probably genomic DNA released from dead cells) into the biofilm. eDNA seemed to be important for biofilm formation, because the degradation of DNA by DNase I resulted in a significant reduction in biofilm formation. When assessing the role of fructan in biofilm formation, we found that fructan enhanced eDNA-dependent cell aggregation.

Two distinct R-tailocin populations differing in length were observed in UV-induced lysates of P. chlororaphis 30-84 via transmission electron microscopy. Mutants defective in the production of one or both R-tailocins demonstrated that the killing spectrum of each tailocin is limited to Pseudomonas species. The spectra of pseudomonads killed by the two R-tailocins differed, although a few Pseudomonas species were either killed by or insusceptible to both tailocins. Tailocin release was disrupted by deletion of the holin gene within the tailocin gene cluster, demonstrating that the lysis cassette is required for the release of both R-tailocins. The loss of functional tailocin production reduced the ability of P. chlororaphis 30-84 to compete with an R-tailocin-sensitive strain within biofilms and rhizosphere communities.

The bacteria associated with dental caries have potent abilities to produce organic acids from dietary carbohydrates and to grow and metabolize in acidic conditions. By contrast, many commensal bacteria produce ammonia through the arginine deiminase system (ADS), which moderates the pH of oral biofilms. Arginine metabolism by the ADS is a significant deterrent to the initiation and progression of dental caries. In this study, we observed how exogenously provided l-arginine affects the growth, the virulence properties, and the tolerance of environmental stresses of S. mutans Supplementation with 1.5% arginine (final concentration) had an inhibitory effect on the growth of S. mutans in complex and chemically defined media, particularly when cells were exposed to acid or oxidative stress. The genes encoding virulence factors required for attachment/accumulation (gtfB and spaP), bacteriocins (nlmA, nlmB, nlmD, and cipB), and the sigma factor required for competence development (comX) were downregulated during growth with 1.5% arginine. Deep sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) comparing the transcriptomes of S. mutans growing in chemically defined media with and without 1.5% arginine revealed differential expression of genes encoding ATP-binding cassette transporters, metal transporters, and constituents required for survival, metabolism, and biofilm formation.

The objective of this study was to generate mixed species anaerobic bacterial biofilms composed of two opportunistic pathogens, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Porphyromonas levii, and evaluate neutrophil responses to extracellular fractions from both biofilms and planktonic cell co-cultures of the same bacteria. Purified bovine neutrophils exposed to culture supernatants from mixed species planktonic bacteria showed elevated oxidative activity compared to neutrophils exposed to biofilms composed of the same bacteria. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide plays a significant role in the stimulation of neutrophils; biofilms produced substantially more lipopolysaccharide than planktonic bacteria under these experimental conditions. Removal of lipopolysaccharide significantly reduced neutrophil oxidative response to culture supernatants of planktonic bacteria. Oxidative responses to LPS-removed biofilm supernatants and LPS-removed planktonic cell supernatants were similar. The limited neutrophil response to biofilm bacteria observed in this study supports the reduced ability of the innate immune system to eradicate biofilm-associated infections.

C. albicans and C. krusei were the most pathogenic species, whereas C. dubliniensis infection showed the lowest mortality. C. albicans was the only species with phospholipase activity, was the greatest producer of aspartyl proteinase and had a higher hemolytic activity. C. albicans and C. krusei caused higher mortality than the rest of the Candida species studied in the C. elegans model of candidiasis.","authors":[{"name":"Marcelo Ortega-Riveros"},{"name":"Iker De-la-Pinta"},{"name":"Cristina Marcos-Arias"},{"name":"Guillermo Ezpeleta"},{"name":"Guillermo Quindós"},{"name":"Elena Eraso"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"Non-conventional model"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article113":{"pmid":"28522724","title":"Draft Genome Sequence of Staphylococcus epidermidis Clinical Strain GOI1153754-03-14 Isolated from an Infected Knee Prosthesis.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"We announce the draft genome sequence of Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical strain GOI1153754-03-14, isolated from an infected orthopedic prosthesis.

To investigate this topic, the bacterium Deinococcus geothermalis was chosen as a model organism due to its tolerance toward desiccation and radiation. Biofilms cultivated on membranes and, for comparison, planktonically grown cells deposited on membranes were air-dried and exposed to individual stressors that included prolonged desiccation, extreme temperatures, vacuum, simulated martian atmosphere, and UV irradiation, and they were exposed to combinations of stressors that simulate space (desiccation + vacuum + UV) or martian (desiccation + Mars atmosphere + UV) conditions.

Lungs of an individual with cystic fibrosis are an exemplary case where their mucus-plugged bronchioles create a favorable habitat for microbial colonization.

Like any microbial community, the chemical conditions of their habitat have a significant impact on the community structure and dynamics. For example, different microorganisms thrive in differing levels of oxygen or other solute concentrations. This is also true in the CF lung, where oxygen concentrations are believed to drive community physiology and structure. The methods described here are designed to mimic the lung environment and grow pathogens in a manner more similar to that from which they cause disease. Manipulation of the chemical surroundings of these microbes is then used to study how the chemistry of lung infections governs its microbial ecology. The method, called the WinCF system, is based on artificial sputum medium and narrow capillary tubes meant to provide an oxygen gradient similar to that which exists in mucus-plugged bronchioles. Manipulating chemical conditions, such as the media pH of the sputum or antibiotics pressure, allows for visualization of the microbiological differences in those samples using colored indicators, watching for gas or biofilm production, or extracting and sequencing the nucleic acid contents of each sample.","authors":[{"name":"William J Comstock"},{"name":"Edwin Huh"},{"name":"Reiley Weekes"},{"name":"Connor Watson"},{"name":"Tianyang Xu"},{"name":"Pieter C Dorrestein"},{"name":"Robert A Quinn"}],"keywords":[]},"article123":{"pmid":"28517974","title":"Impact of Docosahexaenoic Acid Therapy on Subgingival Plaque Microbiota.","date":"2019-02-12","abs":"Oral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) + aspirin therapy has been shown to reduce periodontal probing depth (PD) and local inflammatory mediators in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) among patients with untreated chronic periodontal disease.

Fungal walls are composed of matrix components that are embedded and linked to scaffolds of fibrous load-bearing polysaccharides. Most of the major cell wall components of fungal pathogens are not represented in humans, other mammals, or plants, and therefore the immune systems of animals and plants have evolved to recognize many of the conserved elements of fungal walls. For similar reasons the enzymes that assemble fungal cell wall components are excellent targets for antifungal chemotherapies and fungicides. However, for fungal pathogens, the cell wall is often disguised since key signature molecules for immune recognition are sometimes masked by immunologically inert molecules. Cell wall damage leads to the activation of sophisticated fail-safe mechanisms that shore up and repair walls to avoid catastrophic breaching of the integrity of the surface. The frontiers of research on fungal cell walls are moving from a descriptive phase defining the underlying genes and component parts of fungal walls to more dynamic analyses of how the various components are assembled, cross-linked, and modified in response to environmental signals. This review therefore discusses recent advances in research investigating the composition, synthesis, and regulation of cell walls and how the cell wall is targeted by immune recognition systems and the design of antifungal diagnostics and therapeutics.","authors":[{"name":"Neil A R Gow"},{"name":"Jean-Paul Latge"},{"name":"Carol A Munro"}],"keywords":[]},"article139":{"pmid":"28513143","title":"Interactive Effects of Corrosion, Copper, and Chloramines on Legionella and Mycobacteria in Hot Water Plumbing.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Complexities associated with drinking water plumbing systems can result in undesirable interactions among plumbing components that undermine engineering controls for opportunistic pathogens (OPs).

The virulence attributes of Candida species such as their acidogenicity and aciduric nature, the ability to develop profuse biofilms, ferment and assimilate dietary sugars, and produce collagenolytic proteinases are all indicative of their latent cariogenic potential. Based on the above, oral candidal counts have been used by some as a caries risk indicator.

In this review, we critically examine the varying roles of Candida, and traditionally accepted cariogens such as the mutans group of streptococci in the pathobiology of dental caries.

Bistable expression of these genes is due to their control by RlrA, a positive regulator subject to control by a positive-feedback loop. The type 1 pilus genes are also thought to be negatively regulated by a large number of repressors. Here we show that expression of the type 1 pilus genes is thermosensitive and switched off at growth temperatures below 31°C. We also report that the on expression state of the type 1 pilus genes is highly stable, a phenomenon which we show likely contributed to the erroneous identification of many proteins as negative regulators of these genes. Finally, we exploited the effect of low temperature on pilus gene expression to help identify SP_1523, an Snf2-type protein, as a novel negative regulator of the pilus genes. Our findings establish that the type 1 pilus genes are thermoregulated and are repressed by a member of the Snf2 protein family. They also refute the notion that these genes are controlled by 8 previously described negative regulators.","authors":[{"name":"Alan Basset"},{"name":"Muriel Herd"},{"name":"Raecliffe Daly"},{"name":"Simon L Dove"},{"name":"Richard Malley"}],"keywords":[{"word":"coagulase-negative staphylococcal regulators"},{"word":"gene expression"},{"word":"pilus"},{"word":"pneumococcus"},{"word":"thermosensitivity"}]},"article163":{"pmid":"28507110","title":"Controlled Release of Plectasin NZ2114 from a Hybrid Silicone-Hydrogel Material for Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen in catheter-related infections.

However, given that P. aeruginosa, particularly in its biofilm mode of growth, is thought to grow slowly in vivo, the inefficient use of mucin glycoproteins may be relevant to its persistence within the CF airways. To this end, we used whole-genome fitness analysis, combining transposon mutagenesis with high-throughput sequencing, to identify genetic determinants required for P. aeruginosa growth using intact purified mucins as a sole carbon source. Our analysis reveals a biphasic growth phenotype, during which the glyoxylate pathway and amino acid biosynthetic machinery are required for mucin utilization. Secondary analyses confirmed the simultaneous liberation and consumption of acetate during mucin degradation and revealed a central role for the extracellular proteases LasB and AprA.

Plaque samples from caries-free tooth surfaces (PF) and from enamel carious lesions (PE) and dentin carious lesions (PD) were collected. 16S community profiles were obtained by HOMINGS, and 408 bacterial species and 84 genus probes were assigned. Plaque bacterial communities showed temporal stability, as there was no significant difference in beta diversity values between the baseline and 12-month samples. Irrespective of collection time points, the microbiomes of healthy tooth surfaces differed substantially from those found during caries activity. All pairwise comparisons of beta diversity values between groups were significantly different (P < 0.05), except for comparisons between the CA-PF, CAE-PE, and CA-PE groups. Streptococcus genus probe 4 and Neisseria genus probe 2 were the most frequently detected taxa across the plaque groups, followed by Streptococcus sanguinis, which was highly abundant in CF-PF.

A total of 116 E. coli strains were tested for biofilm formation using the crystal violet microplate technique. 58.6% of the strains did not produce biofilm, while 16.4%, 18.1% and 6.8% formed weak, moderate and strong biofilms, respectively. No correlation was found between the ability to form biofilms and the presence of IBCs. Biofilm formation was significantly associated with pili P codifying genes, whereas other virulence factors were not statistically associated. Antibiotics, including ampicillin, cephalothin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin, were evaluated at different concentrations after 48 h of biofilm formation. Except ampicillin, the other antibiotics tested induced a significant reduction of biofilm biomass. In the case of recurrent UTIs potentially associated with the presence of biofilm, the use of third-generation cephalosporin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides could be recommended.

The range sizes of bacterial taxa were strongly correlated with latitude, decreasing closer to the equator, which coincided with a greater than fivefold increase in bacterial taxonomic richness. The relative richness and range size of bacteria were associated with spatially correlated variation in temperature and rainfall.

We analysed genomic data from ∼500 taxa detected in this study, for which data were available and found that bacterial communities at cooler latitudes also tended to possess greater potential metabolic potential.

In addition, its persistence can be influenced by preadaptation before the introduction into the environment. In order to study how preadaptation changes the survival of Salmonella in soil and therefore its potential to colonize the phytosphere, we developed a new medium based on lettuce material [lettuce medium (LM)]. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 was used as a model for Salmonella in this study. LT2 was inoculated into soil microcosms after pregrowth in Luria Bertani (LB) broth or in LM. Survival of LT2 in soil was monitored over 56 days by plate counts and quantification of the Typhimurium-specific gene STM4497 using qPCR in total community DNA for which primers and TaqMan probe were designed in this study. Significantly enhanced persistence was observed for LT2 pregrown in LM compared to LT2 pregrown in LB, indicating a preadaptation effect. Surprisingly, no improved survival could be observed for S. Typhimurium strain 14028s and S. enterica serovar Senftenberg after pregrowth on LM. This indicates a high strain specificity of preadaptation. Results from previous studies suggested that biofilm formation could enhance the survival of human pathogens in various environments and might contribute to enhanced survival on plants. In vitro biofilm assays with several Salmonella strains revealed a strain-specific effect of LM on the biofilm formation. While LM significantly improved the biofilm formation of S. Senftenberg, the biofilm formation of LT2 was better in LB. This indicates that the better survival of LM-pregrown LT2 in soil was not linked to an improved ability to form biofilms but was likely due to other factors.

Therefore, C. metallidurans CH34 cells were suspended in mineral water supplemented with or without crushed basalt and send for 3 months on board the Russian FOTON-M4 capsule. Long-term storage had a significant impact on cell physiology and energy status (by flow cytometry analysis, plate count and intracellular ATP measurements) as 60% of cells stored on ground lost their cell membrane potential, only 17% were still active, average ATP levels per cell were significantly lower and cultivability dropped to 1%. The cells stored in the presence of basalt and exposed to space flight conditions during storage however showed less dramatic changes in physiology, with only 16% of the cells lost their cell membrane potential and 24% were still active, leading to a higher cultivability (50%) and indicating a general positive effect of basalt and space flight on survival. Microbe-mineral interactions and biofilm formation was altered by spaceflight as less biofilm was formed on the basalt during flight conditions.

Filamentous growth is of particular interest because it is required for biofilm formation and for pathogenesis. Environmentally induced filamentous growth is associated with expression of filamentation-associated genes, and both filamentous growth and associated gene expression depend upon several well-characterized transcription factors. Surprisingly, strains with reduced expression of many essential genes display filamentous growth under non-inducing conditions-those in which the wild type grows as yeast. We found recently that diminished expression of several essential protein kinase genes leads to both filamentous cell morphology and filamentation-associated gene expression under non-inducing conditions. Reduced expression of the essential protein kinase gene CAK1 promoted filamentation-associated gene expression and biofilm formation in strains that lacked key transcriptional activators of these processes, thus indicating that CAK1 expression is critical for both environmental and genetic control of filamentation. In this study, we extend our genetic interaction analysis to a second essential protein kinase gene, KIN28. Reduced expression of KIN28 also permits filamentation-associated gene expression, though not biofilm formation, in the absence of several key transcriptional activators. Our results argue that impairment of several essential cellular processes can alter the regulatory requirements for filamentation-associated gene expression. Our results also indicate that levels of filamentation-associated gene expression are not fully predictive of biofilm formation ability.","authors":[{"name":"C A Woolford"},{"name":"K Lagree"},{"name":"T Aleynikov"},{"name":"A P Mitchell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"EPI-induced filamentation"},{"word":"Gene expression"},{"word":"Mutant strains"},{"word":"Protein kinases"}]},"article185":{"pmid":"28500705","title":"Integration of Temperature and Blue-Light Sensing in Acinetobacter baumannii Through the BlsA Sensor.","date":"2018-10-24","abs":"BlsA is a BLUF photoreceptor present in Acinetobacter baumannii, responsible for modulation of motility, biofilm formation and virulence by light.

Indeed, we show that blsA expression is reduced at 37°C, which correlates with negligible photoreceptor levels in the cells, likely accounting for absence of photoregulation at this temperature. Another point of control occurs on the functionality of the BlsA photocycle itself at different temperatures, which occurs with an average quantum yield of photoactivation of the signaling state of 0.20 ± 0.03 at 15°C < T < 25°C, but is practically inoperative at T > 30°C, as a result of conformational changes produced in the nanocavity of FAD.

Here we describe the deamidation of CsgA, the major protein subunit of curli, which are important proteinaceous components of biofilms. CsgA has a high content of Asn and Gln, a feature seen in a few proteins that self-aggregate. We have implemented an approach to monitor deamidation rapidly by following the globally centroid mass shift, providing guidance for studies at the residue level. From the global mass measurement, we identified, using LC-MS/MS, extensive deamidation of several Asn residues and discovered three Asn-Gly sites to be the hottest spots for deamidation. The fibrillization of deamidated CsgA was measured using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), and a previously reported hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) platform. Deamidated proteins exhibit a longer lag phase and lower final ThT fluorescence, strongly suggesting slower and less amyloid fibril formation. CD spectra show that extensively deamidated CsgA remains unstructured and loses its ability to form amyloids. Mass-spectrometry-based HDX also shows that deamidated CsgA aggregates more slowly than wild-type CsgA. Taken together, the results show that deamidation of CsgA slows its fibrillization and disrupts its function, suggesting an opportunity to modulate CsgA fibrillization and affect curli and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Hanliu Wang"},{"name":"Qin Shu"},{"name":"Carl Frieden"},{"name":"Michael L Gross"}],"keywords":[]},"article197":{"pmid":"28497654","title":"Oxidative Stickland reactions in an obligate aerobic organism - amino acid catabolism in the Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus.","date":"2019-03-29","abs":"The thermoacidophilic Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is a model organism for archaeal adaptation to extreme environments and renowned for its ability to degrade a broad variety of substrates.

Isolates displayed a smooth biofilm-like growth in liquid medium and formed small (0.5-1 mm) pinpoint circular colonies on agar roll tubes. Both endogenous and exogenous sporangia were observed with variable shapes and sizes. Zoospores were mainly spherical, with diameters ranging between 3.8 and 12.5 µm, and mostly a single flagellum. All strains exhibited similar substrate utilization patterns and comparable cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities. Similar ITS1 sequences falling within the same distinctive clade were found on GenBank, with all environmental samples obtained from diverse ruminant and pseudoruminant hosts from three continents, but not from any hindgut-fermenting hosts. Given the high level of sequence divergence between our strains and closest cultured representatives and their distinct microscopic/macroscopic features, we propose a new genus, Pecoramyces, from the name of the taxonomic infraorder Pecora (horned ruminants or higher ruminants; derived from the Latin word for horned livestock), and a new species, P. ruminantium (since occurrence seems to be specific to ruminant/pseudoruminant foregut, but not hindgut-fermenting mammals).","authors":[{"name":"Radwa A Hanafy"},{"name":"Mostafa S Elshahed"},{"name":"Audra S Liggenstoffer"},{"name":"Gareth W Griffith"},{"name":"Noha H Youssef"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anaerobic gut fungi"},{"word":"Pecoramyces ruminantium"},{"word":"novel genus"}]},"article207":{"pmid":"28494209","title":"Antibiotic resistance, virulence factors and biofilm formation ability in Escherichia coli strains isolated from chicken meat and wildlife in the Czech Republic.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Attachment of pathogenic bacteria to food contact surfaces and the subsequent biofilm formation represent a serious threat for the food industry, since these bacteria are more resistant to antimicrobials or possess more virulence factors. The main aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between antibiotic resistance against 13 antibiotics, distribution of 10 virulence factors and biofilm formation in 105 Escherichia coli strains according to their origin. The high prevalence of antibiotic resistance that we have found in wildlife isolates could be acquired by horizontal transfer of resistance genes from human or domestic or farm animals. Consequently, these commensal bacteria might serve as indicator of antimicrobial usage for human and veterinary purposes in the Czech Republic. Further, 46 out of 66 resistant isolates (70%) were able to form biofilm and we found out statistically significant correlation between prevalence of antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation ability. The highest prevalence of antibiotic resistance was observed in weak biofilm producers. Biofilm formation was not statistically associated with any virulence determinant. However, we confirmed the correlation between prevalence of virulence factors and host origin. Chicken isolates possessed more virulence factors (66%), than isolates from wildlife (37%). We can conclude that the potential spread of antibiotic resistance pattern via the food chain is of high concern for public health.

Because biofilms are highly resistant to antifungals, new pharmacological strategies are needed. Aspirin and nitric oxide-donor molecules have both shown antibiofilm effects on C. albicans, making them promising candidates for treatment. In this study, we evaluated the antifungal/antibiofilm effect of a nitric-oxide releasing aspirin (NO-ASA) on C. albicans isolates from denture stomatitis patients in vitro. Disk diffusion assays showed that while NO-ASA had no antifungal effect, the drug potentiated fluconazole inhibition zone diameters, increasing the effect of fluconazole by 20-30% (p<0.05). The effect of NO-ASA on the morphogenesis of C. albicans was evaluated using light microscopy after inducing hyphae formation. For all clinical strains assayed, 125 μM NO-ASA significantly decreased the number of filamentous cells present (p<0.01). Adhesion to abiotic surfaces, a critical event for biofilm formation, was evaluated in 96-well polystyrene plates using crystal violet assay; 125 μM NO-ASA significantly inhibited adhesion. Biofilms were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantified using XTT reduction assay. NO-ASA decreased biofilm formation (IC50 ranging from 300 μM to 700 μM), consistent with SEM findings of altered biofilm microarchitecture. PGE2 and carboxy-PTIO (an NO scavenger) both blocked the antibiofilm effects of NO-ASA, suggesting that the efficacy of NO-ASA may be associated with both inhibition of PGE2 synthesis and release of NO.

As such, it is of great benefit to NO researchers to be able to sensitively detect intracellular NO and stable reactive nitrogen species (RNS) derived from NO. To this end, a protocol for fluorescent detection of intracellular NO/RNS in biofilm cultures of the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus has been optimized using the commercially-available cell-permeable fluorescent stain 4-Amino-5-Methylamino-2', 7'-Difluorofluorescein Diacetate (DAF-FM diacetate). This compound diffuses into cells and intracellular cleavage by esterase enzymes liberates weakly-fluorescent DAF-FM, which reacts with NO or other specific RNS to become highly fluorescent (Kojima et al., 1999). Although quantification of fluorescence is performed using a fluorescent plate reader, it is envisioned that this protocol could be adapted for intracellular NO/RNS imaging of S. aureus biofilms by confocal microscopy. Likewise, this technique could be optimized for the detection of intracellular NO/RNS in other growth conditions (i.e., planktonic cultures) and/or in other bacteria/archaea.","authors":[{"name":"April M Lewis"},{"name":"Silvia S Matzdorf"},{"name":"Kelly C Rice"}],"keywords":[]},"article216":{"pmid":"28491136","title":"Applications of microalgal biofilms for wastewater treatment and bioenergy production.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Microalgae have shown clear advantages for the production of biofuels compared with energy crops.

The findings of this study suggest that friedelane-based pentacyclic triterpenoids-especially dihydrocelastrol and dihydrocelastryl diacetate-have the potential to be candidates both for use in controlling biofilm-related infections and for use as important components of anti-virulence strategies for fighting against MRSA infection.","authors":[{"name":"Seung-Gyun Woo"},{"name":"So-Min Lee"},{"name":"So-Yeon Lee"},{"name":"Kyoung-Hee Lim"},{"name":"Eun-Ju Ha"},{"name":"Sa-Hyun Kim"},{"name":"Yong-Bin Eom"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-biofilm activity"},{"word":"Anti-virulence activity"},{"word":"Dihydrocelastrol"},{"word":"Dihydrocelastryl diacetate"},{"word":"Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)"}]},"article227":{"pmid":"28487993","title":"Acinetobacter baumannii quorum-sensing signalling molecule induces the expression of drug-resistance genes.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Quorum-sensing signalling molecules such as N‑acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) enable certain Gram‑negative bacteria to respond to environmental changes through behaviours, such as biofilm formation and flagellar movement.

Antibiotic sensitivity was assessed in an AHL‑deficient AbS mutant (AbS‑M), and the expression of drug-resistance genes in the presence of meropenem in AbS, AbS‑M and AbS‑M treated with the AHL N-3-hydroxy-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone (N‑3‑OH‑C12‑HSL). AbS‑M was more sensitive to meropenem and piperacillin than wild‑type AbS, but resistance was restored by supplementation with N‑3‑OH‑C12‑HSL. In addition, meropenem‑treated AbS‑M expressed lower levels of the drug‑resistance genes oxacillinase 51, AmpC, AdeA and AdeB; treatment with N‑3‑OH‑C12‑HSL also restored the expression of these genes.

Mastitis is the primary cause for the use of antibiotics in dairy farms but therapeutic failure is often observed. One of the reasons for the lack of effectiveness of antibiotic therapy despite the observed susceptibility of bacterial isolates in vitro are bacterial biofilms. In this study, we used chitosan of well-defined molecular weight (0.4-0.6, 1.3, 2.6 and 4.0 kDa) and investigated their antibiofilm and antibacterial activities in in vitro and in vivo models related to S. aureus IMIs. A chitosan of at least 6 units of glucosamine was necessary for maximum antibacterial activity. The 2.6 and 4.0 kDa forms were able to prevent biofilm production by the biofilm hyperproducer strain S. aureus 2117 and a bovine MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus). The intramammary administration of the 2.6 kDa chitosan showed no adverse effects in mice or in cows, as opposed to the slight inflammatory effect observed in mammary glands with the 4.0 kDa derivative. The 2.6 kDa chitosan killed bacteria embedded in pre-established biofilms in a dose-dependent manner with a >3 log10 reduction in CFU at 4 mg/ml. Also, the 2.6 kDa chitosan could prevent the persistence of the internalized MRSA into the mammary epithelial cell line MAC-T. An in vitro checkerboard assay showed that the 2.6 kDa chitosan produced a synergy with the macrolide class of antibiotics (e.g., tilmicosin) and reduced the MIC of both molecules by 2-8 times. Finally, the intramammary administration of the 2.6 kDa chitosan alone (P<0.01) or in combination with tilmicosin (P<0.0001) reduced the colonization of mammary glands in a murine IMI model. Our results suggest that the use of chitosan alone or in combination with a low dose of a macrolide could help reduce antibiotic use in dairy farms.","authors":[{"name":"Abdelhamid Asli"},{"name":"Eric Brouillette"},{"name":"Céline Ster"},{"name":"Mariana Gabriela Ghinet"},{"name":"Ryszard Brzezinski"},{"name":"Pierre Lacasse"},{"name":"Mario Jacques"},{"name":"François Malouin"}],"keywords":[]},"article234":{"pmid":"28486355","title":"Air-Abrasive Disinfection of Implant Surfaces in a Simulated Model of Periimplantitis.","date":"2018-05-02","abs":"This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the ability of air-powder abrasion to decontaminate dental implants.","authors":[{"name":"David George Quintero"},{"name":"Robert Bonnie Taylor"},{"name":"Matthew Braden Miller"},{"name":"Keith Roshanali Merchant"},{"name":"Scott Anthony Pasieta"}],"keywords":[]},"article235":{"pmid":"28486080","title":"Arginine Improves pH Homeostasis via Metabolism and Microbiome Modulation.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Dental caries can be described as a dysbiosis of the oral microbial community, in which acidogenic, aciduric, and acid-adapted bacterial species promote a pathogenic environment, leading to demineralization. Alkali generation by oral microbes, specifically via arginine catabolic pathways, is an essential factor in maintaining plaque pH homeostasis. There is evidence that the use of arginine in dentifrices helps protect against caries. The aim of the current study was to investigate the mechanistic and ecological effect of arginine treatment on the oral microbiome and its regulation of pH dynamics, using an in vitro multispecies oral biofilm model that was previously shown to be highly reflective of the in vivo oral microbiome. Pooled saliva from 6 healthy subjects was used to generate overnight biofilms, reflecting early stages of biofilm maturation. First, we investigated the uptake of arginine by the cells of the biofilm as well as the metabolites generated. We next explored the effect of arginine on pH dynamics by pretreating biofilms with 75 mM arginine, followed by the addition of sucrose (15 mM) after 0, 6, 20, or 48 h. pH was measured at each time point and biofilms were collected for 16S sequencing and targeted arginine quantification, and supernatants were prepared for metabolomic analysis. Treatment with only sucrose led to a sustained pH drop from 7 to 4.5, while biofilms treated with sucrose after 6, 20, or 48 h of preincubation with arginine exhibited a recovery to higher pH. Arginine was detected within the cells of the biofilms, indicating active uptake, and arginine catabolites citrulline, ornithine, and putrescine were detected in supernatants, indicating active metabolism. Sequencing analysis revealed a shift in the microbial community structure in arginine-treated biofilms as well as increased species diversity. Overall, we show that arginine improved pH homeostasis through a remodeling of the oral microbial community.","authors":[{"name":"M Agnello"},{"name":"L Cen"},{"name":"N C Tran"},{"name":"W Shi"},{"name":"J S McLean"},{"name":"X He"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"metabolomics"},{"word":"microbiota"},{"word":"oral cavity"}]},"article236":{"pmid":"28486078","title":"Characterization of Clinically Isolated Antibiotic-Resistant Salmonella Typhimurium Exposed to Subinhibitory Concentrations of Ceftriaxone and Ciprofloxacin.","date":"2018-07-11","abs":"This study was designed mainly to assess the phenotypic properties of clinically isolated Salmonella Typhimurium exposed to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin.

Evidence suggests dormancy consists of a continuum of interrelated states, including viable but nonculturable (VBNC) and persistence states. VBNC and persistence contribute to antibiotic tolerance, reemergence from latent infections, and even quorum sensing and biofilm formation. Previous studies indicate that the protein mechanisms regulating persistence and VBNC states are not well understood. We have queried the VBNC state of Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665 (MI-2665) by quantitative proteomics combining gel electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry to elucidate some of these mechanisms. MI-2665 is a nonpathogenic actinobacterium containing a small (2.5-Mb), high-GC-content genome which exhibits a well-defined VBNC state induced by nutrient deprivation. The MI-2665 VBNC state demonstrated a loss of protein diversity accompanied by increased levels of 18 proteins that are conserved across actinobacteria, 14 of which have not been previously identified in VNBC. These proteins implicate an anaplerotic strategy in the transition to VBNC, including changes in the glyoxylate shunt, redox and amino acid metabolism, and ribosomal regulatory processes. Our data suggest that MI-2665 is a viable model for dissecting the protein mechanisms underlying the VBNC stress response and provide the first protein-level signature of this state.

Monolaurin-coated Kirschner wires (K-wires) showed excellent antibacterial properties against three different bacterial strains, i.e., methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Staphylococcus epidermidis Approximately 6.0-log reductions of both planktonic and adherent bacteria were achieved using monolaurin-coated K-wires, but monolaurin-coated K-wires did not show any observable cytotoxicity with mouse osteoblast cell cultures. Overall, monolaurin-coated K-wires could be promising as potent antimicrobial materials for orthopedic surgery.","authors":[{"name":"Dmitry Gil"},{"name":"Sergey Shuvaev"},{"name":"Anastasia Frank-Kamenetskii"},{"name":"Vladimir Reukov"},{"name":"Christopher Gross"},{"name":"Alexey Vertegel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial coating"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"external fixators"},{"word":"monolaurin"},{"word":"orthopedic implants"}]},"article250":{"pmid":"28483600","title":"Phenotypic and genotypic study of biofilm formation in Enterococci isolated from urinary tract infections.","date":"2018-01-08","abs":"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent types of nosocomial and community acquired infections in humans.

Gingival fibroblasts can play an important role in periimplantitis because they are the promoters of the inflammatory process and eventual tissue homeostasis and destruction. Moreover, the related inflammatory state is commonly driven also to counteract bacteria implants colonization. In the present research, a new technology based on mechanically produced nanogrooves (0.1-0.2μm) and keratin nanofibers deposited by electrospinning has been proposed in order to obtain titanium surfaces able to drive gingival fibroblasts alignment and proliferation without increasing bacterial adhesion. The prepared surfaces have been characterized for their morphology (FESEM), chemical composition (FTIR, XPS), surface charge (zeta potential) and wettability (contact angle). Afterwards, their performances in terms of cells (human primary gingival fibroblasts) and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) adhesion were compared to mirror-like polished titanium surfaces. Results revealed that gingival fibroblasts viability was not negatively affected by the applied surface roughness or by keratin nanofibers. On the opposite, cells adhesion and spread were strongly influenced by surface roughness revealing a significant cell orientation along the produced nanogrooves. However, the keratin influence was clearly predominant with respect to surface topography, thus leading to increased cells proliferation on the surfaces with nanofibers, disregarding the presence of the surfaces grooves. Moreover, nor nanogrooves nor keratin nanofibers increase bacterial biofilm adhesion in comparison with mirror polished surfaces. Thus, the present research represents a promising innovative strategy and technology for a surface modification finalized to match the main requirements for transmucosal dental implants.","authors":[{"name":"S Ferraris"},{"name":"F Truffa Giachet"},{"name":"M Miola"},{"name":"E Bertone"},{"name":"A Varesano"},{"name":"C Vineis"},{"name":"A Cochis"},{"name":"R Sorrentino"},{"name":"L Rimondini"},{"name":"S Spriano"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial adhesion"},{"word":"Dental implant collar"},{"word":"Fibroblast alignment"},{"word":"Keratin nanofibers"},{"word":"Nanogrooves"},{"word":"Titanium"}]},"article259":{"pmid":"28482286","title":"A new biofilm based microalgal cultivation approach on shifting sand surface for desert cyanobacterium Microcoleus vaginatus.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Biofilm based microalgal cultivation has recently received great attention because of its low water requirement and harvesting cost.

Under host-permissive conditions these organisms can form hypervirulent mucosal biofilms. C. albicans biofilm formation is controlled by 6 master transcriptional regulators: Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Tec1, Ndt80, and Rob1. The objective of this work was to test whether any of these regulators play a role in cross-kingdom interactions between C. albicans and S. oralis in oral mucosal biofilms, and identify downstream target gene(s) that promote these interactions. Organotypic mucosal constructs and a mouse model of oropharyngeal infection were used to analyze mucosal biofilm growth and fungal gene expression. By screening 6 C. albicans transcription regulator reporter strains we discovered that EFG1 was strongly activated by interaction with S. oralis in late biofilm growth stages. EFG1 gene expression was increased in polymicrobial biofilms on abiotic surfaces, mucosal constructs and tongue tissues of mice infected with both organisms. EFG1 was required for robust Candida-streptococcal biofilm growth in organotypic constructs and mouse oral tissues. S. oralis stimulated C. albicans ALS1 gene expression in an EFG1-dependent manner, and Als1 was identified as a downstream effector of the Efg1 pathway which promoted C. albicans-S. oralis coaggregation interactions in mixed biofilms. We conclude that S. oralis induces an increase in EFG1 expression in C. albicans in late biofilm stages. This in turn increases expression of ALS1, which promotes coaggregation interactions and mucosal biofilm growth.

Bacteria within a biofilm may be exposed to subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of antibiotics because of an agent's limited penetration into the biofilm core. Here, we investigated the effect of sub-MICs of tigecycline and ciprofloxacin on the expression of biofilm-associated genes, i.e. icaA, altE and sigB, and the biofilm structure of five clinical isolates of S. epidermidis. For most tested isolates, the expression of these genes increased after exposure to 0.25 MIC and 0.5 MIC tigecycline. A slight decrease in icaAmRNA levels was observed only in two isolates in the presence of 0.25 MIC tigecycline. The effect of ciprofloxacin exposure was isolate-dependent. At 0.5 MIC, ciprofloxacin induced an increase of sigB and icaAmRNA levels in three of the five tested isolates. At the same time, expression of the altE gene increased in all isolates (from 1.3-fold to 42-fold, depending on the strain).

Both matrix (pectin) and reinforcer (halloysite nanotubes) used in this study are considered as biocompatible, natural, and low-cost materials. Various characterization tests including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, release kinetics, contact angle, and dynamic mechanical analysis were performed to evaluate the performance of the pectin films. Exceptional thermal, tensile, and contact angle properties have been achieved for films reinforced by patch halloysite nanotubes due to the patchy and lengthy nature of these tubes, which form a bird nest structure in the pectin matrix. Matauri Bay halloysite nanotubes were dispersed uniformly and individually in the matrix in low and even high halloysite nanotube concentrations. Furthermore, salicylic acid as a biocidal agent was encapsulated in the halloysite nanotubes lumen to control its release kinetics. On this basis, halloysite nanotubes/salicylic acid hybrids were dispersed into the pectin matrix to develop functional biofilms with antimicrobial properties that can be extended over time. Results revealed that shorter nanotubes (Matauri Bay) had better ability for the encapsulation of salicylic acid into their lumen, while patchy structure and longer tubes of patch halloysite nanotubes made the encapsulation process more difficult, as they might need more time and energy to be fully loaded by salicylic acid.

After the biofilm matures, those PFP on the surface of the biofilm can generate ROS under white light irradiation, which has the ability to inactivate bacteria nearby. Once the biofilm is broken, PFP can penetrate throughthe biofilm and continuously generate ROS under irradiation, resulting in biofilm disruption.

This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities of the methanol extracts of 37 Korean medicinal plants against dental pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans, which synergize their virulence so as to induce the formation of plaque biofilms in the oral cavity. The antimicrobial activities were investigated by broth dilution and disk diffusion assay. The anti-biofilm and antioxidant activities were evaluated based on the inhibitory effect against glucosyltransferase (GTase) and the DPPH assay, respectively. Among 37 herbs, eight plant extracts presented growth and biofilm inhibitory activities against both etiologic bacteria. Among them, the methanol extracts (1.0 mg/ml) from Camellia japonica and Thuja orientalis significantly inhibited the growth of both bacteria by over 76% and over 83% in liquid media, respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of these methanol extracts were determined to be 0.5 mg/ml using a disk diffusion assay on solid agar media. Biofilm formation was inhibited by more than 92.4% and 98.0%, respectively, using the same concentration of each extract. The present results demonstrate that the medicinal plants C. japonica and T. orientalis are potentially useful as antimicrobial and anti-biofilm agents in preventing dental diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Hyoung-An Choi"},{"name":"Dae-Eun Cheong"},{"name":"Ho-Dong Lim"},{"name":"Won-Ho Kim"},{"name":"Mi-Hyoun Ham"},{"name":"Myung-Hwan Oh"},{"name":"Yuanzheng Wu"},{"name":"Hyun-Jae Shin"},{"name":"Geun-Joong Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Camellia japonica"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"Thuja orientalis"},{"word":"anti-biofilm activity"},{"word":"antimicrobial activity"}]},"article275":{"pmid":"28478368","title":"Impacts of bleach on bryozoans: A framework to distinguish direct and indirect effects using chemical and physical manipulations.","date":"2018-03-29","abs":"Chemical disturbances, caused by contamination, are a global issue and can cause changes in the abundance of populations of one or more species via direct and/or indirect effects. This, in turn, can have profound consequences on assemblages and/or systems. Understanding how contaminants affect functional groups or taxa, i.e. which ecological or biological processes are being affected, is necessary to better predict their consequences. To distinguish between direct and indirect effects of contaminants, however, specific experiments, physically manipulating the changing variable (in this case, biofilm) as well as the contaminant, are necessary. Here, I tested which processes were affected by bleach, a biocide commonly found in urban run-offs that caused a decrease in covers of bryozoans. Effects of bleach on recruitment and growth of bryozoans were variable, suggesting that impacts are complex. Nevertheless, results indicate that bleach reduced recruitment of bryozoans. Therefore, manipulative field experiments were done to test whether these effects were direct or indirect, through changes in the abundance of photosynthetic biofilms. Responses of biofilms varied with the duration and exposure to bleach, as well as the timing of experiments. Abundance of biofilms did not seem, however, to affect the number of recruits of bryozoans, which could suggest a direct effect of bleach on bryozoan recruitment. Given that bryozoans are a major component of subtidal benthic assemblages and an important food source for >300 species, decreases in their abundance, as those observed here, might have important knock-on effects on marine systems due to trophic cascades. Capsule. In situ manipulative experiments showed that bleach decreased covers of bryozoans, which is possibly due to a combination of effects on their growth and recruitment. Manual removals and chemically induced removals are necessary to disentangle direct and indirect effects of contaminants.","authors":[{"name":"Mariana Mayer-Pinto"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocide"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Growth"},{"word":"Pollution"},{"word":"Recruitment"},{"word":"Sodium hypochlorite"},{"word":"Sydney harbour"}]},"article276":{"pmid":"28478053","title":"Molecular characterization and application of lipase from Bacillus sp.

Although it is typically a chronic condition, rapidly progressing, aggressive forms are associated with the oral pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans One of this bacterium's key virulence traits is its ability to attach to surfaces and form robust biofilms that resist killing by the host and antibiotics. Though much has been learned about A. actinomycetemcomitans since its initial discovery, we lack insight into a fundamental aspect of its basic biology, as we do not know the full set of genes that it requires for viability (the essential genome). Furthermore, research on A. actinomycetemcomitans is hampered by the field's lack of a mutant collection. To address these gaps, we used rapid transposon mutant sequencing (Tn-seq) to define the essential genomes of two strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, revealing a core set of 319 genes. We then generated an arrayed mutant library comprising >1,500 unique insertions and used a sequencing-based approach to define each mutant's position (well and plate) in the library. To demonstrate its utility, we screened the library for mutants with weakened resistance to subinhibitory erythromycin, revealing the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB as a critical resistance factor. During the screen, we discovered that erythromycin induces A. actinomycetemcomitans to form biofilms. We therefore devised a novel Tn-seq-based screen to identify specific factors that mediate this phenotype and in follow-up experiments confirmed 4 mutants. Together, these studies present new insights and resources for investigating the basic biology and disease mechanisms of a human pathogen.","authors":[{"name":"Ajay M Narayanan"},{"name":"Matthew M Ramsey"},{"name":"Apollo Stacy"},{"name":"Marvin Whiteley"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aggregatibacter"},{"word":"Tn-seq"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"essential genome"}]},"article281":{"pmid":"28476373","title":"Ciprofloxacin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles against cystic fibrosis P. aeruginosa lung infections.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Current pulmonary treatments against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung suffer from deactivation of the drug and immobilization in thick and viscous biofilm/mucus blend, along with the general antibiotic resistance.

In this study, we assessed 1333 patients in five ICUs, 56 of whom developed A. baumannii infections. Most of the A. baumannii isolates were resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs, specifically, 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, and 91.1% of the isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR). The most frequent OXA gene present was OXA-23 (55.1%), which is significantly associated with MDR strains. Most of the A. baumannii isolates (76.8%) were capable of forming a biofilm. The antimicrobial drug classes that were effective against most of these isolates were polymyxins and tigecycline. The molecular profile of the isolates allowed detection of 12 different clusters comprising 2 to 8 isolates each. In conclusion, our data indicate a high incidence of resistance to carbapenems as well as MDR strains among the observed A. baumannii isolates, most of which exhibited a high prevalence of OXA-23 gene expression.

For the past year, weekly water samples have been taken from HCUs used at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Foundation Trust. We report the microbial contamination of the HCUs over a year detailing the decontamination regimes applied at UHB to reduce the microbial load. DESIGN Observational study SETTING UHB is a tertiary referral teaching hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom, that provides clinical services to nearly 1 million patients every year. The UHB Cardiac department is one of the largest in the United Kingdom and provides treatment for adult patients with a wide range of cardiac diseases. METHODS Water samples taken from HCUs used at UHB for cardiopulmonary bypass surgery were sampled over a year to determine the number of microorganisms by membrane filtration. Various decontamination processes were employed throughout the year. RESULTS Varying total viable counts containing a wide variety of microorganisms were obtained from water inside the HCUs. No M. chimaera were isolated after replacement of the HCU internal tubing. Stringent decontamination regimes resulted in degradation of the HCUs and increased TVCs after several months. CONCLUSION More work is required to ensure effective decontamination processes to reduce the microbial load within the HCUs. Our studies indicate that weekly water sampling for TVC will be required indefinitely to monitor the water quality in these units as well as regular replacement of the tubing to control the build-up of biofilm.

This was further corroborated by the impairment of autophosphorylation activity in the CodYS215A mutant. Autophosphorylation may be speculated as an additional mechanism regulating CodY activity in the cell.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Staphylococcus aureus can increase PGE2 production of oral epithelial cells and how PGE2 functions in the growth and adherence of Staphylococcus aureus. mRNA levels of COX-2, fnbpA and fnbpB were estimated by quantitative PCR. PGE2 production was measured by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The binding biomass of Staphylococcus aureus to human fibronectin was investigated by crystal violet staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy and the adherent force was measured by atomic force microscope (AFM). The COX-2 mRNA level and PGE2 production were increased by Staphylococcus aureus. PGE2 promoted the growth and biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, enhanced the attachment of Staphylococcus aureus to the human fibronectin as well as to the HOK cells. The transcription of fnbpB was up-regulated by PGE2 in both early and middle exponential phase but not fnbpA. These results suggest that the activation of COX-2/PGE2 pathway in oral epithelial cell by Staphylococcus aureus can in turn facilitate the growth and the ability to adhere of the pathogen.

We tested Hfq-dependent sRNAs in E. coli for their ability, when overproduced, to inhibit or stimulate biofilm formation, in two different growth media. We identify two mutually exclusive pathways for biofilm formation. In LB, PgaA, encoding an adhesion export protein, played a critical role; biofilm was independent of the general stress factor RpoS or CsgD, regulator of curli and other biofilm genes. The PgaA-dependent pathway was stimulated upon overproduction of DsrA, via negative regulation of H-NS, or of GadY, likely by titration of CsrA. In yeast extract casamino acids (YESCA) media, biofilm was dependent on RpoS and CsgD, but independent of PgaA; RpoS appears to indirectly negatively regulate the PgaA-dependent pathway in YESCA medium. Deletions of most sRNAs had very little effect on biofilm, although deletion of hfq, encoding an RNA chaperone, was defective in both LB and YESCA. Deletion of ArcZ, a small RNA activator of RpoS, decreased biofilm in YESCA; only a portion of this defect could be bypassed by overproduction of RpoS.

Denitrifying bioreactors that employ a lignocellulosic wood chip medium contained within a saturated (anoxic) zone are relatively new technology that can be implemented at the local level to manage residential non-point nitrogen sources. In these systems, wood chips serve as a microbial biofilm support and provide a constant source of organic substrate required for denitrification. Denitrifying wood chip bioreactors for stormwater management include biofilters and bioretention systems modified to include an internal water storage zone; for on-site wastewater, they include upflow packed bed reactors, permeable reactive barriers, and submerged wetlands. Laboratory studies have shown that these bioreactors can achieve nitrate removal efficiencies as high as 80-100% but could provide more fundamental insight into system design and performance. For example, the type and size of the wood chips, hydraulic loading rate, and dormant period between water applications affects the hydrolysis rate of the lignocellulosic substrate, which in turn affects the amount and bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon for denitrification. Additional field studies can provide a better understanding of the effect of varying environmental conditions such as ambient temperature, precipitation rates, household water use rates, and idle periods on nitrogen removal performance. Long-term studies are also essential for understanding operations and maintenance requirements and validating mathematical models that integrate the complex physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring in these systems.

In a prospective case series at a primary healthcare clinic in Nuuk, Greenland, patients with more than 14 days of otorrhea were included consecutively. Samples for culturing and biofilm analysis were taken at enrollment and at any subsequent episode with otorrhea. Participants were treated with daily saline irrigation and Ciprofloxacin eardrops for 7-14 days. Biofilm was identified in otorrhea in 81% (17/21) of participants at enrollment. Multispecies infections dominated with Non-typeable Haemophilus Influenzae (NTHI), Staphyloccocus aureus, and anaerobes being the most frequent pathogens. After the initial treatment, 19 (90%) had dry ears. Median observation period was 140 days (range 14-280) where 13 participants had one or more recurrences. Median time to first recurrence was 60 days (range 14-197). Among the 13 with recurrence, three individuals had the same genotype of bacteria at a subsequent episode.

Meat juice was collected during the freeze-thaw process of raw meat and sterilized by filtration. In 96-well polystyrene plates and glass chambers, supplementation of over 25% meat juice (v/v) in laboratory media led to an increase in biofilm formation of Campylobacter and Salmonella. During the initial attachment stage of biofilm development, more bacterial cells were present on surfaces treated with meat juice residues compared to control surfaces. Meat juice particulates on abiotic surfaces facilitated biofilm formation of Campylobacter and Salmonella under both static and flow conditions, with the latter being assessed using a microfluidic platform. Further, the deficiency in biofilm formation of selected Campylobacter and Salmonella mutant strains was restored in the presence of meat juice particulates. These results suggested that meat juice residues on the abiotic surfaces might act as a surface conditioner to support initial attachment and biofilm formation of Campylobacter and Salmonella.

We show that non-producers initially fail to incorporate into biofilms formed by the WT cells, resulting in 100-fold lower final frequency compared to the WT. However, this is modulated in a long-term scenario, as non-producers evolve the ability to better incorporate into biofilms, thereby slightly decreasing the productivity of the whole population.

For instance, competitor bacteria may produce antibiotics and other bioactive metabolites and sequester nutrients. To survive, some species of bacteria escape competition through antibiotic production, biofilm formation, or motility. Specialized metabolite production and biofilm formation are relatively well understood for bacterial species in isolation. How bacteria control these functions when competitors are present is not well studied. To address fundamental questions relating to the competitive mechanisms of different species, we have developed a model system using two species of soil bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces sp. strain Mg1. Using this model, we previously found that linearmycins produced by Streptomyces sp. strain Mg1 cause lysis of B. subtilis cells and degradation of colony matrix. We identified strains of B. subtilis with mutations in the two-component signaling system yfiJK operon that confer dual phenotypes of specific linearmycin resistance and biofilm morphology. We determined that expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter yfiLMN operon, particularly yfiM and yfiN, is necessary for biofilm morphology. Using transposon mutagenesis, we identified genes that are required for YfiLMN-mediated biofilm morphology, including several chaperones.

Four P. aeruginosa isolates with various colistin susceptibilities were chosen for evaluation. The tested isolates of P. aeruginosa exhibited MIC values ranging from 1 to 64 and 0.0625 to 0.5 μg/ml for colistin and CHIR-090, respectively. Against 24-h static biofilms, minimum biofilm eradication concentration values ranged from 256 to 512 and 8 to >128 μg/ml for colistin and CHIR-090, respectively. Interestingly, subinhibitory concentrations of CHIR-090 contributed to the eradication of subpopulations of P. aeruginosa with the highest colistin MIC values. The combination of colistin and CHIR-090 at subinhibitory concentrations demonstrated synergistic activity both in vivo and in vitro and prevented the formation of colistin-tolerant subpopulations in in vitro biofilms. In summary, our study highlights the in vivo and in vitro synergistic activity of the colistin and CHIR-090 combination against both colistin-susceptible and -nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa biofilms.

As poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) remains the main material employed in the fabrication of dentures, the aim of this research was to evaluate the adhesion of Candida albicans cells onto PMMA surfaces by employing an atomic force microscopy (AFM) single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) technique. For experiments, tipless AFM cantilevers were functionalized with PMMA microspheres and probed against C. albicans cells immobilized onto biopolymer-coated substrates. Both a laboratory strain and a clinical isolate of C. albicans were used for SCFS experiments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM imaging of C. albicans confirmed the polymorphic behavior of both strains, which was dependent on growth culture conditions. AFM force-spectroscopy results showed that the adhesion of C. albicans to PMMA is morphology dependent, as hyphal tubes had increased adhesion compared with yeast cells ( P < 0.05). C. albicans budding mother cells were found to be nonadherent, which contrasts with the increased adhesion observed in the tube region. Comparison between strains demonstrated increased adhesion forces for a clinical isolate compared with the lab strain. The clinical isolate also had increased survival in blood and reduced sensitivity to complement opsonization, providing additional evidence of strain-dependent differences in Candida-host interactions that may affect virulence. In conclusion, PMMA-modified AFM probes have shown to be a reliable technique to characterize the adhesion of C. albicans to acrylic surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"S Aguayo"},{"name":"H Marshall"},{"name":"J Pratten"},{"name":"D Bradshaw"},{"name":"J S Brown"},{"name":"S R Porter"},{"name":"D Spratt"},{"name":"L Bozec"}],"keywords":[{"word":"atomic force microscopy"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"biomaterials"},{"word":"candidiasis"},{"word":"nanotechnology"},{"word":"scanning electron microscopy"}]},"article353":{"pmid":"28460167","title":"Imaging Bacterial Interspecies Chemical Interactions by Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering.","date":"2019-01-25","abs":"Microbes produce bioactive chemical compounds to influence the physiology and growth of their neighbors, and our understanding of their biological activities may be enhanced by our ability to visualize such molecules in vivo.

In this study, we investigated MRSA and PA multi-species biofilm communities in vitro and their interaction with the host during in vivo colonization using an OM rat-model. In-vitro biofilm formation and in-vivo colonization were studied using CV-microtiter plate assay and OM rat-model respectively.

The differential gene expressions of rat mucosa colonized with single or multi-species of MRSA or PA were studied using RNA-sequencing of total transcriptome. In multi-species in-vitro biofilms PA partially inhibited SA growth. However, no significant inhibition of MRSA was detected during in-vivo colonization of multi-species in rat bullae. A total of 1,797 genes were significantly (p < 0.05) differentially expressed in MRSA or PA or MRSA + PA colonized rat middle ear mucosa with respect to the control. The poly-microbial colonization of MRSA and PA induced the differential expression of a significant number of genes that are involved in immune response, inflammation, signaling, development, and defense; these were not expressed with single species colonization by either MRSA or PA. Genes involved in defense, immune response, inflammatory response, and developmental process were exclusively up-regulated, and genes that are involved in nervous system signaling, development and transmission, regulation of cell growth and development, anatomical and system development, and cell differentiation were down-regulated after multi-species inoculation. These results indicate that poly-microbial colonization induces a host response that is different from that induced by single species infection.","authors":[{"name":"Mukesh K Yadav"},{"name":"Sung-Won Chae"},{"name":"Yoon Young Go"},{"name":"Gi Jung Im"},{"name":"Jae-Jun Song"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"colonization"},{"word":"methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"otitis media"},{"word":"planktonic"},{"word":"poly-microbial"}]},"article356":{"pmid":"28458812","title":"Infection of Retained Defibrillator Lead Fragment after Heart Transplant.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"A 59-year old heart transplant recipient was admitted due to continuous pain in her left axilla.

We investigated heat-stable nucleoid-structuring (H-NS) mutation-mediated CRISPR-Cas activation and its effect on E. coli Stx2 phage lysogen. The Δhns mutant (MG1655Δhns) of the E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 was obtained. The Δhns mutant lysogen that was generated after Stx phage lysogenic infection had a repressed growth status and showed subdued group behavior, including biofilm formation and swarming motility, in comparison to the wild-type strain. The de-repression effect of the H-NS mutation on CRISPR-Cas activity was then verified. The results showed that cas gene expression was upregulated and the transformation efficiency of the wild-type CRISPR plasmids was decreased, which may indicate activation of the CRISPR-Cas system. Furthermore, the function of CRISPR-Cas on Stx2 phage lysogen was investigated by activating the CRISPR-Cas system, which contains an insertion of the protospacer regions of the Stx2 phage Min27. The phage release and toxin production of four lysogens harboring the engineered CRISPRs were investigated. Notably, in the supernatant of the Δhns mutant lysogen harboring the Min27 spacer, both the progeny phage release and the toxin production were inhibited after mitomycin C induction.

In this study, Aeromonas sp. O23A, one of the dominant DARB strains found in the Zloty Stok mine (SW Poland), was subjected to a detailed physiological and functional analysis aimed to identify the actual environmental impact of this strain. Physiological analyses revealed that O23A is a facultative anaerobe, capable of utilizing arsenate as a respiratory substrate and acetate, citrate and lactate as electron donors. Arsenate reduction was observed within the first 24h of culturing. The strain shows high resistance to arsenic and several other heavy metals (i.a. Cu, Fe, Ni and Zn) as well tolerance to a broad range of physico-chemical conditions. Metabolic preferences of O23A were thoroughly investigated using Biolog™ MicroArray assay. The strain was found to produce hydroxamate siderophores, potentially involved in the mobilization of iron and co-occurring heavy metals from minerals. On the other hand, O23A showed high adherence abilities, and its involvement in biofilm formation may lead to the entrapment of dissolved arsenic species and other toxic ions.

QS-controlled biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in clinical settings has remained controversial due to emerging drug resistance; therefore, screening diverse compounds for anti-biofilm or anti-QS activities is important. This study demonstrates the ability of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of baicalin, an active natural compound extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal Scutellaria baicalensis, to inhibit the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and enhance the bactericidal effects of various conventional antibiotics in vitro. In addition, baicalin exerted dose-dependent inhibitory effects on virulence phenotypes (LasA protease, LasB elastase, pyocyanin, rhamnolipid, motilities and exotoxin A) regulated by QS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, the expression levels of QS-regulatory genes, including lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, pqsR and pqsA, were repressed after sub-MIC baicalin treatment, resulting in significant decreases in the QS signaling molecules 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL, confirming the ability of baicalin-mediated QS inhibition to alter gene and protein expression. In vivo experiments indicated that baicalin treatment reduces Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Greater worm survival in the baicalin-treated group manifested as an increase in the LT50 from 24 to 96 h. In a mouse peritoneal implant infection model, baicalin treatment enhanced the clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the implants of mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared with the control group. Moreover, the combination of baicalin and antibiotics significantly reduced the numbers of colony-forming units in the implants to a significantly greater degree than antibiotic treatment alone. Pathological and histological analyses revealed mitigation of the inflammatory response and reduced cell infiltration in the peritoneal tissue surrounding the implants after baicalin treatment. Measurement of the cytokine levels in the peritoneal lavage fluid of mice in the baicalin treatment group revealed a decrease in IL-4, an increase in interferon γ (IFN-γ), and a reversed IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio compared with the control group, indicating that baicalin treatment activated the Th1-induced immune response to expedite bacterial load clearance. Based on these results, baicalin might be a potent QS inhibitor and anti-biofilm agent for combating Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-related infections.","authors":[{"name":"Jing Luo"},{"name":"Biying Dong"},{"name":"Ke Wang"},{"name":"Shuangqi Cai"},{"name":"Tangjuan Liu"},{"name":"Xiaojing Cheng"},{"name":"Danqing Lei"},{"name":"Yanling Chen"},{"name":"Yanan Li"},{"name":"Jinliang Kong"},{"name":"Yiqiang Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article380":{"pmid":"28452767","title":"From biofilm ecology to reactors: a focused review.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Biofilms are complex biostructures that appear on all surfaces that are regularly in contact with water. They are structurally complex, dynamic systems with attributes of primordial multicellular organisms and multifaceted ecosystems.

This review addresses the following three topics: (1) biofilm ecology, (2) biofilm reactor technology and design, and (3) biofilm modeling. In so doing, it addresses the processes occurring in the biofilm, and how these affect and are affected by the broader biofilm system. The symphonic application of a suite of biological methods has led to significant advances in the understanding of biofilm ecology. New metabolic pathways, such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) or complete ammonium oxidation (comammox) were first observed in biofilm reactors. The functions, properties, and constituents of the biofilm extracellular polymeric substance matrix are somewhat known, but their exact composition and role in the microbial conversion kinetics and biochemical transformations are still to be resolved. Biofilm grown microorganisms may contribute to increased metabolism of micro-pollutants. Several types of biofilm reactors have been used for water treatment, with current focus on moving bed biofilm reactors, integrated fixed-film activated sludge, membrane-supported biofilm reactors, and granular sludge processes. The control and/or beneficial use of biofilms in membrane processes is advancing.

Simultaneous 3D pH mapping and architecture of intact biofilms was performed using two-photon confocal microscopy. The enamel surface and mineral content characteristics were examined successively via optical profilometry and microradiography analyses. Sucrose-mediated biofilm formation created spatial heterogeneities manifested by complex networks of bacterial clusters (microcolonies). Acidic regions (pH<5.5) were found only in the interior of microcolonies, which impedes rapid neutralization (taking more than 120 min for neutralization). Glucose exposure rapidly re-created the acidic niches, indicating formation of diffusion barriers associated with microcolonies structure. Enamel demineralization (white spots), rougher surface, deeper lesion and more mineral loss appeared to be associated with the localization of these bacterial clusters at the biofilm-enamel interface. Similar 3D architecture was observed in plaque-biofilms formed in vivo in the presence of sucrose.

The mechanism of NET release in response to bacteria is largely unknown. We studied the process by which Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, interacts with primary PMNs, and found that flagellar swimming motility of the bacterium is essential for inducing NET extrusion. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is associated with P. aeruginosa infection and PMN-dominated inflammation. Although NETs are abundant in CF airways, the main factors triggering NET release in CF remain unclear. Our study implicates that motile P. aeruginosa is a strong NET-inducer in CF. In early stages of CF lung disease flagellated, motile isolates of P. aeruginosa are characteristic and their interactions with PMNs could lead to NET formation. In chronic CF, P. aeruginosa down-regulates its flagellum expression to avoid recognition by the immune system and forms biofilms. Flagellated bacteria, however, are released from biofilms and could interact with PMNs to form NETs. Although flagellated forms likely represent only a small fraction of the total P. aeruginosa load in chronic CF, NET release induced by them could have a significant impact on inflammation and lung function since flagellated forms trigger the most robust response of the immune system including PMNs. Overall, we speculate that NET formation driven by motile P. aeruginosa could be a novel, significant contributor to pathogenesis at both, early and late stages of CF lung disease.","authors":[{"name":"Balázs Rada"}],"keywords":[{"word":"NETs"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"flagellum"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"neutrophil"}]},"article387":{"pmid":"28450861","title":"Corrigendum: Assessing the function of STAS domain protein SypA in Vibrio fischeri using a comparative analysis.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"[This corrects the article on p. 760 in vol. 6, PMID: 26284045.].","authors":[{"name":"Cecilia M Thompson"},{"name":"Karen L Visick"}],"keywords":[{"word":"STAS domain proteins"},{"word":"Vibrio fischeri"},{"word":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus"},{"word":"Vibrio vulnificus"},{"word":"biofilm formation"}]},"article388":{"pmid":"28450858","title":"Fungal Biofilms: Targets for the Development of Novel Strategies in Plant Disease Management.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The global food supply has been facing increasing challenges during the first decades of the 21","authors":[{"name":"Federica Villa"},{"name":"Francesca Cappitelli"},{"name":"Paolo Cortesi"},{"name":"Andrea Kunova"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioactive natural compounds"},{"word":"biofilm resistance"},{"word":"fungal biofilm"},{"word":"non-biocidal antibiofilm compounds"},{"word":"non-fungicide management practices"}]},"article389":{"pmid":"28449940","title":"Antimicrobial activity of chemomechanical gingival retraction products.","date":"2018-10-12","abs":"Application of astringent hemostatic agents is the most widely used technique for gingival retraction, and a variety of products are offered commercially.

Infection of the COPD airways causes acute exacerbations, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. NTHi has evolved multiple mechanisms to establish infection in the hostile environment of the COPD airways, allowing the pathogen to persist in the airways for months to years. Persistent infection of the COPD airways contributes to chronic airway inflammation that increases symptoms and accelerates the progressive loss of pulmonary function, which is a hallmark of the disease. Persistence mechanisms of NTHi include the expression of multiple redundant adhesins that mediate binding to host cellular and extracellular matrix components. NTHi evades host immune recognition and clearance by invading host epithelial cells, forming biofilms, altering gene expression and displaying surface antigenic variation. NTHi also binds host serum factors that confer serum resistance. Here we discuss the burden of COPD and the role of NTHi infections in the course of the disease. We provide an overview of NTHi mechanisms of persistence that allow the pathogen to establish a niche in the hostile COPD airways.","authors":[{"name":"Christian P Ahearn"},{"name":"Mary C Gallo"},{"name":"Timothy F Murphy"}],"keywords":[{"word":"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"},{"word":"immune evasion"},{"word":"mechanisms of persistence"},{"word":"non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"persistent infection"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"28449040","title":"Toxin-antitoxin systems and their role in disseminating and maintaining antimicrobial resistance.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Toxin-antitoxin systems (TAs) are ubiquitous among bacteria and play a crucial role in the dissemination and evolution of antibiotic resistance, such as maintaining multi-resistant plasmids and inducing persistence formation.

Approximately one-third (51/162, 31.5%) of the A. baumannii clinical isolates possessed the hcp gene, and the hcp-positive isolates were found in several genotypes in multilocus sequence typing. The expression and secretion of Hcp protein varied among the clinical isolates. A. baumannii isolates with detectable Hcp secretion (T6SS+) could better outcompete Escherichia coli compared with T6SS- isolates, including hcp-negative and inactivated hcp-positive isolates. In addition, T6SS+ isolates showed higher biofilm-forming activity and better survival in the presence of normal human serum than the T6SS- isolates. T6SS+ isolates were more frequently detected in patients with catheter-related bloodstream infection, haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and patients receiving immunosuppressive agents. However, T6SS was not a prognostic factor for mortality.

Although the CF airway is inhabited by diverse species of microorganisms interlaced within a biofilm, many studies focus on the sole contribution of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis in CF morbidity. More recently, oral commensal streptococci have been identified as cohabitants of the CF lung, but few studies have explored the role these bacteria play within the CF biofilm. We examined the interaction between P. aeruginosa and oral commensal streptococci within a dual species biofilm. Here we report that the CF P. aeruginosa isolate, FRD1, enhances biofilm formation and colonization of Drosophila melanogaster by the oral commensal Streptococcus parasanguinis. Moreover, production of the P. aeruginosa exopolysaccharide, alginate, is required for the promotion of S. parasanguinis biofilm formation and colonization. However, P. aeruginosa is not promoted in the dual species biofilm. Furthermore, we show that the streptococcal adhesin, BapA1, mediates alginate-dependent enhancement of the S. parasanguinis biofilm in vitro, and BapA1 along with another adhesin, Fap1, are required for the in vivo colonization of S. parasanguinis in the presence of FRD1. Taken together, our study highlights a new association between streptococcal adhesins and P. aeruginosa alginate, and reveals a mechanism by which S. parasanguinis potentially colonizes the CF lung and interferes with the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Jessica A Scoffield"},{"name":"Dingyu Duan"},{"name":"Fan Zhu"},{"name":"Hui Wu"}],"keywords":[]},"article395":{"pmid":"28448629","title":"Structure and function of a novel GH8 endoglucanase from the bacterial cellulose synthase complex of Raoultella ornithinolytica.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Cellulose synthesis in bacteria is a complex process involving the concerted action of several enzymes whose genes are often organized in operons. This process influences many fundamental physiological aspects such as bacteria and host interaction, biofilm formation, among others. Although it might sound contradictory, the participation of cellulose-degrading enzymes is critical to this process. The presence of endoglucanases from family 8 of glycosyl hydrolases (GH8) in bacterial cellulose synthase (Bcs) complex has been described in different bacteria, including the model organism Komagataeibacter xylinus; however, their role in this process is not completely understood. In this study, we describe the biochemical characterization and three-dimensional structure of a novel GH8 member from Raoultella ornithinolytica, named AfmE1, which was previously identified by our group from the metagenomic analysis of the giant snail Achatina fulica. Our results demonstrated that AfmE1 is an endo-β-1,4-glucanase, with maximum activity in acidic to neutral pH over a wide temperature range. This enzyme cleaves cello-oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization ≥ 5 and presents six glucosyl-binding subsites. The structural comparison of AfmE1 with other GH8 endoglucanases showed significant structural dissimilarities in the catalytic cleft, particularly in the subsite +3, which correlate with different functional mechanisms, such as the recognition of substrate molecules having different arrangements and crystallinities. Together, these findings provide new insights into molecular and structural features of evolutionarily conserved endoglucanases from the bacterial cellulose biosynthetic machinery.","authors":[{"name":"Sandra Mara Naressi Scapin"},{"name":"Flavio Henrique Moreira Souza"},{"name":"Leticia Maria Zanphorlin"},{"name":"Thamyres Silva de Almeida"},{"name":"Youssef Bacila Sade"},{"name":"Alexander Machado Cardoso"},{"name":"Guilherme Luiz Pinheiro"},{"name":"Mario Tyago Murakami"}],"keywords":[]},"article396":{"pmid":"28448572","title":"Clonality, virulence determinants, and profiles of resistance of clinical Acinetobacter baumannii isolates obtained from a Spanish hospital.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that is showing increasing rates of carbapenem resistance.

The challenge is to exclusively enrich ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). To achieve nitritation, strategies to suppress nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are needed, which are ideally grounded on an understanding of underlying mechanisms. In this study, a nitrifying MABR was operated under intermittent aeration. During eight months of operation, AOB dominated, while NOB were suppressed. On the basis of dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate profiles within the biofilm and in the bulk, a 1-dimensional nitrifying biofilm model was developed and calibrated. The model was utilized to explore the potential mechanisms of NOB suppression associated with intermittent aeration, considering DO limitation, direct pH effects on enzymatic activities, and indirect pH effects on activity via substrate speciation. The model predicted strong periodic shifts in the spatial gradients of DO, pH, free ammonia, and free nitrous acid, associated with aerated and nonaerated phases. NOB suppression during intermittent aeration was mostly explained by periodic inhibition caused by free ammonia due to periodic transient pH upshifts. Dissolved oxygen limitation did not govern NOB suppression. Different intermittent aeration strategies were then evaluated for nitritation success in intermittently aerated MABRs: both aeration intermittency and duration were effective control parameters.","authors":[{"name":"Yunjie Ma"},{"name":"Carlos Domingo-Félez"},{"name":"Benedek Gy Plósz"},{"name":"Barth F Smets"}],"keywords":[]}}
