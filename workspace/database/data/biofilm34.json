The current study is focused on CzcR and CopR proteins which are part of two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) - CzcR-CzcS and CopR-CopS respectively in P.aeruginosa. They both negatively regulate OprD porin expression which affects the intake of antibiotics like carbapenems. These two proteins can be treated as targets to combat antibiotic resistance in P.aeruginosa. Docking was performed on these proteins in search of inhibitors against the CzcR-CzcS and CopR-CopS TCSs. Efficient inhibitory ligands were evaluated on the basis of least binding energy, human oral absorption and ADME properties using a four-tier structure based virtual screening. The resulting ligands displayed high effective inhibitory property and satisfactory pharmacokinetics as compared to inhibitors which have been identified before for two-component signal transduction systems for gram negative bacteria. These potential inhibitors can now be used further in wet lab by performing selectivity assays to determine their inhibition rate against P.aeruginosa biofilms. Identification of potential leads may enable the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting P.aeruginosabiofilms.","authors":[{"name":" Raavi"},{"name":"Swechha Mishra"},{"name":"Sangeeta Singh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Carbapenems"},{"word":"P.aeruginosa"},{"word":"Two component signal transduction systems"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"28826725","title":"Dry powder aerosols to co-deliver antibiotics and nutrient dispersion compounds for enhanced bacterial biofilm eradication.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The purpose of this study was to formulate a dry powder for inhalation containing a combination treatment for eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial biofilms.

Leucine was added to the spray dried formulation to aid powder flowability. A central composite design of experiments was performed to determine the effects of solution and processing parameters on powder yield and aerodynamic properties. Combinations of CH and GA eradicated bacterial biofilms at lower antibiotic concentrations compared to CH alone. Spray dried powders were produced with yields up to 43% and mass mean aerodynamic diameters (MMAD) in the respirable range. Powder yield was primarily affected by variables that determine cyclone efficiency, i.e. atomizer and solution flow rates and solution concentration; while MMAD was mainly determined by solution concentration. Fine particle fractions (FPF)<4.46μm and <2.82μm of the powders ranged from 56 to 70% and 35 to 46%, respectively.

Of particular concern Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenamase- producing strains have been recorded worldwide. Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) caused by K. pneumoniae are significantly associated with morbidity and mortality. Hence the present work was aimed to develop a strategy for addressing these issues through an innovative approach of antibiofilm and immunomodulation. These two independent activities were analyzed in a Streptomyces derived ASK2 bioactive compound. While analysing the effect of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs), 0.5x of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was found to be more effective in preventing biofilm formation on coverslip and silicone catheter. The minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was found to be 15-fold higher MIC with eradication of 75% of 3 day old biofilm. Apart from its antibiofilm potential, ASK2 also acts as an opsonin and enhances phagocytic response of macrophages against multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae. In addition, ASK2 resulted in elevated levels of nitric oxide generation by the macrophages and has a stimulating effect on IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α proinflammatory cytokines. The opsonic role of ASK2 and its potential in modulating proinflammatory cytokines secreted by macrophages implies the importance of ASK2 in modulating cellular immune response of macrophages against MDR K. pneumoniae.

Only recently, complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox), which oxidize ammonia to nitrate on their own, were identified in the bacterial genus Nitrospira, previously assumed to contain only canonical nitrite oxidizers. Nitrospira are widespread in nature, but for assessments of the distribution and functional importance of comammox Nitrospira in ecosystems, cultivation-independent tools to distinguish comammox from strictly nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira are required. Here we developed new PCR primer sets that specifically target the amoA genes coding for subunit A of the distinct ammonia monooxygenase of comammox Nitrospira. While existing primers capture only a fraction of the known comammox amoA diversity, the new primer sets cover as much as 95% of the comammox amoA clade A and 92% of the clade B sequences in a reference database containing 326 comammox amoA genes with sequence information at the primer binding sites. Application of the primers to 13 samples from engineered systems (a groundwater well, drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment plants) and other habitats (rice paddy and forest soils, rice rhizosphere, brackish lake sediment and freshwater biofilm) detected comammox Nitrospira in all samples and revealed a considerable diversity of comammox in most habitats. Excellent primer specificity for comammox amoA was achieved by avoiding the use of highly degenerate primer preparations and by using equimolar mixtures of oligonucleotides that match existing comammox amoA genes. Quantitative PCR with these equimolar primer mixtures was highly sensitive and specific, and enabled the efficient quantification of clade A and clade B comammox amoA gene copy numbers in environmental samples. The measured relative abundances of comammox Nitrospira, compared to canonical ammonia oxidizers, were highly variable across environments. The new comammox amoA-targeted primers enable more encompassing future studies of nitrifying microorganisms in diverse habitats. For example, they may be used to monitor the population dynamics of uncultured comammox organisms under changing environmental conditions and in response to altered treatments in engineered and agricultural ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Petra Pjevac"},{"name":"Clemens Schauberger"},{"name":"Lianna Poghosyan"},{"name":"Craig W Herbold"},{"name":"Maartje A H J van Kessel"},{"name":"Anne Daebeler"},{"name":"Michaela Steinberger"},{"name":"Mike S M Jetten"},{"name":"Sebastian Lücker"},{"name":"Michael Wagner"},{"name":"Holger Daims"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Nitrospira"},{"word":"PCR"},{"word":"amoA"},{"word":"comammox"},{"word":"marker gene"},{"word":"nitrification"}]},"article12":{"pmid":"28824600","title":"Antibiofilm and Antihyphal Activities of Cedar Leaf Essential Oil, Camphor, and Fenchone Derivatives against Candida albicans.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Candida albicans can form biofilms composed of yeast, hyphal, and pseudohyphal elements, and C. albicans cells in the hyphal stage could be a virulence factor.

Here, we examined the DPPIV dependency of biofilm formation of Prevotella aurantiaca. Three strains (two clinical strains AHN 37505 and 37552 and the type strain CCUG 57723) were incubated in three estradiol concentrations (30, 90, and 120 nmol/L). Regulation of DPPIV activity, biofilm and fimbria formation, and coaggregation of bacterial strains were analyzed after incubation with four concentrations (10 nM, 100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM) of dihydroxy-2,3-pentaedione (DPD), the universal precursor of autoinducer -2 (AI-2), and analogs (ethyl-DPD, butyl-DPD, and isobutyl-DPD) for 24 h. Estradiol enhanced the planktonic growth, coaggregation, and biofilm formation of P. aurantiaca strains. The whole cell extract of AHN 37505 had the highest DPPIV activity, followed by CCUG 57723 and AHN 37552.

Because anthranilate reduced intracellular c-di-GMP and enhanced swimming and swarming motilities in P. aeruginosa, V. vulnificus, B. subtilis, and S. enterica, it is likely that anthranilate disrupts biofilms by inducing the dispersion of these bacteria.

The surface properties and interactions of opposing monolayers of mannobiose (disaccharide of mannose) were probed using atomic force spectroscopy. Unlike its diastereoisomer lactose, mannobiose molecules exhibited lateral packing interactions that manifest on the surface scale as a self-recognizing latch. A break-in force is required for opposing surfaces to penetrate and a breakout (or self-adhesion force) of similar magnitude is required for penetrated surfaces to separate. A hierarchy of self-adhesion forces was distinguished as occurring at the single residue (∼25 pN), cluster (∼250 pN), monolayer (∼1.1 nN), and supramonolayer level. The break-in force and break-out force appear resilient to the presence of simple chaotropes that attenuate a layer of structured water around the mannose surface. The layer of structured water otherwise extends to distances several times longer than a mannobiose residue, indicating a long-range propagation of the hydrogen bonding imposed by the residues. The span of the structured water increases with the velocity of an approaching surface, similar to shear thickening, but fissures at higher approach velocities. Our studies suggest that mannose residues could guide interpathogen interactions, such as in biofilms, and serve as a moated fortress for pathogens to hide behind to resist detection and harsh environments.","authors":[{"name":"Hashanthi K Abeyratne-Perera"},{"name":"Preethi L Chandran"}],"keywords":[]},"article43":{"pmid":"28816520","title":"Emergence of two distinct subpopulations from Klebsiella pneumoniae grown in the stimulated microgravity environment.","date":"2018-06-21","abs":"To isolate and characterize the two phenotypically distinct subpopulations from Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal cultures grown in the simulate microgravity environment.","authors":[{"name":"Haili Wang"},{"name":"Wenliang Li"},{"name":"Lixiao Gu"},{"name":"Xiaofang Gao"},{"name":"Bin Ni"},{"name":"Haiteng Deng"},{"name":"Ruifu Yang"},{"name":"Yanping Han"}],"keywords":[{"word":"HARVs"},{"word":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"SMG"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"cellulose"},{"word":"crystal violet staining"},{"word":"high aspect ratio rotating wall vessels"},{"word":"phenotypic heterogeneity"},{"word":"quantitative proteomics"},{"word":"stimulated microgravity"},{"word":"type 3 fimbriae"},{"word":"yeast cell agglutination"}]},"article44":{"pmid":"28816432","title":"An Integrated Microsystem for Real-Time Detection and Threshold-Activated Treatment of Bacterial Biofilms.","date":"2019-01-14","abs":"Bacterial biofilms are the primary cause of infections in medical implants and catheters. Delayed detection of biofilm infections contributes to the widespread use of high doses of antibiotics, leading to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for systems that can rapidly detect and treat biofilm infections in situ. As a step toward this goal, in this work we have developed for the first time a threshold-activated feedback-based impedance sensor-treatment system for combined real-time detection and treatment of biofilms. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of impedimetric sensing to accurately monitor the growth of Escherichia coli biofilms in microfluidic flow cells by measuring the fractional relative change (FRC) in absolute impedance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of growth measurements as a threshold-activated trigger mechanism to initiate successful treatment of biofilms using bioelectric effect (BE), applied through the same sensing electrode array. This was made possible through a custom program that (a) monitored the growth and removal of biofilms within the microfluidic channels in real-time and (b) enabled the threshold-based activation of BE treatment. Such BE treatment resulted in a ∼74.8 % reduction in average biofilm surface coverage as compared to the untreated negative control. We believe that this smart microsystem for integrated biofilm sensing and treatment will enable future development of autonomous biosensors optimized for accurate real-time detection of the onset of biofilms and their in situ treatment, directly on the surfaces of medical implants.","authors":[{"name":"Sowmya Subramanian"},{"name":"Ekaterina I Tolstaya"},{"name":"Thomas E Winkler"},{"name":"William E Bentley"},{"name":"Reza Ghodssi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial biofilms"},{"word":"bioelectric effect"},{"word":"impedance sensing"},{"word":"interdigitated microelectrodes"},{"word":"microfluidics"},{"word":"microsystem"}]},"article45":{"pmid":"28816181","title":"Antimicrobial and Antiproliferative Activity of Bauhinia forficata Link and Cnidoscolus quercifolius Extracts commonly Used in Folk Medicine.","date":"2019-10-27","abs":"Bauhinia forficata and Cnidoscolus quercifolius plants are commonly used in folk medicine.

ARR is characterized by enhanced resistance to some pathogens at the late adult-vegetative and reproductive stages. While the transition to flowering does not cause the onset of ARR, both processes involve the MADS-domain transcription factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). In this study, ARR-defective svp mutants were found to accumulate reduced levels of intercellular SA compared with wild type in response to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Double mutant and overexpression analyses suggest that SVP and SOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1) act antagonistically, such that SVP is required for ARR to alleviate the negative effects of SOC1 on SA accumulation. In vitro, SA exhibited antibacterial and antibiofilm activity at concentrations similar to those measured in the intercellular space during ARR. In vivo, P. syringae pv. tomato formed biofilm-like aggregates in young susceptible plants, while this was drastically reduced in mature ARR-competent plants, which accumulate intercellular SA. Collectively, these results reveal a novel role for the floral regulators SVP and SOC1 in disease resistance and provide evidence that SA acts directly on pathogens as an antimicrobial agent.

Further, it is shown that the rearrangement of the hydrogel network helps to accommodate precipitated minerals into the network -in other words, the hydrogel self-adapts to the precipitated mineral- while maintaining the viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogel, despite the reinforcement caused by mineralization.

Bacterial biofilm in the endotracheal tube (ET) provides a notable and persistent source of pathogens that may cause VAP, and thus is important for VAP detection. However, during intubation microbial investigations in ET, samples are unavailable due to the infeasibility of collecting ET samples during intubation of neonates. It is therefore of great importance to find alternative sources of samples that can help identify the ET biofilm flora. In the present study, the microbial signatures of throat swabs and tracheal aspirates were compared with ET biofilm samples from VAP neonates using 16S ribosomal RNA gene polymerase chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), cloning and sequencing. Sequences were assigned to phylogenetic species using BLAST. Microbial diversity and richness among the three types of specimens were compared based on their DGGE fingerprints, and taxonomic characteristics based on the BLAST results. The microbial richness and diversity of ET biofilms were similar to tracheal aspirate yet significantly different from throat swab samples (P<0.05). Compared with ET biofilms, the overall constituent ratio of microflora was significantly different in throat swab and tracheal aspirate samples (P<0.05). However tracheal aspirate samples were useful for predicting Staphylococcus sp. in ET biofilms with a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 83.3%. The sensitivity for the combination of tracheal aspirate and throat swab samples to detect Staphylococcus sp. in ET biofilms was 100%.

MATERIAL AND METHODS When developing the standard, used as source materials were the published foreign guidelines for antibiotic therapy of prosthetic joint infections, the analysis of resistance of bacterial strains conducted in the Hospital in České Budějovice, a.s. and the assessment of strain resistance for the Czech Republic published by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net). Considered was also the availability of individual antibiotics in the Czech Republic and restricted prescription according to the Summary of Product Characteristics as specified in the State Institute for Drug Control marketing authorisation. The expert group composed of orthopaedists, microbiologists and infectious disease specialists elaborated the basic antibiotic guideline for choosing an appropriate antibiotic/antifungal drug based on the usual susceptibility, its dose and dosage interval for initial and continuation therapy. The comments of individual specialists were gradually incorporated therein and in case of doubts majority rule was applied. The drafted document was sent for peer reviews to clinical orthopaedic, infectious disease and microbiological centres, whose comments were also incorporated and the finalised document was submitted for evaluation to specialised medical societies. RESULTS The outcome is the submitted guideline for antibiotic curative and suppressive therapy suitable for managing the prosthetic joint infections, which was approved by the committee of the Czech Society for Orthopaedics and Traumatology andthe Society for Infectious Diseases of the Czech Medical Association of J. E. Purkyně. DISCUSION Curative therapy of total joint replacement infections consists primarily in surgical treatment and has to be accompanied by adequate antibiotic therapy administered initially intravenously and later orally over a sufficient period of time. Bearing in mind the wide spectrum of pathogens that can cause infections of a joint replacement and their capacity to form a biofilm on foreign materials, the correct choice of an antibiotic, its dose and dosage interval are essential for successful treatment. Such standard should respect regional availability of antibiotics, regional pathogen resistance/susceptibility and ensure the achievement of sufficiently high concentrations at the requested location including anti-biofilm activity. CONCLUSIONS The submitted guideline is not the only treatment option for joint total replacement infections, but it makes the decisionmaking easier when treating these complications in the form of infections. The final choice of an antibiotic, its dose and duration of therapy shall be based on a critical assessment of results of microbiological (blood culture and molecular genetic) tests and reflect the patient s clinical condition. Since these are multidisciplinary issues, we consider useful for this guideline to be commented upon and approved by the committee of both the Society for Orthopaedics and Infectious Diseases so that it can become the starting point for treatment. Key words: total joint replacement infection, TEP, ATB, antibiotic therapy, consensus meeting, guideline.","authors":[{"name":"D Musil"},{"name":"M Balejová"},{"name":"M Horníková"},{"name":"A Chrdle"},{"name":"N Mallátová"},{"name":"O Nyč"},{"name":"V Chmelík"},{"name":"J Gallo"},{"name":"D Jahoda"},{"name":"J Stehlík"}],"keywords":[]},"article68":{"pmid":"28809546","title":"Staphylococcus aureus CidC Is a Pyruvate:Menaquinone Oxidoreductase.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Recent studies have revealed an important role for the Staphylococcus aureus CidC enzyme in cell death during the stationary phase and in biofilm development and have contributed to our understanding of the metabolic processes that are important in the induction of bacterial programmed cell death (PCD).

We herein present a strategy to remove Streptococcus mutans biofilms through a spontaneous exfoliation by the synergistic effect between zwitterion and sugar alcohols. It is assumed that the anionic site of zwitterion can be coupled with sugar alcohols and the cationic site remains in the state of lacking electrons. The cationic site allows the complexes to be delivered to negatively charged exopolysaccharides of biofilms. This strategy facilitates a significant increase in the ability of sugar alcohols to disperse aggregated exopolysaccharides. In this work, it was demonstrated that the mixture of betaine and erythritol existed as a complex in water and that the complex induced a spontaneous detachment of biofilms from the surface to which the biofilms had been adhered. This detachment resulted from a reduction in adhesive forces of the biofilms due to an increase in solubility of bacterial exopolysaccharides. The effects triggered by the formation of complex between zwitterion and sugar alcohol provide a simple and safe way to remove biofilms without antibiotics and physical forces.","authors":[{"name":"Jong Hyun Lim"},{"name":"Sang-Hun Song"},{"name":"Hyun-Sub Park"},{"name":"Jeong Rae Lee"},{"name":"Sang-Min Lee"}],"keywords":[]},"article71":{"pmid":"28808205","title":"Farnesol inhibits development of caries by augmenting oxygen sensitivity and suppressing virulence-associated gene expression inStreptococcus mutans.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Streptococcus mutans is a primary etiological agent of dental caries.

In this study, we hypothesized that farnesol inhibits caries development in vitro and interferes with biofilm formation by regulating virulence-associated gene expression. The inhibitory effects of farnesol to S. mutans biofilms on enamel surfaces were investigated by determining micro-hardness and calcium measurements. Additionally, the morphological changes ofS. mutans biofilms were compared using field emission scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, and the vitality and oxygen sensitivity ofS. mutans biofilms were compared using MTT assays. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of farnesol's effects, expressions of possible target genesluxS, brpA, ffh, recA, nth, and smx were analyzed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR. Farnesol-treated groups exhibited significantly higher micro-hardness on the enamel surface and lower calcium concentration of the supernatants as compared to the-untreated control. Microscopy revealed that a thinner film with less extracellular matrix formed in the farnesol-treated groups. As compared to the-untreated control, farnesol inhibited biofilm formation by 26.4% with 500 µmol/L and by 37.1% with 1,000 µmol/L (P<0.05).

Changes in the chloroplasts structure and the photosynthetic activity of the cells under AgNP exposure were made using confocal laser microscopy and digital image analysis and the estimation of growth inhibition rate was made using a biomass assay. In the majority of cases, treatment with AgNP caused a time and dose dependant degradation of chloroplasts and decrease in the photosynthetic activity of cells leading to the inhibition of aerial algae growth.

Its pathophysiology includes hyperseborrhoea, abnormal follicular keratinization and Propionibacterium acnes proliferation in the pilosebaceous unit. Recent research has shed some new light on the involvement of the sebaceous gland, as well as on the pro-inflammatory activity of the cutaneous microbiome. During puberty, alteration of the sebaceous lipid profile, called dysseborrhoea, stress, irritation, cosmetics and potential dietary factors lead to inflammation and formation of different types of acne lesions. Dysbiosis, the process leading to a disturbed skin barrier and disequilibrium of the cutaneous microbiome, resulting in the proliferation of P. acnes strains, is another important process that triggers acne. P. acnes activates the innate immunity via the expression of protease activated receptors (PARs), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α and toll-like receptors (TLRs), and the production of interferon (INF) γ, interleukins (IL-8, IL12, IL-1), TNF, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by keratinocytes, resulting in the hyperkeratinization of the pilosebaceous unit. Rebalancing the natural microbiome of the skin by restoring the natural skin barrier, limiting the proliferation of P. acnes on the skin by using topical antibacterials which do not cause resistance and regulating quantity and quality of sebum will be the main acne treatment challenges in the future.

Here, the traditional AgNP-based antibacterial technology is reimagined, now forming the base for an electroenhanced antimicrobial coating. To integrate AgNPs in an electrically conducting polymer layer, a simple, yet effective chemical strategy based on poly(hydroxymethyl 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT-MeOH:PSS) and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane is designed. The resultant PEDOT-MeOH:PSS-AgNP composite presents a consistent coating of covalently linked AgNPs, as shown by scanning electron microscopy and surface plasmon resonance analysis. The efficacy of the coatings, with and without electrical addressing, is then tested against Staphylococcus aureus, a major colonizer of medical implants. Using custom-designed culturing devices, a nearly complete prevention of biofilm growth is obtained in AgNP composite devices addressed with a square wave voltage input.

For this purpose, a comprehensive evaluation of the primary bioreceptivity to phototrophic biofilms of eleven varieties of granitic rocks, commonly used as building material, was carried out. Blocks were inoculated with a multi-species phototrophic culture and subjected to standardised growth conditions for three months. Biofilm formation was assessed by chlorophyll (chl) fluorescence, colour measurements and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) quantification. Relationships between the biofilm growth indicators and the properties of the different rocks studied were then analysed. Results showed that the bioreceptivity of the granites is more strongly affected by the physical characteristics of the stones than by their chemical and mineralogical properties, possibly because of the similar composition of the rocks studied. Growth of phototrophic biofilms was enhanced by high open porosity, capillary water content and surface roughness, and the bioreceptivity of weathered granites was higher than that of sound granites. The results obtained can therefore help in the selection of appropriate lithotypes for building purposes. The amounts of EPS produced by subaerial biofilms primarily depended on the requirements and/or characteristics of the biofilm-forming microorganisms, rather than on the bioreceptivity of the substratum, and microorganisms produce the amounts of EPS required at the initial stage of establishment on the stone surface, independently of the subsequent biomass development. These findings are especially important from the point of view of biodeterioration, in which the EPS matrix plays a central role.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Vázquez-Nion"},{"name":"Benita Silva"},{"name":"Beatriz Prieto"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biodeterioration"},{"word":"Cyanobacteria"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)"},{"word":"Green algae"},{"word":"Multi-species phototrophic culture"},{"word":"Primary bioreceptivity"}]},"article99":{"pmid":"28801691","title":"A new data processing routine facilitating the identification of surface adhered proteins from bacterial conditioning films via QCM-D/MALDI-ToF/MS.","date":"2018-04-30","abs":"Conditioning films are an important factor in the initiation and development of microbial biofilms, which are the leading cause of chronic infections associated with medical devices.

M. xanthus responds to the compression-induced deformation of polysaccharide substrates by preferentially spreading across the surface perpendicular to the axis of compression. Our results suggest that M. xanthus is not responding to the water that accumulates on the surface of the polysaccharide substrate after compression or to compression-induced changes in surface topography such as the formation of troughs. These directed surface movements do, however, consistently match the orientation of the long axes of aligned and tightly packed polysaccharide fibers in compressed substrates, as indicated by behavioral, birefringence and small angle X-ray scattering analyses. Therefore, we suggest that the directed movements are a response to the physical arrangement of the polymers in the substrate and refer to the directed movements as polymertropism.

Linear stability analysis suggested that the ripples were Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities. The analysis also predicted a strong dependence of the instability formation on biofilm viscosity explaining the different surface corrugations observed. Turbulence through Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities occurring at the interface demonstrated that the biofilm flows like a viscous liquid under high flow velocities applied within milliseconds.

Quorum sensing inhibition (QSI) is an effective approach for the prevention of biofilm formation. A Gram-negative bacterium, Delftia tsuruhatensis SJ01, was isolated from the rhizosphere of a species of sedge (Cyperus laevigatus) grown along the coastal-saline area. The isolate SJ01 culture and bacterial crude extract showed QSI activity in the biosensor plate containing the reference strain Chromobacterium violaceum CV026. A decrease in the violacein production of approximately 98% was detected with the reference strain C. violaceum CV026. The bacterial extract (strain SJ01) exhibited anti-quorum sensing activity and inhibited the biofilm formation of clinical isolates wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and P. aeruginosa PAH. A non-toxic effect of the bacterial extract (SJ01) was detected on the cell growth of the reference strains as P. aeruginosa viable cells were present within the biofilm. It is hypothesized that the extract (SJ01) may change the topography of the biofilm and thus prevent bacterial adherence on the biofilm surface. The extract also inhibits the motility, virulence factors (pyocyanin and rhamnolipid) and activity (elastase and protease) in P. aeruginosa treated with SJ01 extract. The potential active compound present was identified as 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diisooctyl ester. Microarray and transcript expression analysis unveiled differential expression of quorum sensing regulatory genes. The key regulatory genes, LasI, LasR, RhlI, and RhlR were down-regulated in the P. aeruginosa analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. A hypothetical model was generated of the transcriptional regulatory mechanism inferred in P. aeruginosa for quorum sensing, which will provide useful insight to develop preventive strategies against the biofilm formation. The potential active compound identified, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diisooctyl ester, has the potential to be used as an anti-pathogenic drug for the treatment of biofilm-forming pathogenic bacteria. For that, a detailed study is needed to investigate the possible applications.","authors":[{"name":"Vijay K Singh"},{"name":"Avinash Mishra"},{"name":"Bhavanath Jha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"anti-quorum"},{"word":"microarray"},{"word":"quorum network"},{"word":"quorum quenching"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"virulence factors"}]},"article116":{"pmid":"28798773","title":"Planktonic Growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa around a Dual-Species Biofilm Supports the Growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum within That Biofilm.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The goal of this study was to understand the potential interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Fusobacterium nucleatum within the middle ear.","authors":[{"name":"James C Wang"},{"name":"Joehassin Cordero"},{"name":"Yan Sun"},{"name":"Mayank Aranke"},{"name":"Randall Wolcott"},{"name":"Jane A Colmer-Hamood"},{"name":"Abdul N Hamood"}],"keywords":[]},"article117":{"pmid":"28798736","title":"Escherichia coli O157:H7 Acid Sensitivity Correlates with Flocculation Phenotype during Nutrient Limitation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains vary in acid resistance; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that result in strain specific differences. Among 25 STEC O157:H7 strains tested, 7 strains flocculated when grown statically for 18 h in minimal salts medium at 37°C, while 18 strains did not. Interestingly, the flocculation phenotype (cells came out of suspension) was found to correlate with degree of acid sensitivity in an assay with 400 mM acetic acid solution at pH 3.3 targeting acidified foods. Strains exhibiting flocculation were more acid sensitive and were designated FAS, for flocculation acid sensitive, while the acid resistant strain designated PAR for planktonic acid resistant. Flocculation was not observed for any strains during growth in complex medium (Luria Bertani broth). STEC strains B201 and B241 were chosen as representative FAS (2.4 log reduction) and PAR (0.15 log reduction) strains, respectively, due to differences in acid resistance and flocculation phenotype. Results from electron microscopy showed evidence of fimbriae production in B201, whereas fimbriae were not observed in B241.Curli fimbriae production was identified through plating on Congo red differential medium, and all FAS strains showed curli fimbriae production. Surprisingly, 5 PAR strains also had evidence of curli production. Transcriptomic and targeted gene expression data for B201 and B241indicated that csg and hde (curli and acid induced chaperone genes, respectively) expression positively correlated with the phenotypic differences observed for these strains. These data suggest that FAS strains grown in minimal medium express curli, resulting in a flocculation phenotype. This may be regulated by GcvB, which positively regulates curli fimbriae production and represses acid chaperone proteins. RpoS and other regulatory mechanisms may impact curli fimbriae production, as well. These findings may help elucidate mechanisms underlying differences among STEC strains in relating acid resistance and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Kathryn L Kay"},{"name":"Frederick Breidt"},{"name":"Pina M Fratamico"},{"name":"Gian M Baranzoni"},{"name":"Gwang-Hee Kim"},{"name":"Amy M Grunden"},{"name":"Deog-Hwan Oh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"GcvB"},{"word":"STEC"},{"word":"acid resistance"},{"word":"curli"},{"word":"nutrient limitation"}]},"article118":{"pmid":"28798735","title":"Phenotypic Heterogeneity in Attachment of Marine Bacteria toward Antifouling Copolymers Unraveled by AFM.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Up to recent years, bacterial adhesion has mostly been evaluated at the population level. Single cell level has improved in the past few years allowing a better comprehension of the implication of individual behaviors as compared to the one of a whole community. A new approach using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure adhesion forces between a live bacterium attached via a silica microbead to the AFM tipless cantilever and the surface has been recently developed. The objectives of this study is to examine the bacterial adhesion to a surface dedicated to ship hulls at the population and the cellular level to understand to what extent these two levels could be correlated. Adhesion of marine bacteria on inert surfaces are poorly studied in particular when substrata are dedicated to ship hulls. Studying these interactions in this context are worthwhile as they may involve different adhesion behaviors, taking place in salty conditions, using different surfaces than the ones usually utilized in the literacy. FRC (fouling release coatings)-SPC (self-polishing coatings) hybrids antifouling coatings have been used as substrata and are of particular interest for designing environmentally friendly surfaces, combining progressive surface erosion and low adhesion properties. In this study, a hybrid coating has been synthetized and used to study the adhesion of three marine bacteria, displaying different surface characteristics, using microplate assays associated with confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) and AFM. This study shows that the bacterial strain that appeared to have the weakest adhesion and biofilm formation abilities when evaluated at the population level using microplates assays and CSLM, displayed stronger adhesion forces on the same surfaces at the single cell level using AFM. In addition, one of the strains tested which presented a strong ability to adhere and to form biofilm at the population level, displayed a heterogeneous phenotypic behavior at the single cell level. Therefore, these results suggest that the evaluation of adhesion at the population level cannot always be correlated with adhesion forces measured individually by AFM and that some bacteria are prone to phenotypic heterogeneity among their population.","authors":[{"name":"Sofiane El-Kirat-Chatel"},{"name":"Aurore Puymege"},{"name":"The H Duong"},{"name":"Perrine Van Overtvelt"},{"name":"Christine Bressy"},{"name":"Lénaïk Belec"},{"name":"Yves F Dufrêne"},{"name":"Maëlle Molmeret"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AFM"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"copolymers surfaces"},{"word":"heterogeneity"},{"word":"marine bacteria"}]},"article119":{"pmid":"28798731","title":"Mechanisms and Regulation of Extracellular DNA Release and Its Biological Roles in Microbial Communities.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The capacity to release genetic material into the extracellular medium has been reported in cultures of numerous species of bacteria, archaea, and fungi, and also in the context of multicellular microbial communities such as biofilms. Moreover, extracellular DNA (eDNA) of microbial origin is widespread in natural aquatic and terrestrial environments. Different specific mechanisms are involved in eDNA release, such as autolysis and active secretion, as well as through its association with membrane vesicles. It is noteworthy that in microorganisms, in which DNA release has been studied in detail, the production of eDNA is coordinated by the population when it reaches a certain cell density, and is induced in a subpopulation in response to the accumulation of quorum sensing signals. Interestingly, in several bacteria there is also a relationship between eDNA release and the development of natural competence (the ability to take up DNA from the environment), which is also controlled by quorum sensing. Then, what is the biological function of eDNA? A common biological role has not been proposed, since different functions have been reported depending on the microorganism. However, it seems to be important in biofilm formation, can be used as a nutrient source, and could be involved in DNA damage repair and gene transfer. This review covers several aspects of eDNA research: (i) its occurrence and distribution in natural environments, (ii) the mechanisms and regulation of its release in cultured microorganisms, and (iii) its biological roles. In addition, we propose that eDNA release could be considered a social behavior, based on its quorum sensing-dependent regulation and on the described functions of eDNA in the context of microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Alejandra L Ibáñez de Aldecoa"},{"name":"Olga Zafra"},{"name":"José E González-Pastor"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"competence"},{"word":"extracellular DNA"},{"word":"horizontal gene transfer"},{"word":"microbial communities"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"social behavior"}]},"article120":{"pmid":"28798430","title":"Contemporary operative caries management: consensus recommendations on minimally invasive caries removal.","date":"2018-07-18","abs":"The International Caries Consensus Collaboration (ICCC) presented recommendations on terminology, on carious tissue removal and on managing cavitated carious lesions. It identified 'dental caries' as the name of the disease that dentists should manage, and the importance of controlling the activity of existing cavitated lesions to preserve hard tissues, maintain pulp sensibility and retain functional teeth in the long term. The ICCC recommended the level of hardness (soft, leathery, firm, and hard dentine) as the criterion for determining the clinical consequences of the disease and defined new strategies for carious tissue removal: 1) Selective removal of carious tissue - including selective removal to soft dentine and selective removal to firm dentine; 2) stepwise removal - including stage 1, selective removal to soft dentine, and stage 2, selective removal to firm dentine 6 to 12 months later; and 3) non-selective removal to hard dentine - formerly known as complete caries removal (a traditional approach no longer recommended). Adoption of these terms will facilitate improved understanding and communication among researchers, within dental educators and the wider clinical dentistry community. Controlling the disease in cavitated carious lesions should be attempted using methods which are aimed at biofilm removal or control first. Only when cavitated carious dentine lesions are either non-cleansable or can no longer be sealed, are restorative interventions indicated. Carious tissue is removed purely to create conditions for long-lasting restorations. Bacterially contaminated or demineralised tissues close to the pulp do not need to be removed. The evidence and, therefore these recommendations, supports minimally invasive carious lesion management, delaying entry to, and slowing down, the destructive restorative cycle by preserving tooth tissue, maintaining pulp sensibility and retaining the functional tooth-restoration complex long-term.","authors":[{"name":"A Banerjee"},{"name":"J E Frencken"},{"name":"F Schwendicke"},{"name":"N P T Innes"}],"keywords":[]},"article121":{"pmid":"28798159","title":"As-CATH1-6, novel cathelicidins with potent antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties from Alligator sinensis, play pivotal roles in host antimicrobial immune responses.","date":"2017-12-17","abs":"Crocodilians are regarded as possessing a powerful immune system. However, the composition and action of the crocodilian immune system have remained unclear until now. Cathelicidins, the principal family of host defense peptides, play pivotal roles in vertebrate immune defense against microbial invasions. However, cathelicidins from crocodilians have not been extensively studied to date. In the present study, six novel cathelicidins (As-CATH1-6) were identified and characterized from the endangered Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis). As-CATH1-6 exhibit no sequence similarity with any of the known cathelicidins. Structure analysis indicated that As-CATH1-3 adopt a random coil secondary conformation, whereas As-CATH4-6 were predicted to mainly adopt an amphipathic α-helix conformation. Among them, As-CATH4-6 exhibited potent, broad-spectrum and rapid antimicrobial activity by inducing the disruption of cell membrane integrity. They also exhibited strong ability to prevent the formation of bacterial biofilms and eradicate preformed biofilms. Furthermore, As-CATH4-6 exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse peritoneal macrophages. They directly neutralized LPS toxicity and therefore inhibited the binding of LPS to the TLR4 receptor and the subsequent activation of inflammatory response pathways. In a peritonitis mice model, As-CATH2-6 provided effective protection against bacterial infection through enhanced immune cell recruitment. In the host Chinese alligator, As-CATH1-6 are mainly expressed in immune organs and epithelial tissues. Bacterial infection significantly enhances their expression, which implies an important role in host anti-infective response. Taken together, the diversity and multiple functions of As-CATH1-6 partially reveal the powerful immune system of the Chinese alligator.","authors":[{"name":"Yan Chen"},{"name":"Shasha Cai"},{"name":"Xue Qiao"},{"name":"Mali Wu"},{"name":"Zhilai Guo"},{"name":"Renping Wang"},{"name":"Yi-Qun Kuang"},{"name":"Haining Yu"},{"name":"Yipeng Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alligator sinensis"},{"word":"As-CATHs"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"cathelicidin"},{"word":"host defense peptides (HDPs)"},{"word":"immunomodulatory"}]},"article122":{"pmid":"28797969","title":"Bioactive mesoporous silica nanostructures with anti-microbial and anti-biofilm properties.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The increasing rate of antibiotic resistant bacteria associated with nosocomial infections in severely ill patients has urged the need for new antibacterial therapies.

Almost all organisms, from eukaryotes to prokaryotes, have evolved enzymes to make and break these bonds. Accurate and efficient disulfide bond formation can be vital for protein function; therefore, the enzymes that catalyze disulfide bond formation are involved in multiple biological processes. Recent advances clearly show that oral bacteria also have the ability to from disulfide bonds, and this ability has an effect on a range of dental plaque-related phenotypes. In the gram-positive Streptococcus gordonii, the ability to form disulfide bonds affected autolysis, extracellular DNA release, biofilm formation, genetic competence, and bacteriocin production. In Actinomyces oris, disulfide bond formation is needed for pilus assembly, coaggregation, and biofilm formation. In other gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecalis, disulfide bonds are formed in secreted bacteriocins and required for activity. In these oral bacteria, the enzymes that catalyze the disulfide bonds are quite diverse and share little sequence homology, but all contain a CXXC catalytic active site motif and a conserved C-terminal cis-proline, signature features of a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase. Emerging evidence also indicates that gram-negative oral bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, use disulfide bonds to stabilize their outer membrane porin proteins. Bioinformatic screens reveal that these gram-negative bacteria carry genes coding for thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases in their genomes. In conclusion, disulfide bond formation in oral bacteria is an emerging field, and the ability to form disulfide bonds plays an important role in dental plaque formation and fitness for the bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"S F Lee"},{"name":"L Davey"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Actinomyces oris"},{"word":"Streptococcus gordonii"},{"word":"bacteriocins"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"oral bacteria"},{"word":"thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases"}]},"article128":{"pmid":"28797068","title":"Virulence profiles and innate immune responses against highly lethal, multidrug-resistant nosocomial isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii from a tertiary care hospital in Mexico.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Virulence profiles and innate immune responses were studied in Acinetobacter baumannii from nosocomial infections collected over one year in a tertiary care hospital in Mexico.

All isolates were genotyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The ability to form biofilm was determined on a polystyrene surface. The resistance to complement was determined with a pooled human normal serum and TNFα release by infected macrophages was determined by ELISA. The 112 isolates from this study were associated with a 52% of mortality. All were resistance to β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and trimethroprim-sulfamethoxal, 96 and 90% were resistant to meropenem and imipenem, respectively, but with high susceptibility to polymyxin B, colistin and tigecyclin. Isolates were classified in 11 different clones. Most isolates, 88% (99/112), were metallo-β-lactamases and carbapenemases producers, associated in 95% with the presence of blaOXA-72 gene. Only 4/99 and 1/99 of the carbapenem-resistant isolates were related to efflux mechanism to meropenem or imipenem resistance, respectively.

Strong biofilm formation and aminoglycoside resistance were associated with a not-cured outcome (P = 0.031 and P < 0.001, respectively). Based on gene-by-gene analysis, some accessory genes were more prevalent in isolates from the not-cured group. These included the biofilm-associated bhp gene, the antiseptic resistance qacA gene, the cassette chromosome recombinase-encoding genes ccrA and ccrB, and the IS256-like transposase gene. This study identifies biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance as associated with poor outcome in S. epidermidis ODRI. Whole-genome sequencing identified specific genes associated with a not-cured outcome that should be validated in future studies.

To understand the details of how the transcription factors function together to regulate biofilm formation, we used a systematic genetic interaction approach based on generating all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network genes and quantitatively analyzing the genetic interactions between them. Overall, the network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation with the six network heterozygous mutants all showing alterations in biofilm formation (haploinsufficiency). In addition, many double heterozygous mutants are as severely affected as homozygous deletions. As a result, the network shows properties of a highly interdependent 'small-world' network that is highly efficient but not robust. In addition, these genetic interaction data indicate that TEC1 represents a network component whose expression is highly sensitive to small perturbations in the function of other networks TFs. We have also found that expression of ROB1 is dependent on both auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other network TFs. Finally, the heterozygous NDT80 deletion mutant is hyperfilamentous under both biofilm and hyphae-inducing conditions in a TEC1-dependent manner. Taken together, genetic interaction analysis of this network has provided new insights into the functions of individual TFs as well as into the role of the overall network topology in its function.","authors":[{"name":"Virginia E Glazier"},{"name":"Thomas Murante"},{"name":"Daniel Murante"},{"name":"Kristy Koselny"},{"name":"Yuan Liu"},{"name":"Dongyeop Kim"},{"name":"Hyun Koo"},{"name":"Damian J Krysan"}],"keywords":[]},"article140":{"pmid":"28793083","title":"Oral health condition and reasons for tooth extraction among an adult population (20-64 years old).","date":"2018-05-03","abs":"The study characterized the oral health condition and main self-reported reasons for tooth extraction in an adult population.

However, relatively few studies have extensively examined the roles of individual residues and domains of globin-coupled diguanylate cyclases, which can shed light on their signaling mechanisms and provide drug targets. Here, we report the critical residues of two globin-coupled diguanylate cyclases, EcGReg from Escherichia coli and BpeGReg from Bordetella pertussis, and show that their diguanylate cyclase activity requires an intact globin domain. In the distal heme pocket of the globin domain, residues Phe42, Tyr43, Ala68 (EcGReg)/Ser68 (BpeGReg), and Met69 are required to maintain full diguanylate cyclase activity. The highly conserved amino acids His223/His225 and Lys224/Lys226 in the middle domain of EcGReg/BpeGReg are essential to diguanylate cyclase activity. We also identified sixteen important residues (Leu300, Arg306, Asp333, Phe337, Lys338, Asn341, Asp342, Asp350, Leu353, Asp368, Arg372, Gly374, Gly375, Asp376, Glu377, and Phe378) in the active site and inhibitory site of the diguanylate cyclase domain of EcGReg.

Although numerous proteomic studies of in vitro-grown microbial pathogens have been performed, in vivo proteomic approaches are still rare. In addition, increasing evidence supports that in vitro studies inadequately reflect in vivo conditions. Choosing the proper host is essential to detect the expression of proteins from the pathogen in vivo. Numerous studies have demonstrated the suitability of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model to in vivo studies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. In most zebrafish-pathogen studies, infection is achieved by microinjection of bacteria into the larvae. However, few reports using static immersion of bacterial pathogens have been published. In this study we infected 3 days post-fertilization (DPF) zebrafish larvae with P. aeruginosa PAO1 by immersion and injection and tracked the in vivo immune response by the zebrafish. Additionally, by using non-isotopic (Q-exactive) metaproteomics we simultaneously evaluated the proteomic response of the pathogen (P. aeruginosa PAO1) and the host (zebrafish). We found some zebrafish metabolic pathways, such as hypoxia response via HIF activation pathway, were exclusively enriched in the larvae exposed by static immersion. In contrast, we found that inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways was exclusively enriched in the larvae exposed by injection, while the integrin signaling pathway and angiogenesis were solely enriched in the larvae exposed by immersion. We also found important virulence factors from P. aeruginosa that were enriched only after exposure by injection, such as the Type-III secretion system and flagella-associated proteins. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa proteins involved in processes like biofilm formation, and cellular responses to antibiotic and starvation were enriched exclusively after exposure by immersion.

In order to understand the functional characteristics of B. animalis subsp. lactis, two isogenic strains that differ in their EPS-producing phenotype, due to a single mutation in the gene Balat_1410, were studied. By means of a double crossover recombination strategy, successfully used for the first time in bifidobacteria, Balat_1410 in the type strain B. animalis subsp. lactis DSM10140 was replaced by a mutated gene containing a non-synonymous mutation previously associated with the appearance of a mucoid-ropy phenotype. Nuclear magnetic resonance and SEC-MALS analyses showed that the novel strain harboring the mutation acquired a ropy phenotype, due to the production of a high molecular weight (HMW)-EPS that is not produced in the wild-type strain. Fluorescence labeling of both strains with two fluorescent proteins, m-Cherry and Green Fluorescent Protein, was achieved by expressing the corresponding genes under the control of a native selected promoter (the elongation factor Tu promoter). Remarkably, qualitative and quantitative fluorescence analyses demonstrated that the ropy strain displays a lower capability to adhere to human intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, the presence of the HMW-EPS reduced the capability of the producing strain to form biofilms upon three different abiotic surfaces. This work also highlights the fact that different EPS confer variable functional characteristics to the bifidobacterial surface, which may be relevant for the performance of B. animalis subsp. lactis as a probiotic.

Although melioidosis is most prevalent during the rainy season in endemic areas, domestic gardens and farms can also serve as a reservoir for B. pseudomallei during the dry season, in part due to irrigation and fertilizer use. In the environment, B. pseudomallei forms biofilms and persists in soil near plant root zones. Biofilms are dynamic bacterial communities whose formation is regulated by extracellular cues and corresponding changes in the nearly universal secondary messenger cyclic dimeric GMP. Recent studies suggest B. pseudomallei loads are increased by irrigation and the addition of nitrate-rich fertilizers, whereby such nutrient imbalances may be linked to the transmission epidemiology of this important pathogen. We hypothesized that exogenous nitrate inhibits B. pseudomallei biofilms by reducing the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP.

Using a sequence-defined library of B. pseudomallei 1026b transposon insertion mutants, we characterized the role of denitrification genes in biofilm formation in response to nitrate. Our results indicate that the denitrification pathway is implicated in B. pseudomallei biofilm growth dynamics and biofilm formation is inhibited by exogenous addition of sodium nitrate. Genomics analysis identified transposon insertional mutants in a predicted two-component system (narX/narL), a nitrate reductase (narGH), and a nitrate transporter (narK-1) required to sense nitrate and alter biofilm formation. Additionally, the results presented here show that exogenous nitrate reduces intracellular levels of the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP.

PQS export correlated strongly with OMV production, even though equivalent amounts of total PQS were produced by both strains. Interestingly, we discovered that poor OMV producers sequestered the majority of PQS in the inner membrane, which appeared to be the result of early saturation of the export pathway. Further analysis showed that strain-specific PQS export and OMV biogenesis patterns were stable once established but could be significantly altered by changing the growth medium. Finally, we demonstrated that the associations described for laboratory strains also held for three clinical strains. These results suggest that factors controlling the export of PQS dictate OMV biogenesis. This work provides new insight into PQS-controlled virulence in P. aeruginosa and provides important tools to further study signal export and OMV biogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Catalina Florez"},{"name":"Julie E Raab"},{"name":"Adam C Cooke"},{"name":"Jeffrey W Schertzer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PQS"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"outer membrane vesicles"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"secretion systems"}]},"article160":{"pmid":"28790201","title":"Division of Labor, Bet Hedging, and the Evolution of Mixed Biofilm Investment Strategies.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Bacterial cells, like many other organisms, face a tradeoff between longevity and fecundity.

This mixed strategy is favored because of a division of labor where exponentially dividing planktonic cells can act as an engine for the production of future biofilm cells, which grow more slowly. We use experimental evolution to test our predictions and show that phenotypic heterogeneity is persistent even under selection for purely planktonic or purely biofilm transmission. Furthermore, simulations suggest that maintenance of a biofilm subpopulation serves as a cost-effective hedge against environmental uncertainty, which is also consistent with our experimental findings.","authors":[{"name":"Nick Vallespir Lowery"},{"name":"Luke McNally"},{"name":"William C Ratcliff"},{"name":"Sam P Brown"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"evolution"},{"word":"microbial ecology"}]},"article161":{"pmid":"28790149","title":"Evaluation of Endotracheal Tube Scraping on Airway Resistance.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) are used to assess the readiness for discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.

However, the ecological consequences may depend on the disturbance history of microbial communities. To test this, we assessed the effects of fungicides and nutrients (four levels each) on the structural and functional resilience of leaf-associated microbial communities with differing disturbance histories (pristine vs. previously disturbed) in a 2 × 4 × 4-factorial design (n = 6) over 21 days. Microbial leaf breakdown was assessed as a functional variable, whereas structural changes were characterized by the fungal community composition, species richness, biomass, and other factors. Leaf breakdown by the pristine microbial community was reduced by up to 30% upon fungicide exposure compared with controls, whereas the previously disturbed microbial community increased leaf breakdown by up to 85%. This significant difference in the functional response increased in magnitude with increasing nutrient concentrations. A pollution-induced community tolerance in the previously disturbed microbial community, which was dominated by a few species with high breakdown efficacies, may explain the maintained function under stress. Hence, the global pressure on pristine ecosystems by agricultural expansion is expected to cause a modification in the structure and function of heterotrophic microbial communities, with microbially mediated leaf litter breakdown likely becoming more stable over time as a consequence of fungal community adaptions.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander Feckler"},{"name":"Willem Goedkoop"},{"name":"Marco Konschak"},{"name":"Rebecca Bundschuh"},{"name":"Kilian G J Kenngott"},{"name":"Ralf Schulz"},{"name":"Jochen P Zubrod"},{"name":"Mirco Bundschuh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"agricultural intensification"},{"word":"aquatic hyphomycetes"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"ecosystem function"},{"word":"fungicides"},{"word":"land use"},{"word":"nutrients"}]},"article164":{"pmid":"28787684","title":"Sequential reduction/oxidation of azo dyes in a three-dimensional biofilm electrode reactor.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"By combining sequential anaerobic-aerobic reactor and penetrable cathode-anode operation, a novel anaerobic/aerobic sequencing three-dimensional biofilm electrode reactor (3D-BER) was developed to evaluate the degradation of azo dye reactive brilliant red X-3B (RBRX-3B).

However, the accumulation and distribution of harbored elements and microbes in the different niches (loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm) and their corresponding potential contribution to water quality deterioration remain unknown. This precludes an in-depth understanding of water quality deterioration and the development of proactive management strategies. The present study quantitatively evaluated the distribution of elements, ATP, Aeromonas spp., and bacterial communities in distribution pipes (PVC-U, D = 110 mm, loose deposit and biofilm niches) and household connection pipes (HDPE, D = 32 mm, HDPE biofilm niches) at ten locations in an unchlorinated distribution system. The results show that loose deposits in PVC-U pipes, acting as sinks, constitute a hotspot (highest total amount per meter pipe) for elements, ATP, and target bacteria groups (e.g., Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., and Legionella spp.). When drinking water distribution system niches with harbored elements and microbes become sources in the event of disturbances, the highest quality deterioration potential (QDP) is that of HDPE biofilm; this can be attributed to its high surface-to-volume ratio. 16s rRNA analysis demonstrates that, at the genus level, the bacterial communities in the water, loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm were dominated, respectively, by Polaromonas spp. (2-23%), Nitrosipra spp. (1-47%), Flavobacterium spp. (1-36%), and Flavobacterium spp. (5-67%). The combined results of elemental composition and bacterial community analyses indicate that different dominant bio-chemical processes might occur within the different niches-for example, iron-arsenic oxidizing in loose deposits, bio-calumniation in PVC-U biofilm, and methane oxidizing in HDPE biofilm. The release of 20% loose deposits, 20% PVC-U biofilm and 10% HDPE biofilm will cause significant changes of water bacterial community.","authors":[{"name":"Gang Liu"},{"name":"Yu Tao"},{"name":"Ya Zhang"},{"name":"Maarten Lut"},{"name":"Willem-Jan Knibbe"},{"name":"Paul van der Wielen"},{"name":"Wentso Liu"},{"name":"Gertjan Medema"},{"name":"Walter van der Meer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Drinking water distribution system"},{"word":"Hotspot"},{"word":"Material accumulation"},{"word":"Next generation sequencing"},{"word":"Quality deterioration potential"}]},"article167":{"pmid":"28787633","title":"Stiffness signatures along early stages of Xylella fastidiosa biofilm formation.","date":"2018-07-09","abs":"The pathogenicity of Xylella fastidiosa is associated with its systematic colonization of the plant xylem, forming bacterial biofilms.

In this work, we show quantitative measurements on the elastic properties of the system composed by EPS and bacterial cell. In order to investigate the mechanical properties of this system, force spectroscopy and confocal Raman measurements were carried out during Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca initial stages of adhesion and cluster formation. We show that stiffness progressively decreases with increasing culture growth time, from two to five days. For early adhesion samples, stiffness values are quite different at the bacterial polar and body regions. Lower stiffness values at the cell pole suggest a flexible mechanical response at this region, associated with first cell adhesion to a surface. These results correlate very well with our observations of cell motion within microchannels, under conditions simulating xylem flow. Both the oscillatory movement of vertically attached single cells, as well as the transport of cell clusters within the biofilm matrix can be explained by the presence of softer materials at the cell pole and EPS matrix.

Infection severity, and in particular bacteraemia-associated mortality, has been attributed to several host-related factors, such as age and the presence of comorbidities. The role of the bacterium in infection severity is less well understood, as it is complicated by the multifaceted nature of bacterial virulence, which has so far prevented a robust mapping between genotype, phenotype and infection outcome. To investigate the role of bacterial factors in contributing to bacteraemia-associated mortality, we phenotyped a collection of sequenced clinical S. aureus isolates from patients with bloodstream infections, representing two globally important clonal types, CC22 and CC30. By adopting a genome-wide association study approach we identified and functionally verified several genetic loci that affect the expression of cytolytic toxicity and biofilm formation. By analysing the pooled data comprising bacterial genotype and phenotype together with clinical metadata within a machine-learning framework, we found significant clonal differences in the determinants most predictive of poor infection outcome. Whereas elevated cytolytic toxicity in combination with low levels of biofilm formation was predictive of an increased risk of mortality in infections by strains of a CC22 background, these virulence-specific factors had little influence on mortality rates associated with CC30 infections. Our results therefore suggest that different clones may have adopted different strategies to overcome host responses and cause severe pathology. Our study further demonstrates the use of a combined genomics and data analytic approach to enhance our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis at the individual level, which will be an important step towards personalized medicine and infectious disease management.","authors":[{"name":"Mario Recker"},{"name":"Maisem Laabei"},{"name":"Michelle S Toleman"},{"name":"Sandra Reuter"},{"name":"Rebecca B Saunderson"},{"name":"Beth Blane"},{"name":"M Estee Török"},{"name":"Khadija Ouadi"},{"name":"Emily Stevens"},{"name":"Maho Yokoyama"},{"name":"Joseph Steventon"},{"name":"Luke Thompson"},{"name":"Gregory Milne"},{"name":"Sion Bayliss"},{"name":"Leann Bacon"},{"name":"Sharon J Peacock"},{"name":"Ruth C Massey"}],"keywords":[]},"article171":{"pmid":"28785025","title":"Human Lipoproteins at Model Cell Membranes: Effect of Lipoprotein Class on Lipid Exchange.","date":"2019-03-20","abs":"High and low density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL) are thought to play vital roles in the onset and development of atherosclerosis; the biggest killer in the western world.

For neutron reflection, lipid exchange and lipid removal can be distinguished thanks to the combined use of hydrogenated and tail-deuterated lipids. Both HDL and LDL remove lipids from the bilayer and deposit hydrogenated material into the lipid bilayer, however, the extent of removal and exchange depends on LP type.

G. sulfurreducens forms electrically conductive, electrode-associated biofilms, but the biological structures mediating electrical conduction from cells to the electrodes are a matter of debate. Bacteria in these communities produce a network of fiber-like Type IV pili, which have been proposed to act either as inherent, protein-based electronic conductors, or as electronically inert scaffolds for cytochromes mediating long-range charge transport. Previous studies have examined pilus conduction mechanisms under vacuum and in dry conditions, but their conduction mechanism under physiologically relevant conditions has yet to be characterized. In this work, we isolate G. sulfurreducens pili, and compare the electronic conduction mechanism of both live biofilms and purified pili networks under dry and aqueous conditions. Solid-state I-V characteristics indicate that electronic transport in films of purified pili is representative of conduction in a fiber percolation network. Electrochemical gating measurements in a bipotentiostat device configuration confirm previous results suggesting redox currents dominate live biofilm conduction. Purified pili films, however, exhibit non-redox electronic conduction under aqueous, buffered conditions, and their conductivity increases with decreasing temperature. These findings show that isolated pili possess inherent, non-redox-mediated conductivity consistent with a metallic-like model of charge carrier transport. The results demonstrate an experimental platform for studying electronic transport in biomaterials and suggest that pili serve as an exemplary model for designing bioelectronic interfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Nicole L Ing"},{"name":"Tyler D Nusca"},{"name":"Allon I Hochbaum"}],"keywords":[]},"article181":{"pmid":"28783117","title":"The Role of Functional Amyloids in Multicellular Growth and Development of Gram-Positive Bacteria.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Amyloid fibrils play pivotal roles in all domains of life.

The functionalized capsules, when introduced into populations of bacteria, alter the dynamics of the AI-2 bacterial communication, attenuating QS activated phenotypes.

In such studies, the behavior of bacteria confined to interfaces or in the proximity of an interface plays an important role. For instance, many studies have probed collective behavior of bacteria in quasi two-dimensional systems such as soap films. Since fluid interfaces can adsorb surfactants and other materials, the stress and velocity boundary conditions at interfaces can alter bacteria motion; hydrodynamic studies of interfaces with differing boundary conditions are reviewed. Also, bacteria in bulk can become trapped at or near fluid interfaces, where they colonize and form structures comprising secretions like exopolysaccharides, surfactants, living and dead bacteria, thereby creating Films of Bacteria at Interfaces (FBI). The formation of FBI is discussed at air-water, oil-water, and water-water interfaces, with an emphasis on film mechanics, and with some allusion to genetic functions guiding bacteria to restructure fluid interfaces. At air-water interfaces, bacteria form pellicles or interfacial biofilms. Studies are reviewed that reveal that pellicle material properties differ for different strains of bacteria, and that pellicle physicochemistry can act as a feedback mechanism to regulate film formation. At oil-water interfaces, a range of FBI form, depending on bacteria strain. Some bacteria-laden interfaces age from an initial active film, with dynamics dominated by motile bacteria, through viscoelastic states, to form an elastic film. Others remain active with no evidence of elastic film formation even at significant interface ages. Finally, bacteria can adhere to and colonize ultra-low surface tension interfaces such as aqueous-aqueous systems common in food industries. Relevant literature is reviewed, and areas of interest for potential application are discussed, ranging from health to bioremediation.","authors":[{"name":"Liana Vaccari"},{"name":"Mehdi Molaei"},{"name":"Tagbo H R Niepa"},{"name":"Daeyeon Lee"},{"name":"Robert L Leheny"},{"name":"Kathleen J Stebe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Active colloids"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Bioremediation"},{"word":"Collective behavior"},{"word":"Pellicles"}]},"article204":{"pmid":"28778149","title":"Strategies for optimizing BioNano and Dovetail explored through a second reference quality assembly for the legume model, Medicago truncatula.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Third generation sequencing technologies, with sequencing reads in the tens- of kilo-bases, facilitate genome assembly by spanning ambiguous regions and improving continuity.

Only a few classes of antifungal drugs are available, so the emergence of resistance to single drug classes and now multidrug resistance greatly hampers patient management. Azole resistance among Candida and Aspergillus species is one of the greatest challenges to clinical success, followed by echinocandin and multidrug resistance among some Candida species, especially Candida glabrata. The spread of agriculturally derived azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus and emerging threats such as multidrug resistant Candida auris are also alarming. The molecular mechanisms that cause drug resistance are naturally occurring in less susceptible species and are acquired in strains of susceptible organisms. Drug resistance mechanisms include altered drug-target interactions, reduced cellular drug concentrations mediated by drug efflux transporters, and permeability barriers associated with biofilms. Although C auris is inherently multidrug resistant, other strains typically develop resistance through stepwise selection of multiple drug-resistance mechanisms. Cellular stress induced by drug treatment promotes adaptation, which contributes to breakthrough resistance. Drug exposure also drives the emergence of resistance.

Five materials were tested: A new composite containing 3% of protein-repellent 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC); the composite with 0% MPC as control; commercial composite control; dental amalgam; resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI). A dental plaque microcosm biofilm model with human saliva as inoculum was used to investigate metabolic activity, colony-forming units (CFU), and lactic acid production. Composite with 3% MPC had flexural strength similar to those with 0% MPC and commercial composite control (p > 0.1), and much greater than RMGI (p < 0.05). Composite with 3% MPC had protein adsorption that was only 1/10 that of control composites (p < 0.05).

They can pose health risks to humans as they grow in hospital settings that include medical supplies and devices. In a previous study, the researchers discovered that bacteria/biofilm grew well on wetted external latex, male catheters. These results concerned the investigators and encouraged them to find ways for prohibiting the growth of bacteria/biofilm on the male catheters (which are made of natural rubber). They carried out a new study to assess the influence of metals and voltage for the growth of bacteria on these latex samples. For this purpose, a unique Rotation Disk Reactor was used to accelerate biofilm formation on external male catheter samples. This setup included a dip tank containing water and a rotating wheel with the attached latex samples (some of which had single electrodes while others had paired electrodes with applied voltage). The process allowed the samples to become wetted and also exposed them to microorganisms in the ambient air during each revolution of the wheel. The results (as viewed from SEM images) showed that when compared to the control sample, the presence of metals (brass, stainless steel, and silver) was generally effective in preventing bacterial growth. Also the use of voltage (9.5 volt battery) essentially eliminated the appearance of rod shaped bacteria in some of the samples. It can be concluded that the presence of metals significantly reduced bacterial growth on latex and the application of voltage was able to essentially eliminate bacteria, providing appropriate electrode combinations were used.","authors":[{"name":"Dana M Barry"},{"name":"Paul B McGrath"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"latex"},{"word":"metals"},{"word":"rotation disk reactor"},{"word":"voltage"}]},"article231":{"pmid":"28773004","title":"Anti-Caries Effects of Dental Adhesives Containing Quaternary Ammonium Methacrylates with Different Chain Lengths.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of dental adhesives containing quaternary ammonium methacrylates (QAMs) with different alkyl chain lengths (CL) on ecological caries prevention in vitro.

In the present review, we critically examine state-of-the-art studies on the interactions of Hg compounds with freshwater biofilms, with an emphasis on Hg accumulation, transformations, and effects. Freshwater biofilms contain both primary producers (e.g., algae) and decomposers (e.g., bacteria and fungi), which contribute to both aquatic food webs and the microbial loop. Hence they play a central role in shallow water and streams, and also contribute to Hg trophic transfer through their consumption. Both inorganic and methylated mercury compounds accumulate in biofilms, which could transform them mainly by methylation, demethylation, and reduction. Accumulated Hg compounds could induce diverse metabolic and physiological perturbations in the microorganisms embedded in the biofilm matrix and affect their community composition. The bioavailability of Hg compounds, their transformations, and their effects depend on their concentrations and speciation, ambient water characteristics, biofilm matrix composition, and microorganism-specific characteristics. The basic processes governing the interactions of Hg compounds with biofilm constituents are understudied. The development of novel conceptual and methodological approaches allowing an understanding of the chemo- and biodynamic aspects is necessary to improve the knowledge on Hg cycling in shallow water as well as to enable improved use of freshwater biofilms as potential indicators of water quality and to support better informed risk assessment.

However, although biological and chemical processes are represented in a number of Individual-based Models (IbMs) the interaction of growth and mechanics is limited. Conversely, there are mechanically sophisticated IbMs with only elementary biology and chemistry. This study focuses on addressing these limitations by developing a flexible IbM that can robustly combine the biological, chemical and physical processes that dictate the emergent properties of a wide range of bacterial communities. This IbM is developed by creating a microbiological adaptation of the open source Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS). This innovation should provide the basis for bottom up prediction of the emergent behaviour of entire microbial systems. In the model presented here, bacterial growth, division, decay, mechanical contact among bacterial cells, and adhesion between the bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances are incorporated. In addition, fluid-bacteria interaction is implemented to simulate biofilm deformation and erosion.

In addition, the results show that increased shear rate results in smoother and more compact biofilms.

The strains used were from different origins, such as clinical (Acinetobacter baumannii AB4), cosmetic industry (Klebsiella oxytoca EU213, Pseudomonas aeruginosa EU190), and environmental (Halomonas venusta MAT28). In general, dispersed cells adhered better to surfaces (measured as the biofilm index) and had a greater hydrophobicity [measured as the microbial affinity to solvents (MATS)] than planktonic cells. The susceptibility to two antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and tetracycline) of dispersed cells was higher compared with that of their planktonic counterparts (tested by the bactericidal index). Dispersed and planktonic cells exhibited differences in cell permeability, especially in efflux pump activity, which could be related to the differences observed in susceptibility to antibiotics. At 1 h of biofilm formation in microtiter plates, dispersed cells treated with therapeutic concentration of ciprofloxacin yielded a lower biofilm index than the control dispersed cells without ciprofloxacin. With respect to the planktonic cells, the biofilm index was similar with and without the ciprofloxacin treatment. In both cases there were a reduction of the number of bacteria measured as viable count of the supernatant. The lower biofilm formation in dispersed cells with ciprofloxacin treatment may be due to a significant increase of biofilm disruption with respect to the biofilm from planktonic cells. From a clinical point of view, biofilms formed on medical devices such as catheters, cells that can be related to an infection were the dispersed cells. Our results showed that early treatment with ciprofloxacin of dispersed cells could diminishe bacterial dispersion and facilitate the partial elimination of the new biofilm formed.","authors":[{"name":"Mercedes Berlanga"},{"name":"Laura Gomez-Perez"},{"name":"Ricardo Guerrero"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alginate-beads biofilms"},{"word":"Bactericidal index"},{"word":"Biofilm index"},{"word":"Cell-surface physicochemical properties"},{"word":"Susceptibility to antibiotics"}]},"article248":{"pmid":"28769901","title":"Fluorescence Imaging of Streptococcus pneumoniae with the Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA) As a Potential, Rapid Diagnostic Tool.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common human pathogen and a major causal agent of life-threatening infections that can either be respiratory or non-respiratory.

Our approach combines phylogenetic analysis and the presence of seven specific genes linked to biofilm formation in association with traditional microbiology techniques, using Mueller Hinton and chicken juice as substrates in order to quantify, classify, determine the composition and morphology of the biomass of simple and mixed biofilms of 30 C. jejuni strains. It also evaluates the inhibition of its formation by biocides commonly used in industry and also by zinc oxide nanoparticles. Genetic analysis showed high heterogeneity with the identification of 23 pulsotypes. Despite the diversity, the presence of flaA, cadF, luxS, dnaJ, htrA, cbrA, and sodB genes in all strains shows the high potential for biofilm formation. This ability was only expressed in chicken juice, where they presented phenotype of a strong biofilm producer, with a mean count of 7.37 log CFU/mL and an ultrastructure characteristic of mature biofilm. The composition of simple and mixed biofilms was predominantly composed by proteins. The exceptions were found in mixed biofilms with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which includes a carbohydrate-rich matrix, lower ability to sessile form in chicken juice and compact architecture of the biofilm, this aspects are intrinsic to this species. Hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and peracetic acid were more effective in controlling viable cells of C. jejuni in biofilm, but the existence of tolerant strains indicates exposure to sublethal concentrations and development of adaptation mechanisms.

The results showed under specific conditions, the PEG density was highest with grafting under cloud point conditions.

In addition, all modified surfaces were tested with protein solutions and in cell (mesenchymal stem cells and MG63 osteoblast-like cells) and bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) attachment assays. Overall, the lowest protein adsorption was observed on the highest polymer graft density, bacterial adhesion was very low on all modified surfaces, and it can be seen that the attachment of mammalian cells gradually increased as the PEG grafting density decreased, reaching the maximum attachment at medium PEG densities.

The c-di-GMP network has a bow-tie shaped architecture that integrates many signals from the outside world-the input stimuli-into intracellular c-di-GMP levels that then regulate genes for biofilm formation or for swarming motility-the output phenotypes. How does the 'uninformed' process of evolution produce a network with the right input/output association and enable bacteria to make the right choice? Inspired by new data from 28 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains evolved in laboratory experiments we propose a mathematical model where the c-di-GMP network is analogous to a machine learning classifier. The analogy immediately suggests a mechanism for learning through evolution: adaptation though incremental changes in c-di-GMP network proteins acquires knowledge from past experiences and enables bacteria to use it to direct future behaviors. Our model clarifies the elusive function of the ubiquitous c-di-GMP network, a key regulator of bacterial social traits associated with virulence.

However, neglect of the conjugated natural estrogens (C-NEs) has caused large discrepancies among different studies on the removal of NEs in WWTPs. The present work investigated the transformation and fate of three NEs and six corresponding C-NEs along wastewater treatment processes. The removal efficiencies of the target estrogens (i.e., NEs and C-NEs) and their correlations with the operational parameters were determined over a twelve-month monitoring period at a typical WWTP adopting a combined bio-treatment process (i.e., anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process followed by a moving-bed biofilm reactor). The concentration variations of the target estrogens along the treatment processes were examined to differentiate the transformation and fate of NEs and C-NEs. Moreover, lab-scale experiments were conducted to clarify the removal pathways of C-NEs in the bio-treatment process. Results indicate that both NEs and C-NEs could pass through the treatment processes, thus being frequently detected in the effluent and excess sludge. The aqueous removal efficiencies of NEs and C-NEs were significantly correlated with the sludge retention time and temperature, respectively. C-NEs were more persistent than NEs, so considerably high conjugated ratios (13.5-100.0%) were detected in the effluent. Sulfate conjugates presented a lower adsorption affinity to sludge and a slower hydrolysis rate than glucuronide conjugates, which makes the former more recalcitrant to biodegradation. This study highlights the challenge on the elimination of NEs, particularly their conjugates, by wastewater treatment processes.","authors":[{"name":"Weiwei Ben"},{"name":"Bing Zhu"},{"name":"Xiangjuan Yuan"},{"name":"Yu Zhang"},{"name":"Min Yang"},{"name":"Zhimin Qiang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Conjugates"},{"word":"Natural estrogens"},{"word":"Operational parameters"},{"word":"Removal pathways"},{"word":"Wastewater treatment plants"}]},"article267":{"pmid":"28763526","title":"Bacterial recovery using sonication versus swabbing of titanium and stainless steel implants inoculated with Staphylococcus pseudintermedius or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"To evaluate the use of sonication to improve recovery of bacteria from metal discs infected with bacteria commonly associated with implant infections in veterinary medicine.","authors":[{"name":"Thomas Keeshen"},{"name":"J Brad Case"},{"name":"James F Wellehan"},{"name":"Mauricio Dujowich"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"orthopaedic implants"},{"word":"sonication"},{"word":"surgical site infection"}]},"article268":{"pmid":"28763494","title":"Global assessment of small RNAs reveals a non-coding transcript involved in biofilm formation and attachment in Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Many strains of Acinetobacter baumannii have been described as being able to form biofilm. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) control gene expression in many regulatory circuits in bacteria.

The global analysis of the small RNA transcriptome revealed different sRNA expression patterns in planktonic and biofilm associated cells, with some of the transcripts only expressed or repressed in sessile bacteria. A total of 255 sRNAs were detected, with 185 of them differentially expressed in the different types of cells. A total of 9 sRNAs were expressed only in biofilm cells, while the expression of other 21 coding regions were repressed only in biofilm cells. Strikingly, the expression level of the sRNA 13573 was 120 times higher in biofilms than in planktonic cells, an observation that prompted us to further investigate the biological role of this non-coding transcript. Analyses of an isogenic mutant and over-expressing strains revealed that the sRNA 13573 gene is involved in biofilm formation and attachment to A549 human alveolar epithelial cells.

Moreover, dysbiosis with overgrowth of anaerobic pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, may induce death of both immune cells and host resident cells. Necroptosis is one newly characterized programmed cell death mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase like (MLKL). With its release of death-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into extracellular environment, necroptosis may help transmit the danger signal and amplify the inflammatory responses.

However, major advances regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the induction, regulation and effector functions of immune and inflammatory responses necessitate a reassessment of their work and its integration with emerging new concepts. We now know that each type of leukocyte is actually represented by functionally distinct subsets with different, or even conflicting, roles in immunity and inflammation. Unexpectedly, neutrophils, traditionally regarded as merely antimicrobial effectors in acute conditions and protagonists of the 'initial' lesion, are currently appreciated for their functional versatility and critical roles in chronic inflammation. Moreover, an entirely new field of study, osteoimmunology, has emerged and sheds light on the impact of immunoinflammatory events on the skeletal system. These developments and the molecular dissection of crosstalk interactions between innate and adaptive leukocytes, as well as between the immune system and local homeostatic mechanisms, offer a more nuanced understanding of the host response in periodontitis, with profound implications for treatment.

Research in the discipline has uncovered a concerted effort of the microbiome, using an array of survival strategies, to interact with other bacteria and host cells. These strategies aid in colonization by 'ambushing, infiltrating and outflanking' host cells and molecules, responding to local environmental changes (including booby traps for host biomolecules), communicating within and between genera and species that provide MASINT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence) to enhance sustained survival, sabotage the host inflammatory and immune responses and by potentially adopting a 'Fabian strategy' with a war of attrition and resulting disease manifestations. Additionally, much has been learned regarding the ever-increasing complexity of the host-response armamentarium at both cellular and molecular levels that is addressed in this review. Knowledge regarding how these systems fully interact requires both new laboratory and clinical tools, as well as sophisticated modeling of the networks that help maintain homeostasis and are dysregulated in disease.

In contrast, reliance solely on physical measurements of probing depth and/or attachment loss under-recognizes the true impact that periodontitis may have on the well-being of individuals. It is currently unclear whether inclusion of the psychosocial and systemic dimensions of the disease in case definitions would result in higher or lower prevalence estimates. The review concludes that periodontitis should no longer be defined solely by gingival/periodontal inflammation in the presence of increased probing depths and attachment loss but should incorporate additional dimensions capturing impaired function, esthetics, and impact on general health and quality of life. A multidimensional approach to the assessment of periodontitis would facilitate an improved understanding of its epidemiology and consequences.","authors":[{"name":"Panos N Papapanou"},{"name":"Cristiano Susin"}],"keywords":[]},"article291":{"pmid":"28758296","title":"Failing to meet the goals of periodontal recall programs.

The principal goals of supportive care are to achieve a high standard of plaque control, minimize bleeding and maintain pockets at less than 6 mm. Gain of attachment around natural teeth during supportive periodontal care has been reported, although gain of attachment and of bone during supportive care may be a more pragmatic and aspirational aim in the longer term. Furthermore, we occasionally see patients for whom, despite excellent home and professional care (surgical or nonsurgical), including the management of risk factors, supportive periodontal care appears to be failing and therefore for such patients the clinician needs to consider further management options. This review considers, in particular, the options of using local or systemically delivered antimicrobials to eradicate periodontal and peri-implant disease progression and discusses the extent to which culture and sensitivity testing before the prescription of systemically delivered antimicrobials may be a cost-effective alternative to prescribing 'blind'.","authors":[{"name":"Giles McCracken"},{"name":"Abisola Asuni"},{"name":"Mark Ritchie"},{"name":"Christopher Vernazza"},{"name":"Peter Heasman"}],"keywords":[]},"article292":{"pmid":"28758290","title":"Crystal structure of master biofilm regulator CsgD regulatory domain reveals an atypical receiver domain.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The master regulator CsgD switches planktonic growth to biofilm formation by activating synthesis of curli fimbriae and cellulose in Enterobacteriaceae.

In particular, biofilm-associated infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are difficult to eradicate because the biofilm is strongly resistant to antibiotics and the host immune response. There is no effective treatment for biofilm-associated infectionss, except for surgical removal of contaminated medical devices followed by antibiotic therapy. Here we show that norgestimate, an acetylated progestin, effectively inhibits biofilm formation by staphylococcal strains, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, without inhibiting their growth, decreasing the selective pressure for emergence of resistance. 17-Deacetyl norgestimate, a metabolite of norgestimate, shows much weaker inhibitory activity against staphylococcal biofilm formation, indicating that the acetyl group of norgestimate is important for its activity. Norgestimate inhibits staphylococcal biofilm formation by inhibiting production of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin and proteins in the extracellular matrix. Proteome analysis of S. aureus indicated that norgestimate represses the expression of the cell wall-anchored protein SasG, which promotes intercellular adhesion, and of the glycolytic enzyme enolase, which plays a secondary role in biofilm formation. Notably, norgestimate induces remarkable changes in cell wall morphology, characterized by increased thickness and abnormal rippled septa. Furthermore, norgestimate increases the expression level of penicillin binding protein 2 and resensitizes methicillin-resistant S. aureus to β-lactam antibiotics. These results suggest that norgestimate is a promising lead compound for the development of drugs to treat biofilm-associated infections, as well as for its ability to resensitize methicillin-resistant S. aureus to β-lactam antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Yutaka Yoshii"},{"name":"Ken-Ichi Okuda"},{"name":"Satomi Yamada"},{"name":"Mari Nagakura"},{"name":"Shinya Sugimoto"},{"name":"Tetsuo Nagano"},{"name":"Takayoshi Okabe"},{"name":"Hirotatsu Kojima"},{"name":"Takeo Iwamoto"},{"name":"Kazuyoshi Kuwano"},{"name":"Yoshimitsu Mizunoe"}],"keywords":[]},"article295":{"pmid":"28757274","title":"Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of biofilm formation among Staphylococcus aureus isolates from clinical specimens, an Atomic Force Microscopic (AFM) study.","date":"2018-04-30","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of nosocomial infections.

CNS from the udder are not necessarily associated with intramammary infections. In fact, some commensal CNS have been shown to have biological activities. This issue led us to screen exoproducts from commensal Staphylococcus chromogenes for anti-biofilm activity against different mastitis pathogens.

Chensinin-1b exhibited antibacterial activity against the tested multiple-drug-resistant bacteria with a MIC ranging between 1.56 and 50μM, except E. cloacae strain 0320 (MREC0320), P. fluorescens strain 0322 (MRPF0322) and E. aerogenes strain 0320 (MREA0320). However, the MIC (25μM) of chensinin-1b to multiple-drug-resistant P. aeruginosa strain (MRPA 0108) was 16-fold higher than that observed to P. aeruginosa susceptible strain CGMCC 1.860 (PA1860). Chensinin-1b was able to disturb the integration of the cytoplasmic membrane of PA1860 and MRPA0108 cells similarly, but the outer membrane permeability of MRPA0108 cells was significantly lower. This low permeability was associated with increased expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane and a decrease in negatively charged phospholipids in the outer membrane leaflet. In addition, the biofilm of MRPA0108 was responsible for the reduced susceptibility to chensinin-1b. A higher concentration of chensinin-1b (12.5µM) was required to maximally inhibit the formation of MRPA0108 biofilm. Notably, chensinin-1b inhibited the formation of MRPA0108 biofilm at concentrations below its MIC value by down-regulating the level of PelA, algD, and PslA gene transcription. Importantly, chensinin-1b had a significant antibacterial effect against MRPA0108 in vivo. Administration of chensinin-1b to mice infected with MRPA 0108 significantly increased survival by 50-70%. Moreover, chensinin-1b reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and correspondingly reduced lung and liver tissue damage in the mouse model of septic shock induced by MRPA 0108.

Herein, the involvement of two factors previously described as being critical for S. suis serotype 2 virulence, whether the dipeptidyl peptidase IV and autolysin, were evaluated with regards to different ascribed functions using prototype strains belonging to important sequence types. Results demonstrate a lack of reproducibility with previously published data. In fact, the role of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV and autolysin as critical virulence factors could not be confirmed. Though certain in vitro functions may be ascribed to these factors, their roles are not unique for S. suis, probably due to compensation by other factors.

For example, its leaf surface microbiome could inhibit or attract eukaryotic epibionts which may overgrow the eelgrass leading to reduced primary productivity and subsequent eelgrass meadow decline. We used amplicon sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes to assess the leaf surface microbiome (prokaryotes) as well as eukaryotic epibionts in- and outside lagoons on the German Baltic Sea coast. Prokaryote microbiomes varied substantially both between sites inside lagoons and between open coastal and lagoon sites. Water depth, leaf area and biofilm chlorophyll a concentration explained a large amount of variation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic community composition. The prokaryotic microbiome and eukaryotic epibiont communities were highly correlated, and network analysis revealed disproportionate co-occurrence between a limited number of eukaryotic taxa and several bacterial taxa.

Attempts to explain the variability in elemental cycling consequently miss an important biological component and thereby impede a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes governing energy and matter flow and transformation. The fate of multiple chemical elements in ecosystems is strongly linked by biotic demand and uptake; thus, considering elemental stoichiometry is important for both biogeochemical and ecological research. Nonetheless, assessments of ecological stoichiometry (ES) often focus on the elemental content of biota rather than taking a more holistic view by examining both elemental pools and fluxes (e.g., organismal stoichiometry and ecosystem process rates). ES theory holds the promise to be a unifying concept to link across hierarchical scales of patterns and processes in ecology, but this has not been fully achieved. Therefore, we propose connecting the expertise of aquatic ecologists and biogeochemists with ES theory as a common currency to connect food webs, ecosystem metabolism, and biogeochemistry, as they are inherently concatenated by the transfer of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous through biotic and abiotic nutrient transformation and fluxes. Several new studies exist that demonstrate the connections between food web ecology, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem metabolism. In addition to a general introduction into the topic, this paper presents examples of how these fields can be combined with a focus on ES. In this review, a series of concepts have guided the discussion: (1) changing biogeochemistry affects trophic interactions and ecosystem processes by altering the elemental ratios of key species and assemblages; (2) changing trophic dynamics influences the transformation and fluxes of matter across environmental boundaries; (3) changing ecosystem metabolism will alter the chemical diversity of the non-living environment. Finally, we propose that using ES to link nutrient cycling, trophic dynamics, and ecosystem metabolism would allow for a more holistic understanding of ecosystem functions in a changing environment.","authors":[{"name":"Nina Welti"},{"name":"Maren Striebel"},{"name":"Amber J Ulseth"},{"name":"Wyatt F Cross"},{"name":"Stephen DeVilbiss"},{"name":"Patricia M Glibert"},{"name":"Laodong Guo"},{"name":"Andrew G Hirst"},{"name":"Jim Hood"},{"name":"John S Kominoski"},{"name":"Keeley L MacNeill"},{"name":"Andrew S Mehring"},{"name":"Jill R Welter"},{"name":"Helmut Hillebrand"}],"keywords":[{"word":"carbon quality"},{"word":"ecological stoichiometry"},{"word":"ecosystem function"},{"word":"element cycling"},{"word":"energy transfer"},{"word":"nutrient dynamics"},{"word":"trophic interactions"}]},"article333":{"pmid":"28747597","title":"Antimicrobial activity of ethylene-vinyl acetate containing bioactive filler against oral bacteria.","date":"2018-09-24","abs":"We developed an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) containing surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) filler, as a new mouthguard material for preventing intraoral bacterial infection.

Allelic exchange mutagenesis was also used to examine genes encoding putative trans-acting factors, and the impact of such mutations on brpA expression was analyzed by reporter assays. Multiple elements in the short brpA promoter (nucleotide -1 to -344 relative to start cordon ATG) were shown to have a major impact on brpA expression, including an FNR-box, for a putative binding site of an FNR-type of transcriptional regulator. When compared with the intact brpA promoter, mutations of the highly conserved nucleotides in FNR-box from TTGATgtttAcCtt to TTACAgaaaGtTac resulted in 1362-fold increases of luciferase activity (P < .001), indicative of the FNR-box-mediated repression as a major mechanism in regulation of brpA expression.

A hollow fiber membrane (HFM) in a benchtop device served as a CVC testing model to demonstrate the WISP concept. Porcine blood was pumped through the HFM while phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was infused through the HFM wall, creating the WISP boundary layer. Protein adherences on model CVC surfaces were measured and imaged. Analytical and finite volume lubrication models were used to justify the assumption of a blood-free boundary layer. We found a 92.2% reduction in average adherent protein density when WISP is used, compared with our model CVC without WISP flow. Lubrication models matched our experimental pressure drop measurements suggesting that a blood-free boundary layer was created.

The overall structures of Tps1 from Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus are essentially identical and reveal N- and C-terminal Rossmann fold domains that form the glucose-6-phosphate and UDP-glucose substrate binding sites, respectively.

These results suggest that Tps1 enzymatic functionality is essential for the fungal stress response and virulence. Furthermore, structures of Tps1 in complex with the nonhydrolyzable inhibitor, validoxylamine A, visualize the transition state and support an internal return-like catalytic mechanism that is generalizable to other GT-B-fold retaining glycosyltransferases.

Although previous work reported the effect of electric fields on bacterial mortality for a variety of medical and engineered applications, the effect of electrode surface properties and the magnitude and polarity of applied electric fields on biofilm development has not been comprehensively investigated. This paper studies the formation of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm on a Papyex graphite (PA) and a carbon aerogel (CA) in the presence and the absence of an electric field. The experiments were conducted using a two-electrode flow cell with a voltage window of ±0.9 V. The CA was less susceptible to biofilm formation compared to the PA due to its lower surface roughness, lower hydrophobicity, and significant antimicrobial properties. For both positive and negative applied potentials, we observed an inverse relationship between biofilm formation and the magnitude of the applied potential. The effect is particularly strong for the CA electrodes and may be a result of cumulative effects between material toxicity and the stress experienced by cells at high applied potentials. Under the applied potentials for both electrodes, high production of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) was indicative of bacterial stress. For both electrodes, the elevated specific ROS activity was lowest for the open circuit potential condition, elevated when cathodically and anodically polarized, and highest for the ±0.9 V cases. These high applied potentials are believed to affect the redox potential across the cell membrane and disrupt redox homeostasis, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth.","authors":[{"name":"Soumya Pandit"},{"name":"Sneha Shanbhag"},{"name":"Meagan Mauter"},{"name":"Yoram Oren"},{"name":"Moshe Herzberg"}],"keywords":[]},"article370":{"pmid":"28741862","title":"In vivo comparison of jellyfish and bovine collagen sponges as prototype medical devices.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Jellyfish have emerged as a source of next generation collagen that is an attractive alternative to existing sources, such as bovine and porcine, due to a plentiful supply and providing a safer source through lack of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) transmission risk and potential viral vectors, both of which could be transmitted to humans. Here we compare collagen implantable sponges derived for the first time from the Rhizostoma pulmo jellyfish. A further novelty for the research was that there was a comparison for sponges that were either uncrosslinked or crosslinked using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), and an assessment on how this affected resorption, as well as their biocompatibility compared to bovine type I collagen sponges. The scaffolds were prepared and examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The samples were implanted in adult male Wistar rats for in vivo experimentation. Both crosslinked and uncrosslinked jellyfish collagen sponges showed a significant reduction in histopathology scores over the course of the study, whereas the bovine collagen sponge scores were not significantly reduced. Both jellyfish collagen sponges and the bovine sponge were tolerated well by the hosts, and a recovery was visible in all samples, suggesting that R. pulmo jellyfish-derived collagen could offer compelling biocompatibility with wound healing applications.

Two main mathematical approaches for biomass representation can be distinguished: continuum and discrete. This review is aimed at exploring the main characteristics of each approach. Continuum models can simulate the biofilm processes in a quantitative and deterministic way.

In this study, the proteome of L. sakei CRL1862 grown either under biofilm on stainless steel surface and planktonic modes of growth at 10°C, was investigated. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, 29 out of 43 statistically significant spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Ten proteins resulted up-regulated whereas 16 were down-regulated during biofilm formation. Differentially expressed proteins were found to belong to carbohydrate, nucleotide, aminoacid and lipid metabolisms as well as translation, peptide hydrolysis, cell envelope/cell wall biosynthesis, adaption to atypical conditions and protein secretion. Some proteins related to carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolisms, translation and peptide degradation were overexpressed whereas those associated to stress conditions were synthesized in lower amounts. It seems that conditions for biofilm development would not imply a stressful environment for L. sakei CRL1862 cells, directing its growth strategy towards glycolytic flux regulation and reinforcing protein synthesis.

Here we report the allelopathic action of periphytic biofilm on bloom-forming cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa), which was triggered by the stress of high nutrient conditions, and continues while nutrients are maintained at high levels (trophic state index at 159 and 171). The experimental evidence indicates that the electron transport from photosystem II (PS II) to photosystem I (PS I) in M. aeruginosa is interrupted by the identified allelochemicals, (9Z)-Octadec-9-enoic acid and (9Z)-Hexadec-9-enoic acid, leading to the failure of photosynthesis and the subsequent death of M. aeruginosa.

This hydroxyapatite is very similar to that found in nature, having a similar crystallite size, iron and carbonate substitution, and a semi-crystalline structure. Hydroxyapatites with such a structure are known to be mechanically stronger and more biocompatible than synthetic or biomimetic hydroxyapatites. The formation of this biogenic hydroxyapatite coating therefore has significance in a range of contexts. In medicine, hydroxyapatite coatings are linked to improved biocompatibility of ceramic implant materials. In the built environment, hydroxyapatite coatings have been proposed for the consolidation and protection of sculptural materials such as marble and limestone, with biogenic hydroxyapatites having reduced solubility compared to synthetic apatites. Hydroxyapatites have also been established as effective for the adsorption and remediation of environmental contaminants such as radionuclides and heavy metals. We identify that in addition to providing a biofilm scaffold for nucleation, the metabolic activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens increases the pH of the growth medium to a suitable level for hydroxyapatite formation. The generated ammonia reacts with phosphate in the growth medium, producing ammonium phosphates which are a precursor to the formation of hydroxyapatite under conditions of ambient temperature and pressure.

A bacterial biofilm is a surface-associated agglomerate of microorganisms embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix made of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. Scientific literature offers several reports on a biofilm's role in infections regarding various body districts. The presence of a bacterial biofilm is responsible for poor efficacy of antibiotic therapies along with bacterial infections in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) districts such as the oral cavity, ear, nasal cavities, and nasal sinuses. In particular, bacterial biofilms are associated with recalcitrant and symptomatically more severe forms of chronic rhinosinusitis. As of today, there are no therapeutic options for the eradication of bacterial biofilm in ENT districts. Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan composed of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine disaccharide units. Its efficacy in treating rhinosinusitis, whether or not associated with polyposis, is well documented, as well as results from its effects on mucociliary clearance, free radical production and mucosal repair. This review's aim is to evaluate the role of bacterial biofilms and the action exerted on it by hyaluronic acid in ENT pathology, with particular attention to the rhinosinusal district. In conclusion, this paper underlines how the efficacy of hyaluronate as an anti-bacterial biofilm agent is well demonstrated by in vitro studies; it is, however, only preliminarily demonstrated by clinical studies.","authors":[{"name":"Alberto Vito Marcuzzo"},{"name":"Margherita Tofanelli"},{"name":"Francesca Boscolo Nata"},{"name":"Annalisa Gatto"},{"name":"Giancarlo Tirelli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Hyaluronic acid"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"rhinosinusitis"},{"word":"sodium hyaluronate"}]},"article384":{"pmid":"28736865","title":"Bioprotection of the built environment and cultural heritage.","date":"2019-01-16","abs":"The growth of microbial biofilms and various biomineralization phenomena can lead to the formation of stable layers and veneers on rocks known as 'rock varnishes' that can stabilize surfaces and protect from further weathering.

In this study, sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of rhubarb water extracts were found to inhibit biofilm formation. Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs), transcriptional regulators, and DNA binding proteins were compared under two conditions: (1) cells treated with sub-MIC rhubarb water extracts and (2) untreated cells. Using an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) strategy, we found that TCSs constituent proteins of histidine kinase and response regulator were significantly down-regulated. This down-regulation can affect the transfer of information during biofilm formation. The transcriptional regulators and DNA binding proteins that can interact with TCSs and interrupt gene transcription were also significantly altered. For these reasons, the levels of protein expressions varied in different parts of the treated vs. untreated cells. In summary, rhubarb water extracts might serve as potential inhibitor for the control of S. suis biofilm formation. The change in TCSs, transcriptional regulators, and DNA binding proteins may be important factors in S. suis biofilm inhibition.","authors":[{"name":"Wen-Ya Ding"},{"name":"Yan-Hua Li"},{"name":"He Lian"},{"name":"Xiao-Yu Ai"},{"name":"Yu-Lin Zhao"},{"name":"Yan-Bei Yang"},{"name":"Qiang Han"},{"name":"Xin Liu"},{"name":"Xue-Ying Chen"},{"name":"Zhonggui He"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNA binding protein"},{"word":"Streptococcus suis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"rhubarb water extracts"},{"word":"transcriptional regulator"},{"word":"two-component signal transduction system (TCSs)"}]},"article386":{"pmid":"28736143","title":"Thermophilic membrane bioreactors: A review.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This study undertakes a state-of-the-art review on thermophilic membrane bioreactors (ThMBRs).

The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity of eleven natural lichen compounds belonging to different chemical families and spanning from linear into cyclic and aromatic structures to uncover new antibiotics which can fight against the oral bacteria. The compounds were screened by broth microdilution assay. Three compounds were shown to have promising antibacterial activities where the depsidone core with certain functional groups constituted the best compound, psoromic acid, with the lowest MICs=11.72 and 5.86μg/mL against S. gordonii and P. gingivalis, respectively. The compounds screened had promising antibacterial activity which might be attributed to some important functional groups as discussed in our study. The best compounds did not induce the death of gingival epithelial carcinoma cells (Ca9-22).

In bacteria, protein phosphorylation was classically thought to be mediated exclusively by histidine kinases as part of two-component signaling systems. However, it is now well appreciated that eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases (eSTKs) control essential processes in bacteria. A subset of eSTKs are single-pass transmembrane proteins that have extracellular penicillin-binding-protein and serine/threonine kinase-associated (PASTA) domains which bind muropeptides. In a variety of important pathogens, PASTA kinases have been implicated in regulating biofilms, antibiotic resistance, and ultimately virulence. Although there are limited examples of direct regulation of virulence factors, PASTA kinases are critical for virulence due to their roles in regulating bacterial physiology in the context of stress. This review focuses on the role of PASTA kinases in virulence for a variety of important Gram-positive pathogens and concludes with a discussion of current efforts to develop kinase inhibitors as novel antimicrobials.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel A Pensinger"},{"name":"Adam J Schaenzer"},{"name":"John-Demian Sauer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Actinobacteria"},{"word":"Firmicutes"},{"word":"bacterial pathogenesis"},{"word":"bacterial protein kinase"},{"word":"kinase inhibitors"},{"word":"β-lactam resistance"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"28734589","title":"Phosphorus and Cu","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Upconversion phosphors (UCPs) can convert visible light into luminescence, such as UV, which can regulate the growth of microbes.

Despite LTTRs being global regulators of pathogenicity in several types of bacteria, few have been characterized in Burkholderia Here, we show that gene ldhR of B. multivorans encoding an LTTR is cotranscribed with ldhA encoding a d-lactate dehydrogenase and evaluate their implication in virulence traits such as exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis and biofilm formation. A comparison of the wild type (WT) and its isogenic ΔldhR mutant grown in medium with 2% d-glucose revealed a negative impact on EPS biosynthesis and on cell viability in the presence of LdhR. The loss of viability in WT cells was caused by intracellular acidification as a consequence of the cumulative secretion of organic acids, including d-lactate, which was absent from the ΔldhR mutant supernatant. Furthermore, LdhR is implicated in the formation of planktonic cellular aggregates. WT cell aggregates reached 1,000 μm in size after 24 h in liquid cultures, in contrast to ΔldhR mutant aggregates that never grew more than 60 μm. The overexpression of d-lactate dehydrogenase LdhA in the ΔldhR mutant partially restored the formed aggregate size, suggesting a role for fermentation inside aggregates. Similar results were obtained for surface-attached biofilms, with WT cells producing more biofilm. A systematic evaluation of planktonic aggregates in Burkholderia CF clinical isolates showed aggregates in 40 of 74. As CF patients' lung environments are microaerophilic and bacteria are found as free aggregates/biofilms, LdhR and LdhA might have central roles in adapting to this environment.","authors":[{"name":"Inês N Silva"},{"name":"Marcelo J Ramires"},{"name":"Lisa A Azevedo"},{"name":"Ana R Guerreiro"},{"name":"Andreia C Tavares"},{"name":"Jörg D Becker"},{"name":"Leonilde M Moreira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia multivorans"},{"word":"LysR family transcriptional regulator"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"d-lactate dehydrogenase"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"planktonic cellular aggregates"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"28733283","title":"Osmotic Compounds Enhance Antibiotic Efficacy against Acinetobacter baumannii Biofilm Communities.","date":"2019-04-03","abs":"Biofilm-associated infections are a clinical challenge, in part because a hydrated matrix protects the bacterial community from antibiotics. Herein, we evaluated how different osmotic compounds (maltodextrin, sucrose, and polyethylene glycol [PEG]) enhance antibiotic efficacy against Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm communities. Established (24-h) test tube biofilms (strain ATCC 17978) were treated with osmotic compounds in the presence or absence of 10× the MIC of different antibiotics (50 μg/ml tobramycin, 20 μg/ml ciprofloxacin, 300 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 30 μg/ml nalidixic acid, or 100 μg/ml erythromycin). Combining antibiotics with hypertonic concentrations of the osmotic compounds for 24 h reduced the number of biofilm bacteria by 5 to 7 log (P < 0.05). Increasing concentrations of osmotic compounds improved the effect, but there was a trade-off with increasing solution viscosity, whereby low-molecular-mass compounds (sucrose, 400-Da PEG) worked better than higher-mass compounds (maltodextrin, 3,350-Da PEG). Ten other A. baumannii strains were similarly treated with 400-Da PEG and tobramycin, resulting in a mean 2.7-log reduction in recoverable bacteria compared with tobramycin treatment alone.
