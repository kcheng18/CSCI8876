As opportunistic pathogens, they can cause fatal infections of the urinary tract and endocarditis in humans, whereas in poultry symptoms are joint disease, sepsis, and falls in the first week of life. The study covered 107 Enterococcus strains-56 isolated from humans and 51 from turkeys. Among the isolates investigated Enterococcus faecalis was detected in 80.36% of human and 80.39% of turkey samples. Enterococcus faecium was identified in 8.93% of human and 17.65% of turkey strains. The highest percentage of the strains was resistant to tetracycline as follows: 48 (85.71%) and 48 (94.12%) of human and turkey strains, respectively. Resistance to erythromycin occurred in 37.50% of the human and in 76.47% of turkey strains, otherwise 27.10% of all strains showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. Our study revealed that 25% of human and 15.69% of turkey strains were resistant to vancomycin. Multidrug resistance showed in 32.14% and 43.14% of human and turkey strains, respectively. The tetracycline resistance gene, tetM, was detected in 82.24% of all strains analyzed, whereas the tetO gene was found in 53.57% of human but only in 7.84% of turkey strains. The vancomycin resistance gene (vanA) was detected in seven Enterococcus strains (six isolated from turkeys and one from humans). The ermB gene (resistance to macrolide) was detected in 55.14% of all isolates (42.86% of human and 68.63% of turkey strains), whereas the ermA gene was detected in 17.65% of turkey but only in 3.57% of human isolates. All the strains had the ability to form biofilms.

For few years now, high-throughput sequencing methods have enabled a better understanding of microbial communities in freshwater environments. Those unexplored and complex communities compete for nutrients using antagonistic molecules as war weapons. Up to now, few of these molecules were characterized in regards of L. pneumophila sensitivity. In this context, we established, from five freshwater environments, a vast collection of culturable bacteria and investigated their ability to inhibit the growth of L. pneumophila. All bacterial isolates were classified within 4 phyla, namely Proteobacteria (179/273), Bacteroidetes (48/273), Firmicutes (43/273), and Actinobacteria (3/273) according to 16S rRNA coding sequences. Aeromonas, Bacillus, Flavobacterium, and Pseudomonas were the most abundant genera (154/273). Among the 273 isolates, 178 (65.2%) were shown to be active against L. pneumophila including 137 isolates of the four previously cited main genera. Additionally, other less represented genera depicted anti-Legionella activity such as Acinetobacter, Kluyvera, Rahnella, or Sphingobacterium. Furthermore, various inhibition diameters were observed among active isolates, ranging from 0.4 to 9 cm. Such variability suggests the presence of numerous and diverse natural compounds in the microenvironment of L. pneumophila. These molecules include both diffusible secreted compounds and volatile organic compounds, the latter being mainly produced by Pseudomonas strains.

P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat due to a number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the organism's propensity to form multicellular biofilms. Epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa often dominate within the lungs of individual CF patients, but how they achieve this is poorly understood. One way that strains of P. aeruginosa can compete is by producing chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, called pyocins. Three major classes of pyocin have been identified in P. aeruginosa: soluble pyocins (S types) and tailocins (R and F types). In this study, we investigated the distribution of S- and R-type pyocins in 24 clinical strains isolated from individual CF patients and then focused on understanding their roles in interstrain competition. We found that (i) each strain produced only one R-pyocin type, but the number of S-pyocins varied between strains, (ii) R-pyocins were generally important for strain dominance during competition assays in planktonic cultures and biofilm communities in strains with both disparate R- and S-pyocin subtypes, and (iii) purified R-pyocins demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against established biofilms. Our work provides support for a role played by R-pyocins in the competition between P. aeruginosa strains and helps explain why certain strains and lineages of P. aeruginosa dominate and displace others during CF infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of exploiting R-pyocins for therapeutic gains in an era when antibiotic resistance is a global concern.","authors":[{"name":"Olubukola Oluyombo"},{"name":"Christopher N Penfold"},{"name":"Stephen P Diggle"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacteriocins"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"pyocins"}]},"article8":{"pmid":"30696091","title":"Astilbin Inhibits the Activity of Sortase A from Streptococcus mutans.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is the primary etiological agent of dental caries.

These properties allow biochar to retain soil nutrients, yet the effects of biochar on bacterial growth remain poorly understood. To examine how biochar influences microbial metabolism, Escherichia coli was grown in a complex, well-defined media and treated with either biochar or activated carbon. The concentration of metabolites in the media were then quantified at several time points using NMR spectroscopy. Several metabolites were immediately adsorbed by the char, including l-asparagine, l-glutamine, and l-arginine. However, we find that biochar quantitatively adsorbs less of these metabolic precursors when compared to activated carbon. Electron microscopy reveals differences in surface morphology after cell culture, suggesting that Escherichia coli can form biofilms on the surfaces of the biochar. An examination of significant compounds in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis reveals that treatment with biochar is less disruptive than activated carbon throughout metabolism. While both biochar and activated carbon slowed growth compared to untreated media, Escherichia coli in biochar-treated media grew more efficiently, as indicated by a longer logarithmic growth phase and a higher final cell density. This work suggests that biochar can serve as a beneficial soil amendment while minimizing the impact on bacterial viability. In addition, the experiments identify a mechanism for biochar's effectiveness in soil conditioning and reveal how biochar can alter specific bacterial metabolic pathways.","authors":[{"name":"Rebecca A Hill"},{"name":"John Hunt"},{"name":"Emily Sanders"},{"name":"Melanie Tran"},{"name":"Griffin A Burk"},{"name":"Todd E Mlsna"},{"name":"Nicholas C Fitzkee"}],"keywords":[]},"article12":{"pmid":"30695121","title":"Durability and performance of loofah sponge as carrier for wastewater treatment with high ammonium.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Loofah sponge (LS) was used as carrier for high ammonia wastewater treatment with a sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR), aimed at evaluating its nitrogen removal performance and durability to changeable pH and microbial corrosion.

In addition to identifying the weight control mechanism, we show that adding a feedback loop can lead to a bistable QS response in certain parameter regimes.

One critical mechanism of biofilm infection that leads to persistent infection lies in the capacity of biofilms to evade the macrophage-mediated innate immune response. It is now increasingly apparent that microorganisms exploit the negative regulatory mechanisms of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated inflammatory response to subvert host cell functions by using various virulence factors. However, the detailed molecular mechanism, along with the identity of a target molecule, underlying the evasion of the macrophage-mediated innate immune response against S. aureus infection associated with biofilm formation remains to be elucidated. Here, using an in vitro culture model of murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells, we demonstrate that S. aureus biofilm-conditioned medium significantly attenuated the capacity for macrophage bactericidal and proinflammatory responses. Importantly, the responses were associated with attenuated activation of NF-κB and increased expression of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in RAW 264.7 cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of KLF2 in RAW 264.7 cells could restore the activation of NF-κB toward the bactericidal activity and generation of proinflammatory cytokines in the presence of S. aureus biofilm-conditioned medium. Collectively, our results suggest that factors secreted from S. aureus biofilms might exploit the KLF2-dependent negative regulatory mechanism to subvert macrophage-mediated innate immune defense against S. aureus biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Talib Alboslemy"},{"name":"Bing Yu"},{"name":"Tara Rogers"},{"name":"Min-Ho Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"KLF2"},{"word":"S. aureus biofilm"},{"word":"macrophages"}]},"article26":{"pmid":"30692023","title":"Convenient framework of poly functionalized (E)-2-benzylideno-(Z)-carbazolylideno cyanoacetamides via rearrangements as an efficient antibiofilm inhibitors with SAR study.","date":"2020-01-14","abs":"A simple and one-pot approach for the synthesis of highly functionalized novel (E)-2-benzylideno-(Z)-carbazolylideno cyanoacetamide derivatives from different 2-(2',3',4',9'-tetrahydro-carbazol-1'-ylidene)-propanedinitriles and aryl/heteroaryl carbaldehydes via vinylogous aldol reaction.

The rise of antibiotic resistance among P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates makes treatment of this disease challenging, emphasizing the need for alternative therapeutic modalities. By comparing the responses to P. aeruginosa infection between an outbred mouse strain (Swiss Webster, SW) and a susceptible mouse strain (C57BL6/N), we found that the inherent neutrophil-killing abilities of these strains correlated with their susceptibility to infection. Namely, SW-derived neutrophils were significantly more efficient at killing P. aeruginosa in vitro than C57BL6/N-derived neutrophils. To interrogate whether the distinct neutrophil killing capacities were dependent on endogenous or exogenous factors, neutrophil progenitor cell lines were generated. The in vitro differentiated neutrophils from either SW or C57BL6/N progenitors retained the differential killing abilities, illustrating that endogenous factors conferred resistance. Consistently, quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis revealed strain-specific and infection-induced alterations of neutrophil proteomes. Among the distinctly elevated proteins in the SW-derived proteomes were α-mannosidases, potentially associated with protection. Inhibition of α-mannosidases reduced neutrophil bactericidal functions in vitro. Conversely, topical application of α-mannosidases reduced bacterial biofilms and burden of infected corneas.

Previously, we demonstrated that a peptide (BAR) derived from Streptococcus gordonii (Sg) potently inhibited adherence of Pg to streptococci and reduced Pg virulence in a mouse model of periodontitis. Thus, BAR may represent a novel therapeutic to control periodontitis by preventing Pg colonization of the oral cavity. However, while BAR inhibited the initial formation of Pg/Sg biofilms, much higher concentrations of peptide were required to disrupt an established Pg/Sg biofilm. To improve the activity of the peptide, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were surface-modified with BAR and shown to more potently disrupt Pg/Sg biofilms relative to an equimolar amount of free peptide. The goal of this work was to determine the in vivo efficacy of BAR-modified NPs (BNPs) and to assess the toxicity of BNPs against human gingival epithelial cells. In vivo efficacy of BNPs was assessed using a murine model of periodontitis by measuring alveolar bone resorption and gingival IL-17 expression as outcomes of Pg-induced inflammation. Infection of mice with Pg and Sg resulted in a significant increase in alveolar bone loss and gingival IL-17 expression over sham-infected animals. Treatment of Pg/Sg infected mice with BNPs reduced bone loss and IL-17 expression almost to the levels of sham-infected mice and to a greater extent than treatment with an equimolar amount of free BAR. The cytotoxicity of the maximum concentration of BNPs and free BAR used in in vitro and in vivo studies (1.3 and 3.4 μM), was evaluated in telomerase immortalized gingival keratinocytes (TIGKs) by measuring cell viability, cell lysis and apoptosis. BNPs were also tested for hemolytic activity against sheep erythrocytes. TIGKs treated with BNPs or free BAR demonstrated >90% viability and no significant lysis or apoptosis relative to untreated cells. In addition, neither BNPs nor free BAR exhibited hemolytic activity.

Our results demonstrate that molecular conformation and internal connectivity are critical parameters to describe the antimicrobial nature of compounds, and the analysis presented here may serve as a general principle for the design of future antimicrobials.","authors":[{"name":"Kavita Yadav"},{"name":"Sandeep Kumar"},{"name":"Deepakkumar Mishra"},{"name":"Mohammad Asad"},{"name":"Madhurima Mitra"},{"name":"Prabhu S Yavvari"},{"name":"Siddhi Gupta"},{"name":"Madhukar Vedantham"},{"name":"Pavit Ranga"},{"name":"Varsha Komalla"},{"name":"Sanjay Pal"},{"name":"Priyanka Sharma"},{"name":"Arti Kapil"},{"name":"Archana Singh"},{"name":"Nirpendra Singh"},{"name":"Aasheesh Srivastava"},{"name":"Lipi Thukral"},{"name":"Avinash Bajaj"}],"keywords":[]},"article45":{"pmid":"30688429","title":"Antibiofilm Nitric Oxide-Releasing Polydopamine Coatings.","date":"2019-06-17","abs":"The growing number of patient morbidity related to nosocomial infections has placed an importance on the development of new antibacterial coatings for medical devices. Here, we utilize the versatile adhesion property of polydopamine (pDA) to design an antibacterial coating that possesses low-fouling and nitric oxide (NO)-releasing capabilities. To demonstrate this, glass substrates were functionalized with pDA via immersion in alkaline aqueous solution containing dopamine, followed by grafting of low-fouling polymer (poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)) via Michael addition and subsequent formation of N-diazeniumdiolate functionalities (NO precursors) by purging with NO gas. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the successful grafting of PEG and formation of N-diazeniumdiolate on polydopamine-coated substrates. NO release from the coating was observed over 2 days, and NO loading is tunable by the pDA film thickness. The antibacterial efficiency of the coatings was assessed using Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (i.e., wild-type PAO1 and multidrug-resistant PA37) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213). The NO-releasing PEGylated pDA film inhibited biofilm attachment by 96 and 70% after exposure to bacterial culture solution for 24 and 36 h, respectively. In contrast, films that do not contain NO failed to prevent biofilm formation on the surfaces at these time points. Furthermore, this coating also showed 99.9, 97, and 99% killing efficiencies against surface-attached PAO1, PA37, and S. aureus bacteria. Overall, the combination of low-fouling PEG and antibacterial activity of NO in pDA films makes this coating a potential therapeutic option to inhibit biofilm formation on medical devices.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Sadrearhami"},{"name":"Farah Nabilah Shafiee"},{"name":"Kitty K K Ho"},{"name":"Naresh Kumar"},{"name":"Marta Krasowska"},{"name":"Anton Blencowe"},{"name":"Edgar H H Wong"},{"name":"Cyrille Boyer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial coating"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"multidrug-resistant bacteria"},{"word":"nitric oxide"},{"word":"polydopamine"},{"word":"surface modification"}]},"article46":{"pmid":"30688370","title":"Topographic characterization of multispecies biofilms growing on dental implant surfaces: An in vitro model.","date":"2019-10-22","abs":"To describe the early biofilm formation over whole dental implants with its micro- and macrostructure, using an in vitro multispecies biofilm model.","authors":[{"name":"Patricia Bermejo"},{"name":"María Carmen Sánchez"},{"name":"Arancha Llama-Palacios"},{"name":"Elena Figuero"},{"name":"David Herrera"},{"name":"Mariano Sanz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CLSM"},{"word":"SEM"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dental implants"},{"word":"peri-implant diseases"},{"word":"qPCR"},{"word":"titanium"}]},"article47":{"pmid":"30688322","title":"Antimicrobial random peptide cocktails: a new approach to fight pathogenic bacteria.","date":"2019-03-15","abs":"Antibiotic resistance in bacteria has become a serious threat to public health, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop new classes of antimicrobial agents. Nowadays, natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their synthetic derivatives are considered as promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics. The broad molecular diversity of AMPs, in terms of sequences and structures, suggests that their activity does not depend on specific features of amino acid sequence or peptide conformation. We therefore selected two common properties of AMPs, (high percentage of hydrophobic and cationic amino acids), to develop a novel approach to synthesize random antimicrobial peptide mixtures (RPMs). Instead of incorporating a single amino acid at each coupling step, a mixture of hydrophobic and cationic amino acids in a defined proportion is coupled. This results in a mixture that contains up to 2n sequences, where n is the number of the coupling step, of random peptides with a defined composition, stereochemistry, and controlled chain length. We have discovered that RPMs of hydrophobic and cationic α-amino acids, such as phenylalanine and lysine, display strong and broad antimicrobial activity towards Gram-negative, Gram-positive, clinically isolated antibiotic resistant superbugs, and several plant pathogenic bacteria. This review summarizes our efforts to explore the mode of action of RPMs and their potential as bioactive agents for multiple applications, including the prevention of biofilm formation and degradation of mature biofilm (related to human health), reduction of disease severity in plant bacterial disease models (related to crop protection), and inhibition of bacterial growth in milk (related to food preservation).

Oral biofilm presents increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and elevated virulence compared with planktonic bacteria. Antimicrobial agents, such as chlorhexidine, have proven effective in the disruption/inhibition of oral biofilm. However, the challenge of precisely and continuously eliminating the specific pathogens without disturbing the microbial ecology still exists, which is a major factor in determining the virulence of a multispecies microbial consortium and the consequent development of oral infectious diseases. Therefore, several novel approaches are being developed to inhibit biofilm virulence without necessarily inducing microbial dysbiosis of the oral cavity. Nanoparticles, such as pH-responsive enzyme-mimic nanoparticles, have been developed to specifically target the acidic niches within the oral biofilm where tooth demineralization readily occurs, in effect controlling dental caries. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) such as dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM), when incorporated into dental adhesives or resin composite, have also shown excellent and durable antimicrobial activity and thus could effectively inhibit the occurrence of secondary caries. In addition, custom-designed small molecules, natural products and their derivatives, as well as basic amino acids such as arginine, have demonstrated ecological effects by modulating the virulence of the oral biofilm without universally killing the commensal bacteria, indicating a promising approach to the management of oral infectious diseases such as dental caries and periodontal diseases. This article aims to introduce these novel approaches that have shown potential in the control of oral biofilm.

The strains isolated from bronchoalveolar washings produced significantly more biofilm than strains isolated from wound and anus. The ability of biofilm forming by fecal strains was significantly lower compared to strains from other materials. MRSA strains had significantly higher ability of biofilm formation than MSSA strains (P = 0.000247). The presence of ica operon in MRSA was detected in all strains. Comparison of strong biofilm biomass of the strains with icaABCD, icaABD, and icaAD revealed that strains with icaABCD and icaABD produced highly significantly more biofilm than strains with icaAD.

Despite the environmental and economic importance of this process, little is known about the microbial ecology of coal seams. In the current study, ecological succession and spatial niche partitioning are explored in three coal seam microbial communities. Scanning electron microscopic visualization and 16S rRNA sequencing track changes in microbial communities over time, revealing distinct attached and planktonic communities displaying patterns of ecological succession.

Although its ethanol extract has been proven to possess several wound-related biological activities, there is no scientific information available for the infused oil of YaSP, which is its traditionally prepared form. This present study therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different infused oils obtained from either fresh or oven-dried herbal parts of YaSP (F-YaSP and D-YaSP) against biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which reside in chronic wounds. Its main active herbal component, Garcinia mangostana (F-GM and D-GM), as well as α-mangostin were also tested in this study. All infused oils significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa with a percentage of reduction ranging from 50 to 90%. Visualization of the inhibition of biofilm development was confirmed using scanning electron and atomic force microscopes. All tested agents resulted in a reduction in the mean average roughness of the biofilm, whereas only treating with D-YaSP, D-GM, and α-mangostin led to a decrease in both peak height and peak-valley height. MTT reduction assays revealed that the metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa mature biofilms decreased considerably up to 50% after only 3 h of incubation and after only 9 h of exposure to D-YaSP. Confocal laser scanning micrographs illustrated that a maximum biofilm eradication was found when treated with the extracts for 3 h, whereas the biomass, the average thickness, maximum thickness, and the surface to volume ratio of the treated biofilm was reduced after up to 18 h of contact time. It can be concluded that D-YaSP can effectively inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa.

Two clinical strains of K.pneumoniae were included in the study. One strain was completely susceptible and the other was resistant to certain antibiotics. Susceptible strain was subjected in the exposure assay as parent/wild strain. Exposure was performed by increasing chlorhexidine concentrations in agar plates. Chlorhexidine concentrations were gradually decreased reaching a final concentration of 0.12 mg/L after five weeks. Chlorhexidine-adapted viable colonies were selected and isolated. Minimal inhibitor concentrations of chlorhexidine, sodium hypochloride, benzalkonium chloride and triclosan for K.pneumoniae strains were determined using broth microdilution method.

Sequence types of isolates were identified using the PubMLST database. Characteristics of biofilm formation of clinical isolates were evaluated by microplate method. Antibiotic susceptibilities of ceftazidime, meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SXT) and levofloxacin were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI (2017) guidelines. Synergy tests were performed by checkerboard method. Clinical isolates were identified as Burkholderia cenocepacia (n= 16), Burkholderia contaminans (n= 11), Burkholderia gladioli (n= 4), Burkholderia dolosa (n= 4), Burkholderia multivorans (n= 2) and Burkholderia seminalis (n= 1).

Overall rates of resistance to ceftazidime, meropenem, TMP-SXT, and levofloxacin of the isolates were 35%, 66%, 50% and 40%, respectively. The antibiotic resistance against Burkholderia spp., isolates obtained from CF patients were more susceptible to ceftazidime, but no significant difference was found for other antibiotics.

Antagonism was detected in 15 isolates, 12 of them were between meropenem and ceftazidime, three of them were between ceftazidime and TMP-SXT. Numerous resistance mechanisms may lead to higher resistance in this bacteria, whereas the antagonism between meropenem and ceftazidime in this study might be attributed to the expression of beta-lactamases.

The results obtained show how the storage tank, the absence of anti-retraction valves, and the disinfection procedures performed are the main critical points of Type A DUWLs, which confirms that dental unit management (maintenance/sanitization) is often missed or not correctly applied by stakeholders, with an underestimation of the real risk of infection for patients and operators.","authors":[{"name":"Jessica Lizzadro"},{"name":"Marta Mazzotta"},{"name":"Luna Girolamini"},{"name":"Ada Dormi"},{"name":"Tiziana Pellati"},{"name":"Sandra Cristino"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Legionella"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"dental unit waterline (DUWL)"},{"word":"heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs)"},{"word":"risk containment"},{"word":"water quality"}]},"article87":{"pmid":"30682768","title":"In Vitro Comparison of Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Activities of Selected Fluoroquinolones against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"An in vitro overview of the inhibitory effects of selected fluoroquinolones against planktonic and biofilm cells of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain American type culture collection (ATCC) 43300 and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain ATCC 27853 was carried out.

This requires a flexible metabolism and physiology, responsive to conditions of the local milieu. The sequence specific RNA binding protein CsrA serves as a global regulator that governs gene expression required for pathogenicity, metabolism, biofilm formation, and motility in response to nutritional conditions. Its activity is determined by two noncoding small RNAs (sRNA), CsrB and CsrC, which sequester and antagonize this protein. Here, we used ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis to comprehensively examine the effects of CsrA on mRNA occupancy with ribosomes, a measure of translation, transcript stability, and the steady state levels of transcripts under in vitro SPI-1 inducing conditions, to simulate growth in the intestinal lumen, and under in vitro SPI-2-inducing conditions, to simulate growth in the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV) of the macrophage. Our findings uncovered new roles for CsrA in controlling the expression of structural and regulatory genes involved in stress responses, metabolism, and virulence systems required for infection. We observed substantial variation in the CsrA regulon under the two growth conditions. In addition, CsrB/C sRNA levels were greatly reduced under the simulated intracellular conditions and were responsive to nutritional factors that distinguish the intracellular and luminal environments. Altogether, our results reveal CsrA to be a flexible regulator, which is inferred to be intimately involved in maintaining the distinct gene expression patterns associated with growth in the intestine and the macrophage.","authors":[{"name":"Anastasia H Potts"},{"name":"Yinping Guo"},{"name":"Brian M M Ahmer"},{"name":"Tony Romeo"}],"keywords":[]},"article95":{"pmid":"30682094","title":"The peptidoglycan and biofilm matrix of Staphylococcus epidermidis undergo structural changes when exposed to human platelets.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a bacterium frequently isolated from contaminated platelet concentrates (PCs), a blood product used to treat bleeding disorders in transfusion patients.

Protein homology and template-based modeling facilitated prediction of the Mgl2 structure, which greatly resembled class I MTases with a S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding cleft. The Mgl2 protein was engaged in exopolysaccharide, but not lipopolysaccharide, synthesis. The mgl2 deletion mutant produced exopolysaccharide comprised of only low molecular weight fractions, while overexpression of mgl2 caused overproduction of exopolysaccharide with a normal low to high molecular weight ratio. The deletion of the mgl2 gene resulted in disturbances in biofilm formation and a slight increase in motility in minimal medium. Red clover (Trifolium pratense) inoculated with the mgl2 mutant formed effective nodules, and the appearance of the plants indicated active nitrogen fixation.

Within this community, sanguinis-group streptococci, comprising the closely related Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii, together with Streptococcus parasanguinis, often predominate. Their ubiquitous and abundant nature reflects the evolution of these bacteria as highly effective colonizers of the oral cavity. Through interactions with host tissues and other microbes, and the capacity to readily adapt to prevailing environmental conditions, sanguinis-group streptococci are able to shape accretion of the oral plaque biofilm and promote development of a microbial community that exists in harmony with its host. Nonetheless, upon gaining access to the blood stream, those very same colonization capabilities can confer upon sanguinis-group streptococci the ability to promote systemic disease. This article focuses on the role of sanguinis-group streptococci as the commensurate commensals, highlighting those aspects of their biology that enable the coordination of health-associated biofilm development. This includes the molecular mechanisms, both synergistic and antagonistic, that underpin adhesion to substrata, intercellular communication, and polymicrobial community formation.

These virulence factors function primarily in bacterial adhesion to host tissues, but they also mediate biofilm formation. Type 1 and P pili of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are the two best-studied CU pilus examples, and here we primarily focus on the former. UPEC can be transmitted to the urinary tract by fecal shedding. It can then ascend up the urinary tract and cause disease by invading and colonizing host tissues of the bladder, causing cystitis, and the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis. FimH is the subunit displayed at the tip of type 1 pili and mediates adhesion to mannosylated host cells via a unique catch-bond mechanism. In response to shear forces caused by urine flow, FimH can transition from a low-affinity to high-affinity binding mode. This clever allosteric mechanism allows UPEC cells to remain tightly attached during periods of urine flow, while loosening their grip to allow dissemination through the urinary tract during urine stasis. Moreover, the bulk of a CU pilus is made up of the rod, which can reversibly uncoil in response to urine flow to evenly spread the tensile forces over the entire pilus length. We here explore the novel structural and mechanistic findings relating to the type 1 pilus FimH catch-bond and rod uncoiling and explain how they function together to enable successful attachment, spread, and persistence in the hostile urinary tract.","authors":[{"name":"Manuela K Hospenthal"},{"name":"Gabriel Waksman"}],"keywords":[]},"article99":{"pmid":"30681067","title":"Outer Membrane Vesicle-Host Cell Interactions.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are nanosized proteoliposomes derived from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

Cariogenic biofilms are structured microbial communities embedded in an extracellular matrix that affords bacterial adhesion-cohesion and drug tolerance, making them difficult to treat using conventional antimicrobial monotherapy. Here, we investigated a multitargeted approach combining exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix-degrading glucanohydrolases with a clinically used essential oils-based antimicrobial to potentiate antibiofilm efficacy. Our data showed that dextranase and mutanase can synergistically break down the EPS glucan matrix in preformed cariogenic biofilms, markedly enhancing bacterial killing by the antimicrobial agent (3-log increase versus antimicrobial alone). Further analyses revealed that an EPS-degrading/antimicrobial (EDA) approach disassembles the matrix scaffold, exposing the bacterial cells for efficient killing while concurrently causing cellular dispersion and physical collapse of the bacterial clusters. Unexpectedly, we found that the EDA approach can also selectively target the EPS-producing cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans with higher killing specificity (versus other species) within mixed biofilms, disrupting their accumulation and promoting dominance of commensal bacteria. Together, these results demonstrate a dual-targeting approach that can enhance antibiofilm efficacy and precision by dismantling the EPS matrix and its protective microenvironment, amplifying the killing of pathogenic bacteria within.","authors":[{"name":"Z Ren"},{"name":"D Kim"},{"name":"A J Paula"},{"name":"G Hwang"},{"name":"Y Liu"},{"name":"J Li"},{"name":"H Daniell"},{"name":"H Koo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-infective agents"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"drug resistance"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substance matrix"},{"word":"streptococcus"}]},"article118":{"pmid":"30678308","title":"Metabolic Profiling of Candida auris, a Newly-Emerging Multi-Drug Resistant Candida Species, by GC-MS.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Candidaauris, a newly-emerging Candida species, is a serious global health threat due to its multi-drug resistant pattern, difficulty to diagnose, and the high mortality associated with its invasive and bloodstream infections.

In the absence of oxygen, the feedstock can be converted into biogas through the established anaerobic digestion (AD) approach. The potential of MMC has shifted to production of intermediate AD compounds as precursors for renewable chemicals.

This review introduces the chain elongation pathway and other bio-reactions occurring during MMC fermentation. We present an overview of the complex feedstocks used, and pinpoint the main operational parameters for MCCAs production such as temperature, pH, loading rates, inoculum, head space composition, and reactor design.

The decline in CF lung function is greatly accelerated by intermittent and progressively severe acute pulmonary exacerbations (PEs). Despite their clinical impact, surprisingly few microbiological signals associated with PEs have been identified. Here we introduce an unsupervised, systems-oriented approach to identify key members of the microbiota. We used two CF sputum microbiome data sets that were longitudinally collected through periods spanning baseline health and PEs. Key taxa were defined based on three strategies: overall relative abundance, prevalence, and co-occurrence network interconnectedness. We measured the association between changes in the abundance of the key taxa and changes in patient clinical status over time via change-point detection, and found that taxa with the highest level of network interconnectedness tracked changes in patient health significantly better than taxa with the highest abundance or prevalence. We also cross-sectionally stratified all samples into the clinical states and identified key taxa associated with each state. We found that network interconnectedness most strongly delineated the taxa among clinical states, and that anaerobic bacteria were over-represented during PEs. Many of these anaerobes are oropharyngeal bacteria that have been previously isolated from the respiratory tract, and/or have been studied for their role in CF. The observed shift in community structure, and the association of anaerobic taxa and PEs lends further support to the growing consensus that anoxic conditions and the subsequent growth of anaerobic microbes are important predictors of PEs.","authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Layeghifard"},{"name":"Hannah Li"},{"name":"Pauline W Wang"},{"name":"Sylva L Donaldson"},{"name":"Bryan Coburn"},{"name":"Shawn T Clark"},{"name":"Julio Diaz Caballero"},{"name":"Yu Zhang"},{"name":"D Elizabeth Tullis"},{"name":"Yvonne C W Yau"},{"name":"Valerie Waters"},{"name":"David M Hwang"},{"name":"David S Guttman"}],"keywords":[]},"article131":{"pmid":"30675370","title":"Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase-B is involved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biofilm formation and a generic target for drug repurposing-based intervention.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), takes one human life every 15 s globally.

This study aimed to investigate the cholinergic receptor subtype involved in regulation of filamentous growth and biofilm formation by C. albicans and determine the roles of cholinergic receptors in modulation of G. mellonella immune cell subsets.

The positivity rate did not differ between samples from catheters and stents (23.6% versus 20.9%) or between catheter and stent corresponding urine samples (40.2% versus 30.2%). Ten different Candida species were detected, with Candida parapsilosis (31.4%), Candida albicans (26.5%), and Candida tropicalis (12.4%) predominating. f-ITS2-PCR-CE was evaluated as substantially less time-consuming and 8.3 times more sensitive than the routinely applied culture technique with 1 µl of urine/sonicated fluid inoculated, detecting 67 (19.9%) versus 8 (2.4%) positive samples out of 337 initially analyzed samples. The culture sensitivity considerably improved to 1.7 times lower than that of f-ITS2-PCR-CE after the inoculation volume was increased to 100 µl in the additional 82 samples.

In the static TKS (sTKS), performed by exposing both strains over 24h to constant antibiotic concentrations, the activity of the two drugs combined was not significantly different the better drug used alone.

Vancomycin did not kill bacteria, amikacin led to bacterial regrowth whereas the combination progressively decreased the bacterial load. Thus, dTKS revealed an enhanced effect of the combination on a large inoculum not observed in sTKS. The discrepancy between the sTKS and dTKS results highlights that the assessment of the efficacy of a combination for severe infections associated with a high bacterial load could be demanding.

Therefore, a hybrid coating containing polydopamine (PDA), hydroxyapatite (HA), AgNPs, and chitosan (CS) is prepared. Organic chelators CS and PDA that have promising biocompatibility are used to prevent the rapid release of silver ions from the AgNPs coating. The double chelating effect of PDA and CS significantly reduces silver ion release from the hybrid coating.

Since the efficacy of photodynamic therapy largely depends on the selection and administration of an appropriate photosensitizer, therefore, the realization of clinically active photosensitizers is an immediate need.

The treated bacterial cells exhibited abundant ROS generation and marked increment in the level of oxidative stress markers as well as significant reduction in LDH activity. Marked reduction in colony forming units was also observed. Optical microscopic and SEM images further confirmed the bacterial death.

Additionally, the study investigates if Cu-induced changes in community structure co-occurs with changes in community functioning (i.e., photosynthesis and community tolerance to Cu). Periphyton was exposed for 18 days to five Cu concentrations, between 0.01 and 10 μM, in a semi-static test. Diversity and community structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms were assessed by 16S and 18S amplicon sequencing, respectively. Community function was studied as impacts on algal biomass and photosynthetic activity. Additionally, we studied Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) using photosynthesis as the endpoint. Sequencing results detected an average of 9,504 and 1,242 OTUs for 16S and 18S, respectively, reflecting the high biodiversity of marine periphytic biofilms. Eukaryotes represent the most Cu-sensitive kingdom, where effects were seen already at concentrations as low as 0.01 μM. The structure of the prokaryotic part of the community was impacted at slightly higher concentrations (0.06 μM), which is still in the range of the Cu concentrations observed in the area (0.08 μM). The current environmental quality standard for Cu of 0.07 μM therefore does not seem to be sufficiently protective for periphyton. Cu exposure resulted in a more Cu-tolerant community, which was accompanied by a reduced total algal biomass, increased relative abundance of diatoms and a reduction of photosynthetic activity.

Freshwater ecosystems are suspected to play an important ecological and evolutionary role in driving the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. The aim of our study was to decipher the occurrence of ESBL-Ec in a small watershed (Ouche river, Burgundy, France), targeting environmental matrices and fishes. Among cefotaxime resistant E. coli (ctxR Ec) isolates, we detected and characterized 36 ESBL-Ec from water, biofilm and fish guts. ctxR Ec and ESBL-Ec were found in samples from sites near the first small town, located downstream from the watershed which was studied. Treatment of urban wastewater by waste water treatment plants (WWTP), might therefore be a major potential source of ctxR Ec and thus of ESBL-Ec. Prevalence of total E. coli and ctxR Ec in fish guts ranged between 0 to 92% and 0 to 85%; respectively, depending on the sampling site and the fish species. The diet of fish (predator or omnivore) seems to strongly influence the prevalence of total E. coli and ESBL-Ec. Extended spectrum beta-lactamases produced by the isolates from this study belonged to the CTX-M family (CTX-M group 1 and 9). Moreover, some environmental ESBL-Ec proved to share genotypic features (MLST types) with isolates which originated from 8 WWTP effluents discharged in the Ouche river and with the sequence type ST131, which is widely described in clinical isolates. Ninety-seven % (97%) of ESBL-Ec from the study harbored additional antibiotic resistances and can thus be considered as multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Finally, 53% of the ESBL-Ec strains harbored class 1 integron-integrase (intl1). These results are discussed with the perspective of defining indicators of antibiotic resistance contamination in freshwater ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Loic Bollache"},{"name":"Emeline Bardet"},{"name":"Géraldine Depret"},{"name":"Sébastien Motreuil"},{"name":"Catherine Neuwirth"},{"name":"Jérome Moreau"},{"name":"Alain Hartmann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ESBL producing Escherichia coli"},{"word":"MLST E. coli"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"blaCTX–M"},{"word":"class 1 integron-integrase"},{"word":"fish"},{"word":"freshwater"}]},"article149":{"pmid":"30671032","title":"The Complete Genome and Physiological Analysis of the Eurythermal Firmicute Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha Strain RW2 Isolated From a Freshwater Microbialite, Widely Adaptable to Broad Thermal, pH, and Salinity Ranges.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Members of the genus Exiguobacterium are found in diverse environments from marine, freshwaters, permafrost to hot springs.

The A. baumannii strains belonging to the international clonal lineages I (IC I) and II (IC II) are associated with the hospital outbreaks and a high virulence. However, the intra and inter lineage-specific features of strains belonging to these most worldwide spread A. baumannii clones are not thoroughly explored. In this study we have investigated a set of cell surface-related features of A. baumannii IC I (n = 20) and IC II (n = 16) lineage strains, representing 30 distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types in the collection of clinical isolates obtained in Lithuanian tertiary care hospitals. We show that A. baumannii IC II strains are non-motile, do not form pellicle and display distinct capsular polysaccharide profile compared with the IC I strains. Moreover, in contrast to the overall highly hydrophobic IC I strains, IC II strains showed a greater variation in cell surface hydrophobicity. Within the IC II lineage, hydrophilic strains demonstrated reduced ability to form biofilm and adhere to the abiotic surfaces, also possessed twofold thicker cell wall and exhibited higher resistance to desiccation. Furthermore, these strains showed increased adherence to the lung epithelial cells and were more virulent in nematode and mouse infection model compared with the hydrophobic IC II strains. According to the polymerase chain reaction-based locus-typing, the reduction in hydrophobicity of IC II strains was not capsule or lipooligosaccharide locus type-dependent. Hence, this study shows that the most widespread A. baumannii clonal lineages I and II markedly differ in the series of cell surface-related phenotypes including the considerable phenotypic diversification of IC II strains at the intra-lineage level.

Secreted proteins and cell wall-anchored proteins (CWAPs) are important for the development of polysaccharide-independent biofilms, but functional relationships between these proteins are unclear. In the present study, we report the roles of the extracellular adherence protein Eap and the surface CWAP SasG in S. aureus MR23, a clinical methicillin-resistant isolate that forms a robust protein-dependent biofilm and accumulates a large amount of Eap in the extracellular matrix. Double deletion of eap and sasG, but not single eap or sasG deletion, reduced the biomass of the formed biofilm. Mutational analysis demonstrated that cell wall anchorage is essential for the role of SasG in biofilm formation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that MR23 formed a rugged and thick biofilm; deletion of both eap and sasG reduced biofilm ruggedness and thickness. Although sasG deletion did not affect either of these features, eap deletion reduced the ruggedness but not the thickness of the biofilm. This indicated that Eap contributes to the rough irregular surface structure of the MR23 biofilm and that both Eap and SasG play roles in biofilm thickness. The level of pathogenicity of the Δeap ΔsasG strain in a silkworm larval infection model was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those of the wild type and single-deletion mutants.

Biofilms were repeatedly and intermittently treated with tobramycin (TOB) alone or in combination with BH for 24 h. After treatment, the remaining cells were quantified using plate counting. After 15 cycles, biofilm cells were less susceptible to TOB and TOB+BH compared to the start population, and the potentiating effect of BH toward TOB was lost. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to probe which changes were involved in the reduced effect of BH, and mutations in 14 protein-coding genes were identified (including mutations in genes involved in central metabolism and in BCAL0296, encoding an ABC transporter). No changes in the MIC or MBC of TOB or changes in the number of persister cells were observed. However, basal intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS levels found after treatment with TOB were markedly decreased in the evolved populations. In addition, in evolved cultures with mutations in BCAL0296, a significantly reduced uptake of TOB was observed.

In this study, we report the identification of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa strain PA154197 isolated from a blood stream infection in Hong Kong. PA154197 belongs to a distinctive MLST550 clonal complex shared by two other international P. aeruginosa isolates VW0289 and AUS544. Comparative genome and transcriptome analysis of PA154197 with the reference strain PAO1 led to the identification of a variety of genetic variations in antibiotic resistance genes and the hyperexpression of three multidrug efflux pumps MexAB-OprM, MexEF-OprN, and MexGHI-OpmD in PA154197. Unexpectedly, the strain does not display a metabolic cost and a compromised virulence compared to PAO1. Characterizing its various physiological and virulence traits demonstrated that PA154197 produces a substantially higher level of the P. aeruginosa major virulence factor pyocyanin (PYO) than PAO1, but it produces a decreased level of pyoverdine and displays decreased biofilm formation compared with PAO1. Further analysis revealed that the secondary quorum-sensing (QS) system Pqs that primarily controls the PYO production is hyperactive in PA154197 independent of the master QS systems Las and Rhl.

However, this non-specific cytotoxic potential is a powerful weapon effective against almost all microorganisms, but also against eukaryotic cells, raising concerns related to their safe use. Among the analyzed transition metals, silver is the most investigated element due to its antimicrobial properties per se or as NPs; however, its toxicity raises questions about its biosafety. Even though it has milder antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity, TiO₂ needs to be exposed to UV light to be activated, thus limiting its use conjugated to orthopedic devices. By contrast, gold has a good balance between antimicrobial activity as an NP and cytocompatibility because of its inability to generate ROS.

Even 50 years after its discovery, (p)ppGpp is venturing into exciting new fields, especially in gram-positive bacteria. After triggering the current renaissance in bacterial second messenger research, c-di-GMP is becoming ever more global with abounding new molecular mechanisms of action and physiological functions. The more recently discovered c-di-AMP is rapidly catching up and has now been found even in archaea, with its function in osmotic homeostasis being conserved across kingdom boundaries. Small modules associated with mobile genetic elements, which make and react to numerous novel mixed cyclic dinucleotides, seem to roam around rather freely in the bacterial world. Finally, many novel and old nucleotide molecules are still lurking around in search of a function. Across many talks it became apparent that (p)ppGpp, c-di-GMP and GTP/ATP can share and compete for binding sites (e.g., the Walker A motif in GTP/ATPases) with intriguing regulatory consequences, thus contributing to the emergent trend of systemwide networks that interconnect diverse signaling nucleotides.

We analyzed the xanthan produced by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) in leaf extracts from grapefruit (a susceptible host of this bacterium) and compared it with the xanthan produced in a synthetic culture medium. We found that the xanthan produced in the grapefruit extract (Xan-GLE) presented shorter and more disordered molecules than xanthan produced in the synthetic medium (Xan-PYM). Besides, Xan-GLE resulted less viscous than Xan-PYM. The disordered molecular conformation of Xan-GLE could be attributed to its higher pyruvilation degree and lower acetylation degree compared with those detected in Xan-PYM. Meanwhile, the difference in the viscosity of both xanthans could be due to their molecules length. Finally, we cultured Xcc in the presence of the Xan-GLE or Xan-PYM and observed the formation of biofilm-like structures in both cases. We found significant differences in biofilm architecture between the two conditions, being the biofilm produced in presence of Xan-GLE similar to that formed in canker lesions developed in lemon plant leaves.

Quorum sensing (QS) is a biological pathway existing in a large number of microorganisms, through which bacteria regulate several of their physiological activities. A number of substances have been identified as quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs); they can interfere with the QS system and control bacterial spoilage characteristics and production of virulence factors. In our previous study, propyl gallate at sub-minimum inhibitory concentration levels showed a potent anti-QS activity. Thus, in this study, coaxial polylactic acid-propyl gallate electrospun fibers were fabricated and their physicochemical properties were characterized. Salmon slices were coated with these electrospun fibers and the effect of this coating on the salmon slices during chilled storage was evaluated. The results showed that the electrospun fibers had a small diameter and smooth surface with no beads or other defects. The thermal stability, tensile strength, and other properties of the fibers were suitable for refrigerated storage conditions. Without inhibiting the bacterial growth in the salmon slices, the QSI-containing electrospun fibers exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the production of total volatile base nitrogen and trimethylamine. Furthermore, the deterioration of muscle tissue in the salmon slices was significantly delayed during cold storage. Quantitative analysis indicated that the electrospun fibers had a significant inhibitory effect on the bacterial spoilage ability. The results suggested that the electrospun fibers loaded with QSIs might be an effective strategy to control food spoilage and enhance the quality of aquatic food products.","authors":[{"name":"Ting Ding"},{"name":"Tingting Li"},{"name":"Jianrong Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. fluorescens"},{"word":"electrospinning"},{"word":"propyl gallate"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"yield factor"}]},"article178":{"pmid":"30667567","title":"2018 international consensus meeting on musculoskeletal infection: Summary from the biofilm workgroup and consensus on biofilm related musculoskeletal infections.","date":"2019-12-20","abs":"Biofilm-associated implant-related bone and joint infections are clinically important due to the extensive morbidity, cost of care and socioeconomic burden that they cause.

ODRI has been convincingly shown to delay healing, worsen functional outcome and incur significant socio-economic costs. To address this clinical problem, ever more sophisticated technologies targeting the prevention and/or treatment of ODRI are being developed and tested in vitro and in vivo. Among the most commonly described innovations are antimicrobial-coated orthopedic devices, antimicrobial-loaded bone cements and void fillers, and dual osteo-inductive/antimicrobial biomaterials. Unfortunately, translation of these technologies to the clinic has been limited, at least partially due to the challenging and still evolving regulatory environment for antimicrobial drug-device combination products, and a lack of clarity in the burden of proof required in preclinical studies. Preclinical in vivo testing (i.e. animal studies) represents a critical phase of the multidisciplinary effort to design, produce and reliably test both safety and efficacy of any new antimicrobial device. Nonetheless, current in vivo testing protocols, procedures, models, and assessments are highly disparate, irregularly conducted and reported, and without standardization and validation. The purpose of the present opinion piece is to discuss best practices in preclinical in vivo testing of antimicrobial interventions targeting ODRI.

The use of gas-discharge plasmas may offer a feasible alternative to conventional sanitization methods. Plasmas are a mixture of charged particles, chemically reactive species, and UV radiation and can be used to destroy microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to measure the effectiveness of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) treatments against bacteria attached to a solid surface and to evaluate the individual susceptibility of various L. monocytogenes strains. Attention was focused on the state of the cells after treatment, combining detection by viable counts and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Most of the culturable cells were inactivated after APP treatment, but the qPCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA revealed the presence of injured cells or their entrance into the viable but nonculturable state. These results were at least partly confirmed by a resuscitation experiment. After APP treatment, L. monocytogenes cell suspensions were incubated in brain heart infusion broth; some cells grew in the medium and therefore had survived the treatment. An understanding of the effects of APP on L. monocytogenes can inform the development of sanitation programs incorporating APP for pathogen removal.

Chemical interference with bacterial cell-to-cell communication, termed quorum sensing (QS), has been recognized as an attractive approach to control infections and address the drug resistance problems currently observed worldwide. Instead of imposing direct selective pressure on bacterial growth, the right bioactive compounds can preferentially block QS-based communication and attenuate cascades of bacterial gene expression and production of virulence factors, thus leading to reduced pathogenicity. Herein, we report on the potential of itaconimides as quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) of P. aeruginosa. An initial hit was discovered in a screening program of an in-house compound collection, and subsequent structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies provided analogs that could reduce expression of central QS-regulated virulence factors (elastase, rhamnolipid, and pyocyanin), and also successfully lead to the eradication of P. aeruginosa biofilms in combination with tobramycin.

To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of the three P. aeruginosa QS systems by DADS, high-throughput RNA and proteome sequencing techniques were used to study differences in the transcriptional and proteome expression of P. aeruginosa PAO1 following treatment with DADS. The RNA-seq and proteomic data are available via NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database with accession number GSE118801 and ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD011144, respectively.

This is consistent with our previous studies on the physiology, biochemistry, and RNA expression of P. aeruginosa treated with DADS. Additionally, our results also indicated that bacterial motility, chemotaxis, and two-component systems were inhibited by DADS treatment. All these changes abolish the sensitivity of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to environmental stimuli and cause the cells to be in a state of passivation.

Recently, the advent of high-throughput sequencing allows the posing of questions that address the system at a larger scale but also allow for the creation of high-resolution maps of transcription. Thus, while much is already known about genetic competence in streptococci, recent studies continue to reveal intricate novel regulation pathways and components. In this perspective article, we highlight the use of transcriptional profiling and mapping as a valuable resource in the identification and characterization of hidden gems pertinent to the natural transformation system. Such strategies have recently been employed in a variety of different species. In S. mutans, for example, genome editing combined with the power of promoter mapping and RNA-Seq allowed for the identification of a link between the ComCDE and the ComRS systems, a ComR positive feedback loop mediated by SigX, and the XrpA peptide, encoded within sigX, which inhibits competence. In S. pneumoniae, a novel member of the competence regulon termed BriC was found to be directly under control of ComE and to promote biofilm formation and nasopharyngeal colonization but not competence.

Recently, Cyphobasidiales yeasts were shown to be ubiquitous in the cortex layer of many macrolichens [7], but for most species, little is known of their cellular distribution and constancy beyond visible fruiting structures. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of an additional and distantly related basidiomycete, Tremella, in 95% of studied thalli in a global sample of one of the most intensively studied groups of lichens, the wolf lichens (genus Letharia). Tremella species are reported from a wide range of lichen genera [8], but until now, their biology was deduced from fruiting bodies (basidiomata) formed on lichen thalli. Based on this, they have been thought to be uncommon to rare, to occur exclusively in a hyphal form, and to be parasitic on the dominant fungal partner [9, 10]. We show that, in wolf lichens, Tremella occurs as yeast cells also in thalli that lack basidiomata and infer that this is its dominant stage in nature. We further show that the hyphal stage, when present in Letharia, is in close contact with algal cells, challenging the assumption that lichen-associated Tremella species are uniformly mycoparasites. Our results suggest that extent of occurrence and cellular interactions of known fungi within lichens have historically been underestimated and raise new questions about their function in specific lichen symbioses.","authors":[{"name":"Veera Tuovinen"},{"name":"Stefan Ekman"},{"name":"Göran Thor"},{"name":"Dan Vanderpool"},{"name":"Toby Spribille"},{"name":"Hanna Johannesson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Tremella"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"confocal laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"cortex"},{"word":"symbiosis"},{"word":"transcriptomics"},{"word":"yeast"}]},"article205":{"pmid":"30661470","title":"First report of polymyxin B activity in Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilm.","date":"2019-11-25","abs":"Considering the clinical importance of biofilm in medical devices and chronic infections, this study aimed to investigate the action of polymyxin B on Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) biofilm.

Electrokinetic potential measurements were also employed to observe to what extent each ligand affected the surface charge property of the Ultisol. All the ligands shifted the zeta potential of the Ultisol to the negative direction, implying that the surface charge of the soil became more negative. The effect on the zeta potential of the soil was observed in the order of oxalate ˃ citrate ˃ EPS. The quantity of Pb adsorbed at each pH (3.0-7.0) reflected the corresponding change in the zeta potential as induced by each ligand. The presence of the ligands shifted the isoelectric point of the Ultisol from 4.8 to 3.2 for the EPS system and below 3.0 for the citrate and oxalate systems. More Pb was adsorbed in the presence of oxalate than in the presence of citrate and EPS. The two most outstanding mechanisms that governed the adsorption of Pb by the Ultisol were (1) electrostatic attraction which was supported by the increase in negative zeta potential of the Ultisol and, (2) complexation which was supported by the lesser proportion of Pb adsorbed in the citrate system at higher pH and also by the spectroscopic data for EPS. The combination EPS + citrate + oxalate was more effective in enhancing the adsorption of Pb than the combination EPS + oxalate and EPS + citrate.","authors":[{"name":"Jackson Nkoh Nkoh"},{"name":"Hai-Lung Lu"},{"name":"Xiao-Ying Pan"},{"name":"Ge Dong"},{"name":"Muhammad Aqeel Kamran"},{"name":"Ren-Kou Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Electrokinetic potential"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substance"},{"word":"Lead"},{"word":"Organic acid"},{"word":"Variable charge soil"}]},"article210":{"pmid":"30660931","title":"Integrating an ex-vivo skin biointerface with electrochemical DNA biosensor for direct measurement of the protective effect of UV blocking agents.","date":"2019-05-09","abs":"Skin cancer is the most frequent kind of cancer in white people in many parts of the world.

Biofilms are the predominant lifestyle for microorganisms in rivers, providing pivotal roles in ecosystem functioning and pollutant removal. The persistence of glyphosate in these ecosystems is suspected to be mostly influenced by microbial biodegradation processes. The present study aimed to investigate the tripartite relationship among biofilms, phosphorus and glyphosate in rivers. The first part consists of a co-occurrence analysis among glyphosate, AMPA and phosphorus using an extensive dataset of measurements (n = 56,198) from French surface waters between 2013 and 2017. The second part investigated the capacity of natural river biofilms to dissipate glyphosate, depending on phosphorus availability and the exposure history of the biofilm, in a microcosm study. A strong co-occurrence among glyphosate, AMPA and phosphorus was found in surface waters. More than two-thirds of samples contained phosphorous with glyphosate, AMPA or both compounds. Seasonal fluctuations in glyphosate, AMPA and phosphorus concentrations were correlated, peaking in spring/summer shortly after pesticide spreading. Laboratory experiments revealed that natural river biofilms can degrade glyphosate. However, phosphorus availability negatively influenced the biodegradation of glyphosate and induced the accumulation of AMPA in water. An increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and phosphorus uptake was observed in glyphosate-degrading biofilms, evidencing the tight link between phosphorus limitation and glyphosate degradation by biofilms. The results of the present study show that phosphorus not only is a key driver of river eutrophication but also can reduce complete glyphosate degradation by biofilms and favour the accumulation of AMPA in river water. The predominant role of biofilms and the trophic status of rivers must therefore be considered in order to better assess the fate and persistence of glyphosate.","authors":[{"name":"Louis Carles"},{"name":"Hélène Gardon"},{"name":"Laura Joseph"},{"name":"Josep Sanchís"},{"name":"Marinella Farré"},{"name":"Joan Artigas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA)"},{"word":"Biodegradation"},{"word":"Co-occurrence"},{"word":"Eutrophication"},{"word":"Microbial ecotoxicology"},{"word":"Phosphorus"}]},"article212":{"pmid":"30660829","title":"Searching for new agents active against Candida albicans biofilm: A series of indole derivatives, design, synthesis and biological evaluation.","date":"2019-03-21","abs":"Candida albicans biofilm represents a major clinical problem due to its intrinsic tolerance to anti-fungal compounds and it has been highly related to infections in catheterized patients.

Dextranase (Dex), which is a type of glucanase, participates in the degradation of water-soluble glucan (WSG); however, the structural features of the EPS regulated by the dexAgene have received limited attention. Our recent studies reported novel protocols to fractionate and analyzed the structural characteristics of glucans from S mutans biofilms. In this study, we identify the role of the S mutans dexAgene in dextran-dependent aggregation in biofilm formation. Our results show that deletion of dexA (SmudexA) results in increased transcription of EPS synthesis-related genes, including gtfB, gtfD, and ftf. Interestingly, we reveal that inactivating the dexA gene may lead to elevated WSG synthesis in S mutans , which results in dysregulated cariogenicity in vivo. Furthermore, structural analysis provides new insights regarding the lack of mannose monosaccharides, especially in the WSG synthesis of the SmudexA mutants. The biofilm phenotypes that are associated with the reduced glucose monosaccharide composition in both WSG and water-insoluble glucan shift the dental biofilm to reduce the cariogenic incidence of the SmudexA mutants. Taken together, these data reveal that EPS synthesis fine-tuning by the dexA gene results in a densely packed EPS matrix that may impede the glucose metabolism of WSG, thereby leading to the lack of an energy source for the bacteria. These results highlight dexA targeting as a potentially effective tool in dental caries management.","authors":[{"name":"Yan Yang"},{"name":"Mengying Mao"},{"name":"Lei Lei"},{"name":"Meng Li"},{"name":"Jiaxin Yin"},{"name":"Xinrong Ma"},{"name":"Xiang Tao"},{"name":"Yingming Yang"},{"name":"Tao Hu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"dexA"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cariogenicity"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"}]},"article217":{"pmid":"30659724","title":"Environmental biofilm communities associated with early-stage common dentex (Dentex dentex) culture.","date":"2019-04-24","abs":"To describe the biofilm microbiota associated with various feeding phases during larval common dentex (Dentex dentex) culture.","authors":[{"name":"E Turgay"},{"name":"T M Steinum"},{"name":"D Colquhoun"},{"name":"S Karataş"}],"keywords":[{"word":"aquaculture"},{"word":"bacterial diversity"},{"word":"biofilm communities"},{"word":"common dentex"},{"word":"hatchery tanks"},{"word":"microbiota"},{"word":"targeted metagenomics"}]},"article218":{"pmid":"30659625","title":"Plant growth promotion and suppression of bacterial leaf blight in rice by Paenibacillus polymyxa Sx3.","date":"2019-05-22","abs":"The effects and mechanisms of Paenibacillus polymyxa Sx3 on growth promotion and the suppression of bacterial leaf blight in rice were evaluated in this study.

Rice seedling experiments indicated that Sx3 promoted plant growth and suppressed bacterial leaf blight. In addition, bacteriological tests showed that Sx3 was able to fix nitrogen, solubilize phosphate and produce indole acetic acid, indicating that various mechanisms may be involved in the growth promotion by Sx3. The culture filtrate of P. polymyxa Sx3 reduced bacterial growth, biofilm formation and disrupted the cell morphology of Xoo strain GZ 0005, as indicated by the transmission and scanning electron microscopic observations. In addition, MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed that Sx3 could biosynthesize two types of secondary metabolites fusaricidins and polymyxin P. In summary, this study clearly indicated that P. polymyxa Sx3 has strong in vitro and in vivo antagonistic activity against Xoo, which may be at least partially attributed to its production of secondary metabolites.

In this study, the metabolism and redox conduction behaviors of G. sulfurreducens biofilms developed at different potentials were explored. We found that electrochemical acclimation occurred at the initial hours of polarizing G. sulfurreducens cells to the potentials. Two mechanisms of acclimation were found, depending on the polarizing potential. In the mature biofilms, a low level of biosynthesis and a high level of catabolism were maintained at +0.2 V versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The opposite results were observed at potentials higher than or equal to +0.4 V versus SHE. The potential also regulated the constitution of the electron transfer network by synthesizing more extracellular cytochrome c such as OmcS at 0.0 and +0.2 V and exhibited a better conductivity.

This is followed by the ligand-binding region responsible for host adhesion and cohesion, which contains diverse ligand-binding domains. These serve a zip code function to direct bacteria to a particular environmental niche. Thereafter is a large extension region consisting of tens to hundreds of tandem bacterial immunoglobulin-like (BIg) domains, whose function is to extend the reach of the ligand-binding domains away from the bacterial surface. Lastly, there is a conserved N terminal cell-membrane-anchor region that retains the adhesin within the secretion system. This is also a site of in situ proteolysis, when nutrients are scarce, that enables the bacterium to leave the biofilm.

Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIHNIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4- glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide.

The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organspecific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyperechoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and multidrug- resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other genital mycoplasmas is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. Next generation investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gramnegative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alphablockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called dysbiosis causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Vittorio Magri"},{"name":"Matteo Boltri"},{"name":"Tommaso Cai"},{"name":"Roberto Colombo"},{"name":"Salvatore Cuzzocrea"},{"name":"Pieter De Visschere"},{"name":"Rosanna Giuberti"},{"name":"Clara Maria Granatieri"},{"name":"Maria Agnese Latino"},{"name":"Gaetano Larganà"},{"name":"Christian Leli"},{"name":"Giorgio Maierna"},{"name":"Valentina Marchese"},{"name":"Elisabetta Massa"},{"name":"Alberto Matteelli"},{"name":"Emanuele Montanari"},{"name":"Giuseppe Morgia"},{"name":"Kurt G Naber"},{"name":"Vaia Papadouli"},{"name":"Gianpaolo Perletti"},{"name":"Nektaria Rekleiti"},{"name":"Giorgio I Russo"},{"name":"Alessandra Sensini"},{"name":"Konstantinos Stamatiou"},{"name":"Alberto Trinchieri"},{"name":"Florian M E Wagenlehner"}],"keywords":[]},"article234":{"pmid":"30655213","title":"Benzimidazole tethered pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinoline with broad-spectrum activity against fungal pathogens.","date":"2020-02-14","abs":"Fungal infections caused by Candida and Cryptococcus are particularly dangerous for immunocompromised individuals.

The chosen isolate, Bacillus ligniniphilus 61, was then used to extract and purify Chitosan NAGH using precipitation in ammonium sulfate followed by polyethylene glycol-treated dialysis and gel-permeation chromatography. Biofilm inhibition and antimicrobial activity of Chitosan NAGH was estimated against different bacterial species. Both gene expression profiling of biofilm-related genes and an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) inhibition assay were performed. Results: The BL61 strain was able to produce much more Chitosan activity than the other strains, as the latter only exhibited antimicrobial activity at low concentration levels; however, they did show as antibiofilm agents at varying proportions. Chitosan NAGH caused a uniform decrease in EPS formation in each isolate. Many biofilm-related genes, e.g., IcaABCD, decreased, but genes related to autoinducer synthetase were not affected by Chitosan NAGH. EPS, which is responsible for polysaccharide formation, was underexpressed at 3-fold down.

Phosphorus limitation was associated with higher concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances, lower biomass concentrations, a more filamentous biofilm morphology, and increased relative abundance of Hyphomicrobiaceae (a family of stalked bacteria) on the biofilter media.

In this study, we demonstrate that the recently identified autoinducer, DPO, also controls AphA production in V. cholerae. DPO, functioning through the transcription factor VqmA and the VqmR small RNA, reduces AphA levels at the post-transcriptional level and consequently inhibits virulence gene expression. VqmR-mediated repression of AphA provides an important link between the AI-2/CAI-1 and DPO-dependent quorum sensing pathways in V. cholerae. Transcriptome analyses comparing the effect of single autoinducers versus autoinducer combinations show that quorum sensing controls the expression of ∼400 genes in V. cholerae and that all three autoinducers are required for a full quorum sensing response. Together, our data provide a global view on autoinducer interplay in V. cholerae and highlight the importance of RNA-based gene control for collective functions in this major human pathogen.","authors":[{"name":"Roman Herzog"},{"name":"Nikolai Peschek"},{"name":"Kathrin S Fröhlich"},{"name":"Kilian Schumacher"},{"name":"Kai Papenfort"}],"keywords":[]},"article256":{"pmid":"30649481","title":"Unequivocal identification of an underestimated opportunistic yeast species, Cyberlindnera fabianii, and its close relatives using a dual-function PCR and literature review of published cases.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Although Cyberlindnera fabinaii is a rare opportunist yeast species, its ability to cause septicemia, produce biofilm, and rapid acquisition of resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole, reinforced the urge for its identification from its closely related species.

Moreover, the urge for a reliable molecular means of identification remains unsolved for 28 years. In order to unequivocally differentiate Cy. fabianii, Cy. mississipiensis, Cy. jadinii, and W. anomalus, we designed a dual-function multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Challenging our dual-function multiplex PCR assay with 30 most clinically important yeast species, proved its specificity. Although conventional PCR could differentiate four target species, the real-time PCR counterpart due to Tm overlap misidentified Cy. mississipiensis as Cy. jadinii. Alongside of presenting a comprehensive literature review of published cases of Cy. fabianii from 1990 to 2018, we collected various clinical isolates from Tehran, Shiraz, and Fasa (July 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017) to find a passive relative distribution of these closely-related species in Iran. Subjecting our Iranian collection of yeast isolates to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS and LSU and ITS rDNA sequencing revealed six isolates of Cy. fabianii (central venous catheter n = 2 and vaginal swabs n = 4) and one isolate of Cy. jadinii (vaginal swabs).

This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of farnesol against planktonic and sessile cells of clinical Trichosporon asahii (n = 3) andTrichosporon inkin (n = 7) strains. Biofilms were evaluated during adhesion, development stages and after maturation for metabolic activity, biomass and protease activity, as well as regarding morphology and ultrastructure by optical microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Farnesol inhibited Trichosporon planktonic growth by 80% at concentrations ranging from 600 to 1200 μM for T. asahii and from 75 to 600 μM for T. inkin. Farnesol was able to reduce cell adhesion by 80% at 300 μM for T. asahii and T. inkin at 600 μM, while biofilm development of both species was inhibited by 80% at concentration of 150 μM, altering their structure. After biofilm maturation, farnesol decreased T. asahii biofilm formation by 50% at 600 μM concentration and T. inkin formation at 300 μM. Farnesol inhibited gradual filamentation in a concentration range between 600 and 1200 μM.

Moreover, our previous studies have indicated that Rhb1 is associated with the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway. In this study, we further explored the relationship between Rhb1 and drug susceptibility. The RHB1 deletion mutant exhibited reduced fluconazole susceptibility, and this phenotype occurred mainly through the increased gene expression and activity of efflux pumps. In addition, Mrr1 and Tac1 are transcription factors that can activate efflux pump gene expression. However, the RHB1 deletion, RHB1/MRR1 and RHB1/TAC1 double deletion mutants had no significant differences in efflux pump gene expression and fluconazole susceptibility, suggesting that Rhb1-regulated efflux pump genes do not act through Mrr1 and Tac1. We also showed that membrane localization is crucial for Rhb1 activity in response to fluconazole. Finally, Rhb1 was linked not only to the TOR but also to the Mkc1 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in response to fluconazole.

Because of the lubricant, bacteria cannot attach to the substrate surface and thus formation of the biofilm is prevented. For this purpose, we manufactured substrates with different porosity and surface roughness values via UV-initiated free-radical polymerization in Fluoropor. Fluoropor is a class of highly fluorinated bulk-porous polymers with tunable porosity, which we recently introduced. We investigated the growth of the biofilm on the substrates, showing that a reduced surface roughness is beneficial for the reduction of biofilm growth.

We did not observe any direct antibacterial effect by L. mutabilis extract. Instead we observed an influence on the host cells, with indirect impact on bacteria and their possibility of causing infection. L. mutabilis extract decreased adhesion to bladder epithelial cells of uropathogenic bacteria, including drug-resistant strains. Moreover, uroplakin1a, involved in adhesion, was downregulated while the antimicrobial peptide RNase 7 was upregulated in L. mutabilis treated cells irrespectively of glucose concentration. This supports an early effect fighting bacteria. Additionally, L. mutabilis prevented bacterial biofilm formation, which is used by bacteria to evade the immune system and antibiotics. In summary, L. mutabilis protects against bacterial infection in uroepithelial cells by preventing adhesion through alteration of the cell surface, increasing antimicrobial peptide expression, and reducing biofilm formation. Together, this promotes bacterial clearance, suggesting that L. mutabilis as extract or as a dietary item can contribute to the prevention of urinary tract infections, which is of importance in an era of increasing antibiotic resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Witchuda Kamolvit"},{"name":"Vera Nilsén"},{"name":"Silvia Zambrana"},{"name":"Soumitra Mohanty"},{"name":"Eduardo Gonzales"},{"name":"Claes-Göran Östenson"},{"name":"Annelie Brauner"}],"keywords":[]},"article275":{"pmid":"30642992","title":"Flagellar Stators Stimulate c-di-GMP Production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Flagellar motility is critical for surface attachment and biofilm formation in many bacteria. A key regulator of flagellar motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other microbes is cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). High levels of this second messenger repress motility and stimulate biofilm formation. c-di-GMP levels regulate motility in P. aeruginosa in part by influencing the localization of its two flagellar stator sets, MotAB and MotCD. Here, we show that while c-di-GMP can influence stator localization, stators can in turn impact c-di-GMP levels. We demonstrate that the swarming motility-driving stator MotC physically interacts with the transmembrane region of the diguanylate cyclase SadC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this interaction is capable of stimulating SadC activity. We propose a model by which the MotCD stator set interacts with SadC to stimulate c-di-GMP production under conditions not permissive to motility. This regulation implies a positive-feedback loop in which c-di-GMP signaling events cause MotCD stators to disengage from the motor; then disengaged stators stimulate c-di-GMP production to reinforce a biofilm mode of growth.

Biocides have been incorporated into catheter coatings to inhibit bacterial colonization while, ideally, exhibiting low cytotoxicity and mitigating the selection of resistant bacterial populations. We compared the effects of long-term biocide exposure on susceptibility, biofilm formation, and relative pathogenicity in eight UPEC isolates. MICs, minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs), and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined before and after long-term exposure to triclosan, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and silver nitrate. Biofilm formation was quantified using a crystal violet assay, and relative pathogenicity was assessed via a Galleria mellonella waxworm model. Cytotoxicity and the resulting biocompatibility index values were determined by use of an L929 murine fibroblast cell line. Biocide exposure resulted in multiple decreases in biocide susceptibility in planktonic and biofilm-associated UPEC. Triclosan exposure induced the largest frequency and magnitude of susceptibility decreases at the MIC, MBC, and MBEC, which correlated with an increase in biofilm biomass in all isolates. Induction of antibiotic cross-resistance occurred in 6/84 possible combinations of bacteria, biocide, and antibiotic. Relative pathogenicity significantly decreased after triclosan exposure (5/8 isolates), increased after silver nitrate exposure (2/8 isolates), and varied between isolates for PHMB and BAC. The biocompatibility index ranked the antiseptic potential as PHMB > triclosan > BAC > silver nitrate. Biocide exposure in UPEC may lead to reductions in biocide and antibiotic susceptibility, changes in biofilm formation, and alterations in relative pathogenicity. These data indicate the multiple consequences of biocide adaptation that should be considered when selecting an anti-infective catheter-coating agent.","authors":[{"name":"E L Henly"},{"name":"J A R Dowling"},{"name":"J B Maingay"},{"name":"M M Lacey"},{"name":"T J Smith"},{"name":"S Forbes"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biocide"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"susceptibility"}]},"article278":{"pmid":"30642898","title":"Structural and Functional Insights into PpgL, a Metal-Independent β-Propeller Gluconolactonase That Contributes to Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Biofilm formation is a critical determinant in the pathopoiesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa It could significantly increase bacterial resistance to drugs and host defense.

Colonization of the oral cavity by the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key event in the initiation and development of periodontal disease. Adhesive surface structures termed fimbriae (pili) mediate interactions of P. gingivalis with other bacteria and with host cells throughout the course of disease. The P. gingivalis fimbriae are assembled via a novel mechanism that involves proteolytic processing of lipidated precursor subunits and their subsequent polymerization on the bacterial surface. Given their extracellular assembly mechanism and central roles in pathogenesis, the P. gingivalis fimbriae are attractive targets for anti-infective therapeutics to prevent or treat periodontal disease. Here we confirm that conserved sequences in the N and C termini of the Mfa1 fimbrial subunit protein perform critical roles in subunit polymerization. We show that treatment of P. gingivalis with peptides corresponding to the conserved C-terminal region inhibits the extracellular assembly of Mfa fimbriae on the bacterial surface. We also show that peptide treatment interferes with the function of Mfa fimbriae by reducing P. gingivalis adhesion to Streptococcus gordonii in a dual-species biofilm model. Finally, we show that treatment of bacteria with similar peptides inhibits extracellular polymerization of the Fim fimbriae, which are also expressed by P. gingivalis These results support a donor strand-based assembly mechanism for the P. gingivalis fimbriae and demonstrate the feasibility of using extracellular peptides to disrupt the biogenesis and function of these critical periodontal disease virulence factors.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah R Alaei"},{"name":"Jin Ho Park"},{"name":"Stephen G Walker"},{"name":"David G Thanassi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Porphyromonas gingivalis"},{"word":"assembly inhibitor"},{"word":"fimbriae"},{"word":"pili"}]},"article280":{"pmid":"30642467","title":"Application of rice (Oryza sativa L.) root endophytic diazotrophic Azotobacter sp. strain Avi2 (MCC 3432) can increase rice yield under green house and field condition.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"Use of plant-associated beneficial microbes, especially endophytes are getting popular day by day as they occupy a relatively privileged niche inside different plant tissues with lesser competition for food and shelter than rhizosphere.

Surprisingly, the activity of environmental β-lactamases and PenP, as well as the general stress response, resulted in a similarly reduced lag phase of the culture in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics, with little or no impact on the logarithmic growth rate. The length of the lag phase may determine the outcome of the competition between β-lactams and β-lactamases producers. Overall, our work suggests that antibiotic resistance genes in B. subtilis and related species are ancient and widespread, and could be selected by interspecies competition in undisturbed soils.","authors":[{"name":"Tabitha Bucher"},{"name":"Alona Keren-Paz"},{"name":"Jean Hausser"},{"name":"Tsviya Olender"},{"name":"Eddie Cytryn"},{"name":"Ilana Kolodkin-Gal"}],"keywords":[]},"article298":{"pmid":"30637904","title":"Intra-clade metabolomic profiling of MAR4 Streptomyces from the Macaronesia Atlantic region reveals a source of anti-biofilm metabolites.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"The search for new and effective strategies to reduce bacterial biofilm formation is of utmost importance as bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to emerge.

Thus, this study was designed to investigate the biological functions encoded by the cluster in the twitching-negative strain S. sanguinis SK36. We found that the cluster was transcribed as an operon, with three promoters located 5' to the cluster and one in the intergenic region between SSA_2307 and SSA_2305. Studies using promoter-cat fusion strains revealed that the transcription of the cluster was mainly driven by the distal 5' promoter, which is located more than 800 bases 5' to the first gene of the cluster, SSA_2318. Optimal expression of the cluster occurred at the early stationary growth phase in a CcpA-dependent manner, although a CcpA-binding consensus is absent in the promoter region. Expression of the cluster resulted in a short hairlike surface structure under transmission electron microscopy. Deletion of the putative pilin genes (SSA_2313 to SSA_2315) abolished the biosynthesis of this structure and significantly reduced the adherence of SK36 to HeLa and SCC-4 cells.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the chitosan-streptomycin conjugate (CS-Strep) remains unclear and the poor water-solubility of the conjugate might restrict its applications for anti-infection therapy. In this study, we conjugated streptomycin with water-soluble chitosan oligosaccharides (COS). Unlike CS-Strep, the COS-streptomycin conjugate (COS-Strep) barely affected biofilms of tested Gram-positive bacteria. However, COS-Strep efficiently eradicated established biofilms of the Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This activity of COS-Strep was influenced by the degree of polymerization of chitosan oligosaccharide. The increased susceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotics after conjugating might be related to the following: Suppression of the activation of MexX-MexY drug efflux pump system induced by streptomycin treatment; and down-regulation of the biosynthesis of biofilm exopolysaccharides.

The repurposed antifungal drug, ciclopirox, equally blocks antibiotic-susceptible or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates, indicating that it is not affected by existing resistance mechanisms. Toward understanding how ciclopirox blocks growth, we screened E. coli mutant strains and found that disruption of genes encoding products involved in galactose salvage, enterobacterial common antigen synthesis, and transport of the iron binding siderophore, enterobactin, lowered the minimum inhibitory concentration of ciclopirox needed to block growth of the mutant compared to the isogenic parent strain. We found that ciclopirox induced enterobactin production and that this effect is strongly affected by the deletion of the galactose salvage genes encoding UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, galE, or galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, galT. As disruption of ECA synthesis activates the regulation of capsular synthesis (Rcs) phosphorelay, which inhibits bacterial swarming and promotes biofilm development, we test whether ciclopirox prevents activation of the Rcs pathway. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciclopirox increased swarming of the E. coli laboratory K12 strain BW25113 but had widely varying effects on swarming or surface motility of clinical isolate E. coli, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae.

IRES are characterized by periods of flow cessation, during which channel substrates accumulate and undergo physico-chemical changes (preconditioning), and periods of flow resumption, when these substrates are rewetted and release pulses of dissolved nutrients and organic matter (OM). However, there are no estimates of the amounts and quality of leached substances, nor is there information on the underlying environmental constraints operating at the global scale. We experimentally simulated, under standard laboratory conditions, rewetting of leaves, riverbed sediments, and epilithic biofilms collected during the dry phase across 205 IRES from five major climate zones. We determined the amounts and qualitative characteristics of the leached nutrients and OM, and estimated their areal fluxes from riverbeds. In addition, we evaluated the variance in leachate characteristics in relation to selected environmental variables and substrate characteristics. We found that sediments, due to their large quantities within riverbeds, contribute most to the overall flux of dissolved substances during rewetting events (56%-98%), and that flux rates distinctly differ among climate zones. Dissolved organic carbon, phenolics, and nitrate contributed most to the areal fluxes. The largest amounts of leached substances were found in the continental climate zone, coinciding with the lowest potential bioavailability of the leached OM. The opposite pattern was found in the arid zone. Environmental variables expected to be modified under climate change (i.e. potential evapotranspiration, aridity, dry period duration, land use) were correlated with the amount of leached substances, with the strongest relationship found for sediments. These results show that the role of IRES should be accounted for in global biogeochemical cycles, especially because prevalence of IRES will increase due to increasing severity of drying events.","authors":[{"name":"Oleksandra Shumilova"},{"name":"Dominik Zak"},{"name":"Thibault Datry"},{"name":"Daniel von Schiller"},{"name":"Roland Corti"},{"name":"Arnaud Foulquier"},{"name":"Biel Obrador"},{"name":"Klement Tockner"},{"name":"Daniel C Allan"},{"name":"Florian Altermatt"},{"name":"María Isabel Arce"},{"name":"Shai Arnon"},{"name":"Damien Banas"},{"name":"Andy Banegas-Medina"},{"name":"Erin Beller"},{"name":"Melanie L Blanchette"},{"name":"Juan F Blanco-Libreros"},{"name":"Joanna Blessing"},{"name":"Iola Gonçalves Boëchat"},{"name":"Kate Boersma"},{"name":"Michael T Bogan"},{"name":"Núria Bonada"},{"name":"Nick R Bond"},{"name":"Kate Brintrup"},{"name":"Andreas Bruder"},{"name":"Ryan Burrows"},{"name":"Tommaso Cancellario"},{"name":"Stephanie M Carlson"},{"name":"Sophie Cauvy-Fraunié"},{"name":"Núria Cid"},{"name":"Michael Danger"},{"name":"Bianca de Freitas Terra"},{"name":"Anna Maria De Girolamo"},{"name":"Ruben Del Campo"},{"name":"Fiona Dyer"},{"name":"Arturo Elosegi"},{"name":"Emile Faye"},{"name":"Catherine Febria"},{"name":"Ricardo Figueroa"},{"name":"Brian Four"},{"name":"Mark O Gessner"},{"name":"Pierre Gnohossou"},{"name":"Rosa Gómez Cerezo"},{"name":"Lluís Gomez-Gener"},{"name":"Manuel A S Graça"},{"name":"Simone Guareschi"},{"name":"Björn Gücker"},{"name":"Jason L Hwan"},{"name":"Skhumbuzo Kubheka"},{"name":"Simone Daniela Langhans"},{"name":"Catherine Leigh"},{"name":"Chelsea J Little"},{"name":"Stefan Lorenz"},{"name":"Jonathan Marshall"},{"name":"Angus McIntosh"},{"name":"Clara Mendoza-Lera"},{"name":"Elisabeth Irmgard Meyer"},{"name":"Marko Miliša"},{"name":"Musa C Mlambo"},{"name":"Marcos Moleón"},{"name":"Peter Negus"},{"name":"Dev Niyogi"},{"name":"Athina Papatheodoulou"},{"name":"Isabel Pardo"},{"name":"Petr Paril"},{"name":"Vladimir Pešić"},{"name":"Pablo Rodriguez-Lozano"},{"name":"Robert J Rolls"},{"name":"Maria Mar Sanchez-Montoya"},{"name":"Ana Savić"},{"name":"Alisha Steward"},{"name":"Rachel Stubbington"},{"name":"Amina Taleb"},{"name":"Ross Vander Vorste"},{"name":"Nathan Waltham"},{"name":"Annamaria Zoppini"},{"name":"Christiane Zarfl"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"leaching"},{"word":"leaf litter"},{"word":"rewetting"},{"word":"sediments"},{"word":"temporary rivers"}]},"article336":{"pmid":"30627971","title":"Characterization of the bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus italicus ONU547 isolated from Thai fermented cabbage.","date":"2019-11-12","abs":"Seventy-eight isolates of lactic acid bacteria from Ukraine and Thailand were screened for bacteriocinogenic activity against indicator strain Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei JCM 1157.

In both CF and COPD, the respiratory microbiome plays a major contributing role in disease progression and morbidity. Pulmonary pathogens can differ dramatically during various stages of each disease and frequently cause acute worsening of lung function due to disease exacerbation.

In the present study, we characterized by 16S rRNA metabarcoding the bacterial diversity in a field-pilot bioreactor treating extremely As-rich AMD in situ, over a 6 months monitoring period. Inside the bioreactor, the bacterial communities responsible for iron and arsenic removal formed a biofilm (biogenic precipitate) whose composition varied in time and space. These communities evolved from a structure at first similar to the one of the feed water used as an inoculum to a structure quite similar to the natural biofilm developing in situ in the AMD. Over the monitoring period, iron-oxidizing bacteria always largely dominated the biogenic precipitate, with distinct populations (Gallionella, Ferrovum, Leptospirillum, Acidithiobacillus, Ferritrophicum), whose relative proportions extensively varied among time and space. A spatial structuring was observed inside the trays (arranged in series) composing the bioreactor. This spatial dynamic could be linked to the variation of the physico-chemistry of the AMD water between the raw water entering and the treated water exiting the pilot. According to redundancy analysis (RDA), the following parameters exerted a control on the bacterial communities potentially involved in the water treatment process: dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, dissolved sulfates, arsenic and Fe(II) concentrations and redox potential. Appreciable arsenite oxidation occurring in the bioreactor could be linked to the stable presence of two distinct monophylogenetic groups of Thiomonas related bacteria. The ubiquity and the physiological diversity of the bacteria identified, as well as the presence of bacteria of biotechnological relevance, suggested that this treatment system could be applied to the treatment of other AMD.","authors":[{"name":"Elia Laroche"},{"name":"Corinne Casiot"},{"name":"Lidia Fernandez-Rojo"},{"name":"Angélique Desoeuvre"},{"name":"Vincent Tardy"},{"name":"Odile Bruneel"},{"name":"Fabienne Battaglia-Brunet"},{"name":"Catherine Joulian"},{"name":"Marina Héry"}],"keywords":[{"word":"acid mine drainage"},{"word":"arsenic"},{"word":"arsenic-oxidizing bacteria"},{"word":"bioremediation"},{"word":"eco-engineering"},{"word":"iron-oxidizing bacteria"},{"word":"microbial ecotoxicology"}]},"article342":{"pmid":"30626536","title":"Salivary levels of MPO, MMP-8 and TIMP-1 are associated with gingival inflammation response patterns during experimental gingivitis.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"This study aimed to investigate the association between salivary levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and gingival inflammation development during an experimental gingivitis study.","authors":[{"name":"Gustavo G Nascimento"},{"name":"Vibeke Baelum"},{"name":"Timo Sorsa"},{"name":"Taina Tervahartiala"},{"name":"Peter D Skottrup"},{"name":"Rodrigo López"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Gingival inflammation"},{"word":"Immunology"},{"word":"Innate immunity"},{"word":"Neutrophils"},{"word":"Periodontal diseases"}]},"article343":{"pmid":"30626214","title":"Bacterial anti-adhesion activity based on the electrochemical properties of polymethacrylates bearing ferrocenyl pendant groups.","date":"2019-06-27","abs":"Much current research is focused on preventing and controlling the natural process of colonization by marine organisms of surfaces submerged in seawater.

In an attempt to overcome these issues, we have investigated the bacterial recombinant expression of MIP-3α by using several common expression and fusion tags, including 6× histidine (His), small ubiquitin modifier protein (SUMO), thioredoxin (TRX), ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), and maltose binding protein (MBP). We have also evaluated a recently introduced calmodulin (CaM)-tag that has been used for the effective expression of many basic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).

Rapid purification was facilitated by the His-tag that was integrated in the CaM-fusion protein system.

Moreover, certain phage-resistant variants recovered susceptibility to phage infection following re-culturing, suggesting alternative protection mechanisms, such as formation of biofilm, receptor downregulation and phage inactivation by proteases. Also, the lack of phage production by some strains despite strong phage control suggested an abortive infection mechanism was in play.

Here, we show that the regulator termed LvbR is an LqsS-regulated transcription factor that binds to the promoter of lpg1056/hnox1 (encoding an inhibitor of the diguanylate cyclase Lpg1057), and thus, regulates proteins involved in c-di-GMP metabolism. LvbR determines biofilm architecture, since L. pneumophila lacking lvbR accumulates less sessile biomass and forms homogeneous mat-like structures, while the parental strain develops more compact bacterial aggregates. Comparative transcriptomics of sessile and planktonic ΔlvbR or ΔlqsR mutant strains revealed concerted (virulence, fitness island, metabolism) and reciprocally (motility) regulated genes in biofilm and broth respectively. Moreover, ΔlvbR is hyper-competent for DNA uptake, defective for phagocyte infection, outcompeted by the parental strain in amoebae co-infections and impaired for cell migration inhibition.

By studying fibril formation in vitro, in a model system of two common but unrelated biofilm-forming proteins, FapC from Pseudomonas fluorescens and CsgA from Escherichia coli, we found that the two proteins have a common aggregation mechanism. In both systems, fibril formation proceeds via nucleated growth of linear fibrils exhibiting similar measured rates of elongation, with negligible fibril self-replication. These similarities between two unrelated systems suggest that convergent evolution plays a key role in tuning the assembly kinetics of functional amyloid fibrils and indicates that only a narrow window of mechanisms and assembly rates allows for successful biofilm formation.

Unfortunately, most of the current techniques for in-vitro biofilm formation are not compatible with high throughput screening techniques that can speed up discovery of new drugs with anti-biofilm activity. To try to overcome this major impediment, our group has developed a novel technique consisting of micro-scale culture of microbial biofilms on a microarray platform. Using this technique, hundreds to thousands of microbial biofilms, each with a volume of approximately 30-50 nanolitres, can be simultaneously formed on a standard microscope slide. Despite more than three orders of magnitude of miniaturization over conventional biofilms, these nanobiofilms display similar growth, structural and phenotypic properties, including antibiotic drug resistance. These nanobiofilm chips are amenable to automation, drastically reducing assay volume and costs.

However, this approach to prevention is impractical for many individuals, so dental caries and periodontal disease are highly prevalent globally. Experts recently agreed that a toothpaste with fluoride and a plaque control agent can augment mechanical procedures to simultaneously prevent caries and periodontal disease. Notwithstanding this, it is timely to rethink prevention and oral health promotion. A new definition of oral health raises awareness of its different dimensions and empowers dentistry to move from treating disease to supporting prevention. In addition, a deeper understanding of the relationship between oral biofilms and the host facilitates new opportunities for disease prevention. The knowledge that health-associated biofilms help prevent establishment of pathogenic species, regulate the potentially damaging host response, and provide essential benefits to health and well-being is paramount to changing the paradigm of prevention of dental disease. Ecological approaches to biofilm control can reduce plaque sufficiently to reduce disease risk, while creating and supporting the beneficial functions of biofilms consistent with health. The knowledge that the oral soft tissues are the primary reservoir of bacteria for tooth recolonization and that reducing bacteria on soft tissues results in improved plaque control and consequently better oral health is also salient. Indeed, a toothpaste that delivers 12-hour protection to the hard and soft tissues (whole mouth protection) and multiple oral health benefits (whole mouth health) could become the future cornerstone of prevention. An innovative fluoride toothpaste with a Dual Zinc plus Arginine multi-functional therapeutic agent offers whole mouth protection against daily oral challenges and whole mouth health for the patient. Within a patient-centered preventive program, next to messaging that motivates towards improved self-care, this toothpaste empowers patients to achieve effective prevention of common oral diseases and better oral health compared to just brushing with an ordinary toothpaste.","authors":[{"name":"Diane Cummins"},{"name":"Philip D Marsh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"12-hour protection"},{"word":"L-arginine"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"control"},{"word":"ecology"},{"word":"fluoride"},{"word":"gingivitis"},{"word":"plaque"},{"word":"prevention"},{"word":"toothpaste"},{"word":"zinc citrate"},{"word":"zinc oxide"}]},"article375":{"pmid":"30620734","title":"Deletion of genes involved in the ketogluconate metabolism, Entner-Doudoroff pathway, and glucose dehydrogenase increase local and invasive virulence phenotypes in Streptococcus pneumoniae.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Streptococcus pneumoniae displays increased resistance to antibiotic therapy following biofilm formation.

Single and double SP 0320 and SP 0675 knockout mutants were created in strain BS72; however, no differences were observed in the biofilm-forming phenotypes of mutants compared to the wild type strain. Using the chinchilla model of otitis media and invasive disease, all three mutants exhibited greatly increased virulence compared to the wild type strain (increased pus formation, tympanic membrane rupture, mortality rates). The SP 0320 gene is located in an operon with SP 0317, SP 0318 and SP 0319, which we bioinformatically annotated as being part of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway.

One of these phosphorelays putatively includes four histidine sensor kinase homologues, DivJ, PleC, PdhS1 and PdhS2, and two response regulators, DivK and PleD. In several different alphaproteobacteria, this pathway influences a conserved downstream phosphorelay that ultimately controls the phosphorylation state of the CtrA master response regulator. The PdhS2 sensor kinase reciprocally regulates biofilm formation and swimming motility. In the current study, the mechanisms by which the A. tumefaciens sensor kinase PdhS2 directs this regulation are delineated. PdhS2 lacking a key residue implicated in phosphatase activity is markedly deficient in proper control of attachment and motility phenotypes, whereas a kinase-deficient PdhS2 mutant is only modestly affected. A genetic interaction between DivK and PdhS2 is revealed, unmasking one of several connections between PdhS2-dependent phenotypes and transcriptional control by CtrA. Epistasis experiments suggest that PdhS2 may function independently of the CckA sensor kinase, the cognate sensor kinase for CtrA, which is inhibited by DivK. Global expression analysis of the pdhS2 mutant reveals a restricted regulon, most likely functioning through CtrA to separately control motility and regulate the levels of the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (cdGMP), thereby affecting the production of adhesive polysaccharides and attachment. We hypothesize that in A. tumefaciens the CtrA regulatory circuit has expanded to include additional inputs through the addition of PdhS-type sensor kinases, likely fine-tuning the response of this organism to the soil microenvironment.","authors":[{"name":"Jason E Heindl"},{"name":"Daniel Crosby"},{"name":"Sukhdev Brar"},{"name":"John F Pinto"},{"name":"Tiyan Singletary"},{"name":"Daniel Merenich"},{"name":"Justin L Eagan"},{"name":"Aaron M Buechlein"},{"name":"Eric L Bruger"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"Clay Fuqua"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Agrobacterium tumefaciens"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"development"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"phosphorelay"},{"word":"sensor kinase"}]},"article378":{"pmid":"30619958","title":"Bacterial biofilm formation on implantable devices and approaches to its treatment and prevention.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"In living organisms, biofilms are defined as complex communities of bacteria residing within an exopolysaccharide matrix that adheres to a surface.

The CF airways become chronically colonized with bacteria in childhood, and over time commensal lung microbes are displaced by bacterial pathogens, leading to a decrease in microbial diversity that correlates with declining patient health. Infection with the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major predictor of morbidity and mortality in CF, with CF individuals often becoming chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa in early adulthood and thereafter having an increased risk of hospitalization. Progression of CF respiratory disease is also influenced by infection with respiratory viruses. Children and adults with CF experience frequent respiratory viral infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus, with RSV and influenza infection linked to the greatest decreases in lung function. Along with directly causing severe respiratory symptoms in CF populations, the impact of respiratory virus infections may be more far-reaching, indirectly promoting bacterial persistence and pathogenesis in the CF respiratory tract. Acquisition of P. aeruginosa in CF patients correlates with seasonal respiratory virus infections, and CF patients colonized with P. aeruginosa experience increased severe exacerbations and declines in lung function during respiratory viral co-infection. In light of such observations, efforts to better understand the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections in the CF airways have been a focus of clinical and basic research in recent years.

Its worldwide use results in widespread presence as a contaminant in surface streams and ground-waters. In this study, we isolated, for the first time, the Plectosphaerella cucumerina AR1 nicosulfuron-degrading fungal strain, a new record from Alnus leaf litter submerged in freshwater. The degradation of nicosulfuron by P. cucumerina AR1 was achieved by a co-metabolism process and followed a first-order model dissipation. Biodegradation kinetics analysis indicated that, in planktonic lifestyle, nicosulfuron degradation by this strain was glucose concentration dependent, with a maximum specific degradation rate of 1 g/L in glucose. When grown on natural substrata (leaf or wood) as the sole carbon sources, the Plectosphaerella cucumerina AR1 developed as a well-established biofilm in 10 days. After addition of nicosulfuron in the medium, the biofilms became thicker, with rising mycelium, after 10 days for leaves and 21 days for wood. Similar biofilm development was observed in the absence of herbicide. These fungal biofilms still conserve the nicosulfuron degradation capacity, using the same pathway as that observed with planktonic lifestyle as evidenced by LC-MS analyses. This pathway involved first the hydrolysis of the nicosulfuron sulfonylurea bridge, leading to the production of two major metabolites: 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine (ADMP) and 2-(aminosulfonyl)-N,N-dimethyl-3-pyridinecarboxamide (ASDM). One minor metabolite, identified as 2-(1-(4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)-ureido)-N,N-dimethyl-nicotinamide (N3), derived from the cleavage of the C-S bond of the sulfonylurea bridge and contraction by elimination of sulfur dioxide. A last metabolite (N4), detected in trace amount, was assigned to 2-(4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-nicotinamide (N4), resulting from the hydrolysis of the N3 urea function. Although fungal growth was unaffected by nicosulfuron, its laccase activity was significantly impaired regardless of lifestyle. Leaf and wood surfaces being good substrata for biofilm development in rivers, P. cucumerina AR1 strain could thus have potential as an efficient candidate for the development of methods aiming to reduce contamination by nicosulfuron in aquatic environments.","authors":[{"name":"Louis Carles"},{"name":"Florent Rossi"},{"name":"Pascale Besse-Hoggan"},{"name":"Christelle Blavignac"},{"name":"Martin Leremboure"},{"name":"Joan Artigas"},{"name":"Isabelle Batisson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Plectosphaerella cucumerina"},{"word":"ascomycete fungus"},{"word":"co-metabolism"},{"word":"degradation"},{"word":"herbicide"},{"word":"natural substrata"},{"word":"sulfonylurea"}]},"article382":{"pmid":"30619221","title":"Heavy Metal Ion Stress on Halobacterium salinarum R1 Planktonic Cells and Biofilms.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Halobacterium salinarum R1 is an extremely halophilic archaeon, able to attach to the surface and to form characteristic biofilm structures under physiological conditions.

We also studied the effects on gene expression in planktonic cells. Investigation of planktonic growth and cell adhesion in the presence of sub-lethal metal concentrations yielded an up to 60% reduced adhesion in case of copper and a significantly enhanced adhesion in case of zinc, whereas nickel treatment had no effect on adhesion. A PMA-qPCR assay was developed to quantify live/dead cells in planktonic cultures and mature biofilms, enabling the investigation of cell vitality after metal exposure. An increased resistance was observed in biofilms with up to 80% in case of copper- and up to 50% in case of zinc exposure compared to planktonic cells. However, nickel-treated biofilms showed no significant increase of cell survival. Microscopic investigation of the architecture of mature biofilms exposed to lethal metal concentrations demonstrated an increased detachment and the formation of large microcolonies after copper treatment, whereas the number of adherent cells increased strongly in nickel-exposed biofilms. In contrast, zinc exposed-biofilms showed no differences compared to the control.

Proteusmirabilis is more commonly associated with UTIs in these abnormalities, especially in patients undergoing catheterisation. This pathogen is able to colonise the host's tissues and to cause disease thanks to the production of many virulence factors such as fimbriae, flagella, immune avoidance, host-damaging factors, and the ability to form crystalline biofilms. In addition, Proteus lipid A may exhibit apoptotic activity and induce desquamation of epithelial cells. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of two clinically isolated strains of P. mirabilis that are phenotypically different, named PM1 of PM2, respectively, to induce apoptosis in human prostatic adenocarcinoma PC-3. Our results demonstrate that PM1 and PM2 are able to activate two different apoptotic pathways, and this different behaviour is confirmed by the expression level of the ZapA gene, molecular fingerprinting and different spectrum of antibiotic resistance.

The overall fold of PaCysB NTD domain is similar to other LysR superfamily proteins and structural superposition revealed one possible DNA-binding model for PaCysB. Structural comparison also revealed great flexibility of the PaCysB RD domain, which may play an important role in bending and transcriptional regulation of target DNA. Taken together, these results expand our current understanding of the complex regulatory networks of T3SS and RetS pathways.

After granules matured, there was no difference in contamination removal between the two types of granules. The protein content in EPS of GAC aerobic granules was higher than that of the control group; however, there was no difference in the polysaccharide content. EPS fluorescence in situ staining demonstrated that inside the aerobic granules, a high concentration of protein encapsulated the GAC. In addition, integrity coefficients indicated that GAC significantly improved the ability of aerobic granules to resist hydraulic shear.

We investigated the effects of indole on toxigenic V. cholerae O1 El Tor during growth under virulence inducing conditions. The indole transcriptome was defined by RNA sequencing and showed widespread changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolism, biofilm production, and virulence factor production. In contrast, genes involved in type VI secretion were not affected by indole. We subsequently found that indole repressed genes involved in V. cholerae pathogenesis, including the ToxR virulence regulon. Consistent with this, indole inhibited cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus production in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of indole on virulence factor production and biofilm were linked to ToxR and the ToxR-dependent regulator LeuO. The expression of leuO was increased by exogenous indole and linked to repression of the ToxR virulence regulon. This process was dependent on the ToxR periplasmic domain, suggesting that indole was a ToxR agonist. This conclusion was further supported by results showing that the ToxR periplasmic domain contributed to indole-mediated increased biofilm production.

We examined the effects of pgl gene deletion on the C. jejuni proteome using label-based liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and validation using data independent acquisition (DIA-SWATH-MS). We quantified 1359 proteins corresponding to ∼84% of the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 genome, and 1080 of these were validated by DIA-SWATH-MS. Deletion of the pglB oligosaccharyltransferase (ΔpglB) resulted in a significant change in abundance of 185 proteins, 137 of which were restored to their wild-type levels by reintroduction of pglB (Δaaz.batpglB::ΔpglB). Deletion of pglB was associated with significantly reduced abundances of pgl targets and increased stress-related proteins, including ClpB, GroEL, GroES, GrpE and DnaK. pglB mutants demonstrated reduced survival following temperature (4 °C and 46 °C) and osmotic (150 mm NaCl) shock and altered biofilm phenotypes compared with wild-type C. jejuni Targeted metabolomics established that pgl negative C. jejuni switched from aspartate (Asp) to proline (Pro) uptake and accumulated intracellular succinate related to proteome changes including elevated PutP/PutA (proline transport and utilization), and reduced DctA/DcuB (aspartate import and succinate export, respectively). ΔpglB chemotaxis to some substrates (Asp, glutamate, succinate and α-ketoglutarate) was reduced and associated with altered abundance of transducer-like (Tlp) proteins. Glycosylation negative C. jejuni were depleted of all respiration-associated proteins that allow the use of alternative electron acceptors under low oxygen.

Notably, Staphylococcus capitis accounted for the majority of these daptomycin-resistant (DAP-R) CoNS. To further investigate the mechanisms of daptomycin resistance in CoNS, daptomycin-susceptible clinical strains of S. capitis and Staphylococcus epidermidis underwent in vitro daptomycin exposure to generate DAP-R CoNS mutants. Unlike that seen with Staphylococcus aureus, alteration of cell surface charge was not observed in the DAP-R CoNS strains, but biofilm formation was compromised.

PCR and sequencing of walK and walR from 17 DAP-R CoNS clinical isolates identified seven nonsynonymous mutations. The results were confirmed by the recreation of the walK SNP in S. epidermidis, which resulted in reduced susceptibility to daptomycin and vancomycin. This study highlights the significance of CoNS in evolving daptomycin resistance and showed that walKR is shared among the staphylococcal species and is involved in antibiotic resistance development.

The integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process is a cost-effective means of upgrading CAS-WWTPs by adding free-floating carrier media, which promotes biofilm formation in the well-mixed suspended growth reactors, providing a potential niche for slow-growing microorganisms. Although IFAS upgrades are typically aimed at enhancing nutrient removal, limited bench- and pilot-scale data indicate that TrOC removal may also be improved. However, only limited reports which focus on a small number of compounds in individual full-scale IFAS-WWTPs have been published to date, and no data is available regarding the removal of estrogenic activity in full-scale IFAS-WWTPs. In this study, six full-scale IFAS-WWTPs were surveyed to quantify TrOC and estrogenic activity removal. Twenty-four hour composite samples of secondary influent and effluent (pre-disinfection) were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), estrogenic activity, and 98 TrOCs. The biomass distribution between the suspended growth phase (i.e. mixed liquor) and IFAS media was also assessed. All IFAS-WWTPs performed well in terms of TSS, COD, and ammonia removal. TN removal varied in accordance with nitrate removal. Total solids per liter of wetted reactor volume ranged from 2.5 to 7.6 g, with 40-60% attached to media. TrOCs with no detection (17) and those with high median removal (23, ≥90% average removal) were observed. Other TrOCs had lower and more variable removal efficiencies.
