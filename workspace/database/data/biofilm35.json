Domestic drinking water systems (DDWSs), which include the plumbing between the water meter and consumer's taps, are the most critical points in which water quality may be affected. In distribution networks, the drinking water temperature and water residence time are regarded as indicators of the drinking water quality. This paper describes an experimental research on the influence of stagnation time and temperature change on drinking water quality in a full-scale DDWS. Two sets of stagnation experiments, during winter and summer months, with various stagnation intervals (up to 168 h of stagnation) were carried out. Water and biofilms were sampled at two different taps, a kitchen and a shower tap. Results from this study indicate that temperature and water stagnation affect both chemical and microbial quality in DDWSs, whereas microbial parameters in stagnant water appear to be driven by the temperature of fresh water. Biofilm formed in the shower pipe contained more total and intact cells than the kitchen pipe biofilm. Alphaproteobacteria were found to dominate in the shower biofilm (78% of all Proteobacteria), while in the kitchen tap biofilm Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were evenly distributed.","authors":[{"name":"Lj Zlatanović"},{"name":"J P van der Hoek"},{"name":"J H G Vreeburg"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Drinking water"},{"word":"Water quality"},{"word":"Water stagnation"},{"word":"Water temperature"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"28732183","title":"New Resins for Dental Composites.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Restorative composites have evolved significantly since they were first introduced in the early 1960s, with most of the development concentrating on the filler technology.

Due to the high water content of biofilms, the attenuation coefficient of biofilms and water are very close, hindering the distinction between biofilms and water without the use of contrast agents. Until now, the use of contrast agents such as barium sulfate, silver-coated micro-particles or 1-chloronaphtalene added to the liquid phase allowed imaging the biofilm 3D morphology. However, these contrast agents are not passive and potentially interact with the biofilm when injected into the sample. Here, we use a natural inorganic compound, namely iron sulfate, as a contrast agent progressively bounded in dilute or colloidal form into the EPS matrix during biofilm growth. By combining a very long source-to-detector distance on a X-ray laboratory source with a Lorentzian filter implemented prior to tomographic reconstruction, we substantially increase the contrast between the biofilm and the surrounding liquid, which allows revealing the 3D biofilm morphology. A comparison of this new method with the method proposed by Davit et al (Davit et al., 2011), which uses barium sulfate as a contrast agent to mark the liquid phase was performed. Quantitative evaluations between the methods revealed substantial differences for the volumetric fractions obtained from both methods. Namely, contrast agent-biofilm interactions (e.g. biofilm detachment) occurring during barium sulfate injection caused a reduction of the biofilm volumetric fraction of more than 50% and displacement of biofilm patches elsewhere in the column. Two key advantages of the newly proposed method are that passive addition of iron sulfate maintains the integrity of the biofilm prior to imaging, and that the biofilm itself is marked by the contrast agent, rather than the liquid phase as in other available methods. The iron sulfate method presented can be applied to understand biofilm development and bioclogging mechanisms in porous materials and the obtained biofilm morphology could be an ideal basis for 3D numerical calculations of hydrodynamic conditions to investigate biofilm-flow coupling.","authors":[{"name":"Maxence Carrel"},{"name":"Mario A Beltran"},{"name":"Verónica L Morales"},{"name":"Nicolas Derlon"},{"name":"Eberhard Morgenroth"},{"name":"Rolf Kaufmann"},{"name":"Markus Holzner"}],"keywords":[]},"article5":{"pmid":"28731847","title":"The Colorful World of Extracellular Electron Shuttles.","date":"2019-01-18","abs":"Descriptions of the changeable, striking colors associated with secreted natural products date back well over a century.

Here, we present a novel nanoscale hydrodynamic film (NHF) that is formed between a solid substrate and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface. The thickness of the NHF can be adjusted by varying the pressure applied between them so that the mass transfer through the NHF can also be controlled. These novel phenomena are characterized and applied to develop a compartmentalized microchamber array with diffusion-tunable and solution-switchable chemostat-like versatile bacterial assays. The NHF-based compartmentalization technique is ideal for not only continuous bacterial cultivation by consistently refreshing various nutrient sources but also various diffusion-based microbial assays such as chemical induction of synthetically engineered bacterial cells and selective growth of a specific bacterial strain with respect to chemical environments. In addition, we show that tight compartmentalization protects cells in the chambers, while biofilm formation and nutrient contamination are eliminated by loading a lysis buffer, which typically hinders long-term continuous cultures and accurate microbial assays on a chip. Therefore, we ensure that the NHF-based compartmentalization platform proposed in this work will facilitate not only fundamental studies in microbiology but also various practical applications of microbes for production of valuable metabolites and byproducts in a high-throughput and highly efficient format.","authors":[{"name":"Minseok Kim"},{"name":"Ji Won Lim"},{"name":"Sung Kuk Lee"},{"name":"Taesung Kim"}],"keywords":[]},"article22":{"pmid":"28725743","title":"Exposure of Mycobacterium marinum to low-shear modeled microgravity: effect on growth, the transcriptome and survival under stress.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria can form biofilms, and certain species can cause hard-to-treat human lung infections.

For the commensal bacteria of the oral cavity, it is important to adapt to environmental stimuli, including human- or bacteria-derived antimicrobial agents. Recently, bacterial-specific signal transduction regulatory systems, called two-component systems (TCSs), which appear to be focused on sensing and adapting to the environment, were discovered. Streptococcus mutans is an oral commensal bacteria and is also known as a cariogenic bacteria. Although the virulence factors of S. mutans have been well demonstrated, the mechanism underlying the adaptation of the species to the oral cavity is poorly understood. S. mutans UA159 has 15 sets of TCSs. Among them, several have been demonstrated to be involved in acid tolerance, competence and biofilm formation. Recently, together with our findings, it was demonstrated that 5 TCSs were involved in resistance to antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, another TCS was associated with the production of bacteriocin. Six of 15 TCSs are associated with antimicrobial agents, implying that S. mutans can survive in the oral cavity by resisting various antimicrobial peptides. In this review, we highlight the role of antimicrobial peptides in the oral cavity.","authors":[{"name":"Miki Kawada-Matsuo"},{"name":"Hitoshi Komatsuzawa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"Bacteriocin"},{"word":"Defensin"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"Two-component system"}]},"article25":{"pmid":"28725026","title":"Microbiome analysis and confocal microscopy of used kitchen sponges reveal massive colonization by Acinetobacter, Moraxella and Chryseobacterium species.","date":"2019-01-23","abs":"The built environment (BE) and in particular kitchen environments harbor a remarkable microbial diversity, including pathogens.

In prokaryotes, the function of pervasive transcription and its output on cell physiology is still unknown. Most bacteria possess termination factor Rho, which represses pervasive, mostly antisense, transcription. Here, we investigate the biological significance of Rho-controlled transcription in the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Rho inactivation strongly affected gene expression in B. subtilis, as assessed by transcriptome and proteome analysis of a rho-null mutant during exponential growth in rich medium. Subsequent physiological analyses demonstrated that a considerable part of Rho-controlled transcription is connected to balanced regulation of three mutually exclusive differentiation programs: cell motility, biofilm formation, and sporulation. In the absence of Rho, several up-regulated sense and antisense transcripts affect key structural and regulatory elements of these differentiation programs, thereby suppressing motility and biofilm formation and stimulating sporulation. We dissected how Rho is involved in the activity of the cell fate decision-making network, centered on the master regulator Spo0A. We also revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of Spo0A activation through Rho-dependent intragenic transcription termination of the protein kinase kinB gene. Altogether, our findings indicate that distinct Rho-controlled transcripts are functional and constitute a previously unknown built-in module for the control of cell differentiation in B. subtilis. In a broader context, our results highlight the recruitment of the termination factor Rho, for which the conserved biological role is probably to repress pervasive transcription, in highly integrated, bacterium-specific, regulatory networks.","authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Bidnenko"},{"name":"Pierre Nicolas"},{"name":"Aleksandra Grylak-Mielnicka"},{"name":"Olivier Delumeau"},{"name":"Sandrine Auger"},{"name":"Anne Aucouturier"},{"name":"Cyprien Guerin"},{"name":"Francis Repoila"},{"name":"Jacek Bardowski"},{"name":"Stéphane Aymerich"},{"name":"Elena Bidnenko"}],"keywords":[]},"article31":{"pmid":"28723923","title":"On the mechanism of Candida tropicalis biofilm reduction by the combined action of naturally-occurring anthraquinones and blue light.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The photoprocesses involved in the photo-induced Candida tropicalis biofilm reduction by two natural anthraquinones (AQs), rubiadin (1) and rubiadin-1-methyl ether (2), were examined.

The strain OE1-1 produces aryl-furanone secondary metabolites, ralfuranones (A, B, J, K and L), dependent on the quorum sensing (QS) system, with methyl 3-hydroxymyristate (3-OH MAME) synthesized by PhcB as a QS signal. Ralfuranones are associated with the feedback loop of the QS system. A ralfuranone productivity-deficient mutant (ΔralA) exhibited significantly reduced growth in intercellular spaces compared with strain OE1-1, losing its virulence. To analyse the function of ralfuranones in mBF formation by OE1-1 cells, we observed cell aggregates of R. solanacearum strains statically incubated in tomato apoplast fluids on filters under a scanning electron microscope. The ΔralA strain formed significantly fewer microcolonies and mBFs than strain OE1-1. Supplementation of ralfuranones A, B, J and K, but not L, significantly enhanced the development of mBF formation by ΔralA. Furthermore, a phcB- and ralA-deleted mutant (ΔphcB/ralA) exhibited less formation of mBFs than OE1-1, although a QS-deficient, phcB-deleted mutant formed mBFs similar to OE1-1. Supplementation with 3-OH MAME significantly reduced the formation of mBFs by ΔphcB/ralA. The application of each ralfuranone significantly increased the formation of mBFs by ΔphcB/ralA supplied with 3-OH MAME.

For instance, the presence of the adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) in this mucosal microbiota has been correlated with Crohn's disease. Using short-term screening assays and a novel long-term dynamic gut model, which comprises a simulated mucosal environment (M-SHIME), we investigated how (potential) pro- and prebiotics may repress colonisation of AIEC from mucus. Despite that during the short-term screening assays, some of the investigated Lactobacillus strains adhered strongly to mucins, none of them competed with AIEC for mucin-adhesion. In contrast, AIEC survival and growth during co-culture batch incubations was decreased by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and L. reuteri 1063, which correlated with (undissociated) lactic acid and reuterin levels. Regarding the prebiotics, long-chain arabinoxylans (LC-AX) lowered the initial mucin-adhesion of AIEC, while both inulin (IN) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) limited AIEC survival and growth during batch incubations. L. reuteri 1063, LC-AX and IN were thus retained for a long-term study with the M-SHIME. All treatments repressed AIEC from mucus without affecting AIEC numbers in the luminal content. As a possible explanation, L. reuteri 1063 treatment increased lactobacilli levels in mucus, while LC-AX and IN additionally increased mucosal bifidobacteria levels, thus leading to antimicrobial effects against AIEC in mucus.

This model, named Piggyback-the-Winner (PtW), contrasts to current accepted models on the frequency of lysis and lysogeny and predicts that phages integrate into their hosts' genomes as prophages when microbial abundances and growth rates are high. According to PtW, switching to the temperate life cycle reduces phage predation control on bacterial abundance and confers superinfection exclusion, preventing that a closely-related phage infects the same bacterial cell. Here we examine how PtW is important for metazoans. Specifically, we postulate that PtW and the recently described bacteriophage adherence to mucus (BAM) model are strongly interrelated and have an important role in the development of the microbiome. In BAM, phage produced by the microbiome attach to mucins and protect underlying epithelial cells from invading bacteria. Spatial structuring of the mucus creates a gradient of phage replication strategies consistent with PtW. We predict that lysogeny is favored at the top mucosal layer and lytic predation predominates in the bacteria-sparse intermediary layers. The lysogeny confers competitive advantage to commensals against niche invasion and the lytic infection eliminates potential pathogens from deeper mucus layers.","authors":[{"name":"Cynthia B Silveira"},{"name":"Forest L Rohwer"}],"keywords":[]},"article43":{"pmid":"28721246","title":"Oral treatment with Eubacterium hallii improves insulin sensitivity in db/db mice.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"An altered intestinal microbiota composition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

PUGSK8.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Luminescent vibrios are ubiquitous in the marine environment and are the causative agents of vibriosis and mass mortality in many aquatic animals. In aquatic environments, treatments cannot be limited to the diseased population alone, therefore treatment of the entire aquatic system is the only possible approach. Thus, the use of antibiotics to treat part of the infected animals requires a dose based on the entire biomass, which results in the treatment of uninfected animals as well as non-target normal microbial flora. A treatment method based on anti-virulence or quorum quenching has recently been proposed as an effective treatment strategy for aquatic animals. Polyhydroxy butyrates (PHB) are bacterial storage molecules, which accumulate in cells under nutritional stress. The degradation of PHB releases short-chain β-hydroxy butyric acid, which may act as anti-infective molecule. To date, there is very limited information on the potential anti-infective and anti-virulence mechanisms involving PHB. In this study, we aim to examine the effect of PHB on inhibition of the virulence cascade of Vibrio such as biofilm formation, luminescence, motility behaviour, haemolysin and quorum sensing. A luminescent Vibrio PUGSK8, tentatively identified as Vibrio campbellii PUGSK8 was tested in vitro for production of extracellular virulence factors and then established as a potential shrimp pathogen based on in vivo challenge experiments. The ability of Vibrio PUGSK8 to form biofilms and the effect of PHB on biofilm formation was tested in a 96-well microtitre-plate assay system. The motility behaviour of Vibrio PUGSK8 was evaluated using twitching, swimming and swarming plate assays. Reporter strains such as Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens were used to detect quorum-sensing molecules. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry spectral analysis was performed to elucidate the fragmentation pattern and structure of N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone. PHB depolymerase activity in Vibrio PUGSK8 was quantified as the amount of the enzyme solution to hydrolyse 1 μg of PHB per min. An in vivo challenge experiment was performed using a gnotobiotic Artemia assay. Of the 27 isolates tested, the Vibrio PUGSK8 strain was selected for target-specific assays based on the high intensity of luminescence and production of virulence factors. The virulence cascade detected in Vibrio PUGSK8 include luminescence, motility behaviour, biofilm formation, quorum sensing and haemolysin production. Thus inhibition/degradation of the virulence cascade would be an effective approach to contain Vibrio infections in aquatic animals. In this report, we demonstrate that the degradation intermediate of PHB effectively inhibits biofilm formation, luminescence, motility behaviour, haemolysin production and the N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated quorum-sensing pathway in PUGSK8. Interestingly, the growth of Vibrio PUGSK8 remains unaffected in the presence of PHB, with PHB degradation being detected in the media. PHB depolymerase activity in Vibrio PUGSK8 results in the release of degradation intermediates include a short-chain β-hydroxy butyric acid, which inhibits the virulence cascade in Vibrio PUGSK8. Thus, a molecule that targets quorum sensing and the virulence cascade and which is species/strain-specific could prove to be an effective alternative to antimicrobial agents to control the pathogenesis of Vibrio, and thereby help to contain Vibrio outbreaks in aquatic systems.","authors":[{"name":"George Seghal Kiran"},{"name":"Sethu Priyadharshini"},{"name":"Alan D W Dobson"},{"name":"Elumalai Gnanamani"},{"name":"Joseph Selvin"}],"keywords":[]},"article46":{"pmid":"28721044","title":"Stimulated phase-shift acoustic nanodroplets enhance vancomycin efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Bacterial biofilms on the surface of prostheses are becoming a rising concern in managing prosthetic joint infections.

In debilitated and immunocompromised individuals, C. albicans may spread to cause life-threatening systemic infections. Upon contact with serum and at body temperature, C. albicans performs a regulated switch to filamentous morphology, characterized by emergence of a germ tube from the yeast cell followed by mold-like growth of branching hyphae. The ability to switch between growth morphologies is an important virulence factor of C. albicans. To identify compounds able to inhibit hyphal morphogenesis, we screened libraries of existing drugs for inhibition of the hyphal switch under stringent conditions. Several compounds that specifically inhibited hyphal morphogenesis were identified. Chemogenomic analysis suggested an interaction with the endocytic pathway, which was confirmed by direct measurement of fluid-phase endocytosis in the presence of these compounds. These results suggest that the activity of the endocytic pathway, which is known to be particularly important for hyphal growth, represents an effective target for hyphae-inhibiting drugs.","authors":[{"name":"Hagit Bar-Yosef"},{"name":"Nora Vivanco Gonzalez"},{"name":"Shay Ben-Aroya"},{"name":"Stephen J Kron"},{"name":"Daniel Kornitzer"}],"keywords":[]},"article50":{"pmid":"28720810","title":"Biofilm formation in enterococci: genotype-phenotype correlations and inhibition by vancomycin.","date":"2019-01-23","abs":"Enterococci are nosocomial pathogens that can form biofilms, which contribute to their virulence and antibiotic resistance.

Here, we assessed the biofilm-forming ability of 90 enterococcal clinical isolates. Major patterns of virulence gene distribution in enterococcal genomes were identified, and the differentiating virulence genes were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 31 of the clinical isolates.

Streptococcus mutans is one of the most effective microorganisms in lactic acid production of the dental biofilm. Identifying essential Streptococcus mutans proteins using bioinformatics methods helps to search for alternative therapies. To this end, the bacterial genomes of several Streptococcus mutans strains and representative strains of other cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria were analysed by identifying pathogenicity islands and alignments with other bacteria, and by detecting the exclusive genes of cariogenic species in comparison to the non-pathogenic ones. This study used tools for orthology prediction such as BLAST and OrthoMCL, as well as the server IslandViewer for the detection of pathogenicity islands. In addition, the potential interactome of Streptococcus mutans was rebuilt by comparing it to interologues of other species phylogenetically close to or associated with cariogenicity. This protocol yielded a final list of 20 proteins related to potentially virulent factors that can be used as therapeutic targets in future analyses. The EIIA and EIIC enzymatic subunits of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) were prioritized, as well as the pyruvate kinase enzyme, which are directly involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and in obtaining the necessary energy for the microorganism's survival.

Certain plant-derived compounds (PDCs) can impair bacterial virulence by suppressing pathogenic factors of R. solanacearum. However, the inhibitory mechanisms of PDCs in bacterial virulence remain largely unknown. In this study, we screened a library of coumarins and derivatives, natural PDCs with fused benzene and α-pyrone rings, for their effects on expression of the type III secretion system (T3SS) of R. solanacearum. Here, we show that umbelliferone (UM), a 7-hydroxycoumarin, suppressed T3SS regulator gene expression through HrpG-HrpB and PrhG-HrpB pathways. UM decreased gene expression of six type III effectors (RipX, RipD, RipP1, RipR, RipTAL, and RipW) of 10 representative effector genes but did not alter T2SS expression. In addition, biofilm formation of R. solanacearum was significantly reduced by UM, though swimming activity was not affected. We then observed that UM suppressed the wilting disease process by reducing colonization and proliferation in tobacco roots and stems. In summary, the findings reveal that UM may serve as a plant-derived inhibitor to manipulate R. solanacearum T3SS and biofilm formation, providing proof of concept that these key virulence factors are potential targets for the integrated control of bacterial wilt.","authors":[{"name":"Liang Yang"},{"name":"Shili Li"},{"name":"Xiyun Qin"},{"name":"Gaofei Jiang"},{"name":"Juanni Chen"},{"name":"Bide Li"},{"name":"Xiaoyuan Yao"},{"name":"Peibo Liang"},{"name":"Yong Zhang"},{"name":"Wei Ding"}],"keywords":[{"word":"R. solanacearum"},{"word":"bacterial wilt"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"coumarins"},{"word":"inhibitor"},{"word":"type III secretion system"},{"word":"umbelliferone"}]},"article79":{"pmid":"28713356","title":"A Genotypic Analysis of Five P. aeruginosa Strains after Biofilm Infection by Phages Targeting Different Cell Surface Receptors.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Antibiotic resistance constitutes one of the most serious threats to the global public health and urgently requires new and effective solutions. Bacteriophages are bacterial viruses increasingly recognized as being good alternatives to traditional antibiotic therapies. In this study, the efficacy of phages, targeting different cell receptors, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm and planktonic cell cultures was evaluated over the course of 48 h. Although significant reductions in the number of viable cells were achieved for both cases, the high level of adaptability of the bacteria in response to the selective pressure caused by phage treatment resulted in the emergence of phage-resistant variants. To further investigate the genetic makeup of phage-resistant variants isolated from biofilm infection experiments, some of these bacteria were selected for phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Whole genome sequencing was performed on five phage-resistant variants and all of them carried mutations affecting the galU gene as well as one of pil genes. The sequencing analysis further revealed that three of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 variants carry large deletions (>200 kbp) in their genomes. Complementation of the galU mutants with wild-type galU in trans restored LPS expression on the bacterial cell surface of these bacterial strains and rendered the complemented strains to be sensitive to phages. This provides unequivocal evidence that inactivation of galU function was associated with resistance to the phages that uses LPS as primary receptors. Overall, this work demonstrates that P. aeruginosa biofilms can survive phage attack and develop phage-resistant variants exhibiting defective LPS production and loss of type IV pili that are well adapted to the biofilm mode of growth.","authors":[{"name":"Diana P Pires"},{"name":"Andreas Dötsch"},{"name":"Erin M Anderson"},{"name":"Youai Hao"},{"name":"Cezar M Khursigara"},{"name":"Joseph S Lam"},{"name":"Sanna Sillankorva"},{"name":"Joana Azeredo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacterial resistance"},{"word":"bacteriophages"},{"word":"biofilms"}]},"article80":{"pmid":"28713344","title":"Outer Membrane Proteome of Veillonella parvula: A Diderm Firmicute of the Human Microbiome.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Veillonella parvula is a biofilm-forming commensal found in the lungs, vagina, mouth, and gastro-intestinal tract of humans, yet it may develop into an opportunistic pathogen. Furthermore, the presence of Veillonella has been associated with the development of a healthy immune system in infants. Veillonella belongs to the Negativicutes, a diverse clade of bacteria that represent an evolutionary enigma: they phylogenetically belong to Gram-positive (monoderm) Firmicutes yet maintain an outer membrane (OM) with lipopolysaccharide similar to classic Gram-negative (diderm) bacteria. The OMs of Negativicutes have unique characteristics including the replacement of Braun's lipoprotein by OmpM for tethering the OM to the peptidoglycan. Through phylogenomic analysis, we have recently provided bioinformatic annotation of the Negativicutes diderm cell envelope. We showed that it is a unique type of envelope that was present in the ancestor of present-day Firmicutes and lost multiple times independently in this phylum, giving rise to the monoderm architecture; however, little experimental data is presently available for any Negativicutes cell envelope. Here, we performed the first experimental proteomic characterization of the cell envelope of a diderm Firmicute, producing an OM proteome of V. parvula. We initially conducted a thorough bioinformatics analysis of all 1,844 predicted proteins from V. parvula DSM 2008's genome using 12 different localization prediction programs. These results were complemented by protein extraction with surface exposed (SE) protein tags and by subcellular fractionation, both of which were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The merging of proteomics and bioinformatics results allowed identification of 78 OM proteins. These include a number of receptors for TonB-dependent transport, the main component of the BAM system for OM protein biogenesis (BamA), the Lpt system component LptD, which is responsible for insertion of LPS into the OM, and several copies of the major OmpM protein. The annotation of V. parvula's OM proteome markedly extends previous inferences on the nature of the cell envelope of Negativicutes, including the experimental evidence of a BAM/TAM system for OM protein biogenesis and of a complete Lpt system for LPS transport to the OM. It also provides important information on the role of OM components in the lifestyle of Veillonella, such as a possible gene cluster for O-antigen synthesis and a large number of adhesins. Finally, many OM hypothetical proteins were identified, which are priority targets for further characterization.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel I Poppleton"},{"name":"Magalie Duchateau"},{"name":"Véronique Hourdel"},{"name":"Mariette Matondo"},{"name":"Jennifer Flechsler"},{"name":"Andreas Klingl"},{"name":"Christophe Beloin"},{"name":"Simonetta Gribaldo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BAM/TAM complex"},{"word":"LPS"},{"word":"Lpt system"},{"word":"Negativicutes"},{"word":"O-antigen"},{"word":"OmpM"},{"word":"adhesins"},{"word":"proteomics"}]},"article81":{"pmid":"28713229","title":"Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces that Prevent Microbial Surface Fouling and Kill Non-Adherent Pathogens in Surrounding Media: A Controlled Release Approach.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Many types of slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (or 'SLIPS') can resist adhesion and colonization by microorganisms. These 'slippery' materials thus offer new approaches to prevent fouling on a range of commercial and industrial surfaces, including biomedical devices. However, while SLIPS can prevent fouling on surfaces to which they are applied, they can currently do little to prevent the proliferation of non-adherent (planktonic) organisms, stop them from colonizing other surfaces, or prevent them from engaging in other behaviors that could lead to infection and associated burdens. Here, we report an approach to the design of multi-functional SLIPS that addresses these issues and expands the potential utility of slippery surfaces in antimicrobial contexts. Our approach is based on the incorporation and controlled release of small-molecule antimicrobial agents from the porous matrices used to host infused slippery oil phases. We demonstrate that SLIPS fabricated using nanoporous polymer multilayers can prevent short- and longer-term colonization and biofilm formation by four common fungal and bacterial pathogens (Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus), and that the polymer and oil phases comprising these materials can be exploited to load and sustain the release of triclosan, a model hydrophobic and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, into surrounding media. This approach both improves the inherent anti-fouling properties of these materials and endows them with the ability to efficiently kill planktonic pathogens. Finally, we show that this approach can be used to fabricate dual-action SLIPS on complex surfaces, including the luminal surfaces of flexible catheter tubes. This strategy has the potential to be general; we anticipate that the materials, strategies, and concepts reported here will enable new approaches to the design of slippery surfaces with improved anti-fouling properties and open the door to new applications of slippery liquid-infused materials that host or promote the release of a variety of other active agents.","authors":[{"name":"Uttam Manna"},{"name":"Namrata Raman"},{"name":"Michael A Welsh"},{"name":"Yashira M Zayas-Gonzalez"},{"name":"Helen E Blackwell"},{"name":"Sean P Palecek"},{"name":"David M Lynn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial"},{"word":"Antifungal"},{"word":"Controlled Release"},{"word":"Multilayers"},{"word":"Slippery Surfaces"}]},"article82":{"pmid":"28712963","title":"Anti-quorum sensing activity of Pistacia atlantica against Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and identification of its bioactive compounds.","date":"2019-01-04","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug resistant opportunistic pathogen and an important cause of nosocomial infections.

Non-efficient cleaning of equipment surfaces and piping can act as a conditioning layer that affects the development of a new biofilm post-disinfection. We have previously shown that surface conditioning with cell extracts could reduce biofilm formation. In the present work, we hypothesized that E. coli cell wall components could be implicated in this phenomena and therefore mannose, myristic acid and palmitic acid were tested as conditioning agents. To evaluate the effect of surface conditioning and flow topology on biofilm formation, assays were performed in agitated 96-well microtiter plates and in a parallel plate flow chamber (PPFC), both operated at the same average wall shear stress (0.07 Pa) as determined by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It was observed that when the 96-well microtiter plate and the PPFC were used to form biofilms at the same shear stress, similar results were obtained. This shows that the referred hydrodynamic feature may be a good scale-up parameter from high-throughput platforms to larger scale flow cell systems as the PPFC used in this study. Mannose did not have any effect on E. coli biofilm formation, but myristic and palmitic acid inhibited biofilm development by decreasing cell adhesion (in about 50%). These results support the idea that in food processing equipment where biofilm formation is not critical below a certain threshold, bacterial lysis and adsorption of cell components to the surface may reduce biofilm buildup and extend the operational time.","authors":[{"name":"Luciana C Gomes"},{"name":"Joana M R Moreira"},{"name":"José D P Araújo"},{"name":"Filipe J Mergulhão"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"computational fluid dynamics"},{"word":"mannose"},{"word":"microtiter plate"},{"word":"myristic acid"},{"word":"palmitic acid"},{"word":"parallel plate flow chamber"},{"word":"surface conditioning"}]},"article90":{"pmid":"28710998","title":"The potential multiple mechanisms and microbial communities in simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process treating high carbon and nitrogen concentration saline wastewater.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"A simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) process in sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) was established to treat high carbon and nitrogen saline wastewater in this study.

Survival may be related to the phenotype of individual strains including the ability to form biofilms and resist desiccation and/or sanitizer exposure. The objectives of this research were to compare 14 L. monocytogenes strains isolated from blood (3), food (6) and water (5) with respect to their benzalkonium chloride (BAC) sensitivity, desiccation resistance, and ability to form biofilm. Correlations were tested between those responses, and the presence of the SSI-1 (Stress Survival Islet) and LGI1/CC8 (Listeria Genomic Island 1 in a clonal complex 8 background) genetic markers. Genetic sequences from four strains representing different phenotypes were also probed for predicted amino acid differences in biofilm, desiccation, and membrane related genes. The water isolates were among the most desiccation susceptible strains, while strains exhibiting desiccation resistance harboured SSI-1 or both the SSI-1 and LGI1/CC8 markers. BAC resistance was greatest in planktonic LGI1/CC8 cells (relative to non-LGI1/CC8 cells), and higher BAC concentrations were also needed to inhibit the formation of biofilm by LGI1/CC8 strains during incubation for 48h and 6days compared to other strains. Formation of biofilm on stainless steel was not significantly (p>0.05) different among the strains. Analysis of genetic sequence data from desiccation and BAC sensitive (CP4 5-1, CP5 2-3, both from water), intermediate (Lm568, food) and desiccation and BAC resistant (08 5578, blood, human outbreak) strains led to the finding of amino acid differences in predicted functional protein domains in several biofilm, desiccation and peptidoglycan related genes (e.g., lmo0263, lmo0433, lmo0434, lmo0771, lmo0973, lmo1080, lmo1224, lmo1370, lmo1744, and lmo2558).

To combat antibiotics, microorganisms employ their pre-existing defence mechanisms that existed long before man's discovery of antibiotics. Bacteria utilise levels of protection that range from gene upregulation, mutations, adaptive resistance, and production of resistant phenotypes (persisters) to communal behaviour, as in swarming and the ultimate defence of a biofilm. A major part of all of these responses involves the use of antibiotic efflux transporters. At the single cell level, it is becoming apparent that the use of efflux pumps is the first line of defence against an antibiotic, as these pumps decrease the intracellular level of antibiotic while the cell activates the various other levels of protection. This frontline of defence involves a coordinated network of efflux transporters. In the future, inhibition of this efflux transporter network, as a target for novel antibiotic therapy, will require the isolation and then biochemical/biophysical characterisation of each pump against all known and new antibiotics.

Early phase biofilms are also prone to damage by the latter steps. In bacteria like mycobacteria, biofilm formation occurs largely at the liquid-air interphase which is susceptible to loss. In the proposed protocol, loss of such biofilm layer was prevented. In place of inverting and discarding the media which can lead to the loss of the aerobic biofilm layer in CV assay, media was removed from the formed biofilm with the help of a syringe and biofilm layer was allowed to dry. The staining and washing steps were avoided, and an organic solvent-tetrahydrofuran (THF) was deployed to dissolve the biofilm, and the absorbance was recorded at 595 nm. The protocol was tested for biofilm estimation of E. coli, B. subtilis and M. smegmatis, and compared with the traditional CV assays. Isoniazid drug molecule, a known inhibitor of M. smegmatis biofilm, was tested and its inhibitory effects were quantified by the proposed protocol. For ease in referring, this method has been described as the Syal method for biofilm quantification.

This hypothesis was tested in the present study using viability assays, flow cytometry, and cell tracking. The results revealed that shorter E. coli cells detached from stiff PDMS were easier to be phagocytized than the longer cells from soft PDMS surfaces. Furthermore, macrophage cells were found to be more motile on stiff PDMS surfaces and more effective at phagocytosis of E. coli cells attached on these surfaces.

Culture-based diagnostics were found to be insufficiently sensitive for the assessment of the composition of biofilms in chronic wounds and poorly standardized for screenings for enteric colonization with multi-drug resistant bacteria. However, the increased sensitivity of qPCR causes interpretative challenges regarding the attribution of etiological relevance to individual pathogen species in case of multiple detections of facultative pathogenic microorganisms in primarily non-sterile sample materials. This is particularly the case in high-endemicity settings, where continuous exposition to respective microorganisms leads to immunological adaptation and semi-resistance while considerable disease would result in case of exposition of a non-adapted population. While biofilms in chronic wounds show higher pathogenic potential in case of multi-species composition, detection of multiple pathogens in respiratory samples is much more difficult to interpret and asymptomatic enteric colonization with facultative pathogenic microorganisms is frequently observed in high endemicity settings. For respiratory samples and stool samples, cycle-threshold-value-based semi-quantitative interpretation of qPCR results has been suggested. Etiological relevance is assumed if cycle-threshold values are low, suggesting high pathogen loads. Although the procedure is challenged by lacking standardization and methodical issues, first evaluations have led to promising results.

The serotypes 2 and 9 are often considered the most virulent and prevalent serotypes involved in swine infections, especially in Europe.

In several pathogenic streptococci, expression of multimodal adhesion proteins known as antigen I/II (AgI/II) have been linked with persistence in the upper respiratory tract and the oral cavity, as well as with bacterial dissemination. Herein, we report expression of these immunostimulatory factors by S. suis serotype 2 and 9 strains and that AgI/II-encoding genes are carried by integrative and conjugative elements. Using mutagenesis and different in vitro assays, we demonstrate that the contribution of AgI/II to the virulence of the serotype 2 strain used herein appears to be modest. In contrast, data demonstrate that the serotype 9 AgI/II participates in self-aggregation, induces salivary glycoprotein 340-related aggregation, contributes to biofilm formation and increased strain resistance to low pH, as well as in bacterial adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and epithelial cells. Moreover, the use of a porcine infection model revealed that AgI/II contributes to colonization of the upper respiratory tract of pigs.

However, in susceptible hosts, especially hospitalized and/or immunocompromised patients, it may cause a wide range of infections. The presence of abiotic substrates, such as central venous or urinary catheters, provides an additional niche for Candida attachment and persistence, particularly via biofilm development. Furthermore, Candida biofilm is poorly susceptible to most antifungals, including azoles. Here we investigated the effects of a synthetic killer peptide (KP), known to be active in vitro, ex vivo and/or in vivo against different pathogens, on C. albicans biofilm. Together with a scrambled peptide used as a negative control, KP was tested against Candida biofilm at different stages of development. A reference strain, two fluconazole-resistant and two fluconazole-susceptible C. albicans clinical isolates were used. KP-induced C. albicans oxidative stress response and membrane permeability were also analysed. Moreover, the effect of KP on transcriptional profiles of C. albicans genes involved in different stages of biofilm development, such as cell adhesion, hyphal development and extracellular matrix production, was evaluated. Our results clearly show that the treatment with KP strongly affected the capacity of C. albicans to form biofilm and significantly impairs preformed mature biofilm. KP treatment resulted in an increase in C. albicans oxidative stress response and membrane permeability; also, biofilm-related genes expression was significantly reduced. Comparable inhibitory effects were observed in all the strains employed, irrespective of their resistance or susceptibility to fluconazole. Finally, KP-mediated inhibitory effects were observed also against a catheter-associated C. albicans biofilm.

We believe this strategy of dividing otherwise coordinated pathogens and breaking up their shielded stronghold represents a blueprint for cellular anti-infectives in the postantibiotic era.","authors":[{"name":"Ferdinand Sedlmayer"},{"name":"Tina Jaeger"},{"name":"Urs Jenal"},{"name":"Martin Fussenegger"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Quorum Quenching"},{"word":"Synthetic gene network"},{"word":"anti-infectives"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell-based therapy"}]},"article134":{"pmid":"28703572","title":"Development of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate-Encapsulated Nanohydroxyapatite/Mesoporous Silica for Therapeutic Management of Dentin Surface.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"In dental clinic, unsatisfactory management of the dentin surface after dentin exposure often leads to the occurrence of dentin hypersensitivity and caries. Current approaches can occlude the tubules on the dentin surface to relieve dentin hypersensitivity; however, the blocked tubules are generally weak in combating daily tooth erosion and abrasion. Moreover, cariogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus mutans, produce biofilm on the dentin surface, causing caries and compromising the tubules' sealing efficacy. To overcome this problem, the present study focused on establishing a versatile biomaterial, epigallocatechin-3-gallate-encapsulated nanohydroxyapatite/mesoporous silica nanoparticle (EGCG@nHAp@MSN), for therapeutic management of the dentin surface. The effectiveness of the biomaterial on dentinal tubule occlusion, including resistances against acid and abrasion, was evaluated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and dentin permeability measurement. The inhibitory capability of the biomaterial on S. mutans biofilm formation was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, colony forming units (CFU) counts, and FESEM. Results demonstrated for the first time that the use of EGCG@nHAp@MSN on the dentin surface was capable of effectively occluding dentinal tubules, reducing dentin permeability, and achieving favorable acid- and abrasion-resistant stability. Furthermore, EGCG@nHAp@MSN held the capability to continuously release EGCG, Ca, and P, and significantly inhibit the formation and growth of S. mutans biofilm on the dentin surface. Thus, the development of EGCG@nHAp@MSN bridges the gap between multifunctional concept and dental clinical practice and is promising in providing dentists a therapeutic strategy for the management of the dentin surface to counter dentin hypersensitivity and caries.","authors":[{"name":"Jian Yu"},{"name":"Hongye Yang"},{"name":"Kang Li"},{"name":"Hongyu Ren"},{"name":"Jinmei Lei"},{"name":"Cui Huang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"dentin hypersensitivity"},{"word":"epigallocatechin-3-gallate"},{"word":"mesoporous silica nanoparticles"},{"word":"nanohydroxyapatite"}]},"article135":{"pmid":"28703468","title":"Escherichia coli isolates from commercial chicken meat and eggs cause sepsis, meningitis and urinary tract infection in rodent models of human infections.","date":"2018-08-08","abs":"The zoonotic potential of Escherichia coli from chicken-source food products is important to define for public health purposes. Previously, genotypic and phenotypic screening of E. coli isolates from commercial chicken meat and shell eggs identified some E. coli strains that by molecular criteria resembled human-source extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Here, to clarify the zoonotic risk of such chicken-source E. coli, we compared selected E. coli isolates from chicken meat and eggs, stratified by molecularly defined ExPEC status, to human-source ExPEC and to laboratory E. coli for virulence in rodent models of sepsis, meningitis and UTI, and evaluated whether specific bacterial characteristics predict experimental virulence. Multiple chicken-source E. coli resembled human-source ExPEC in their ability to cause one or multiple different ExPEC-associated infections. Swimming ability corresponded with urovirulence, K1 capsule corresponded with ability to cause neonatal meningitis, and biofilm formation in urine corresponded with ability to cause sepsis. In contrast, molecularly defined ExPEC status and individual genotypic traits were uncorrelated with ability to cause sepsis, and neither complement sensitivity nor growth in human urine corresponded with virulence in any infection model. These findings establish that chicken-derived food products contain E. coli strains that, in rodent models of multiple human-associated ExPEC infections, are able to cause disease comparably to human-source E. coli clinical isolates, which suggests that they may pose a significant food safety threat.

Using high throughput small subunit ribosomal RNA sequencing, we found more taxonomic richness in Bacteria, Archaea and microbial eukaryotes in the perennially unfrozen biofilms compared to moat communities. The deep communities contained both aerobic and anaerobic taxa including denitrifiers, sulfate reducers, and methanogenic Archaea. The water overlying the deep biofilms was well oxygenated in mid-summer but almost devoid of oxygen in spring, indicating anoxia during winter.

As biofilm formation is usually regulated by environmental conditions, we hypothesized that serum composition may be altered after burn injury, potentially affecting the ability of infecting bacteria to form biofilms. As predicted, we observed that serum from burn-injured rats increases biofilm formation by S. aureus and also induces bacterial aggregation and adherence to human fibronectin and fibrinogen. Analysis of potential regulatory factors revealed that exposure to burn serum decreases expression of the quorum-sensing agr system and increases mRNA levels of some biofilm inducers such as sarA and icaA. In addition, we also observed that burn serum imposes oxidative stress and increases expression of key oxidoreductase genes (sodA, sodM, katA, and ahpC) in S. aureus. Importantly, the ability of burn serum to enhance biofilm formation and bacterial cell aggregation can be abrogated by treatment with an antioxidant. Taken together, these findings indicate that burn serum increases S. aureus biofilm formation via elevated oxidative stress, and may lead to novel strategies to control biofilm formation and infection in burn patients.","authors":[{"name":"Supeng Yin"},{"name":"Bei Jiang"},{"name":"Guangtao Huang"},{"name":"Yali Gong"},{"name":"Bo You"},{"name":"Zichen Yang"},{"name":"Yu Chen"},{"name":"Jing Chen"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Yuan"},{"name":"Ming Li"},{"name":"Fuquan Hu"},{"name":"Yan Zhao"},{"name":"Yizhi Peng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"burn injury"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"serum"}]},"article141":{"pmid":"28702008","title":"Hypersensitive Response of Plasmid-Encoded AHL Synthase Gene to Lifestyle and Nutrient by Ensifer adhaerens X097.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"It is known that some bacteria, especially members of the family Rhizobiaceae, have multiple N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) synthase genes and produce multiple AHL signals.

In this study, an actinobacterial strain MSA31 was isolated from a marine sponge Fasciospongia cavernosa which showed high activity in biosurfactant screening assays such as drop collapsing, oil displacement, lipase and emulsification. Lipopeptide produced by MSA31 was found to be thermostable which was evident in differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The spectral data obtained in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the presence of aliphatic groups combined with peptide moiety which is a characteristic feature of lipopeptides. The stability index of lipopeptide MSA31 revealed halo-alkali and thermal tolerant biosurfactant which can be used in the food industry. Microtiter plate assay showed 125 μg/ml of lipopeptide was effective in reducing the biofilm formation activity of pathogenic multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The confocal laser scanning microscopic images provided further evidences that lipopeptide MSA31 was an effective antibiofilm agent. The antioxidant activity of lipopeptide MSA31 may be due to the presence of unsaturated fatty acid present in the molecule. The brine shrimp cytotoxicity assay showed lipopeptide MSA31 was non-toxic and can be used as food additives. Incorporation of lipopeptide MSA31 in muffin showed improved organoleptic qualities compared to positive and negative control.

STK1, despite being nonessential protein for MRSA survival, it can serve as an important therapeutic agent for combination therapy. Here, we report a novel small molecule quinazoline compound, Inh2-B1, which specifically inhibits STK1 activity by directly binding to its ATP-binding catalytic domain. Functional analyses encompassing in vitro growth inhibition of MRSA, and in vivo protection studies in mice against the lethal MRSA challenge indicated that at high concentration neither Inh2-B1 nor Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime alone was able to inhibit the growth of bacteria or protect the challenged mice. However, the growth of MRSA was inhibited, and a significant protection in mice against the bacterial challenge was observed at a micromolar concentration of Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime in the presence of Inh2-B1. Cell-dependent minimal to no toxicity of Inh2-B1, and its abilities to down-regulate cell wall hydrolase genes and disrupt the biofilm formation of MRSA clearly indicated that Inh2-B1 serves as a therapeutically important antibiotic-resistance-breaker, which enhances the bactericidal activity of Ceftriaxone/Cefotaxime against highly pathogenic MRSA infection.","authors":[{"name":"Sashi Kant"},{"name":"Shailendra Asthana"},{"name":"Dominique Missiakas"},{"name":"Vijay Pancholi"}],"keywords":[]},"article160":{"pmid":"28698557","title":"Controls on eDNA movement in streams: Transport, Retention, and Resuspension.","date":"2019-01-28","abs":"Advances in detection of genetic material from species in aquatic ecosystems, including environmental DNA (eDNA), have improved species monitoring and management. eDNA from target species can readily move in streams and rivers and the goal is to measure it, and with that infer where and how abundant species are, adding great value to delimiting species invasions, monitoring and protecting rare species, and estimating biodiversity.

We developed a new strategy for evaluating molecular formula data sets obtained by ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS), in which the time-dependent change of component abundance was fitted by a linear regression model after normalization of mass peak intensities. All components were categorized by calculating the slope (change of percent intensity per day) in each of the seven flumes. These slopes were then related to cumulative bacterial production. The concentration of DOM decreased quickly in all flumes. Bacterial activity was higher in flumes with percolated sediment than in those without percolation, whereas plankton bacterial activity was higher in flumes without percolation or without sediment. There were no differences in molecular-DOM characteristics between flumes, but there were distinct changes over time. Positive slopes, i.e. increasing intensities over time, were found for small molecules (MW < 450 Da) and high O/C ratios, whereas decreasing intensities were observed less often and only for large molecules and low O/C ratios. The positive slopes of produced components showed a positive relationship to bacterial production for small and for oxygen-rich components. The negative slopes of degraded components were negatively related to bacterial production for large and for oxygen-deficient molecules.

The pioneer colonizer and commensal bacterium of the human gastrointestinal tract, Streptococcus salivarius, has strong adhesive properties but the molecular determinants of this adhesion remain uncharacterized. Serine-rich repeat (SRR) glycoproteins are a family of adhesins that fulfil an important role in adhesion. In general, Gram-positive bacterial genomes have a unique SRR glycoprotein-encoding gene. We demonstrate that S. salivarius expresses three large and glycosylated surface-exposed proteins - SrpA, SrpB and SrpC - that show characteristics of SRR glycoproteins and are secreted through the accessory SecA2/Y2 system. Two glycosyltransferases - GtfE/F - encoded outside of the secA2/Y2 locus, unusually, perform the first step of the sequential glycosylation process, which is crucial for SRR activity.

Hence, fundamental research of bacterial adhesion mechanisms is of utmost importance. So far, less is known about the size of the contact area between bacterial cells and a surface. This gap will be filled by this study using a single-cell force spectroscopy-based method to investigate the contact area between a single bacterial cell of Staphylococcus aureus and a solid substrate. The technique relies on the strong influence of the hydrophobic interaction on bacterial adhesion: by incrementally crossing a very sharp hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface while performing force-distance curves with a single bacterial probe, the bacterial contact area can be determined. Assuming circular contact areas, their radii - determined in our experiments - are in the range from tens of nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. The contact area can be slightly enlarged by a larger load force, yet does not resemble a Hertzian contact, rather, the enlargement is a property of the individual bacterial cell. Additionally, Staphylococcus carnosus has been probed, which is less adherent than S. aureus, yet both bacteria exhibit a similar contact area size. This corroborates the notion that the adhesive strength of bacteria is not a matter of contact area, but rather a matter of which and how many molecules of the bacterial species' cell wall form the contact. Moreover, our method of determining the contact area can be applied to other microorganisms and the results might also be useful for studies using nanoparticles covered with soft, macromolecular coatings.","authors":[{"name":"Christian Spengler"},{"name":"Nicolas Thewes"},{"name":"Philipp Jung"},{"name":"Markus Bischoff"},{"name":"Karin Jacobs"}],"keywords":[]},"article180":{"pmid":"28695213","title":"Extracellular polymeric substances are transient media for microbial extracellular electron transfer.","date":"2019-07-01","abs":"Microorganisms exploit extracellular electron transfer (EET) in growth and information exchange with external environments or with other cells.

It catabolizes specific carbon sources, such as D-glucose, to pyruvate via the modified Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. This pathway has two parallel branches, the semi-phosphorylative and the non-phosphorylative. However, the strategy of S.solfataricus to endure in such an extreme environment in terms of robustness and adaptation is not yet completely understood. Here, we present the first dynamic mathematical model of the ED pathway parameterized with quantitative experimental data. These data consist of enzyme activities of the branched pathway at 70°C and 80°C and of metabolomics data at the same temperatures for the wild type and for a metabolic engineered knockout of the semi-phosphorylative branch. We use the validated model to address two questions: 1. Is this system more robust to perturbations at its optimal growth temperature? 2. Is the ED robust to deletion and perturbations? We employed a systems biology approach to answer these questions and to gain further knowledge on the emergent properties of this biological system. Specifically, we applied deterministic and stochastic approaches to study the sensitivity and robustness of the system, respectively. The mathematical model we present here, shows that: 1. Steady state metabolite concentrations of the ED pathway are consistently more robust to stochastic internal perturbations at 80°C than at 70°C; 2. These metabolite concentrations are highly robust when faced with the knockout of either branch. Connected with this observation, these two branches show different properties at the level of metabolite production and flux control. These new results reveal how enzyme kinetics and metabolomics synergizes with mathematical modelling to unveil new systemic properties of the ED pathway in S.solfataricus in terms of its adaptation and robustness.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Sofia Figueiredo"},{"name":"Theresa Kouril"},{"name":"Dominik Esser"},{"name":"Patrick Haferkamp"},{"name":"Patricia Wieloch"},{"name":"Dietmar Schomburg"},{"name":"Peter Ruoff"},{"name":"Bettina Siebers"},{"name":"Jörg Schaber"}],"keywords":[]},"article191":{"pmid":"28691662","title":"Role of the inner-membrane histidine kinase RcsC and outer-membrane lipoprotein RcsF in the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay signal transduction system in Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-11-05","abs":"The Rcs phosphorelay signal transduction system of Escherichia coli controls genes for capsule production and many other envelope-related functions and is implicated in biofilm formation.

Mislocalization of RcsF to the periplasm or the cytoplasmic membrane leads to high activation of the Rcs system, suggesting that RcsF functions by interacting with the cytoplasmic membrane component(s) of the system in activating the system. This is consistent with the result reported by Cho et al.

In this study we show that RcsF also interacts with the periplasmic domain of the innermembrane-localized histidine kinase RcsC (RcsCperi). RcsCperi, which was secreted to the periplasm by fusion to maltose-binding protein, titrated RcsF's activating effect.

Toxins inhibit a cellular process, while the interaction of the antitoxin with the toxin attenuates the toxin's activity. Endoribonuclease-encoding TAs cleave RNA in a sequence-dependent fashion, resulting in translational inhibition. To account for their prevalence and retention by bacterial genomes, TAs are credited with clinically significant phenomena, such as bacterial programmed cell death, persistence, biofilms and anti-addiction to plasmids. However, the programmed cell death and persistence hypotheses have been challenged because of conceptual, methodological and/or strain issues. In an alternative view, chromosomal TAs seem to be retained by virtue of addiction at two levels: via a poison-antidote combination (TA proteins) and via transcriptional reprogramming of the downstream core gene (due to integration). Any perturbation in the chromosomal TA operons could cause fitness loss due to polar effects on the downstream genes and hence be detrimental under natural conditions. The endoribonucleases encoding chromosomal TAs are most likely selfish DNA as they are retained by bacterial genomes, even though TAs do not confer a direct advantage via the TA proteins. TAs are likely used by various replicons as 'genetic arms' that allow the maintenance of themselves and associated genetic elements. TAs seem to be the 'selfish arms' that make the best use of the 'arms race' between bacterial genomes and plasmids.","authors":[{"name":"Bhaskar Chandra Mohan Ramisetty"},{"name":"Ramachandran Sarojini Santhosh"}],"keywords":[]},"article193":{"pmid":"28691316","title":"Efficacy of an unwaxed dental floss impregnated with 2% chlorhexidine on control of supragingival biofilm: A randomized, clinical trial.","date":"2018-09-17","abs":"In the present study, we evaluated the antiplaque and antigingivitis efficacy of a dental floss impregnated with 2% chlorhexidine digluconate.","authors":[{"name":"Francisco Wilker Mustafa Gomes Muniz"},{"name":"Heitor da Silva Lima"},{"name":"Cassiano Kuchenbecker Rösing"},{"name":"Ricardo Souza Martins"},{"name":"Maria Mônica Studart Mendes Moreira"},{"name":"Rosimary de Sousa Carvalho"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chlorhexidine"},{"word":"dental floss"},{"word":"gingivitis"},{"word":"oral hygiene"}]},"article194":{"pmid":"28691240","title":"Superdurable Coating Fabricated from a Double-Sided Tape with Long Term Zero Bacterial Adhesion.","date":"2019-01-22","abs":"There is no coating technology currently available to prevent the notorious biofilm formation issue.

Controlling biomass exposure to growth substrate represents an appealing option for process optimization, as substrate availability likely impacts microbial activity, hence organic trace chemical removal. This study investigated the elimination of pharmaceuticals in pre-denitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs), where biofilm exposure to different organic substrate loading and composition was controlled by reactor staging. A three-stage MBBR and a single-stage reference MBBR (with the same operating volume and filling ratio) were operated under continuous-flow conditions (18 months). Two sets of batch experiments (day 100 and 471) were performed to quantify and compare pharmaceutical removal and denitrification kinetics in the different MBBRs. Experimental results revealed the possible influence of retransformation (e.g., from conjugated metabolites) and enantioselectivity on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals. In the second set of experiments, specific trends in denitrification and biotransformation kinetics were observed, with highest and lowest rates/rate constants in the first (S1) and the last (S3) staged sub-reactors, respectively. These observations were confirmed by removal efficiency data obtained during continuous-flow operation, with limited removal (<10%) of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals and highest removal in S1 within the three-stage MBBR. Notably, biotransformation rate constants obtained for non-recalcitrant pharmaceuticals correlated with mean specific denitrification rates, maximum specific growth rates and observed growth yield values. Overall, these findings suggest that: (i) the long-term exposure to tiered substrate accessibility in the three-stage configuration shaped the denitrification and biotransformation capacity of biofilms, with significant reduction under substrate limitation; (ii) biotransformation of pharmaceuticals may have occurred as a result of cometabolism by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Fabio Polesel"},{"name":"Elena Torresi"},{"name":"Luca Loreggian"},{"name":"Mònica Escolà Casas"},{"name":"Magnus Christensson"},{"name":"Kai Bester"},{"name":"Benedek Gy Plósz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cometabolism"},{"word":"Heterotrophic denitrification"},{"word":"Micropollutant biotransformation"},{"word":"Moving bed biofilm reactors"},{"word":"Reactor staging"}]},"article209":{"pmid":"28688575","title":"Natural-Product Antibiotics: Cues for Modulating Bacterial Biofilm Formation.","date":"2018-12-01","abs":"Cell-cell communication enables bacteria to coordinate their behavior through the production, recognition, and response to chemical signals produced by their microbial neighbors.

This study aimed to conduct such assessment using sewer reactors mimicking conditions of rising main, gravity sewer, and wastewater alone, over a 12-hour period. The results show that cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine are relatively stable under all sewer conditions while ethyl sulfate was only stable in wastewater alone and gradually degraded in rising main and gravity sewer conditions. Ethyl glucuronide quickly degraded in all reactors. These findings suggest that cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine are good biomarkers to estimate tobacco consumption; ethyl sulfate may be used as a biomarker to estimate alcohol consumption, but its in-sewer loss should be accounted for in the calculation of consumption estimates.

Unlike the coccoid wild type, the rgpG mutant existed primarily in chains of swollen, squarish dividing cells. Deficiency of rgpG also causes significant reduction in biofilm formation (P < 0.01). Double and triple mutants with deficiency in brpA and/or psr, genes coding for the LytR-CpsA-Psr family proteins BrpA and Psr, which were previously shown to play important roles in cell envelope biogenesis, were constructed using the rgpG mutant. There were no major differences in growth rates between the wild-type strain and the rgpG brpA and rgpG psr double mutants, but the growth rate of the rgpG brpA psr triple mutant was reduced drastically (P < 0.001). Under transmission electron microscopy, both double mutants resembled the rgpG mutant, while the triple mutant existed as giant cells with multiple asymmetric septa. When analyzed by immunoblotting, the rgpG mutant displayed major reductions in cell wall antigens compared to the wild type, while little or no signal was detected with the double and triple mutants and the brpA and psr single mutants.

In literature, terms such as microbial corrosion, biocorrosion, microbially influenced/induced corrosion, and biodegradation are often applied. MIC research in the oil and gas industry has seen a revolution over the past decade, with the introduction of molecular microbiological methods: (MMM) as well as new industry standards and procedures of sampling biofilm and corrosion products from the process system. This review aims to capture the most important trends the oil and gas industry has seen regarding MIC research over the past decade. The paper starts out with an overview of where in the process stream MIC occurs - from the oil reservoir to the consumer. Both biotic and abiotic corrosion mechanisms are explained in the context of managing MIC using a structured corrosion management (CM) approach. The corrosion management approach employs the elements of a management system to ensure that essential corrosion control activities are carried out in an effective, sustainable, well-planned and properly executed manner. The 3-phase corrosion management approach covering of both biotic and abiotic internal corrosion mechanisms consists of 1) corrosion assessment, 2) corrosion mitigation and 3) corrosion monitoring. Each of the three phases are described in detail with links to recent field cases, methods, industry standards and sampling protocols. In order to manage the corrosion threat, operators commonly use models to support decision making. The models use qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative measures to help assess the rate of degradation caused by MIC. The paper reviews four existing models for MIC Threat Assessment and describe a new model that links the threat of MIC in the oil processing system located on an offshore platform with a Risk Based Inspection (RBI) approach. A recent field case highlights and explains the conflicting historic results obtained through serial dilution of culture media using the most probable number (MPN) method as compared to data obtained from corrosion monitoring and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. Results from qPCR application in the field case have changed the way MIC is monitored on the oil production facility in the North Sea. A number of high quality resources have been published as technical conference papers, books, educational videos and peer-reviewed scientific papers, and thus we end the review with an updated list of state-of-the-art resources for anyone desiring to become more familiar with the topic of MIC in the upstream oil and gas sector.","authors":[{"name":"Torben Lund Skovhus"},{"name":"Richard B Eckert"},{"name":"Edgar Rodrigues"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocorrosion"},{"word":"Corrosion management"},{"word":"Field case"},{"word":"MIC Modeling"},{"word":"North Sea"},{"word":"Oil and gas industry"}]},"article214":{"pmid":"28687321","title":"In vitro antibiofilm efficacy of Piper betle against quorum sensing mediated biofilm formation of luminescent Vibrio harveyi.","date":"2018-04-25","abs":"Vibrio harveyi is a potent biofilm former, which confers resistance to multiple antimicrobials, disinfectants, chemicals and biocides.

Based on qPCR data, bacteria were the dominant taxa of the biofilm (92.9-98.4%) relative to fungi (1.5-6.9%) and archaea (0.03-0.07%). NMDS analysis indicated that during the initial stages of operation, the biofilm communities were indistinguishable from those found in the sludge. However, the biofilm community significantly diverged from the sludge over time and ultimately showed a unique biofilm profile. This suggested that there was strong selection for a group of organisms that were biofilm specialists. This pattern of succession and selection was correlated with the rapid increase in TMP, where bacteria including Rhodospirillales, Sphingomonadales and Rhizobiales dominated the biofilm at this time.

The genes that are responsible for degrading PAHs have been identified in P. aeruginosa, however, no gene acts alone as various stresses often initiate different metabolic pathways, quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antibiotic tolerance, etc. Therefore, it is important to study how PAH degradation genes behave under different conditions. In this study, we apply network analysis to investigating how 46 PAH degradation genes reorganized among 5549 genes in P. aeruginosa PAO1 under nine different conditions using publicly available gene coexpression data from GEO.

Biofilms are dense communities of microorganisms in which cells associate with surfaces and each other using a self-produced extracellular matrix composed of proteins, polysaccharides, and genetic material. Proteins in the extracellular matrix take on a variety of forms, but here we focus on functional amyloid structures. Amyloids have long been associated with protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases, but recent research has demonstrated that numerous bacterial species utilize the amyloid fold to fortify the biofilm matrix and resist disassembly. Consequently, these functional amyloids, in particular the soluble oligomeric intermediates formed during amyloidogenesis, represent targets to destabilize the extracellular matrix and interrupt biofilm formation. Our previous studies suggested that these amyloidogenic intermediates adopt a non-standard structure, termed α-sheet, as they aggregate into soluble oligomeric species. This led to the design of complementary α-sheet peptides as anti-α-sheet inhibitors; these designs inhibit amyloidogenesis in three unrelated mammalian disease-associated systems through preferential binding of soluble oligomers. Here we show that these anti-α-sheet peptides inhibit amyloid formation in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, they inhibit aggregation of pure, synthetic phenol soluble modulin α1, a major component of Staphylococcus aureus functional amyloids. As it aggregates phenol soluble modulin α1 adopts α-helix then α-sheet and finally forms β-sheet fibrils. The binding of the designed peptide inhibitors coincides with the formation of α-sheet.","authors":[{"name":"Alissa Bleem"},{"name":"Robyn Francisco"},{"name":"James D Bryers"},{"name":"Valerie Daggett"}],"keywords":[]},"article231":{"pmid":"28685097","title":"Restructuring of Enterococcus faecalis biofilm architecture in response to antibiotic-induced stress.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Bacterial biofilms are intrinsically resistant to antimicrobial treatment, which contributes to microbial persistence in clinical infections. Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen that readily forms biofilms and is the most prevalent enterococcal species identified in healthcare-associated infections. Since intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics is common for enterococci, and antibiotic resistance is elevated in biofilm populations, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms involved. Previously, we identified two glycosyltransferase genes whose disruption resulted in impaired nascent biofilm formation in the presence of antibiotic concentrations subinhibitory for parent growth and biofilm formation. The glycosyltransferases are involved in synthesis of the cell-wall-associated rhamnopolysaccharide Epa. Here we examined the effect of epa mutations on the temporal development of E. faecalis biofilms, and on the effects of antibiotics on pre-formed biofilms using scanning electron microscopy. We show that ΔepaOX mutant cells arrange into complex multidimensional biofilms independent of antibiotic exposure, while parent cells form biofilms that are monolayers in the absence of antibiotics. Remarkably, upon exposure to antibiotics parent biofilm cells restructure into complex three-dimensional biofilms resembling those of the ΔepaOX mutant without antibiotics. All biofilms exhibiting complex cellular architectures were less structurally stable than monolayer biofilms, with the biofilm cells exhibiting increased detachment. Our results indicate that E. faecalis biofilms restructure in response to cellular stress whether induced by antibiotics in the case of parent cells, or by deficiencies in Epa composition for the ΔepaOX strain. The data demonstrate a link between cellular architecture and antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Jennifer L Dale"},{"name":"Jennifer L Nilson"},{"name":"Aaron M T Barnes"},{"name":"Gary M Dunny"}],"keywords":[]},"article232":{"pmid":"28684959","title":"Association between Virulence Factors and Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae Compared to Nonproducing Isolates.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Klebsiella pneumoniae is considered an important opportunistic multidrug-resistant pathogen.

Antibiotic sensitivity test of all isolates was determined by disc diffusion assay. Phenotypic and genotypic detection of ESBL were done. Various virulence factors and some virulence factor-associated genes were screened. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was employed to investigate the genetic fingerprints of ESBL from non-ESBL producing K. pneumoniae. Results. 50% of isolates were ESBL producers. A significant association was observed between ESBL production and biofilm (strong and moderate), serum resistance, and iss gene. Moreover, significant association between non-ESBL producers and hypermucoviscosity was identified.

In a screen of mutants from random transposon mutagenesis, an insertional mutation in the eptC gene (cj0256) resulted in a significant decrease in C. jejuni NCTC11168 biofilm formation (<20%) on major food contact surfaces, such as polystyrene and borosilicate glass, when compared with wild-type cells (p < 0.05). In C. jejuni strain 81-176, the protein encoded by eptC modified cell surface structures, such as lipid A, the inner core of lipooligosaccharide, and the flagellar rod protein (FlgG), by attaching phosphoethanolamine. To assess the role of eptC in C. jejuni NCTC11168, adherence and motility tests were performed. In adhesion assays with glass surfaces, the eptC mutant exhibited a 0.77 log CFU/cm² decrease in adherence compared with wild-type cells during the initial 2 h of the assay (p < 0.05). These results support the hypothesis that the modification of cell surface structures by eptC affects the initial adherence in biofilm formation of C. jejuni NCTC11168. In motility tests, the eptC mutant demonstrated reduced motility when compared with wild-type cells, but wild-type cells with the transposon inserted in a gene irrelevant to biofilm formation (cj1111c) also exhibited decreased motility to a similar extent as the eptC mutant. This suggests that although eptC affects motility, it does not significantly affect biofilm formation. This study demonstrates that eptC is essential for initial adherence, and plays a significant role in the biofilm formation of C. jejuni NCTC11168.","authors":[{"name":"Eun Seob Lim"},{"name":"Joo-Sung Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Campylobacter jejuni"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"eptC"}]},"article242":{"pmid":"28683409","title":"Thymus vulgaris L. extract has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects in the absence of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity.","date":"2018-06-27","abs":"This study evaluated the biological effects of the T. vulgaris L. extract., such as antimicrobial activity on planktonic cultures and mono- and polymicrobial biofilms, cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory activity and genotoxicity.","authors":[{"name":"Jonatas Rafael de Oliveira"},{"name":"Daiane de Jesus Viegas"},{"name":"Ana Paula Réquia Martins"},{"name":"Cláudio Antonio Talge Carvalho"},{"name":"Cristina Pacheco Soares"},{"name":"Samira Esteves Afonso Camargo"},{"name":"Antonio Olavo Cardoso Jorge"},{"name":"Luciane Dias de Oliveira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-inflammatory activity"},{"word":"Antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Cytotoxicity"},{"word":"Genotoxicity"},{"word":"Thymus vulgaris l"}]},"article243":{"pmid":"28683004","title":"Evaluation of Compatibility of a Gum Mastic Liquid Adhesive and Liquid Adhesive Remover With an Alcoholic Chlorhexidine Gluconate Skin Preparation.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"The compatibility of a 2% chlorhexidine gluconate/70% isopropyl alcohol (CHG/IPA) skin preparation with a gum mastic liquid adhesive (GMLA) and liquid adhesive remover (LAR) was assessed in healthy volunteers.

Hydrogen peroxide modulates biofilm development attributed to its growth inhibitory nature. Hydrogen peroxide production is closely associated with extracellular DNA(eDNA) release from microbe and the development of its competent cell which are critical for biofilm development and also serves as source for horizontal gene transfer. Microbe also can reduce the damage to themselves through several detoxification mechanisms. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide is also involved in the regulation of interactions between oral microorganisms and host.

The major threat of chronic wound bio lms is their substantial protection from host immunities and extreme tolerance to antimicrobial agents. To help guide the development of wound treatment strategies, a panel of experts experienced in clinical and laboratory aspects of biofilm convened to discuss what is understood and not yet understood about biofilms and what is needed to better identify and treat chronic wounds in which biofilm is suspected. This article reviews evidence of the problem of biofilms in chronic wounds, summarizes literature-based and experience-based recommendations from the panel meeting, and identities future and emerging technologies needed to address the current gaps in knowledge. While currently there is insufficient evidence to provide an accurate comparison of the effectiveness of current therapies/products in reducing or removing biofilm, research has shown that in addition to debridement, appropriate topical antimicrobial application can suppress biofilm reformation. Because the majority of the resistance of bacteria in a biofilm population is expressed by its own secreted matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), panel members stressed the need for a paradigm shift toward biofilm treatment strategies that disrupt this shield. High-osmolarity surfactant solution technology is emerging as a potential multimodal treatment that has shown promise in EPS disruption and prevention of biofilm formation when used immediately post debridement. Panel members advocated incorporating an EPS-disrupting technology into an antibiofilm treatment approach for all chronic wounds. The activity of this panel is a step toward identifying technology and research needed to improve biofilm management of chronic wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Robert J Snyder"},{"name":"Greg Bohn"},{"name":"Jason Hanft"},{"name":"Larry Harkless"},{"name":"Paul Kim"},{"name":"Larry Lavery"},{"name":"Greg Schultz"},{"name":"Randy Wolcott"}],"keywords":[]},"article248":{"pmid":"28681658","title":"Analysis of culturable and non-culturable bacteria and their potential to form biofilms in a primary treated dairy wastewater system.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Biofilm formation in a dairy waste irrigation system can reduce treatment capacity and increase maintenance and cleaning.

On the contrary, the lower part (excavated in 2005) was almost completely covered by extensive biological patinas.

In these patients, increased levels of IL-17 as well as of IL-5 and IL-13 along with arginase (Arg)-positive macrophages have been observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. While IL-17 is a strong proinflammatory cytokine associated with host defense against bacterial and fungal infections and is also elevated in several autoimmune diseases, IL-5/IL-13 and Arg1-positive M2 macrophages are part of the anti-inflammatory type 2 (Th2) immunity. To study whether increased IL-5 and IL-13 levels are related to biofilm formation, which is frequently observed in CF patients colonized by P. aeruginosa, we utilized an agarose bead-embedded P. aeruginosa rat model commonly employed in in vivo biofilm studies. We showed that sterile agarose bead instillation in rat notably increased lung transcript levels of IL-5 and IL-13 at two post-instillation study-points, day 1 and day 3. Concurrently, increased infiltration of type 2 innate cells such as eosinophils and Arg1 positive M2 activated macrophages (Arg1+CD68+) was also observed both at day 1 and day 3 while the proportion of M1 activated macrophages (iNOS+CD68+) at these time-points decreased. In contrast, P. aeruginosa-loaded beads caused a drastic elevation of proinflammatory Th1 (IFNγ, TNFα, IL-12a) and antibacterial Th17 (IL-17a, IL-17f, IL-22, IL-23a) cytokines along with a high influx of neutrophils and M1 macrophages, while Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) drastically declined at day 1 post-infection. Interestingly, at day 3 post-infection, both Th1 and Th17 cytokines sharply declined and corroborated with decreased M1 and increased M2 macrophages.

However, in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, a nosocomial pathogen that frequently infects immunodeficient or immunoincompetent patients, the regulatory function of c-di-GMP remains unclear. Here we show that BsmR is a negative regulator of biofilm development that degrades c-di-GMP through its EAL domain. Increasing BsmR expression resulted in significant increase in bacterial swimming and decrease in cell aggregation. BsmR regulates the expression of at least 349 genes. Among them, 34 involved in flagellar assembly and a flagellar-assembly-related transcription factor (fsnR) are positively regulated. Although BsmR is a response regulator of the two-component signaling system, its role in biofilm formation depends on the expression level of its respective gene (bsmR), not on the protein's phosphorylation level. A transcription factor, BsmT, whose coding gene is located in the same tetra-cistronic operon as bsmR, was shown to directly bind to the promoter region of the operon and, through a positive regulatory loop, modulate bsmR transcription.

Because nonkin are the target of the system, B. subtilis can potentially distinguish degrees of nonkin relatedness, not just kin versus nonkin. We examined this by testing a large strain collection of diverse Bacillus species against B. subtilis in different multicellular contexts. The effects of kin discrimination extend to nearby species, as the other subtilis clade species were treated with the same antagonism as nonkin. Species in the less-related pumilus clade started to display varied phenotypes but were mostly still discriminated against, while cereus clade members and beyond were no longer subject to kin discrimination. Seeking a reason why other species are perceived as antagonistic nonkin, we tested the ability of B. subtilis to steal communally produced surfactant from these species. We found that the species treated as nonkin were the only ones that made a surfactant that B. subtilis could utilize and that nonkin antagonism prevented such stealing when the two strains were mixed.

Analysis carried out using the new tool, BIAM, indicates that CDA affects the fluorescence intensity of the biofilm structures as well as biofilm architectures.

This study aimed to analyze the clinical and pathological features of POF and to investigate the immunoexpression of Osterix and STRO-1 proteins. Data such as age, gender, and size were obtained from 30 cases of POF. Microscopic features were assessed by conventional light microscopy using hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical markers, and by polarized light microscopy using Picrosirius red staining. The age range was 11-70 years and 70% of the patients were female. Moreover, the size of POF varied from 0.2 to 5.0 cm; in 43.33% of the cases, the mineralized content consisted exclusively of bony trabeculae. The immunohistochemical analysis showed nuclear staining for Osterix in 63% and for STRO-1 in 20% of the cases. Mature collagen fibers were observed in mineralized tissue in 76.67% of the cases. The clinical and microscopic features observed were in agreement with those described in the literature. Osterix was overexpressed, while STRO-1 was poorly expressed. Osterix was expressed particularly in cells entrapped in and around mineralized tissue, indicating the presence of a stimulus that triggers the differentiation of these cells into osteoblasts or cementoblasts, i.e., cells that produce mineralized tissue. Based on our results, Osterix may play a role in the pathogenesis of POF.","authors":[{"name":"Vivian Narana Ribeiro El Achkar"},{"name":"Raphaella da Silveira Medeiros"},{"name":"Fernanda Gargano Longue"},{"name":"Ana Lia Anbinder"},{"name":"Estela Kaminagakura"}],"keywords":[]},"article263":{"pmid":"28678952","title":"Clinical trial for evaluation of Ricinus communis and sodium hypochlorite as denture cleanser.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"This study evaluated Ricinus communis and sodium hypochlorite solutions in terms of biofilm removal ability, remission of candidiasis, antimicrobial activity, and participant satisfaction.","authors":[{"name":"Maurício Malheiros Badaró"},{"name":"Marcela Moreira Salles"},{"name":"Vanessa Maria Fagundes Leite"},{"name":"Carolina Noronha Ferraz de Arruda"},{"name":"Viviane de Cássia Oliveira"},{"name":"Cássio do Nascimento"},{"name":"Raphael Freitas de Souza"},{"name":"Helena de Freitas de Oliveira Paranhos"},{"name":"Cláudia Helena Silva-Lovato"}],"keywords":[]},"article264":{"pmid":"28678862","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells attached to a surface display a typical proteome early as 20 minutes of incubation.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Biofilms are present in all environments and often result in negative effects due to properties of the biofilm lifestyle and especially antibiotics resistance.

Thus deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in attachment could allow discovering molecular targets from it would be possible to develop inhibitors against bacterial colonization and potentiate antibiotherapy. To identify the key components and pathways that aid the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in attachment we performed for the first time a proteomic analysis as early as after 20 minutes of incubation using glass wool fibers as a surface. We compared the protein contents of the attached and unattached bacteria. Using mass spectrometry, 3043 proteins were identified. Our results showed that, as of 20 minutes of incubation, using stringent quantification criteria 616 proteins presented a modification of their abundance in the attached cells compared to their unattached counterparts. The attached cells presented an overall reduced gene expression and characteristics of slow-growing cells. The over-accumulation of outer membrane proteins, periplasmic folding proteins and O-antigen chain length regulators was also observed, indicating a profound modification of the cell envelope. Consistently the sigma factor AlgU required for cell envelope homeostasis was highly over-accumulated in attached cells. In addition our data suggested a role of alarmone (p)ppGpp and polyphosphate during the early attachment phase. Furthermore, almost 150 proteins of unknown function were differentially accumulated in the attached cells. Our proteomic analysis revealed the existence of distinctive biological features in attached cells as early as 20 minutes of incubation.

Here an additional level of cfcR control, operating post-transcriptionally via the RNA-binding proteins RsmA, RsmE and RsmI, is unraveled. Specific binding of the three proteins to an Rsm-binding motif (5'CANGGANG3') encompassing the translational start codon of cfcR was confirmed. Although RsmA exhibited the highest binding affinity to the cfcR transcript, single deletions of rsmA, rsmE or rsmI caused minor derepression in CfcR translation compared to a ΔrsmIEA triple mutant. RsmA also showed a negative impact on c-di-GMP levels in a double mutant ΔrsmIE through the control of cfcR, which is responsible for most of the free c-di-GMP during stationary phase in static conditions. In addition, a CfcR-dependent c-di-GMP boost was observed during this stage in ΔrsmIEA confirming the negative effect of Rsm proteins on CfcR translation and explaining the increased biofilm formation in this mutant compared to the wild type.

To directly investigate the genetic basis of electrode-based respiration, we constructed Geobacter sulfurreducens transposon-insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) libraries for growth, with soluble fumarate or an electrode as the electron acceptor.

Here we show that, in opposition to previous reports, the common laboratory strain ATCC 17978 produces Csu pili. We found that, although ATCC 17978 was resistant to sulfamethoxazole (Smx) and trimethoprim (Tmp), subinhibitory concentrations of these antibiotics abolished the expression of Csu and consequently produced a dramatic reduction in biofilm formation by ATCC 17978. Smx and Tmp acted synergistically to inhibit the enzymatic systems involved in the bacterial synthesis of tetrahydrofolate (THF), which is required for the synthesis of nucleotides. The effects of these antibiotics were partially relieved by exogenous THF addition, indicating that Smx and Tmp turn off Csu assembly by inducing folate stress. We propose that, for Acinetobacter, nanomolar concentrations of Smx and Tmp represent a danger signal. In response to this signal, Csu expression is repressed, allowing biofilm dispersal and escape from potentially inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics.

However, the role of AtlA in bacterial biofilm formation is unclear. In this study, confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis showed that extracellular DNA (eDNA) was embedded in S. mutans GS5 floes during biofilm formation on damaged heart valves, but an ΔatlA strain could not form bacterial aggregates. Semiquantification of eDNA by PCR with bacterial 16S rRNA primers demonstrated that the ΔatlA mutant strain produced dramatically less eDNA than the wild type. Similar results were observed with in vitro biofilm models. The addition of polyanethol sulfonate, a chemical lysis inhibitor, revealed that eDNA release mediated by bacterial cell lysis is required for biofilm initiation and maturation in the wild-type strain. Supplementation of cultures with calcium ions reduced wild-type growth but increased eDNA release and biofilm mass. The effect of calcium ions on biofilm formation was abolished in ΔatlA cultures and by the addition of polyanethol sulfonate. The VicK sensor, but not CiaH, was found to be required for the induction of eDNA release or the stimulation of biofilm formation by calcium ions.

Biofilms are communities of microbes embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances. Eradicating biofilms with the use of antibiotics or biocides is often ineffective and needs replacement with other potential agents. Compared to conventional agents, promising and potential alternatives are biofilm-inhibiting compounds without impairing growth. Here, we screened a S. suis adhesion inhibitor, rutin, derived from Syringa. Rutin, a kind of flavonoids, shows efficient biofilm inhibition of S. suis without impairing its growth. Capsular polysaccharides(CPS) are reported to be involved in its adherence to influence bacterial biofilm formation. We investigated the effect of rutin on S. suis CPS content and structure. The results showed that rutin was beneficial to improve the CPS content of S. suis without changing its structure. We further provided evidence that rutin specifically affected S. suis biofilm susceptibility by affecting CPS biosynthesis in vitro. The study explores the antibiofilm potential of rutin against S. suis which can be used as an adhesion inhibitor for the prevention of S. suis biofilm-related infections. Nevertheless, rutin could be used as a novel natural inhibitor of biolfilm and its molecular mechanism provide basis for its pharmacological and clinical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Shuai Wang"},{"name":"Chang Wang"},{"name":"Lingfei Gao"},{"name":"Hua Cai"},{"name":"Yonghui Zhou"},{"name":"Yanbei Yang"},{"name":"Changgeng Xu"},{"name":"Wenya Ding"},{"name":"Jianqing Chen"},{"name":"Ishfaq Muhammad"},{"name":"Xueying Chen"},{"name":"Xinmiao He"},{"name":"Di Liu"},{"name":"Yanhua Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CPS"},{"word":"Streptococcus suis"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"rutin"}]},"article306":{"pmid":"28669832","title":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy augments tobramycin efficacy in experimental Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.","date":"2018-05-08","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious disease with an in-hospital mortality of up to 40%.

Inoculation with cyanobacterial formulations led to significant interactions with different cultivars, in terms of fresh weight and number of nodules, the concentration of nodular leghemoglobin, and the number of pods. The inoculant A. laxa alone was superior in its performance, recording 30-50% higher values than uninoculated control, and led to significantly higher nodule number per plant and fresh root weight, relative to the M. ciceri alone. Highest nodule numbers were recorded in the kabuli cultivars BG256 and BG1003. The kabuli cultivar BG1108 treated with the biofilmed Anabaena-M. ciceri inoculant recorded the highest concentration of leghemoglobin in nodules. These inoculants also stimulated the elicitation of defense- and pathogenesis-related enzymes in both the desi and kabuli cultivars, by two to threefolds. The analyses of Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles revealed that microbial communities in nodules were highly diverse, with about 23 archaeal, 9 bacterial, and 13 cyanobacterial predominant phylotypes observed in both desi and kabuli cultivars, and influenced by the inoculants.

All bacteria encode for mechanisms to incorporate exogenous fatty acids, and some bacteria can use exogenous fatty acids to bypass FASII inhibition. Bacteria encode three different mechanisms for activating exogenous fatty acids for incorporation into phospholipid synthesis. Exogenous fatty acids are converted into acyl-CoA in Gammaproteobacteria such as E. coli. Acyl-CoA molecules constitute a separate pool from endogenously synthesized acyl-ACP. Acyl-CoA can be used for phospholipid synthesis or broken down by β-oxidation, but cannot be used for lipopolysaccharide synthesis. Exogenous fatty acids are converted into acyl-ACP in some Gram-negative bacteria. The resulting acyl-ACP undergoes the same fates as endogenously synthesized acyl-ACP. Exogenous fatty acids are converted into acyl-phosphates in Gram-positive bacteria, and can be used for phospholipid synthesis or become acyl-ACP. Only the order Lactobacillales can use exogenous fatty acids to bypass FASII inhibition. FASII shuts down completely in presence of exogenous fatty acids in Lactobacillales, allowing Lactobacillales to synthesize phospholipids entirely from exogenous fatty acids. Inhibition of FASII cannot be bypassed in other bacteria because FASII is only partially down-regulated in presence of exogenous fatty acid or FASII is required to synthesize essential metabolites such as β-hydroxyacyl-ACP. Certain selective pressures such as FASII inhibition or growth in biofilms can select for naturally occurring one step mutations that attenuate endogenous fatty acid synthesis. Although attempts have been made to estimate the natural prevalence of these mutants, culture-independent metagenomic methods would provide a better estimate.","authors":[{"name":"Jiangwei Yao"},{"name":"Charles O Rock"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acyl carrier protein"},{"word":"Antibiotics"},{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Fatty acid synthesis"},{"word":"Metabolism"},{"word":"Pathogens"}]},"article314":{"pmid":"28668171","title":"Emerging nanotechnology based strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics of urinary tract infections: A review.","date":"2018-08-30","abs":"At present, various diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are available for urinary tract infections.

The substitution pattern at the C-4 position and the aryl carboxamide ring at the N-1 position have major effects on the biofilm inhibitory and antiproliferative activity. Especially, the introduction of a p-methyl group at the carboxamide ring remarkably enhances both the anti-biofilm and antiproliferative activity.

The most frequent scenario that led to foodborne outbreaks was the post-thermal treatment cross-contamination of deli meat products during slicing and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The precondition for such cross contamination is the previous introduction of Listeria into meat processing facilities and subsequent colonization of the production environment, associated with formation of biofilms resilient to common sanitation procedures regularly applied in meat establishments. The use of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) can facilitate the understanding of contamination and colonization routes of pathogens within the food production environment and enable efficient pathogen tracking among different departments. This study aimed to: a) provide a proof of concept on practical use of WGS in a meat establishment to define the entry routes and spread pattern of L. monocytogenes, and b) to consider the regular use of WGS in meat processing establishments as a strong support of food safety management system. The results revealed that Listeria spp. was present in slaughter line, chilling chambers, deboning, slicing, MAP, as well as in corridors and dispatch (53 positive samples, out of 240). Eight L. monocytogenes isolates (out of 53) were identified from the slaughterhouse, chilling chambers, deboning, MAP and dispatch. L. monocytogenes isolates were of three different serotypes (1/2a, 1/2c, 4b) and correspondingly of three MLST sequence types. Overall, two pairs of L. monocytogenes isolates were genetically identical, i.e. two serotype 4b isolates (ST1), isolated from water drain at dispatch unit and two isolates obtained from slaughterhouse (floorwall junction at the carcass wash point) and MAP (water drain). These findings indicated that L. monocytogenes isolates identified in meat processing units (MAP, chilling chamber and dispatch) originated from the slaughter line. Further, all eight L. monocytogenes isolates were confirmed to be biofilm producers on glass and stainless steel surfaces. The identification of the main entry routes of L. monocytogenes into meat establishments and tracking the routes for spread of the pathogen are of essential importance to define appropriate risk mitigation strategies for L. monocytogenes in meat production environment. The routine use of WGS for bacterial characterization, as a strong support of food safety management system in meat establishments, will require the cost-effective approach.

This study presents a new way to achieve mainstream anammox, which couples anammox with denitratation (nitrate reduction to nitrite) instead of nitritation (ammonium oxidation to nitrite). An anoxic/oxic (A/O) biofilm system treating systhetic domestic wastewater was used to demonstrate this concept for over 400 days. This A/O biofilm system achieved a total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of 80 ± 4% from the influent with a low C/N ratio of 2.6 and a TN concentration of 60.5 mg/L. Nitrogen removal via anammox was found to account for 70% of dinitrogen production in the anoxic reactor. Batch tests confirmed that the anoxic biofilm could oxidize ammonium using nitrite as electron acceptor, and that it had a higher nitrate reduction rate than the nitrite reduction rate, thus producing nitrite for the anammox reaction. Metagenomic analysis showed that Candidatus Jettenia caeni and Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis were the top two dominant species in anoxic biofilm. Genes involved in the metabolism of the anammox process were detected in anoxic biofilm. The abundance of nitrate reductase (73360 hits) was much higher than nitrite reductase (13114 hits) in anoxic biofilm. This system can be easily integrated with the high-rate activated sludge technology, which produces an effluent with a low C/N ratio. While this new design consumes 21% more oxygen in comparison to the currently studied nitritation/anammox process, the nitrite-producing process appears to be more stable.","authors":[{"name":"Bin Ma"},{"name":"Wenting Qian"},{"name":"Chuansheng Yuan"},{"name":"Zhiguo Yuan"},{"name":"Yongzhen Peng"}],"keywords":[]},"article343":{"pmid":"28659908","title":"Pterostilbene, a Methoxylated Resveratrol Derivative, Efficiently Eradicates Planktonic, Biofilm, and Intracellular MRSA by Topical Application.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Pterostilbene is a methoxylated derivative of resveratrol originated from natural sources.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay demonstrated a superior biocidal activity of pterostilbene compared to resveratrol (8~16-fold) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and clinically isolated vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). Pterostilbene was found to reduce MRSA biofilm thickness from 18 to 10 μm as detected by confocal microscopy. Pterostilbene showed minimal toxicity to THP-1 cells and was readily engulfed by the macrophages, facilitating the eradication of intracellular MRSA. Pterostilbene exhibited increased skin absorption over resveratrol by 6-fold. Topical pterostilbene application improved the abscess formation produced by MRSA by reducing the bacterial burden and ameliorating the skin architecture. The potent anti-MRSA capability of pterostilbene was related to bacterial membrane leakage, chaperone protein downregulation, and ribosomal protein upregulation. This mechanism of action was different from that of resveratrol according to proteomic analysis and molecular docking.

Treatment of Xoo with 500 ppm THY oil displayed a significant diminution in swimming, swarming, exopolysaccharide and xanthomonadin secretion. However, no effect was observed on bacterial growth kinetics and metabolic activity of the cells. Results were further authenticated by RT-qPCR as significant reduction in motA, motB, and flgE genes was observed upon THY oil treatment. Similarly, the expression of some extracellular enzyme genes such as endoglucanase, xylanase, cellobiosidase, and polygalacturonase was also found to be significantly reduced. However, biochemical plate assays revealed insignificant effect of 500 ppm THY oil on secretion of protease, cellulase, and lipase enzymes. The rpfF gene known to play a crucial role in the virulence of the phytopathogenic bacteria was also significantly reduced in the THY oil treated Xoo cells. HPTLC analysis further revealed significant reduction in DSF and BDSF signaling molecules when Xoo cells were treated with 500 ppm THY oil. Disease reduction was observed in in vitro agar plate assay as lesion length was reduced in THY oil treated Xoo cells when compared with the alone treatment. GC-MS result revealed thymol as the active and major component of THY oil which showed potential binding with rpfF gene.

Mac Callum and Hastings characterized an organism, now known to be Enterococcal faecalis, which was isolated from a lethal case of endocarditis on 1899. The report was the first detailed description of its pathogenic capabilities. Over the past few decades, multi-drug resistance enterococci have become as important health-care associated pathogen, and leading causes of drug resistance infection. The modern life style including the broad use of antibiotics in medical practice and animal husbandry have selected for the convergence of potential virulence factors to the specific enterococcus species such as E. faecium and E. faecalis. The development of modern medical care of intensive and invasive medical therapies and treatments for human disease, and existence of severe compromised patients in hospitals has contributed to the increased prevalence of these opportunistic organisms. The virulence factors converged in E. faecalis and E. faecium which have been isolated in nosocomial infections, include antibiotic resistance, extracellular proteins (toxins), extrachromosome and mobile genetic elements, cell wall components, biofilm formation, adherence factors, and colonization factor such as bacteriocin, etc. In these potential virulence factors, I presented characteristics of enterococcal conjugative plasmid, cytolysin, collagen binding protein of adhesion, bacteriocins, and drug resistances.

The periodontal pathogenic microorganisms trigger the disease process; however, the destruction of the periodontium is mostly caused by the host's immune response to the bacterial insults. The main thrust of periodontal therapy has been centered traditionally on reducing the microbial load by mechanical and antimicrobial means. This approach has been reported to be effective for the majority of patients and sites. However, modulating the host response by anti-inflammatory agents could provide another viable pathway to managing poorly responding periodontal patients. The overall objective of this paper is to review current data pertinent to curcumin and its dual anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties and to explore its potential in managing patients with periodontal diseases. Curcumin has a wide biological spectrum that could provide clinicians with an alternative anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agent for managing a variety of maladies including periodontal diseases. However, large-scale longitudinal randomized clinical trials are needed to prove efficacy and effectiveness of curcumin in managing periodontitis.

Studies that characterized the membrane biofilm communities in lab-and pilot-scale MBRs are numerous, yet similar studies in full-scale MBRs are limited. Also, most of these studies have characterized the mature biofilm communities with very few studies addressing early biofilm communities. In this study, five full-scale MBRs located in Seattle (Washington, U.S.A.) were selected to address two questions concerning membrane biofilm communities (early and mature): (i) Is the assembly of biofilm communities (early and mature) the result of random immigration of species from the source community (i.e. activated sludge)? and (ii) Is there a core membrane biofilm community in full-scale MBRs? Membrane biofilm (early and mature) and activated sludge (AS) samples were collected from the five MBRs, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was applied to investigate the bacterial communities of AS and membrane biofilms (early and mature). Alpha and beta diversity measures revealed clear differences in the bacterial community structure between the AS and biofilm (early and mature) samples in the five full-scale MBRs. These differences were mainly due to the presence of large number of unique but rare operational taxonomic units (∼13% of total reads in each MBR) in each sample. In contrast, a high percentage (∼87% of total reads in each MBR) of sequence reads was shared between AS and biofilm samples in each MBR, and these shared sequence reads mainly belong to the dominant taxa in these samples. Despite the large fraction of shared sequence reads between AS and biofilm samples, simulated biofilm communities from random sampling of the respective AS community revealed that biofilm communities differed significantly from the random assemblages (P < 0.001 for each MBR), indicating that the biofilm communities (early and mature) are unlikely to represent a random sample of the AS community. In addition to the presence of unique operational taxonomic units in each biofilm sample (early or mature), comparative analysis of operational taxonomic units and genera revealed the presence of a core biofilm community in the five full-scale MBRs. These findings provided insight into the membrane biofilm communities in full-scale MBRs. More comparative studies are needed in the future to elucidate the factors shaping the core and unique biofilm communities in full-scale MBRs.","authors":[{"name":"Gerald K Matar"},{"name":"Samik Bagchi"},{"name":"Kai Zhang"},{"name":"Daniel B Oerther"},{"name":"Pascal E Saikaly"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA gene sequencing"},{"word":"Activated sludge"},{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Early biofilm"},{"word":"Mature biofilm"},{"word":"Membrane bioreactor"}]},"article359":{"pmid":"28658258","title":"Genome-scale analysis of the genes that contribute to Burkholderia pseudomallei biofilm formation identifies a crucial exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is an important public health threat due to limited therapeutic options for treatment. Efforts to improve therapeutics for B. pseudomallei infections are dependent on the need to understand the role of B. pseudomallei biofilm formation and its contribution to antibiotic tolerance and persistence as these are bacterial traits that prevent effective therapy. In order to reveal the genes that regulate and/or contribute to B. pseudomallei 1026b biofilm formation, we screened a sequence defined two-allele transposon library and identified 118 transposon insertion mutants that were deficient in biofilm formation. These mutants include transposon insertions in genes predicted to encode flagella, fimbriae, transcriptional regulators, polysaccharides, and hypothetical proteins. Polysaccharides are key constituents of biofilms and B. pseudomallei has the capacity to produce a diversity of polysaccharides, thus there is a critical need to link these biosynthetic genes with the polysaccharides they produce to better understand their biological role during infection. An allelic exchange deletion mutant of the entire B. pseudomallei biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide biosynthetic cluster was decreased in biofilm formation and produced a smooth colony morphology suggestive of the loss of exopolysaccharide production. Conversely, deletion of the previously defined capsule I polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster increased biofilm formation. Bioinformatics analyses combined with immunoblot analysis and glycosyl composition studies of the partially purified exopolysaccharide indicate that the biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide is neither cepacian nor the previously described acidic exopolysaccharide. The biofilm-associated exopolysaccharide described here is also specific to the B. pseudomallei complex of bacteria. Since this novel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster is retained in B. mallei, it is predicted to have a role in colonization and infection of the host. These findings will facilitate further advances in understanding the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei and improve diagnostics and therapeutic treatment strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Grace I Borlee"},{"name":"Brooke A Plumley"},{"name":"Kevin H Martin"},{"name":"Nawarat Somprasong"},{"name":"Mihnea R Mangalea"},{"name":"M Nurul Islam"},{"name":"Mary N Burtnick"},{"name":"Paul J Brett"},{"name":"Ivo Steinmetz"},{"name":"David P AuCoin"},{"name":"John T Belisle"},{"name":"Dean C Crick"},{"name":"Herbert P Schweizer"},{"name":"Bradley R Borlee"}],"keywords":[]},"article360":{"pmid":"28657808","title":"Chronologic Trends in Studies on Fluoride Mechanisms of Action.","date":"2017-11-01","abs":"Fluoride has been widely used for the prevention of dental caries since the mid-20th century.

We have identified the single Dig1 orthologue in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Genetic studies and transcriptional profiling experiments show that this single protein is implicated in the regulation of MAP kinase-controlled processes involved in mating, filamentous growth and biofilm formation, and also influences cAMP-regulated processes. This suggests that the multiple cellular roles of the Dig1 protein are ancestral and predate the sub-functionalization apparent in S. cerevisiae after the genome duplication. Intriguingly, even though loss of Dig1 function in C. albicans enhances filamentous growth and biofilm formation, colonization of the murine gastrointestinal tract is reduced in the mutant.

Proteins known to contribute to biofilm were identified, and some proteins were reported to have the ability to bind eDNA, such as the major autolysin (Atl) and the immunodominant surface protein B (IsaB). Mutants defective in IsaB showed a moderate decrease in biofilm capacity in the presence of heparin. Our findings suggested that heparin is substituting for eDNA during S. aureus biofilm development. To test this model, eDNA content was increased in biofilms through inactivation of nuclease activity, and the heparin enhancement effect was attenuated.

This question is addressed here using traction force microscopy. We study two distinct motility mechanisms of Myxococcus xanthus, namely, twitching and gliding. For twitching, powered by type-IV pilus retraction, we find that individual cells exert local traction in small hotspots with forces on the order of 50 pN. Twitching bacterial groups also produce traction hotspots, but with forces around 100 pN that fluctuate rapidly on timescales of <1.5 min. Gliding, the second motility mechanism, is driven by lateral transport of substrate adhesions. When cells are isolated, gliding produces low average traction on the order of 1 Pa. However, traction is amplified approximately fivefold in groups. Advancing protrusions of gliding cells push, on average, in the direction of motion. Together, these results show that the forces generated during twitching and gliding have complementary characters, and both forces have higher values when cells are in groups.","authors":[{"name":"Benedikt Sabass"},{"name":"Matthias D Koch"},{"name":"Guannan Liu"},{"name":"Howard A Stone"},{"name":"Joshua W Shaevitz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Myxococcus xanthus"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"gliding"},{"word":"traction force"},{"word":"twitching"}]},"article369":{"pmid":"28655820","title":"e-Biologics: Fabrication of Sustainable Electronics with Green Biological Materials.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"The growing ubiquity of electronic devices is increasingly consuming substantial energy and rare resources for materials fabrication, as well as creating expansive volumes of toxic waste.

The use of the microfluidic platform allows for single-cue experiments where electrical current is supplied at a range that is biocidal to bacteria and multi-cue experiments where acetic acid is combined with current to enhance disinfection. These strategies may offer substantial therapeutic benefits, specifically for the treatment of biofilm infections, such as those found in the wound environment. Our results showed that an application of current in combination with acetic acid has profound inhibitory effects on MDR strains of P. aeruginosa and E. coli, even with brief applications. Specifically, E. coli motility dynamics and cell survival were significantly impaired starting at a concentration of 0.125 mA of direct current (DC) and 0.31% acetic acid, while P. aeruginosa was impaired at 0.70 mA and 0.31% acetic acid. As these strains are relevant wound pathogens, it is likely that this strategy would be effective against similar strains in vivo and could represent a new approach to hasten wound healing.","authors":[{"name":"Ryan Berthelot"},{"name":"Kristina Doxsee"},{"name":"Suresh Neethirajan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. aeruginosa"},{"word":"cell motility"},{"word":"electrotaxis"},{"word":"galvanotaxis"},{"word":"microfluidics"},{"word":"wound healing"}]},"article372":{"pmid":"28655056","title":"Inactivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm after ultraviolet light-emitting diode treatment: a comparative study between ultraviolet C and ultraviolet B.","date":"2019-09-30","abs":"The objective of this study was to test the inactivation efficiency of two different light-based treatments, namely ultraviolet B (UVB) and ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation, on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms at different growth stages (24, 48, and 72 h grown).

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of bacterial proteins are now recognized as one mechanism of protein regulation. In the present study, Western blot analyses, with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody, indicated that a large number of gonococcal proteins are post-translationally modified. Previous work has shown that Nε-lysine acetylation can occur non-enzymatically with acetyl-phosphate (AcP) as the acetyl donor. In the current study, an acetate kinase mutant (1291ackA), which accumulates AcP, was generated in N. gonorrhoeae. Broth cultures of N. gonorrhoeae 1291wt and 1291ackA were grown, proteins extracted and digested, and peptides containing acetylated-lysines (K-acetyl) were affinity-enriched from both strains. Mass spectrometric analyses of these samples identified a total of 2686 unique acetylation sites. Label-free relative quantitation of the K-acetyl peptides derived from the ackA and wild-type (wt) strains demonstrated that 109 acetylation sites had an ackA/wt ratio>2 and p-values <0.05 in at least 2/3 of the biological replicates and were designated as AckA-dependent. Regulated K-acetyl sites were found in ribosomal proteins, central metabolism proteins, iron acquisition and regulation proteins, pilus assembly and regulation proteins, and a two-component response regulator. Since AckA is part of a metabolic pathway, comparative growth studies of the ackA mutant and wt strains were performed. The mutant showed a growth defect under aerobic conditions, an inability to grow anaerobically, and a defect in biofilm maturation. In conclusion, the current study identified AckA-dependent acetylation sites in N. gonorrhoeae and determined that these sites are found in a diverse group of proteins. This work lays the foundation for future studies focusing on specific acetylation sites that may have relevance in gonococcal pathogenesis and metabolism.","authors":[{"name":"Deborah M B Post"},{"name":"Birgit Schilling"},{"name":"Lorri M Reinders"},{"name":"Alexandria K D'Souza"},{"name":"Margaret R Ketterer"},{"name":"Steven J Kiel"},{"name":"Aroon T Chande"},{"name":"Michael A Apicella"},{"name":"Bradford W Gibson"}],"keywords":[]},"article376":{"pmid":"28654321","title":"Redox-Based Regulation of Bacterial Development and Behavior.","date":"2018-06-20","abs":"Severe changes in the environmental redox potential, and resulting alterations in the oxidation states of intracellular metabolites and enzymes, have historically been considered negative stressors, requiring responses that are strictly defensive.

Accurate assessment of middle ear effusions is an important part of understanding otitis media. Current technologies used to diagnose otitis media with effusion are pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, and acoustic reflectometry. While all of these techniques can reasonably diagnose the presence of an effusion, they provide limited information about the infection present behind the tympanic membrane.We have developed a technique based on low-coherence interferometry-a non-invasive optical ranging technique capable of sensing depth-resolved microscopic scattering features through the eardrum-to quantify eardrum thickness and integrity, as well as detect any effusion, purulence, or biofilm behind the tympanic membrane. In this manuscript, the technique is coupled with a pneumatic otoscope to measure minute deflections of the tympanic membrane from insufflation pressure stimuli. This results in quantitative measurements of tympanic membrane mobility, which may be used to gain a better understanding of the impact of infection on the membrane dynamics. A small pilot study of 15 subjects demonstrates the ability of pneumatic low-coherence interferometry to quantitatively differentiate normal ears from ears with effusions present.

The surface roughness, wettability, and silver release profile of each disc were measured. In addition, the antibacterial activity was also evaluated by using disk diffusion tests for bacteria frequently isolated from the peri-implant biofilm: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in vitro in a natural human osteoblasts cell culture. The addition of nanosilver significantly increased the surface roughness and decreased the wettability in a dose-dependent manner. These surfaces were significantly toxic to all the tested bacteria following a 48-hour exposure, regardless of silver doping duration. A concentration of 0.05 ppm was sufficient to inhibit Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, with the latter being significantly more susceptible to silver ions. However, after the exposure of human osteoblasts to 0.1 ppm of silver ions, a significant decrease in cell viability was observed by using ToxiLight™ BioAssay Kit after 72 hours. Data from the present study indicated that the incorporation of nanosilver may influence the surface properties that are important in the implant healing process. The presence of nanosilver on the titanium provides an antibacterial activity related to the bacteria involved in peri-implantitis.

Currently, amphotericin B (AmB) is considered to be the most effective antibiotic in the treatment of C. albicans infections, but its clinical application is limited by side effects and poor bioavailability. In order to use AmB in the local treatment of oral C. albicans infections, AmB/MPEG-PCL-g-PEI (monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-graft-polyethylenimine, MPP) micelles were prepared. A series of characterizations were performed. The micelles allowed a sustained in vitro release in both normal oral conditions (pH 6.8) and C. albicans infection conditions (pH 5.8). Then, buccal tablets containing freeze-dried powder of AmB/MPP micelles were produced by direct compression process and evaluated as regards to weight variation, hardness, and friability. In vitro drug release of the buccal tablets was measured in both the United States Pharmacopeia dissolution apparatus and the dissolution rate test apparatus, which was previously designed for simulating in vivo conditions of the oral cavity. The buccal tablets could sustainably release within 8 h and meet the antifungal requirements. Regarding safety assessment of AmB/MPP micelles, in vivo histopathological data showed no irritation toward buccal mucosa of the rats in both optical microscopy and ultrastructure observation of the tissues. MTT experiment proved that AmB/MPP micelles reduced the cytotoxicity of AmB. The micelles delivered through the gastrointestinal route were also found to be non-systemic toxicity by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, the antifungal action of AmB/MPP micelles was evaluated. Although AmB/MPP had no obvious improvement as compared to AmB alone in the antifungal effect on planktonic C. albicans, the micelles significantly enhanced the antifungal activity against the biofilm state of C. albicans.

The results show that combinations of both moxifloxacin and flucloxacillin plus rifampin are adequate for the treatment of periprosthetic infections due to infections with S. aureus, whereas monotherapies are not effective or not applicable due to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance.

In addition, PdcA PDE activity is allosterically regulated by GTP, further linking c-di-GMP levels to nutrient availability. Mutation of pdcA increased biofilm formation and reduced toxin biosynthesis without affecting swimming motility or global intracellular c-di-GMP. Analysis of the transcriptional response to pdcA mutation indicates that PdcA-dependent phenotypes manifest during stationary phase, consistent with regulation by CodY.

While most EAL domain proteins contain additional, usually N-terminal, domains, there is a distinct family of proteins with stand-alone EAL domains, exemplified by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium proteins STM3611 (YhjH/PdeH), a c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase, and the enzymatically inactive STM1344 (YdiV/CdgR) and STM1697, which regulate bacterial motility through interaction with the flagellar master regulator, FlhDC. We have analyzed the phylogenetic distribution of EAL-only proteins and their potential functions. Genes encoding EAL-only proteins were found in various bacterial phyla, although most of them were seen in proteobacteria, particularly enterobacteria. Based on the conservation of the active site residues, nearly all stand-alone EAL domains encoded by genomes from phyla other than proteobacteria appear to represent functional phosphodiesterases. Within enterobacteria, EAL-only proteins were found to cluster either with YhjH or with one of the subfamilies of YdiV-related proteins. EAL-only proteins from Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Yersinia enterocolitica were tested for their ability to regulate swimming and swarming motility and formation of the red, dry, and rough (rdar) biofilm morphotype. In these tests, YhjH-related proteins S4210, KPN_01159, KPN_03274, and YE4063 displayed properties typical of enzymatically active phosphodiesterases, whereas S1641 and YE1324 behaved like members of the YdiV/STM1697 subfamily, with Yersinia enterocolitica protein YE1324 shown to downregulate motility in its native host. Of two closely related EAL-only proteins, YE2225 is an active phosphodiesterase, while YE1324 appears to interact with FlhD.

However, microalgae-bacteria consortium is promising for advanced nutrient removal from wastewater. Suspended algal-bacterial systems can easily wash out unless the hydraulic retention time is long, attached microalgae-bacteria consortium is more realistic. This critical review summarizes the fundamentals and status of attached microalgae-bacteria consortium for advanced nutrient removal from surface water. Key advantages are the various nutrient removal pathways, reduction of nutrients to very low concentration, and diversified photobioreactor configurations. Challenges include poor identification of functional species, poor control of the community composition, and long start-up times. Future research should focus on the selection and engineering of robust microbial species, mathematical modelling of the composition and functionality of the consortium, and novel photobioreactor configurations.","authors":[{"name":"Junzhuo Liu"},{"name":"Yonghong Wu"},{"name":"Chenxi Wu"},{"name":"Koenraad Muylaert"},{"name":"Wim Vyverman"},{"name":"Han-Qing Yu"},{"name":"Raúl Muñoz"},{"name":"Bruce Rittmann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Advanced nutrient removal"},{"word":"Attached microalgae-bacteria symbiosis"},{"word":"Biofilm photobioreactor"},{"word":"Surface water"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"28651217","title":"Modeling in-sewer transformations at catchment scale - implications on drug consumption estimates in wastewater-based epidemiology.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"To which extent illicit drugs are transformed during in-sewer transport, depends on a number of factors: i) substance-specific transformation rates, ii) environmental conditions, iii) point of discharge (location of drug user) and iv) sewer network properties, primarily hydraulic residence time (HRT) and the ratio of biofilm contact area to wastewater volume (A/V","authors":[{"name":"Ann-Kathrin McCall"},{"name":"Rocco Palmitessa"},{"name":"Frank Blumensaat"},{"name":"Eberhard Morgenroth"},{"name":"Christoph Ort"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Micropollutant"},{"word":"Monte Carlo"},{"word":"Pharmaceuticals"},{"word":"Sewage-based epidemiology"},{"word":"Wastewater quality modeling"}]},"article392":{"pmid":"28651147","title":"Desalinated drinking water in the GCC countries - The need to address consumer perceptions.","date":"2017-11-20","abs":"The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries consist of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. These countries depend mainly on seawater desalination to meet their water needs. Although great emphasis is given to characterize desalinated water for its physicochemical and microbial properties, e.g. presence of metals, other organic contaminants and for bacteria, sensorial characteristics including smell, taste and color have not received the same attention. This is possibly attributed to the fact that inhabitants of GCC States do not use desalinated tap water for drinking consumption, rather they depend on locally produced or imported bottled water where color, taste and odor are not problematic. To address the consumer needs and perceptions of drinking desalinated water in GCC countries, water quality standards and guidelines, should respond to the public concern about other sensorial characteristics (organoleptic properties) including taste, odor, and trigeminal sensations. Often the root causes of color and smell in water are attributed to the presence of organic and inorganic contaminants and to bacterial growth which is frequently accompanied by the production of metabolites and byproducts that are obnoxious. The unpleasant sensorial problems associated with desalinated drinking tap water may constitute the driving force for most people in GCC countries to depend on bottled water. To encourage people in the GCC countries to consume desalinated tap water, it is essential that water testing include measurements of physicochemical properties, biofilm presence and organoleptic parameters to improve overall water quality. This review highlights the contribution of organoleptics for consumers of desalinated tap water. It extends water quality research to be addressed by standards for organoleptic parameters in desalinated drinking water. Accordingly, consumer awareness and outreach campaigns should be implemented to encourage people to drink tap water in the GCC countries.","authors":[{"name":"Basem Shomar"},{"name":"Jalal Hawari"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bottled water"},{"word":"Desalinated tap water"},{"word":"GCC countries"},{"word":"Water organoleptic"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"28651010","title":"Macrophages, but not neutrophils, are critical for proliferation of Burkholderia cenocepacia and ensuing host-damaging inflammation.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Bacteria of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) can cause devastating pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, yet the precise mechanisms underlying inflammation, recurrent exacerbations and transition from chronic stages to acute infection and septicemia are not known. Bcc bacteria are generally believed to have a predominant extracellular biofilm life style in infected CF lungs, similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but this has been challenged by clinical observations which show Bcc bacteria predominantly in macrophages. More recently, Bcc bacteria have emerged in nosocomial infections of patients hospitalized for reasons unrelated to CF. Research has abundantly shown that Bcc bacteria can survive and replicate in mammalian cells in vitro, yet the importance of an intracellular life style during infection in humans is unknown. Here we studied the contribution of innate immune cell types to fatal pro-inflammatory infection caused by B. cenocepacia using zebrafish larvae. In strong contrast to the usual protective role for macrophages against microbes, our results show that these phagocytes significantly worsen disease outcome. We provide new insight that macrophages are critical for multiplication of B. cenocepacia in the host and for development of a fatal, pro-inflammatory response that partially depends on Il1-signalling. In contrast, neutrophils did not significantly contribute to disease outcome. In subcutaneous infections that are dominated by neutrophil-driven phagocytosis, the absence of a functional NADPH oxidase complex resulted in a small but measurably higher increase in bacterial growth suggesting the oxidative burst helps limit bacterial multiplication; however, neutrophils were unable to clear the bacteria. We suggest that paradigm-changing approaches are needed for development of novel antimicrobials to efficiently disarm intracellular bacteria of this group of highly persistent, opportunistic pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Jennifer Mesureur"},{"name":"Joana R Feliciano"},{"name":"Nelly Wagner"},{"name":"Margarida C Gomes"},{"name":"Lili Zhang"},{"name":"Monica Blanco-Gonzalez"},{"name":"Michiel van der Vaart"},{"name":"David O'Callaghan"},{"name":"Annemarie H Meijer"},{"name":"Annette C Vergunst"}],"keywords":[]},"article394":{"pmid":"28650808","title":"Histotripsy Treatment of S.
