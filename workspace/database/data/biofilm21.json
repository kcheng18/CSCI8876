Thus, it is necessary to develop peroxidase-based materials without extra H2O2. In this report, H2O2-free depots are prepared by integrating CaO2 and hemin-loading graphene (H-G) into alginate (CaO2/H-G@alginate). They can convert H2O into hROS through localized cascade reactions at the site of bacterial infection and damage the main components of biofilms (bacteria, polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids). Besides, the confined environment of depots can reduce the potential risk from H2O2 and improve the cascade catalytic activity.

Sputum from patients with CF has been shown to contain oxic and hypoxic subzones as well as millimolar concentrations of lactate. Here, we describe the physiological roles and expression patterns of P. aeruginosa lactate dehydrogenases in the contexts of different growth regimes. P. aeruginosa produces four enzymes annotated as lactate dehydrogenases, three of which are known to contribute to anaerobic or aerobic metabolism in liquid cultures. These three are LdhA, which reduces pyruvate to d-lactate during anaerobic survival, and LldE and LldD, which oxidize d-lactate and l-lactate, respectively, during aerobic growth. We demonstrate that the fourth enzyme, LldA, performs redundant l-lactate oxidation during growth in aerobic cultures in both a defined MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid)-based medium and synthetic CF sputum media. However, LldA differs from LldD in that its expression is induced specifically by the l-enantiomer of lactate. We also show that the P. aeruginosa lactate dehydrogenases perform functions in colony biofilms that are similar to their functions in liquid cultures. Finally, we provide evidence that the enzymes LdhA and LldE have the potential to support metabolic cross-feeding in biofilms, where LdhA can catalyze the production of d-lactate in the anaerobic zone, which is then used as a substrate in the aerobic zone. Together, these observations further our understanding of the metabolic pathways that can contribute to P. aeruginosa growth and survival during CF lung infection.","authors":[{"name":"Yu-Cheng Lin"},{"name":"William Cole Cornell"},{"name":"Jeanyoung Jo"},{"name":"Alexa Price-Whelan"},{"name":"Lars E P Dietrich"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"lactate isomers"},{"word":"pyruvate"},{"word":"pyruvate fermentation"}]},"article4":{"pmid":"30205468","title":"Antimicrobial Photodynamic Inactivation Mediated by Rose Bengal and Erythrosine Is Effective in the Control of Food-Related Bacteria in Planktonic and Biofilm States.","date":"2018-12-21","abs":"The thermal and chemical-based methods applied for microbial control in the food industry are not always environmentally friendly and may change the nutritional and organoleptic characteristics of the final products.

Its transition between host-associated and environmental lifestyles involves the tight regulation of niche-specific phenotypes such as motility, biofilm formation, and virulence. V. cholerae's transition from the host to environmental dispersal usually involves suppression of virulence and dispersion of biofilm communities. In contrast to this naturally occurring transition, bacterial aggregation by cationic polymers triggers a unique response, which is to suppress virulence gene expression while also triggering biofilm formation by V. cholerae, an artificial combination of traits that is potentially very useful to bind and neutralize the pathogen from contaminated water. Here, we set out to uncover the mechanistic basis of this polymer-triggered bacterial behavior. We found that bacteria-polymer aggregates undergo rapid autoinduction and achieve quorum sensing at bacterial densities far below those required for autoinduction in the absence of polymers. We demonstrate this induction of quorum sensing is due both to a rapid formation of autoinducer gradients and local enhancement of autoinducer concentrations within bacterial clusters as well as the stimulation of CAI-1 and AI-2 production by aggregated bacteria. We further found that polymers cause an induction of the biofilm-specific regulator VpsR and the biofilm structural protein RbmA, bypassing the usual suppression of biofilm during autoinduction. Overall, this study highlights that synthetic materials can be used to cross-wire natural bacterial responses to achieve a combination of phenotypes with potentially useful applications.","authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Perez-Soto"},{"name":"Oliver Creese"},{"name":"Francisco Fernandez-Trillo"},{"name":"Anne-Marie Krachler"}],"keywords":[]},"article8":{"pmid":"30204158","title":"CDy14: a novel biofilm probe targeting exopolysaccharide Psl.","date":"2018-12-12","abs":"Detection of biofilm bacteria would be an ideal method for the physicians to diagnose chronic bacterial infections directly, but there are few imaging probes available so far.

Antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) respiratory pathogens were analysed and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined. Furthermore, the time-killing assay illustrated that the metabolite eliminates 50% of the vegetative cells within few hours of the treatment. From the spectral data, the major functional groups present in the compound were determined as carbonyl group and phenolic hydroxyl group which contribute towards its bioactivity. The compound significantly depreciates the production of extracellular polysaccharides which results in the weakening of biofilm architecture and resistance towards serum killing and phagocytosis.

The chemical characterization of both river water and biofilms revealed a substantial heavy metals pollution of the environment; heavy metals were also differentially accumulated in red and black epilithons. Overall, our data revealed that the structuring of red and black epilithons might be affected mainly by the antagonistic interactions exhibited by bacterial genera dominating the two biofilms.

Phenotypic characterization of ad hoc engineered strains and in silico molecular docking demonstrated that the antifungal drugs clotrimazole and miconazole, as well as an antibacterial compound active against Gram-positive pathogens, clofoctol, inhibit the pqs system, probably by targeting the transcriptional regulator PqsR. The most active inhibitor, clofoctol, specifically inhibited the expression of pqs-controlled virulence traits in P. aeruginosa, such as pyocyanin production, swarming motility, biofilm formation, and expression of genes involved in siderophore production. Moreover, clofoctol protected Galleria mellonella larvae from P. aeruginosa infection and inhibited the pqs QS system in P. aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients.

This study developed a method for the determination of elastic properties of biofilms by modelling the biofilm deformation recorded by OCT imaging with poroelastic fluid-structure interaction computations. Two-dimensional biofilm geometries were extracted from OCT scans of non-deformed and deformed structures as a result of hydrodynamic loading. The biofilm geometries were implemented in a model coupling fluid dynamics with elastic solid mechanics and Darcy flow in the biofilm. The simulation results were compared with real deformed geometries and a fitting procedure allowed estimation of the Young's modulus in given flow conditions. The present method considerably improves the estimation of elastic moduli of biofilms grown in mini-fluidic rectangular channels. This superior prediction is based on the relaxation of several simplifying assumptions made in past studies: shear stress is not anymore taken constant over the biofilm surface, total stress including also pressure is accounted for, any biofilm shape can be used in the determinations, and non-linear behavior of mechanical properties can be estimated. Biofilm elastic moduli between 70 and 700 Pa were obtained and biofilm hardening at large applied stress due to increasing flow velocity was quantified.

S. epidermidis has become one of the most common causes of primary bacteremia. Infections are difficult to diagnose because the pathogen has natural niches on human skin and the ability to adhere to inanimate surfaces via biofilms. Alarmingly, S. epidermidis has acquired resistance to many antibiotics, which presents a danger to human health. Known as methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), most clinical isolates of MRSE in North America exhibit β-lactam resistance primarily due to the presence of mecA, a gene that bestows β-lactam antibiotic resistance in a manner similar to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MecA encodes for expression of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which is absent in β-lactam susceptible strains of S. epidermidis. We can disable this resistance factor in MRSE with 600-Da branched polyethylenimine (BPEI). Cationic BPEI targets anionic wall teichoic acid (WTA), an essential cofactor for proper functioning of PBP2a. We found that BPEI synergizes the activity of β-lactam antibiotics against MRSE. Growth curves suggest that the combination of BPEI and oxacillin is bactericidal. Electron micrographs indicate abnormalities in the cellular septa and cell walls of treated samples. Therefore, first-line clinical treatments can be effective against MRSE when used in combination with BPEI.","authors":[{"name":"Anh K Lam"},{"name":"Melissa A Hill"},{"name":"Erika L Moen"},{"name":"Jennifer Pusavat"},{"name":"Cassandra L Wouters"},{"name":"Charles V Rice"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"branched polyethylenimine"},{"word":"wall teichoic acid"},{"word":"β-lactams"}]},"article47":{"pmid":"30192874","title":"Cariogenic potential of sweet flavors in electronic-cigarette liquids.","date":"2019-02-22","abs":"Most electronic-cigarette liquids contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine and a wide variety of flavors of which many are sweet.

Colony biofilms originate from one or more cells that, through growth and division, develop a complicated three-dimensional structure consisting of aerial parts, agar-embedded invasive parts and a central cavity, filled with extracellular matrix. In contrast, flocs arise relatively quickly by aggregation of planktonic cells growing in liquid cultures after they reach the appropriate growth phase and/or exhaust nutrients such as glucose. Creation of both types of structures is dependent on the presence of flocculins: Flo11p in the former case and Flo1p in the latter. We recently showed that formation of both types of structures by wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BR-F is regulated via transcription regulators Tup1p and Cyc8p, but in a divergent manner. Biofilm formation is regulated by Cyc8p and Tup1p antagonistically: Cyc8p functions as a repressor of FLO11 gene expression and biofilm formation, whereas Tup1p counteracts the Cyc8p repressor function and positively regulates biofilm formation and Flo11p expression. In addition, Tup1p stabilizes Flo11p probably by repressing a gene coding for a cell wall or extracellular protease that is involved in Flo11p degradation. In contrast, formation of BR-F flocs is co-repressed by the Cyc8p-Tup1p complex. These findings point to different mechanisms involved in yeast multicellularity.","authors":[{"name":"Libuše Váchová"},{"name":"Zdena Palková"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adhesion and invasion"},{"word":"Colony biofilm"},{"word":"Cyc8p and Tup1p"},{"word":"Flocculation"},{"word":"Yeast multicellular structures"}]},"article53":{"pmid":"30190570","title":"Novel Imidazole and Methoxybenzylamine Growth Inhibitors Affecting Salmonella Cell Envelope Integrity and its Persistence in Chickens.","date":"2019-11-07","abs":"The control of Salmonella from farm to fork is challenging due to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant isolates and the limited effects of current control methods.

Chromosomal lasR complementation in these lasR mutants verified that lasR inactivation was the sole cause of las deficiency.

The lack of efficient technologies to remove ECs from residual waters contributes for their appearance in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS). Therefore, sessile microorganisms on DWDS pipes are continuously exposed to trace concentrations of ECs. However, no data exists on the role of ECs on the resident microbiota. The present work aims to understand the effects of prolonged exposure of a bacterial strain of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, isolated from a DWDS, in both planktonic and biofilm states, to trace concentrations of selected ECs (antipyrine-ANTP; diclofenac sodium salt-DCF; ibuprofen-IBP; galaxolide-GAL; tonalide-TON; carbamazepine-CBZ; clofibric acid-CA; tylosin-TY) on its tolerance to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and resistance to antibiotics. Pre-established S. maltophilia biofilms were exposed to ECs for 26 d. Subsequently, the planktonic behaviour of the biofilm cells grown in the presence of ECS was characterized in terms of susceptibility to NaOCl and to selected antibiotics (levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Moreover, S.maltophilia was tested on its biofilm productivity in the presence of ECs (alone and mixed). These biofilms were challenged by NaOCl in order to assess the role of ECs on biofilm susceptibility. The results did not evidence remarkable effects of ECs on planktonic S. maltophilia susceptibility to NaOCl and antibiotics. However, S. maltophilia biofilm production and susceptibility to NaOCl was affected from ECs pre-exposure, particularly by the combination of different ECs (CA + CBZ, CA + IBP, CA + CBZ + IBP). S. maltophilia biofilms became more resistant to removal by NaOCl when developed in the presence of mixtures of CA + CBZ and CA + CBZ + IBP. Also, biofilm production was significantly affected. CA was present in all the combinations that altered biofilm behaviour. The overall results propose that exposure to ECs for 26 days had not a huge impact on S. maltophilia planktonic antimicrobial susceptibility. Nevertheless, the prolonged exposure to some ECs altered biofilm production and tolerance to NaOCl, with a potential practical outcome of hindering DWDS disinfection. The simultaneous presence of different ECs in the environment may amplify biofilm resilience.","authors":[{"name":"Inês B Gomes"},{"name":"Lúcia C Simões"},{"name":"Manuel Simões"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm control"},{"word":"Chlorine"},{"word":"Drinking water disinfection"},{"word":"Emerging contaminants"},{"word":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"}]},"article59":{"pmid":"30189320","title":"Quorum sensing molecules regulate epithelial cytokine response and biofilm-related virulence of three Prevotella species.","date":"2019-03-22","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) signaling regulates the motility, adhesion, and biofilm formation of bacteria, and at the same time activates immune response in eukaryotic organisms.

Here, we examined the combined effects of estradiol and QS signaling on 1) cytokine response of human gingival keratinocytes (HMK) against whole cell extract (WCE) of P. intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella pallens, and 2) biofilm formation of these three Prevotella species.

Concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, -6, and -8 were determined by the Luminex multiplex immunoassay, biofilm mass was quantitatively evaluated by measuring protein concentration via the Bradford method, and the microtopography of biofilms was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were elevated when HMK cells were incubated with estradiol and WCE of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens, but decreased when incubated with estradiol and WCE of P. pallens.

Essential Oil.","date":"2019-08-29","abs":"Anti-virulence strategies are being explored as a novel approach to combat pathogens. Such strategies include inhibition of surface adhesion, tissue invasion, toxin production, and/or interference with the gene regulation of other virulence traits. Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, is a facultative intracellular food pathogen characterized by a wide distribution in the environment. Its ability to persist within biofilms and to develop resistance to sanitizers is the cause of significant problems in food processing plants and of steep costs for the food industry. In humans, the treatment of listeriosis is hampered by the intracellular location of listeriae and the poor intracellular penetration of some antibiotics. Eleven L. monocytogenes isolates from patients who were diagnosed with invasive listeriosis in Italy in 2014-2016 were studied. This in vitro and in vivo study explored the antibacterial and anti-virulence properties of a steam-distilled essential oil of Cannabis sativa L., which is being intensively investigated for its high content in powerful bioactive phytochemicals. Susceptibility experiments demonstrated a moderate bactericidal activity of the essential oil (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration > 2048 μg/mL). Assessment of the effects of sublethal concentrations of the essential oil on L. monocytogenes virulence traits demonstrated a significant action on motility. Listeriae were non-motile after exposure to the essential oil. Light and scanning electron microscopy documented aggregates of listeriae with the flagella trapped inside the cluster. Real-time RT-PCR experiments showed downregulation of flagellar motility genes and of the regulatory gene prfA. The ability to form biofilm and to invade Caco-2 cells was also significantly reduced. Galleria mellonella larvae infected with L. monocytogenes grown in presence of sublethal concentrations of the essential oil showed much higher survival rates compared with controls, suggesting that the extract inhibited tissue invasion. Food contamination with L. monocytogenes is a major concern for the food industry, particularly for plants making ready-to-eat and processed food. The present work provides a baseline in the study of the anti-virulence properties of the C. sativa essential oil against L. monocytogenes. Further studies are needed to understand if it could be used as an alternative agent for the control of L. monocytogenes in food processing plants.","authors":[{"name":"Emanuela Marini"},{"name":"Gloria Magi"},{"name":"Gianna Ferretti"},{"name":"Tiziana Bacchetti"},{"name":"Angelica Giuliani"},{"name":"Armanda Pugnaloni"},{"name":"Maria Rita Rippo"},{"name":"Bruna Facinelli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cannabis sativa"},{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell invasion"},{"word":"essential oil"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"sublethal concentrations"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article70":{"pmid":"30186447","title":"Preliminary study on the effect of brazilin on biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilms significantly enhance antibiotic resistance by inhibiting penetration of antibiotics and are shielded from the immune system via the formation of an extracellular polymeric matrix. Innovative and novel approaches are required for the inhibition of biofilm formation and treatment of biofilm-associated infectious diseases. In the current study, a biofilm model of Staphylococcus aureus was established in vitro to explore inhibitory effects of brazilin (BN) on biofilm formation and to evaluate damaging effects of BN in the presence and absence of vancomycin (VCM) on the biofilm. Antibiofilm-infection mechanisms of BN were observed. In these experiments, the clinical strain of S. aureus C-4-4 was isolated for biofilm formation. Crystal violet staining and fluorescence microscopy revealed that BN inhibited biofilm formation in vitro and the best effect was observed with two times the minimum inhibitory concentration of BN following 48 h incubation. Additionally, the results demonstrated that BN in combination with VCM enhanced the damage to biofilms, whereas VCM alone did not. The results of the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that BN downregulated gene expression of intercellular adhesion (ica)A and upregulated icaR and the quorum-sensing (QS) system regulator accessory gene regulator A. In summary, BN inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and destroyed biofilms, while simultaneously increasing permeability to VCM. BN was able to reduce production of the extracellular polymeric matrix and inhibited the QS system. These results support the use of BN as a novel drug and treatment strategy for S. aureus biofilm-associated infections.","authors":[{"name":"Dan Peng"},{"name":"Anlin Chen"},{"name":"Bin Shi"},{"name":"Xun Min"},{"name":"Tao Zhang"},{"name":"Zheling Dong"},{"name":"Huan Yang"},{"name":"Xianlian Chen"},{"name":"Yingbiao Tian"},{"name":"Zehui Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"brazilin"},{"word":"vancomycin"}]},"article71":{"pmid":"30186325","title":"Fungal-Host Interaction: Curcumin Modulates Proteolytic Enzyme Activity of Candida albicans and Inflammatory Host Response In Vitro.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Current treatments for Candida albicans infection are limited due to the limited number of antifungal drugs available and the increase in antifungal resistance. Curcumin is used as a spice, food preservative, flavoring, and coloring agent that has been shown to have many pharmacological activities. Thus, this study evaluated the modulatory effects of curcumin on major virulence factors associated with the pathogenicity of C. albicans. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of curcumin against C. albicans (SC5314) was determined. Biofilm formation was quantified and the proteinase and phospholipase secretion was measured. The cytotoxicity was tested in oral fibroblast cells. A cocultured model was used to analyze the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-6) from host cells, as well SAP-1 and PLB-1 by RT-PCR. The MIC was between 6.25 and 12.5 µM, and the activity of proteinase enzyme was significantly decreased in biofilms treated with curcumin. However, proteinase gene expression was not downregulated after curcumin treatment. Furthermore, gene expressions of host inflammatory response, IL-1β and IL-1α, were significantly downregulated after exposure to curcumin. In conclusion, curcumin exhibited antifungal activity against C. albicans and modulated the proteolytic enzyme activities without downregulating the gene expression. In host inflammatory response, curcumin downregulated IL-1β and IL-1α gene expression.","authors":[{"name":"Emily Chen"},{"name":"Bruna Benso"},{"name":"Dalia Seleem"},{"name":"Luiz Eduardo Nunes Ferreira"},{"name":"Silvana Pasetto"},{"name":"Vanessa Pardi"},{"name":"Ramiro Mendonça Murata"}],"keywords":[]},"article72":{"pmid":"30186269","title":"Pseudomonas-Specific NGS Assay Provides Insight Into Abundance and Dynamics of Pseudomonas Species Including P. aeruginosa in a Cooling Tower.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Pseudomonas species are frequent inhabitants of freshwater environments and colonizers of water supply networks via bioadhesion and biofilm formation. P. aeruginosa is the species most commonly associated with human disease, causing a wide variety of infections with links to its presence in freshwater systems.

In the present study, an Illumina-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach using Pseudomonas-specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene was evaluated and applied to a set of freshwater samples from different environments including a cooling tower sampled monthly during 2 years. Our approach showed high in situ specificity and accuracy. NGS read counts revealed a precise quantification of P. aeruginosa and a good correlation with the absolute number of Pseudomonas genome copies in a validated genus-specific qPCR assay, demonstrating the ability of the NGS approach to determine both relative and absolute abundances of Pseudomonas species and P. aeruginosa. The characterization of Pseudomonas communities in cooling tower water allowed us to identify 43 phylotypes, with P. aeruginosa being the most abundant. A shift existed within each year from a community dominated by phylotypes belonging to P. fluorescens and P. oleovorans phylogenetic groups to a community where P. aeruginosa was highly abundant. Co-occurrence was observed between P. aeruginosa and other phylotypes of P. aeruginosa group as well as the potentially pathogenic species P. stutzeri, but not with phylotypes of the P. fluorescens group, indicating the need to further investigate the metabolic networks and ecological traits of Pseudomonas species.

Therefore, QS has been regarded as a promising target to treat P. aeruginosa infections. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the plant-derived QS inhibitor coumarin on P. aeruginosa biofilms and virulence. Coumarin inhibited QS in the P. aeruginosa QSIS2 biosensor strain, reduced protease and pyocyanin production, and inhibited biofilm formation in microtiter plates in different P. aeruginosa strains. The effects of coumarin in inhibiting biofilm formation in an in vitro wound model and reducing P. aeruginosa virulence in the Lucilia sericata infection model were strain-dependent. Transcriptome analysis revealed that several key genes involved in the las, rhl, Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), and integrated QS (IQS) systems were downregulated in coumarin-treated biofilms of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Coumarin also changed the expression of genes related to type III secretion and cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) metabolism. The cellular c-di-GMP level of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and recent clinical P. aeruginosa strains was significantly reduced by coumarin.

This drug has a remarkable benefit in that its activity increases under oxygen-limited conditions unlike other commonly used antimicrobials such as β-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Especially, utility of fosfomycin has being evaluated with particular interest to treat chronic biofilm infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa because it often encounters anaerobic situations. Here, we showed that P. aeruginosa PAO1, commonly used in many laboratories, becomes more susceptible to fosfomycin when grown anaerobically, and studied on how fosfomycin increases its activity under anaerobic conditions. Results of transport assay and gene expression study indicated that PAO1 cells grown anaerobically exhibit a higher expression of glpT encoding a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter which is responsible for fosfomycin uptake, then lead to increased intracellular accumulation of the drug. Elevated expression of glpT in anaerobic cultures depended on ANR, a transcriptional regulator that is activated under anaerobic conditions. Purified ANR protein bound to the DNA fragment from glpT region upstream, suggesting it is an activator of glpT gene expression. We found that increased susceptibility to fosfomycin was also observed in a clinical isolate which has a promoted biofilm phenotype and its glpT and anr genes are highly conserved with those of PAO1. We conclude that increased antibacterial activity of fosfomycin to P. aeruginosa under anaerobic conditions is attributed to elevated expression of GlpT following activation of ANR, then leads to increased uptake of the drug.","authors":[{"name":"Hidetada Hirakawa"},{"name":"Kumiko Kurabayashi"},{"name":"Koichi Tanimoto"},{"name":"Haruyoshi Tomita"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anaerobiosis"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance (AMR)"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"fosfomycin"},{"word":"multi-drug resistance (MDR)"}]},"article75":{"pmid":"30186252","title":"Genetic and Phenotypic Characterization of Indole-Producing Isolates of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae Obtained From Chilean Kiwifruit Orchards.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"In recent years, Chilean kiwifruit production has been affected by the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), which has caused losses to the industry. In this study, we report the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of 18 Psa isolates obtained from Chilean kiwifruits orchards between 2012 and 2016 from different geographic origins. Genetic analysis by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using four housekeeping genes (gyrB, rpoD, gltA, and gapA) and the identification of type III effector genes suggest that the Chilean Psa isolates belong to the Psa Biovar 3 cluster. All of the isolates were highly homogenous in regard to their phenotypic characteristics. None of the isolates were able to form biofilms over solid plastic surfaces. However, all of the isolates formed cellular aggregates in the air-liquid interface. All of the isolates, except for Psa 889, demonstrated swimming motility, while only isolate Psa 510 demonstrated swarming motility. The biochemical profiles of the isolates revealed differences in 22% of the tests in at least one Psa isolate when analyzed with the BIOLOG system.

Sutures strongly contribute to development of surgical site infections as they are considered foreign material in the human body. Sutures serve as excellent surfaces for microbial adherence and subsequent colonization, biofilm formation and infection on the site of a surgery. Various antimicrobial sutures have been developed to prevent suture-mediated surgical site infection. However, depending on the site of surgery, antimicrobial sutures may remain ineffective, and antimicrobial agents on them might have drawbacks. Plasma, defined as the fourth state of matter, composed of ionized gas, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, free radical and neutrals, draws attention for the control and prevention of hospital-acquired infections due to its excellent antimicrobial activities. In the present study, the efficacy of non-thermal atmospheric plasma treatment for prevention of surgical site infections was investigated. First, contaminated poly (glycolic-co-lactic acid), polyglycolic acid, polydioxanone and poly (glycolic acid-co-caprolactone) sutures were treated with non-thermal atmospheric plasma to eradicate contaminating bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Moreover, sutures were pre-treated with non-thermal atmospheric plasma and then exposed to S. aureus and E. coli. Our results revealed that non-thermal atmospheric plasma treatment effectively eradicates contaminating bacteria on sutures, and non-thermal atmospheric plasma pre-treatment effectively prevents bacterial colonization on sutures without altering their mechanical properties. Chemical characterization of sutures was performed with FT-IR and XPS and results showed that non-thermal atmospheric plasma treatment substantially increased the hydrophilicity of sutures which might be the primary mechanism for the prevention of bacterial colonization. In conclusion, plasma-treated sutures could be considered as novel alternative materials for the control and prevention of surgical site infections.","authors":[{"name":"Utku Kürşat Ercan"},{"name":"Fatma İbiş"},{"name":"Caner Dikyol"},{"name":"Nesrin Horzum"},{"name":"Ozan Karaman"},{"name":"Çağla Yıldırım"},{"name":"Elif Çukur"},{"name":"Emine Afra Demirci"}],"keywords":[]},"article86":{"pmid":"30183351","title":"Multidrug Resistance, Biofilm Formation, and Virulence of Escherichia coli Isolates from Commercial Meat and Vegetable Products.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Escherichia coli is an important food safety and public health concern because of its pathogenicity and potential for antimicrobial resistance. E. coli isolates as food contaminants and their antimicrobial resistance, biofilm-forming ability, and virulence genes were analyzed to identify the potential of E. coli in food as a major transmission route for antimicrobial resistance and infectious agents. Among the 709 samples of minced meat and fresh vegetable products tested, 18.6% were positive for E. coli. One hundred nine (29.2%) out of 383 E. coli isolates were resistant to 1 or more of the 25 tested antimicrobials. Among the isolates from minced pork, the highest rate of resistance was observed for tetracycline (52.8%), followed by ampicillin (41.6%). The highest resistance rates against tetracycline were coincident with the high amount of tetracycline sold for veterinary use. Because penicillin is the most frequently used antimicrobial in humans, with 4.52 defined daily doses per 1000 people per day, the high rate of resistance to ampicillin (41.6%) supported the potential risk of E. coli food contaminants. However, only 1.3% of the isolates possessed the virulence genes commonly involved in foodborne outbreaks of E. coli. Sixty-seven isolates (17.5%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR), and the highest MDR was observed against 14 antimicrobials. Most of the MDR E. coli isolates showed biofilm-forming ability. Therefore, these isolates will have additional protection from environmental stresses, including antimicrobials.

Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and their exopolysaccharides (EPS) showed profound effects on plant growth and drought tolerance. Reactions of bacteria to drought stress at various organizational levels are different which depends on intensity of stress, duration, species, and growth stage. PGPR could be effectively utilized in developing strategies to facilitate water conservation strategies of plants. They have the ability to improve plant growth directly by enhancing level of phytohormones, siderophore, biofilm, and exopolysaccharides production and by increasing the nutrient availability in the rhizosphere or indirectly by protecting plants from pathogen attack. EPS producing bacteria are capable to maintain higher soil moisture content and growth of plants even under severe dried sandy soils. The evidence of survival of rhizobacteria under low moisture content obtained from the fact of rhizobacterial occurrence in the soil of desert and effective nodule formation in desert soil. Beside this, EPS produced by PGPR form rhizosheath around the roots and thus protect the plant roots from desiccation for a longer period of time. Important role exhibited by exopolysaccharides includes, protection from desiccation, microbial aggregation, plant-microbe interaction, surface attachment, bioremediation and its use by many industries for stabilizing, thickening, coagulating, gelling, suspending and for film forming. Plants inoculated with EPS-producing bacteria showed higher accumulation of proline, sugars, and free amino acids under water deficit stress. Biofilms formed by the PGPR around the roots are made up of bacterial populations or bacterial communities that encased inside the polymeric extracellular matrix formed by bacteria itself, they adhered to the external surfaces that contain sufficient moisture. It is concluded that the application of PGPR in combination with their EPS is a promising measure to combat drought stress thus, increasing global food security.","authors":[{"name":"Hafsa Naseem"},{"name":"Muhammad Ahsan"},{"name":"Muhammad A Shahid"},{"name":"Naeem Khan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"PGPR"},{"word":"drought"},{"word":"water conservation"}]},"article89":{"pmid":"30182831","title":"Isolation, Purification and Characterisation of a D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine Specific Lectin from Marine Sponge Fasciospongia cavernosa.","date":"2019-01-02","abs":"Marine sponges, belonging to the phylum Porifera, are gaining more attention by researchers and industrial sectors from all over the world due to their ability to produce a variety of bioactive secondary metabolites that have many applications including drug discovery.

Biofilm formation is an important factor that leads to multidrug resistance (MDR) in bacteria. The ability of H. pylori to form biofilms on the gastric mucosa is known. However, there are few studies on the regulatory mechanisms of H. pylori biofilm formation and multidrug resistance. Guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate and guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate [(p)ppGpp] are global regulatory factors and are synthesized in H. pylori by the bifunctional enzyme SpoT. It has been reported that (p)ppGpp is involved in the biofilm formation and multidrug resistance of various bacteria. In this study, we found that SpoT also plays an important role in H. pylori biofilm formation and multidrug resistance. Therefore, it was necessary to carry out some further studies regarding its regulatory mechanism. Considering that efflux pumps are of great importance in the biofilm formation and multidrug resistance of bacteria, we tried to determine whether efflux pumps controlled by SpoT participate in these activities. We found that Hp1174 (glucose/galactose transporter [gluP]), an efflux pump of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), is highly expressed in biofilm-forming and multidrug-resistant (MDR) H. pylori strains and is upregulated by SpoT. Through further research, we determined that gluP is involved in H. pylori biofilm formation and multidrug resistance.

The potential toxicity of each pharmaceutical to the intrinsic microbial communities was first assessed over a wide exposure range (0-1000 μg/l) via an ex-situ dose-response assay to estimate the concentration at which adverse effects were likely to occur. Based on these results an acute (7 day) in-situ exposures (500 μg/l) were then performed and impacts to the mesocosm systems monitored for 1 month via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) alongside chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates and a range of water quality, and hydrological parameters. Despite the clear potential for negative impacts to microbial function from both compounds observed at 100 μg/l in the ex-situ dose-response test, no impacts were observed for the 500 μg/l in-situ exposure in the VSSF mesocosms. COD removal, water chemistry, plant health, and hydrological parameters did not significantly change in response to the in-situ exposure. In terms of fate, the removal efficiency for both TCL and SMX was high (>80%) after 1 h and complete removal (>99.7%) was observed after 168 h. Following the in-situ exposure, and subsequent one month effects-monitoring period, the mesocosms were decommissioned with the media biofilm spatially assessed for organic content as well as TCL and SMX concentrations. TCL and SMX were found to have persisted in the media and demonstrated spatial variation with an overall 2-20% and 5-6% recovered respectively. This suggests that biofilm bound TCL and SMX were biologically degraded in VSSF CWs, however may also accumulate in the biofilm if TCL and SMX are maintained in the influent. These results reinforce the robustness and potential of constructed wetlands for the treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) contaminated wastewater.","authors":[{"name":"Mark Button"},{"name":"Katryn Cosway"},{"name":"Jessie Sui"},{"name":"Kela Weber"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Constructed wetland"},{"word":"Ecotoxicity"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"PPCPs"},{"word":"Sulfamethoxazole"},{"word":"Triclosan"}]},"article107":{"pmid":"30179710","title":"Do raspberry extracts and fractions have antifungal or anti-adherent potential against Candida spp.?","date":"2019-03-25","abs":"Candida spp., especially Candida albicans, is one of the main colonisers of the oral cavity.

However, the process remains poorly understood. In this study, microfluidics with time-lapse imaging was used for real-time monitoring of plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in biofilms. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 harboring an antibiotic resistance plasmid RP4 was chosen as the donor while Escherichia coli and activated sludge bacteria were used as the recipient cells. Dynamic features of the transfer process, including the transfer rate, cell growth rate and kinetic changes of the transfer frequency, were determined. It was found that the routes for gene transfer strongly depend on the structure and composition of a biofilm. While intraspecies HGT is essential to initiate a transfer event, the secondary retransfer from transconjugants to the same species is more efficient and can cause cascading gene spread in single-strain biofilms. For the activated sludge biofilm, only small and scattered colonies formed and vertical gene transfer appears to be the dominant route after initial intraspecies transfer. Furthermore, more than 46% of genera in the activated sludge were permissive to plasmid RP4, many of which are associated with human pathogens. These phenomena imply early prevention and interruptions to biofilm structure could provide an effect way to inhibit rapid antibiotic resistance gene spread and reduce the likelihood of catastrophic events associated with antibiotic resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Bing Li"},{"name":"Yong Qiu"},{"name":"Jing Zhang"},{"name":"Xia Huang"},{"name":"Hanchang Shi"},{"name":"Huabing Yin"}],"keywords":[]},"article110":{"pmid":"30179253","title":"Organic matter and nutrient inputs from large wildlife influence ecosystem function in the Mara River, Africa.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Animals can be important vectors for the movement of resources across ecosystem boundaries. Animals add resources to ecosystems primarily through egestion, excretion, and carcasses, and the stoichiometry and bioavailability of these inputs likely interact with characteristics of the recipient ecosystem to determine their effects on ecosystem function. We studied the influence of hippopotamus excretion/egestion and wildebeest carcasses, and their interactions with discharge, in the Mara River, Kenya. We measured nutrient dissolution and decomposition rates of wildlife inputs, the influence of inputs on nutrient concentrations and nutrient limitation in the river and the influence of inputs on biofilm growth and function in both experimental streams and along a gradient of inputs in the river. We found that hippopotamus excretion/egestion increases ammonium and coarse particulate organic matter in the river, and wildebeest carcasses increase ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus, and total phosphorus. Concentrations of dissolved carbon and nutrients in the water column increased along a gradient of wildlife inputs and during low discharge, although concentrations of particulate carbon decreased during low discharge due to deposition on the river bottom. Autotrophs were nitrogen limited and heterotrophs were carbon limited and nitrogen and phosphorus colimited upstream of animal inputs but there was no nutrient limitation downstream of inputs. In experimental streams, hippo and wildebeest inputs together increased biofilm gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R). These results differed in the river, where low concentrations of hippo inputs increased gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) of biofilms, but high concentrations of hippo inputs in conjunction with wildebeest inputs decreased GPP. Our research shows that inputs from large wildlife alleviate nutrient limitation and stimulate ecosystem metabolism in the Mara River and that the extent to which these inputs subsidize the ecosystem is mediated by the quantity and quality of inputs and discharge of the river ecosystem. Thus, animal inputs provide an important ecological subsidy to this river, and animal inputs were likely important in many other rivers prior to the widespread extirpation of large wildlife.","authors":[{"name":"Amanda L Subalusky"},{"name":"Christopher L Dutton"},{"name":"Laban Njoroge"},{"name":"Emma J Rosi"},{"name":"David M Post"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem"},{"word":"carcass"},{"word":"discharge"},{"word":"ecosystem function"},{"word":"egestion"},{"word":"excretion"},{"word":"hippopotamus"},{"word":"productivity"},{"word":"river"},{"word":"stoichiometry"},{"word":"subsidy"},{"word":"wildebeest"}]},"article111":{"pmid":"30178559","title":"Biofilms and their properties.","date":"2019-05-30","abs":"Bacteria within the oral cavity live primarily as complex, polymicrobial biofilms.

Caries prevention has traditionally relied on fluoride exposure, diet control, thorough oral hygiene, and antibacterial measures. Prevention of caries as an NCD does certainly not disqualify these methods, but brings them into a new context. This conference paper provides a brief review on how common preventive measures can interfere with the drivers of dysbiosis and promote the growth of health-associated clusters in the oral microbiome. Besides the established routines of regular toothbrushing with fluoride products, there is an opportunity for additional technologies, based on ecological principles, to address and modify the oral biofilm. Methods to reduce dietary sugar intake, slow down plaque metabolism, and support saliva functions should be further developed and investigated in terms of efficacy, compliance, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, biofilm engineering through pre- and probiotics early in life to support microbial diversity seem promising in order to obtain a sustained caries-preventive effect.","authors":[{"name":"Svante Twetman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"fluoride"},{"word":"oral bacteria"},{"word":"probiotics"},{"word":"sugars"}]},"article113":{"pmid":"30177957","title":"The Involvement of the Cas9 Gene in Virulence of Campylobacter jejuni.","date":"2019-08-29","abs":"Campylobacter jejuni is considered as the leading cause of gastroenteritis all over the world.

Understanding both aspects of this relationship allows for a much deeper understanding of the mechanism of bacterial pathogenesis. The present study determined virulence in wild and mutant strains by observing biofilm formation, motility, adhesion and invasion, intracellular survivability, and cytotoxin production, followed by the transcriptomic analysis of both strains. The comparative gene expression profile of wild and mutant strains was determined on the basis of De-Seq transcriptomic analysis, which showed that the cas9 gene is involved in enhancing virulence. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that multiple pathways were involved in virulence, regulated by the CRISPR-cas9 system. Our findings help in understanding the potential role of cas9 in regulating the other virulence associated genes in C. jejuni NCTC11168.

MECs inoculated with different P. aeruginosa strains showed a difference in current generation.

Exogenous N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone could remedy the electricity production by lasIrhlI mutants to a level similar to wild-type strains while signaling molecules had little effect on wild-type bacteria in MFCs. Meanwhile, experiments with the wild-type and pqsA, pqsL mutants indicated that the overexpression of PQS signaling molecules made no significant contribution to EET. QS signaling molecules therefore have dual-edged effects on microbial EET.

As certain amount of biofilm growth is required for efficient use of biofilms, the ability to control and maintain biofilms at desired thickness is vital. To this end, we developed synthetic gene circuits to control E. coli MG1655 biofilm formation by using CRISPRi/dCas9 to regulate a gene (wcaF) involved in the synthesis of colanic acid (CA), a key polysaccharide in E. coli biofilm extracellular polymeric substance (EPS).

In this study, positively charged chitosan nanoparticles (CSNP) loaded with oxacillin (Oxa) and Deoxyribonuclease I (CSNP-DNase-Oxa) were fabricated. The antibiofilm activity was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Biofilm architecture on silicone surfaces was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

CSNP-DNase-Oxa inhibited biofilm formation in-vitro and eradicated mature biofilm effectively. CSNP-DNase-Oxa could disrupt the biofilm formation through degradation of eDNA, reduced biofilm thickness and the amount of viable cells on silicone. Repeated treatment with CSNP-DNase-Oxa for two days resulted in 98.4% biofilm reduction. Moreover, CSNP-DNase-Oxa was not only able to affect the biofilm of a standard S. aureus strain, but also showed the highest eradication of biofilms of clinical isolates compared with control groups.

These teeth were treated by a combination of nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treatment. During surgery, the root apices were resected to within the alveolus and the fenestrated area covered by the flap. Specimens consisting of the root apex and surrounding soft tissues were subjected to histopathological and histobacteriological analyses. Histobacteriological analysis revealed extensive resorptive defects on the root apices filled with thick bacterial biofilm, irregular detachment of the cementum layers with consequent infection of the underlying spaces, and heavy infection in the apical foramina. The soft tissue specimens exhibited no or minimal inflammation. The 2 cases showed satisfactory postsurgical healing of the hard and soft tissues. Both cases of mucosal fenestration showed root apices covered with dense bacterial biofilms and associated with a bone crypt with no significant inflammatory tissue therein. The 2 cases were successfully treated by conservative approaches involving a combination of nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treatment with root-end resection.","authors":[{"name":"Domenico Ricucci"},{"name":"José F Siqueira"},{"name":"Simona Loghin"},{"name":"Antonio Grosso"},{"name":"Erica M Valois"},{"name":"Alex S M Leal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Apical surgery"},{"word":"bone fenestration"},{"word":"bone healing"},{"word":"extraradicular infection"}]},"article128":{"pmid":"30173098","title":"Effect of biofilm structural deformation on hydraulic resistance during ultrafiltration: A numerical and experimental study.","date":"2019-09-25","abs":"Biofilm formation in membrane systems negatively impacts the filtration system performances. This study evaluated how biofilm compression driven by permeate flow increases the hydraulic resistance and leads to reduction in permeate flux. We analysed the effect of biofilm compression on hydraulic resistance and permeate flux through computational models supported by experimental data. Biofilms with homogeneous surface structure were subjected to step-wise changes in flux and transmembrane pressure during compression and relaxation tests. Biofilm thickness under applied forces was measured non-invasively in-situ using optical coherence tomography (OCT). A numerical model of poroelasticity, which couples water flow through the biofilm with biofilm mechanics, was developed to correlate the structural deformation with biofilm hydraulics (permeability and resistance). The computational model enabled extracting mechanical and hydrological parameters corresponding to the experimental data. Homogeneous biofilms under elevated compression forces experienced a significant reduction in thickness while only a slight increase in resistance was observed. This shows that hydraulic resistance of homogeneous biofilms was affected more by permeability decrease due to pore closure than by a decrease in thickness. Both viscoelastic and elastoplastic models could describe well the permanent biofilm deformation. However, for biofilms under study, a simpler elastic model could also be used due to the small irreversible deformations. The elastic moduli fitting the measured data were in agreement with other reported values for biofilm under compression. Biofilm stiffening under larger flow-driven compression forces was observed and described numerically by correlating inversely the elastic modulus with biofilm porosity. The importance of this newly developed method lies in estimation of accurate biofilm mechanical parameters to be used in numerical models for both membrane filtration system and biofouling cleaning strategies. Such model can ultimately be used to identify optimal operating conditions for membrane system subjected to biofouling.","authors":[{"name":"Morez Jafari"},{"name":"Peter Desmond"},{"name":"Mark C M van Loosdrecht"},{"name":"Nicolas Derlon"},{"name":"Eberhard Morgenroth"},{"name":"Cristian Picioreanu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm compression"},{"word":"Elastic modulus"},{"word":"Fluid-structural model"},{"word":"Hydraulic resistance"},{"word":"Poroelasticity"}]},"article129":{"pmid":"30173066","title":"Fluidized granular activated carbon electrode for efficient microbial electrosynthesis of acetate from carbon dioxide.","date":"2018-10-11","abs":"The electricity-driven bioreduction of carbon dioxide to multi-carbon organic compounds, particularly acetate, has been achieved in microbial electrosynthesis (MES).

To address these issues, we isolated seven novel AOB strains from the arsenic-contaminated soils. They can completely oxidize 1.0 mM As(III) in 22-60 h. Their arsenite oxidase sequences show 43-99% identities to those of other known AOB. Strains Cug1, Cug2, Cug3, Cug4, and Cug6 are able to form biofilms with thickness of 15-95 µm, whereas Cug8 and Cug9 cannot form biofilms. It is interesting to see that arsenite inhibited the biofilm formations of heterotrophic AOB strains, but promoted the biofilm formations of autotrophic strains in a concentration-dependent manner. The arsenite-oxidizing rates of Cug1 and Cug4 biofilms are 31.6% and 27.6% lower than those of their suspension cultures, whereas the biofilm activities of other strains are similar to those of their suspension cultures. The biofilm formation significantly promoted the bacterial resistance to arsenic.

In addition, the biofilm-mode-of-growth of infecting bacteria impedes antimicrobial penetration in biofilms. Here, we report on poly(ethylene)glycol-poly(β-amino esters) (PEG-PAE) micelles with conjugated antimicrobials, that can uniquely penetrate biofilms, target themselves to bacterial cell surfaces once inside the low-pH environment of a biofilm and release conjugated antimicrobials through degradation of their ester-linkage with PAE by bacterial lipases. In vitro, PEG-PAE micelles with conjugated Triclosan (PEG-PAE-Triclosan) yielded no inadvertent leakage of their antimicrobial cargo and better killing of MDR Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and oral streptococcal biofilms than Triclosan in solution. In mice, PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles with conjugated Triclosan yielded better eradication efficacy towards a MDR S. aureus-infection compared with Triclosan in solution and Triclosan-loaded micelles at equal Triclosan-equivalent concentrations. Ex vivo exposure of multi-species oral biofilms collected from orthodontic patients to PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles, demonstrated effective bacterial killing at 30-40 fold lower Triclosan-equivalent concentrations than achieved by Triclosan in solution. Importantly, Streptococcus mutans, the main causative organism of dental caries, was preferentially killed by PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles. Thus PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles present a promising addendum to the decreasing armamentarium available to combat infection in diverse sites of the body. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: pH-adaptive polymeric micelles with conjugated antimicrobials can efficiently eradicate infectious biofilms from diverse body sites in mice and men. An antimicrobial was conjugated through an ester-linkage to a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)/poly(β-amino ester) block copolymer to create micellar nanocarriers. Stable micelle structures were formed by the hydrophobic poly(β-amino ester) inner core and a hydrophilic PEG outer shell. Thus formed PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles do not lose their antimicrobial cargo underway to an infection site through the blood circulation, but penetrate and accumulate in biofilms to release antimicrobials once inside a biofilm through degradation of its ester-linkage by bacterial lipases, to kill biofilm-embedded bacteria at lower antimicrobial concentrations than when applied in solution. PEG-PAE-Triclosan micelles effectively eradicate biofilms of multi-drug-resistant pathogens and oral bacteria, most notably highly cariogenic Streptococcus mutans, in mice and men respectively, and possess excellent clinical translation possibilities.","authors":[{"name":"Yong Liu"},{"name":"Yijin Ren"},{"name":"Yuanfeng Li"},{"name":"Linzhu Su"},{"name":"Yumin Zhang"},{"name":"Fan Huang"},{"name":"Jinjian Liu"},{"name":"Jianfeng Liu"},{"name":"Theo G van Kooten"},{"name":"Yingli An"},{"name":"Linqi Shi"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Enzymatic pH-adaptive"},{"word":"Infection model"},{"word":"Multi-drug resistance"},{"word":"Polymeric micelle"}]},"article132":{"pmid":"30172303","title":"Versatile use of Azospirillum brasilense strains tagged with egfp and mCherry genes for the visualization of biofilms associated with wheat roots.","date":"2018-11-16","abs":"This study reports the introduction of egfp or mCherry markers to the Sp245, Sp7, and M40 wild-type strains of Azospirillum brasilense and the hhkB (encoding for a putative hybrid histidine kinase) minus mutant an isogenic strain of A. brasilense Sp245 to monitor colonization of wheat (Triticum aestivum).

Serotype 4b Listeria monocytogenes strains associated with the majority of listeriosis outbreak, while the function of hfq in serotype 4b strains still not referenced. Here, we constructed hfq deletion and reversion mutants of serotype 4b Lm NTSN and analysed the biological characteristics both in vitro and in vivo. The deletion of hfq resulted in a growth deficiency in medium containing 4.5% ethanol or 1% Triton X-100, and the growth of the mutant was significantly reduced at 4 °C. Furthermore, the hfq deletion dramatically decreased biofilm formation in BHI medium and gastric fluid medium, and reduced the invasion and replication rate into the Caco-2BBe cells and RAW264.7 cells. However, complementation restored the wild-type phenotype. Importantly, mouse infection experiments demonstrated that hfq played a more important role in the colonisation and virulence in serotype 4b strain Lm NTSN than in the serotype 1/2a strain Lm EGDe. Taken together, these results demonstrated that hfq is a novel factor associated with biofilm formation, and plays an essential role in the stress response and pathogenisis in serotype 4b strain Lm NTSN.

This study evaluated the physical and biological properties of a denture base acrylic resin after immersion in antiseptic soaps. Acrylic resin specimens were prepared and stored in distinct solutions for 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. The solutions were as follows: DW: distilled water at 37°C (control group); DS: cycles of daily immersion in Dettol soap for 8 hours at room temperature, followed by immersion in distilled water for 16 hours at 37°C; PS: cycles of daily immersion in Protex soap, as described for the previous group; LS: cycles of daily immersion in Lifebuoy soap, as described for the DS group. The parameters evaluated at each time point were the following: biofilm formation capacity by Candida albicans and reduction of preformed fungal biofilms, cytotoxicity, surface roughness, hardness, and color change. For the fungal adhesion phase, the type of soap had a statistically significant effect (p = 0.0292), but after 24 hours, no differences were found between solutions or between storage times. Regarding the efficacy of biofilm reduction, there was a significant difference when the groups were compared to each other (p = 0.014). Dettol and Lifebuoy eliminated the preformed biofilm on the specimens. Moreover, all the soaps were classified as non-cytotoxic (on HaCaT cell line) because there was no difference in cell viability between the different groups, except after 21 days, when a decrease in cell viability occurred, regardless of the type of soap. Regarding the roughness, there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) between the groups. Lifebuoy decreased resin hardness regardless of storage time (p = 0.003). After 21 and 28 days of storage, there was an increase in hardness value, regardless of the type of soap. The specimens' color, according to the National Bureau of Standards values, ranged from 0.27 to 0.58 (i.e., imperceptible or mild color changes). In general, the disinfectant soaps were not able to prevent biofilm formation, but all the soaps were effective in reducing the preformed biofilm. In addition, all soaps were non-cytotoxic and did not change surface roughness, hardness (except Lifebuoy), and color (except Lifebuoy).

CC45 strains produced significantly more mature biofilm than other group of strains did. The formation of biofilms was highly dependent on the presence of extracellular DNA in the CC5, CC15 and CC30 strains whereas it was mostly dependent on the presence of proteins in CC45. Finally, the CC30 group highlighted higher proportion of susceptible (bMIC < breakpoints of EUCAST guidelines) for cloxacillin, teicoplanin and vancomycin compared to the other CCs.

Biofilm structure and composition were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy before the grazing experiment. Sublethal effects on R. balthica were observed measuring consumption of biofilm and growth rates. The biofilm composition on PMMA significantly differed compared to PC and glass. The grazing experiments showed limited biofilm consumption and lower growth rates of R. balthica in both plastic treatments.

However, reports on individual Ps-CLPs are often much more limited in the scope of organisms that are challenged or activities that are explored. As a result, our analysis shows that the available data is currently too sparse to allow biological function to be correlated to a particular group of Ps-CLPs.

Today, this plastic litter is ubiquitous in the oceans, including even remote habitats such as deep-sea sediments and polar sea ice, and it is believed to pose a threat to ecosystem health. However, the concentration of microplastics in the surface layer of the oceans is considerably lower than expected, given the ongoing replenishment of microplastics and the tendency of many plastic types to float. It has been hypothesized that microplastics leave the upper ocean by aggregation and subsequent sedimentation. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the interactions of microplastics with marine biogenic particles collected in the southwestern Baltic Sea. Our laboratory experiments revealed a large potential of microplastics to rapidly coagulate with biogenic particles, which substantiates this hypothesis.

The aggregation of microplastics and biogenic particles was significantly accelerated by microbial biofilms that had formed on the plastic surfaces.

Therefore inhibiting or modulating the function of these transporters continues to draw attention as effective strategy to combat MDR. We have previously reported the antifungal potential of Geraniol (Ger), a natural monoterpenoid from Palmarosa oil, against Candida albicans. Herein, we explored the fungicidal nature of Ger. The Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and Nile red accumulation confirms the specific effect on CaCdr1p. Mechanistic insights with Candida cells overexpressing CaCdr1p and CaMdr1p revealed that Ger specifically modulates CaCdr1p activity. Kinetic studies further unraveled the competitive inhibition of Ger for R6G efflux as evident from increased apparent Km without affecting Vmax value. The effect of Ger on CaCdr1p was substantiated by molecular docking analyses, which depicted in-silico binding affinity of Ger with CaCdr1p and explored that Ger binds to the active site of CaCdr1p with higher binding energy. Although RT-PCR and western blot revealed no change in expressions of CDR1 and CaCdr1p, confocal microscopy images however depicted CaCdr1p mislocalization in presence of Ger. Interestingly, Ger was synergistic (FICI<0.5) with fluconazole (FLC) which is a well known antifungal drug. Furthermore, Ger sensitizes the FLC sensitive and resistant clinical matched pair of isolates Gu4/Gu5 and led to abrogated R6G efflux and depleted ergosterol. Furthermore, Rhodamine B labeling demonstrates altered mitochondrial potential with Ger which suggest possible linkage of dysfunctional mitochondria with CaCdr1p activity. We also estimated phenotypic virulence marker extracellular phospholipase activity which was considerably diminished along with inhibited cell adherence and biofilm biomass. Lastly, antifungal efficacy of Ger was demonstrated by enhanced survival of Caenorhabditis elegans model and negligible hemolytic activity (20%). Together, modulation of efflux pump activity by Ger and FLC synergism represent a promising approach for combinatorial treatment of candidiasis.","authors":[{"name":"Shweta Singh"},{"name":"Zeeshan Fatima"},{"name":"Kamal Ahmad"},{"name":"Saif Hameed"}],"keywords":[]},"article173":{"pmid":"30156511","title":"[Detection of virulence factors and antifungal susceptibilities of Fusarium strains isolated from keratitis cases].","date":"2019-04-24","abs":"Fusarium species have gained importance as a cause of keratitis. The pathogenicity and virulence factors of genus Fusarium remain largely unknown. Several putative virulence factors have been reported for fungal pathogens, including biofilm formation, production of proteinases and other hydrolytic enzymes. It has been emphasized that Fusarium species are generally resistant to antifungals but the resistance may vary depending on the species and even according to the isolate. For this reason, pathogenic features and antifungal susceptibility of the clinical isolates gained importance for the management of keratitis cases. The aim of this study was to identify clinical Fusarium isolates, to evaluate their virulence factors and to show antifungal susceptibility patterns. The identification of Fusarium was made on genus level isolated from 25 keratitis cases. Among them, 13 of the isolates were identified by ITS sequencing on species complex level. The production of hemolytic activity, caseinase, esterase, proteinase and phospholipase activity were investigated in 13 of the isolates. Biofilm production was searched among all 25 isolates. Galleria mellonella larvae was used as in vivo infection model. Antifungal susceptibility for amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M38-A2 microdilution assay guidelines. As the subcommittee on antifungal susceptibility tests did not determine the clinical resistance breakpoints (CBP) specific to Fusarium species complex, the epidemiological cut off values (ECV) were used for the interpretation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the antifungal drugs. Isolates were identified as six F.oxysporum, six F.solani species complex and one F.brachygibbosum. One F.solani, one F.oxysporum were positive for hemolytic activity; all isolates were caseinase positive; three F.oxysporum and two F.solani isolate were esterase positive; one F.solani isolate was proteinase positive; five F.oxysporum and two F.solani isolates were phospholipase positive; biofilm activity was positive in 52% of the 25 isolates. The larvae survived for seven days after Fusarium inoculation in the G.mellonella larvae model. MIC range was 0.5-8 µg/ml for amphotericin B, 2-32 µg/ml for itraconazole, 0.5-8 µg/ml for voriconazole, 0.5-16 µg/ml for posaconazole and according to the ECV values F.solani and F.oxysporum isolates were determined as wild type for four antifungal agents. As a result, it was shown that Fusarium isolates have some virulence factors, there was a concordance between in vitro virulence properties and in vivo virulence characteristics and some of the isolates were classified as antifungal susceptible wild type isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Tuğba Çuhadar"},{"name":"Nilgün Karabıçak"},{"name":"Tuğba Özdil"},{"name":"Didem Özgür"},{"name":"Feza Otağ"},{"name":"Kenan Hızel"},{"name":"Ayşe Kalkancı"}],"keywords":[]},"article174":{"pmid":"30156245","title":"MoS","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"Developing novel antibacterial agents to combat bacterial infection has been an everlasting task for scientists, due to the drug resistance evolved by bacteria during antibiotic treatment.

Although herbicide effects on periphyton are frequently studied, the focus has been on photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides while other modes of toxic action have received little attention. Against this background, a 21-days-lasting bioassay was conducted, during which mature periphytic communities were exposed to the carotenoid-biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicide diflufenican for 12 days (up to 10 μg/L; n = 4), followed by a 9-days-lasting recovery phase in herbicide-free medium. Variables related to periphytic functioning (photosynthetic efficiency and non-photochemical quenching) and structure (pigment concentrations, biomass, and algal community structure) were quantified every third day during both experimental phases. Exposure to ≥ 0.2 μg diflufenican/L resulted in 20-25% and 25-30% lowered carotenoid and chlorophyll a concentrations, respectively, likely explained by a reduced algal biovolume as well as diflufenican's mode of toxic action and thus a shift towards a higher heterotrophy of the communities. Despite these adverse effects on the photosynthetic apparatus, the photosynthetic efficiency increased by up to ∼15% under diflufenican exposure judged on higher chlorophyll fluorescence. This may be explained by an up to ∼60% reduced non-photochemical quenching as well as binding of diflufenican to the pigment-protein membrane complex of the photosystem II, two processes causing higher chlorophyll fluorescence. Additionally, phototrophs may have actively increased energy assimilation to cope with higher energy demands under chemical stress. Although periphyton showed some recovery potential following the exposure phase, observed as increasing chlorophyll a concentrations and non-photochemical quenching, periphyton may not be able to quickly recover from stress given the persistent increase in the photosynthetic efficiency. While the processes underlying the observed effects yet remain speculative, the results suggest a shift towards a higher degree of heterotrophy in periphytic communities ultimately increasing the importance of heterotrophic ecosystem functions at impacted sites over the long term.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander Feckler"},{"name":"Jelena Rakovic"},{"name":"Maria Kahlert"},{"name":"Rikard Tröger"},{"name":"Mirco Bundschuh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algae"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Carotenoid-biosynthesis-inhibitor"},{"word":"Chlorophyll fluorescence"},{"word":"Herbicide"},{"word":"PAM fluorometry"},{"word":"Photosynthesis"}]},"article184":{"pmid":"30153549","title":"Application of a novel strain Corynebacterium pollutisoli SPH6 to improve nitrogen removal in an anaerobic/aerobic-moving bed biofilm reactor (A/O-MBBR).","date":"2018-10-11","abs":"A novel bacterium Corynebacterium pollutisoli SPH6 was added in A/O-MBBR system to explore its potential in nitrogen removal.

With findings on the progression of photogranulation, the fate and dynamics of EPS, and microscopy on microstructures associated with EPS, we discuss potential mechanisms of photogranulation occurring under hydrostatic conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Wenye Camilla Kuo-Dahab"},{"name":"Kristie Stauch-White"},{"name":"Caitlyn S Butler"},{"name":"Gitau J Gikonyo"},{"name":"Blanca Carbajal-González"},{"name":"Anastasia Ivanova"},{"name":"Sona Dolan"},{"name":"Chul Park"}],"keywords":[]},"article191":{"pmid":"30152991","title":"Glycomimetic-Conjugated Photosensitizer for Specific Pseudomonas aeruginosa Recognition and Targeted Photodynamic Therapy.","date":"2019-07-05","abs":"Due to the rapid development of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need to explore new antibacterial agents to substitute for traditional antibiotic therapy.

The surface-adsorbed structure is governed by the nature of the molecule, surface characteristics, and solution environment. There are therefore three critical interactions that govern adhesion: solvent-analyte, substrate-analyte, and substrate-solvent. The last two interactions require a surface-specific probe restricted to a few nanometers or less. This is particularly true of efforts to probe polymer surface structure without being overwhelmed by bulk polymer signal or interfacial water structure in the presence of bulk water. Second-order nonlinear optical techniques are ideal probes of such interactions, as their reporting depth is determined by the polar arrangement of molecules (a break in the macroscopic inversion symmetry) rather than the penetration of the optical fields. This Account begins with an introduction of surface water structure from the perspective of a nonlinear probe. Details about the unique view of the water orientation distribution are discussed and contrasted with information obtained from conventional vibrational techniques. The salient features of water next to model hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces are discussed, in preparation for a discussion of solute interactions that follows. We then present three examples using a combination of linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to illustrate how water is both a mediator and a marker of adhesion. The first is a study of amphipathic peptide adhesion onto hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, characterizing the adsorbed structure in relation to the water surrounding the molecule and trapped near the surface. Water is found to be especially important in mediating adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces, where it aids in solvating the peptide as well as facilitating interactions with the surface. In the second example, we look at adhesion of a multicomponent polymer adhesive using surface-bulk heterospectral correlation analysis, in which surface vibrational spectroscopy is combined with bulk infrared absorption to determine interfacial structure development during the evaporation of water. When acrylic acid is added to the polymer, there is a change in orientation of the polymer before an increase in population. This is opposite to what is observed when no additive is present. In our third example, we show how interfacial water provides a unique window into the surface microenvironment during bacterial adhesion, highlighting the role of solution conditions at the surface in cell attachment and biofilm growth. Changes in the nonlinear vibrational response of interfacial water reflect changes occurring in the pH and ionic strength only at the surface, due to the presence of polymeric adhesives secreted by the bacteria. These studies underline the importance of surface water in governing the structure of adhered molecules and in mediating changes in the interfacial environment as a result of adhesion and provide insight into a nanoscale region that is otherwise difficult to query. They also illustrate the importance of combining surface-sensitive and bulk spectroscopic probes with computer modeling to gain a better understanding of the interplay between water and adsorbate structure.","authors":[{"name":"Tasha Jarisz"},{"name":"Sandra Roy"},{"name":"Dennis K Hore"}],"keywords":[]},"article193":{"pmid":"30152639","title":"Oral Helicobacter pylori: Interactions with host and microbial flora of the oral cavity.","date":"2019-08-26","abs":"The role of the oral cavity as a reservoir for Helicobacter pylori is still a controversial issue.

Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are one of the most important factors determining colonization of H. pylori in the oral cavity.

Here, 122 S. capitis isolates from New Zealand (NZ) underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and these data were supplemented with publicly available S. capitis sequence reads. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses were performed, as were phenotypic assessments of antimicrobial resistance, biofilm formation, and plasmid segregational stability on representative isolates. A distinct lineage of S. capitis was identified in NZ associated with neonates and the NICU environment. Isolates from this lineage produced increased levels of biofilm, displayed higher levels of tolerance to chlorhexidine, and were multidrug resistant. Although similar to globally circulating NICU-associated S. capitis strains at a core-genome level, NZ NICU S. capitis isolates carried a novel stably maintained multidrug-resistant plasmid that was not present in non-NICU isolates.

The genome of Bdolosa strain AU0158 (BdAU0158) contains three loci that are predicted to encode contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) systems. CDI systems function by translocating the toxic C terminus of a large exoprotein directly into target cells, resulting in growth inhibition or death unless the target cells produce a cognate immunity protein. We demonstrate here that each of the three bcpAIOB loci in BdAU0158 encodes a distinct CDI system that mediates interbacterial competition in an allele-specific manner. While only two of the three bcpAIOB loci were expressed under the in vitro conditions tested, the third conferred immunity under these conditions due to the presence of an internal promoter driving expression of the bcpI gene. One BdAU0158 bcpAIOB allele is highly similar to bcpAIOB in Burkholderia thailandensis strain E264 (BtE264), and we showed that their BcpI proteins are functionally interchangeable, but contact-dependent signaling (CDS) phenotypes were not observed in BdAU0158.

Prophages often carry genes that benefit the host bacterial cell, since increasing the survival of the host cell by extension also increases the fitness of the prophage. These highly diverse and beneficial phage genes, which are not required for the life cycle of the phage itself, have been referred to as morons, as their presence adds more on the phage genome in which they are found.

This prompted us to investigate the therapeutic application of sPLA2, PLA2G1B, for bovine mastitis. Initial testing of PLA2G1B's effect on bovine mammary epithelial cell (bMEC) line PS revealed no changes in cell viability or cytokine-secretion pattern. However, when cells were first treated with lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) or live bacteria (Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus), incubation with PLA2G1B significantly improved cell viability, suggesting involvement of sPLA2s in protecting membranes from lipid-peroxidation damage, rather than a bactericidal action. When PLA2G1B was applied simultaneously with LPS, a significant short-term reduction in interleukin-8 secretion was observed compared with bMECs treated only with LPS, supporting previous reports that PLA2G1B affects interleukin-8 signaling in similar cells. Following the favorable outcome of the in vitro experiments, we tested PLA2G1B in vivo by mammary infusion into infected glands. In one of a small sample (n = 4) of lactating cows chronically infected with Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a single PLA2G1B treatment completely cleared inflammation and bacteria, demonstrating its potential to cure subclinical mastitis. PLA2G1B treatment did not affect coagulase-negative staphylococci infection. These types of mastitis may involve formation of a resistant biofilm, and its elimination may relate to sPLA2s' characteristic ability to aggregate with cellular debris, facilitating their internalization by macrophages. In a bovine model of clinical mastitis based on introduction of E. coli via the streak canal, a single mammary infusion of PLA2G1B led to faster recovery to pre-infection milk-yield levels and decrease of somatic cell counts. In this case, all of sPLA2s' modes of resolving inflammation may apply, including competitive binding of the sPLA2s' receptor, the inactivation of which confers resistance to endotoxic shock.

Therefore, the necessity of developing new antibiotics or management to deal with bacterial infections has been increasing. The current study combined a low concentration of glutaraldehyde (GTA) with near-infrared (NIR) light and 405-nm laser to entail antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and colony forming unit (CFU) counting were used to quantify the viable cells while fluorescent and scanning electron microscopic images were used to qualitatively evaluate the cell membrane integrity and structural deformation, respectively. Practically, S. aureus biofilm was highly susceptible (7% cell viability and 6.8-log CFU/cm2 bacterial reduction for MTT assay and CFU analysis, respectively) to the combination of GTA (0.1%), NIR light (270 J/cm2), and 405-nm laser (288 J/cm2) exposure. GTA could form either DNA-protein or protein-protein crosslinks to inhibit DNA and protein synthesis. The NIR light induced the thermal damage on protein/enzymes while 405-nm laser could induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to damage the bacterial membrane. Thus, the proposed technique may be a feasible modality for endoscope cleaning to prevent any secondary infection in the healthcare industry.","authors":[{"name":"Van Nam Tran"},{"name":"Chakradhar Dasagrandhi"},{"name":"Van Gia Truong"},{"name":"Young-Mog Kim"},{"name":"Hyun Wook Kang"}],"keywords":[]},"article213":{"pmid":"30146909","title":"Proteomics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: the increasing role of post-translational modifications.","date":"2019-05-13","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen widely involved in human infections.

Ratiometric monitoring of pH with the fluorescent dye C-SNARF-4 has been used to reliably map extracellular pH in the basal layers of biofilms, but only under static conditions. Here, we expand this methodology to measurements of vertical gradients in multispecies in vitro-grown and in situ-grown dental biofilms of different age, and to pH measurements in in vitro-grown biofilms under flow conditions. After static incubation with glucose, young in vitro-grown biofilms (30h) were more acidogenic than older biofilms (120h). However, under dynamic conditions mimicking the oral salivary flow, low pH was only preserved in older biofilms. As both types of biofilm were of similar thickness (~20 μm), these findings highlight the importance of cell density and biofilm matrix maturation for pH developments. In both in vitro-grown and in in situ-grown biofilms, horizontal and vertical pH gradients were observed. Under static conditions, the surface layer of the biofilms tended to be more acidic, whereas the bottom layer became more acidic under dynamic conditions. Compared to in vitro-grown biofilms, 120 h in situ-grown biofilms showed higher acidogenicity during static incubation. This study shows that pH ratiometry with C-SNARF-4 is well-suited to monitor extracellular pH in thin biofilms in all three dimensions. The different pH dynamics observed under static and dynamic conditions argue for the implementation of flow during real-time assessment of biofilm pH.","authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Schlafer"},{"name":"Vibeke Baelum"},{"name":"Irene Dige"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"C-SNARF-4"},{"word":"Confocal laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"Flow"},{"word":"In situ"},{"word":"pH ratiometry"}]},"article222":{"pmid":"30144008","title":"Use of high-strength electromagnetic radiation to remove phototrophic biofilms from terracotta artifacts.","date":"2019-06-27","abs":"A novel technique, effective in eliminating biodeteriogens from biofilms encrusting terracotta artifacts, is presented here. This method is based on the use of high-strength electromagnetic radiation (EMR) in the radiofrequency band. Shards of terracotta from historical pots at the Botanical Garden of Naples, Italy, were used. The shards, after sterilization, were inoculated with several phototrophic microorganisms previously isolated from whole terracotta pots. The newly formed biofilms were exposed to EMR amplitude modulated by a train of rectangular pulses with Tr = 200 ns repetition time and 10% duty cycle. The exposure protocol consisted of three applications of 2 h each, every other day. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses conducted on the newly formed biofilms showed that, after the first exposure to EMR, all species in the biofilms but one were still alive. The second exposure resulted in the disappearance of 9 out of 13 species that were initially present on the samples. After the third exposure, all species disappeared. Superficial layers of terracotta from the exposed samples, transferred to a culture medium at 24 °C for 72 h, did not show any re-growing of organisms. Petrographic analyses of the sampleswere carried out before and after the treatments; they showed that exposure to EMR did not cause structural alterations in the treated substrates. Moreover, the amplitude of the EMR that samples were exposed to was not high enough to cause any significant increase in the temperature of the substrates; that is, no thermal effect, which is the most relevant effect when matter or organisms containing water are exposed to EMR, was observed. Finally, the field strength of the EMR showed to be non-invasive for the artifacts and non-dangerous for operators and the environment as compared to other techniques adopted in the field of conservation of cultural heritage.","authors":[{"name":"Paola Cennamo"},{"name":"Nicola Pasquino"},{"name":"Vincenza Guarino"},{"name":"Vincenzo Morra"},{"name":"Antonella Giorgio"},{"name":"Paolo Caputo"},{"name":"Aldo Moretti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biodeterioration"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cultural heritage"},{"word":"Electromagnetic radiation"},{"word":"Restoration"},{"word":"Terracotta"}]},"article223":{"pmid":"30143838","title":"Mixed bacterial responses to dust exposure in an A549 eukaryotic co-culture.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Recent studies evaluated the impact of dust exposure on pure and mixed cultures of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, revealing increased biofilm formation and altered sensitivities to H","authors":[{"name":"Mariam Bado"},{"name":"Djene Keita"},{"name":"Nkem Azu"},{"name":"Shishir Shishodia"},{"name":"Jason A Rosenzweig"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"Infections"},{"word":"Lung environment"},{"word":"Oxidative stress"}]},"article225":{"pmid":"30143701","title":"Augmented antibiotic resistance associated with cadmium induced alterations in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi.","date":"2019-10-30","abs":"In view of the reports on co-selection of metal and antibiotic resistance, recently we have reported that increased cadmium accumulation in Salmonella Typhi Ty2 leads to increased antibiotic resistance. In continuation, the present study was carried to substantiate this association in clinical isolates. Interestingly, the levels of cadmium were found to be more in the clinical isolates which co-related with their antibiotic sensitivity/resistance pattern. On cadmium accumulation, antibiotic(s) sensitive isolates were rendered resistant and the resistant isolates were rendered more resistant as per their minimum inhibitory concentration(s). Further, after subjecting the pathogen to cadmium accumulation, alterations occurring in the cells were assessed. Transgenerational cadmium exposure led to changes in growth response, morphology, proteome, elevated antioxidants other than SOD, increased biofilm formation, decreased intracellular macrophage killing coupled with upregulation of genes encoding metallothionein and metal transporters. Thus, these results indicate that cadmium, if acquired from the environment, being non-degradable can exert a long-lasting selective pressure on Salmonella in the host which may display antibiotic resistance later on, as a result of co-selection. Therefore, appropriate strategies need to be developed to inhibit such an enduring pressure of heavy metals, as these represent one of the factors for the emerging antibiotic resistance in pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Ujjwal Jit Kaur"},{"name":"Simran Preet"},{"name":"Praveen Rishi"}],"keywords":[]},"article226":{"pmid":"30143697","title":"Whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis of two plant-associated strains of Rhodopseudomonas palustris (PS3 and YSC3).","date":"2019-10-30","abs":"Rhodopseudomonas palustris strains PS3 and YSC3 are purple non-sulfur phototrophic bacteria isolated from Taiwanese paddy soils.

The increase, emergence, and spread of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria are the most important health problems worldwide. One of the mechanisms of resistance used by bacteria is biofilm formation, which is also a mechanism of virulence. This study analyzed the possible relationship between antimicrobial resistance and biofilm formation among isolates of three Gram-negative bacteria species. Several relationships were found between the ability to form biofilm and antimicrobial resistance, being different for each species. Indeed, gentamicin and ceftazidime resistance was related to biofilm formation in Escherichia coli, piperacillin/tazobactam, and colistin in Klebsiella pneumoniae, and ciprofloxacin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, no relationship was observed between global resistance or multidrug-resistance and biofilm formation. In addition, compared with other reported data, the isolates in the present study showed higher rates of antimicrobial resistance. In conclusion, the acquisition of specific antimicrobial resistance can compromise or enhance biofilm formation in several species of Gram-negative bacteria. However, multidrug-resistant isolates do not show a trend to being greater biofilm producers than non-multiresistant isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Virginio Cepas"},{"name":"Yuly López"},{"name":"Estela Muñoz"},{"name":"Dora Rolo"},{"name":"Carmen Ardanuy"},{"name":"Sara Martí"},{"name":"Mariona Xercavins"},{"name":"Juan Pablo Horcajada"},{"name":"Jordi Bosch"},{"name":"Sara M Soto"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gram-negative"},{"word":"infections"}]},"article238":{"pmid":"30141744","title":"Prospects for the research and application of biodegradable ureteral stents: from bench to bedside.","date":"2019-09-25","abs":"Ureteral stents are commonly used in urological practices but are frequently associated with patient discomfort, encrustation and stent-related infection.

Here, we performed RNA-seq analysis of biofilm cells formed by S. aureus RN450 and two derived strains carrying prophages ϕ11 and ϕ80α. The lysogenic strains displayed increased biofilm formation and production of the carotenoid pigment staphyloxanthin. These phenotypes could be partly explained by the differences in gene expression displayed by prophage-harboring strains, namely an activation of the alternative sigma factor (SigB) regulon and downregulation of genes controlled by the Agr quorum-sensing system, especially the decreased transcription of genes encoding dispersion factors like proteases. Nonetheless, spontaneous lysis of part of the population could also contribute to the increased attached biomass. Interestingly, it appears that the phage CI protein plays a role in orchestrating these phage-host interactions, although more research is needed to confirm this possibility.

Here, we propose a framework which uses data from different experiment regimes to identify a region in the parameter space over which subsequent mathematical analysis can be conducted. Along with building confidence in the parameter estimates, it provides us with variations in the parameters due to changes in the experimental conditions. To determine significance of these variations, we conduct global sensitivity analysis, allowing us to make testable hypothesis for effects of changes in the experimental conditions on the biological system.

Rhizobial mutants defective in the production of exopolysaccharides (EPSs), lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), or capsular polysaccharides are usually affected in symbiosis with their plant hosts. In the present study, we evaluated the role of the combined effects of LPS and EPS II in cell-to-cell and cell-to-surface interactions in Sinorhizobium meliloti by studying planktonic cell autoaggregation, biofilm formation, and symbiosis with the host plant Medicago sativa. The lpsB mutant, which has a defective core portion of LPS, exhibited a reduction in biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces as well as altered biofilm architecture compared with the wild-type Rm8530 strain. Atomic force microscopy and confocal laser microscopy revealed an increase in polar cell-to-cell interactions in the lpsB mutant, which might account for the biofilm deficiency. However, a certain level of biofilm development was observed in the lpsB strain compared with the EPS II-defective mutant strains. Autoaggregation experiments carried out with LPS and EPS mutant strains showed that both polysaccharides have an impact on the cell-to-cell adhesive interactions of planktonic bacteria. Although the lpsB mutation and the loss of EPS II production strongly stimulated early attachment to alfalfa roots, the number of nodules induced in M. sativa was not increased. Taken together, this work demonstrates that S. meliloti interactions with biotic and abiotic surfaces depend on the interplay between LPS and EPS II.","authors":[{"name":"Fernando Sorroche"},{"name":"Pablo Bogino"},{"name":"Daniela M Russo"},{"name":"Angeles Zorreguieta"},{"name":"Fiorela Nievas"},{"name":"Gustavo M Morales"},{"name":"Ann M Hirsch"},{"name":"Walter Giordano"}],"keywords":[]},"article261":{"pmid":"30136358","title":"The model squid-vibrio symbiosis provides a window into the impact of strain- and species-level differences during the initial stages of symbiont engagement.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Among horizontally acquired symbioses, the mechanisms underlying microbial strain- and species-level specificity remain poorly understood. Here, confocal-microscopy analyses and genetic manipulation of the squid-vibrio association revealed quantitative differences in a symbiont's capacity to interact with the host during initial engagement. Specifically, dominant strains of Vibrio fischeri, 'D-type', previously named for their dominant, single-strain colonization of the squid's bioluminescent organ, were compared with 'S-type', or 'sharing', strains, which can co-colonize the organ. These D-type strains typically: (i) formed aggregations of 100s-1000s of cells on the light-organ surface, up to 3 orders of magnitude larger than those of S-type strains; (ii) showed dominance in co-aggregation experiments, independent of inoculum size or strain proportion; (iii) perturbed larger areas of the organ's ciliated surface; and, (iv) appeared at the pore of the organ approximately 4×s more quickly than S-type strains. At least in part, genes responsible for biofilm synthesis control the hyperaggregation phenotype of a D-type strain.

Although A. baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen, its infections are notoriously difficult to treat due to intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance, often limiting effective therapeutic options. A. baumannii can survive for long periods in the hospital environment, particularly on inanimate surfaces. Such environments may act as a reservoir for cross-colonization and infection outbreaks and should be considered a substantial factor in infection control practices. Moreover, clothing of healthcare personnel and gadgets may play a role in the spread of nosocomial bacteria. A link between contamination of hospital surfaces and A. baumannii infections or between its persistence in the environment and its virulence has not yet been established. Bacteria under stress (i.e., long-term desiccation in hospital setting) could conserve factors that favor infection. To investigate whether desiccation and/or starvation may be involved in the ability of certain strains of A. baumannii to retain virulence factors, we have studied five well-characterized clinical isolates of A. baumannii for which survival times were determined under simulated hospital conditions. Despite a considerable reduction in the culturability over time (up to 88% depending on strain and the condition tested), some A. baumannii strains were able to maintain their ability to form biofilms after rehydration, addition of nutrients, and changing temperature. Also, after long-term desiccation, several clinical strains were able to grow in the presence of non-immune human serum as fine as their non-stressed homologs. Furthermore, we also show that the ability of bacterial strains to kill Galleria mellonella larvae does not change although A. baumannii cells were stressed by long-term starvation (up to 60 days). This means that A. baumannii can undergo a rapid adaptation to both the temperature shift and nutrients availability, conditions that can be easily found by bacteria in a new patient in the hospital setting.","authors":[{"name":"Itziar Chapartegui-González"},{"name":"María Lázaro-Díez"},{"name":"Zaloa Bravo"},{"name":"Jesús Navas"},{"name":"José M Icardo"},{"name":"José Ramos-Vivas"}],"keywords":[]},"article270":{"pmid":"30132198","title":"Dynamics of Pseudomonas putida biofilms in an upscale experimental framework.","date":"2018-11-27","abs":"Exploitation of biofilms for industrial processes requires them to adopt suitable physical structures for rendering them efficient and predictable.

ETEC causes disease by adhering tightly to the epithelial cells in a concerted effort by adhesins, flagella, and other virulence-factors. When attached ETEC secretes toxins targeting the small intestine host-cells, which ultimately leads to osmotic diarrhea. HldE is a bifunctional protein that catalyzes the nucleotide-activated heptose precursors used in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and in post-translational protein glycosylation. Both mechanisms have been linked to ETEC virulence: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the bacterial outer membrane and is needed for transport of heat-labile toxins to the host cells, and ETEC glycoproteins have been shown to play an important role for bacterial adhesion to host epithelia. Here, we report that HldE plays an important role for ETEC virulence. Deletion of hldE resulted in markedly reduced binding to the human intestinal cells due to reduced expression of colonization factor CFA/I on the bacterial surface. Deletion of hldE also affected ETEC motility in a flagella-dependent fashion. Expression of both colonization factors and flagella was inhibited at the level of transcription. In addition, the hldE mutant displayed altered growth, increased biofilm formation and clumping in minimal growth medium. Investigation of an orthogonal LPS-deficient mutant combined with mass spectrometric analysis of protein glycosylation indicated that HldE exerts its role on ETEC virulence both through protein glycosylation and correct LPS configuration.

The use of a common methodology for the mechanical characterization of biofilms will enable reliable analysis and comparison of microbiological protocols needed for improvement of engineering process and screening.","authors":[{"name":"Héloïse Boudarel"},{"name":"Jean-Denis Mathias"},{"name":"Benoît Blaysat"},{"name":"Michel Grédiac"}],"keywords":[]},"article276":{"pmid":"30131595","title":"Secreted products of oral bacteria and biofilms impede mineralization of apical papilla stem cells in TLR-, species-, and culture-dependent fashion.","date":"2019-10-25","abs":"Regenerative endodontics exploits the mineralization potential of stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAPs) in order to promote root maturation of permanent immature teeth. SCAPs may encounter post-disinfection residual bacteria either in planktonic or in biofilm growth mode. Bacterial components bind to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and trigger pro-inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that biofilm-triggered TLR activation affects the mineralization potential of human SCAPs. SCAPs were challenged with conditioned media derived from standardized dual-species biofilms and planktonic bacterial cultures and their inflammatory status and mineralization capacity were studied. Bacterial products from both growth modes (planktonic vs. biofilm) compromised cell viability, proliferation and mineralization capacity of SCAPs, but in a species- and growth mode-dependent fashion. While TLR4 expression remained unaffected, TLR2 expression was upregulated coinciding with a pro-inflammatory activation of SCAPs. Moreover, TLR and its downstream TGF-β-associated kinase (TAK1) appeared to be blocking mineralization, as inhibition of these factors restored it. In conclusion, bacterial products promoted the pro-inflammatory status and inhibited mineralization of human SCAPs in a TLR-, species-, and culture-dependent fashion. TLR2 emerged as the pivotal mediator of these responses and further research is warranted towards the judicious manipulation of SCAPs in order to modify the untoward events of TLR-priming and signaling.","authors":[{"name":"Xenos Petridis"},{"name":"Luc W M van der Sluis"},{"name":"René J B Dijkstra"},{"name":"Marja G L Brinker"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Martin C Harmsen"}],"keywords":[]},"article277":{"pmid":"30131525","title":"Mixotrophic Microalgae Biofilm: A Novel Algae Cultivation Strategy for Improved Productivity and Cost-efficiency of Biofuel Feedstock Production.","date":"2019-10-25","abs":"In this work, we studied a novel algae cultivation strategy, mixotrophic microalgae biofilm, to improve the productivity and cost-efficiency of algal biofuel production. In contrast to previous methods, this improved approach can achieve high productivity at low cost by harnessing the benefits of mixotrophic growth's high efficiency, i.e., capable of subsisting on inorganic and organic carbons thus unaffected by limited light, and microalgae biofilm's low harvesting cost. Our results, as one of the first studies of this type, proved that microalgae biofilms under mixotrophic condition exhibited significantly higher productivity and quality of biofuel feedstock: 2-3 times higher of biomass yield, 2-10 times higher of lipid accumulation, and 40-60% lower of ash content when compared to microalgae biofilms under autotrophic condition. In addition, we investigated the impact of cell-surface properties (hydrophobicity and roughness) on the growth activities of microalgae biofilms and found that the productivity of mixotrophic biofilms was significantly correlated with the surface hydrophobicity. Finally, our work demonstrated the applicability of integrating this novel cultivation method with wastewater for maximum efficiency. This study opens a new possibility to solve the long-lasting challenges of algal biofuel feedstock production, i.e., low productivity and high cost of algal cultivation.","authors":[{"name":"Javad Roostaei"},{"name":"Yongli Zhang"},{"name":"Kishore Gopalakrishnan"},{"name":"Alexander J Ochocki"}],"keywords":[]},"article278":{"pmid":"30131362","title":"Discovery of New Genes Involved in Curli Production by a Uropathogenic Escherichia coli Strain from the Highly Virulent O45:K1:H7 Lineage.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Curli are bacterial surface-associated amyloid fibers that bind to the dye Congo red (CR) and facilitate uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) biofilm formation and protection against host innate defenses. Here we sequenced the genome of the curli-producing UPEC pyelonephritis strain MS7163 and showed it belongs to the highly virulent O45:K1:H7 neonatal meningitis-associated clone. MS7163 produced curli at human physiological temperature, and this correlated with biofilm growth, resistance of sessile cells to the human cationic peptide cathelicidin, and enhanced colonization of the mouse bladder. We devised a forward genetic screen using CR staining as a proxy for curli production and identified 41 genes that were required for optimal CR binding, of which 19 genes were essential for curli synthesis. Ten of these genes were novel or poorly characterized with respect to curli synthesis and included genes involved in purine de novo biosynthesis, a regulator that controls the Rcs phosphorelay system, and a novel repressor of curli production (referred to as rcpA). The involvement of these genes in curli production was confirmed by the construction of defined mutants and their complementation. The mutants did not express the curli major subunit CsgA and failed to produce curli based on CR binding. Mutation of purF (the first gene in the purine biosynthesis pathway) and rcpA also led to attenuated colonization of the mouse bladder. Overall, this work has provided new insight into the regulation of curli and the role of these amyloid fibers in UPEC biofilm formation and pathogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Thi Khanh Nhu"},{"name":"Minh-Duy Phan"},{"name":"Kate M Peters"},{"name":"Alvin W Lo"},{"name":"Brian M Forde"},{"name":"Teik Min Chong"},{"name":"Wai-Fong Yin"},{"name":"Kok-Gan Chan"},{"name":"Milan Chromek"},{"name":"Annelie Brauner"},{"name":"Matthew R Chapman"},{"name":"Scott A Beatson"},{"name":"Mark A Schembri"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"curli"},{"word":"urinary tract infection"},{"word":"virulence"},{"word":"virulence regulation"}]},"article279":{"pmid":"30131361","title":"Increased Osmolarity in Biofilm Triggers RcsB-Dependent Lipid A Palmitoylation in Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Biofilms are often described as protective shelters that preserve bacteria from hostile surroundings. However, biofilm bacteria are also exposed to various stresses and need to adjust to the heterogeneous physicochemical conditions prevailing within biofilms. In Gram-negative bacteria, such adaptations can result in modifications of the lipopolysaccharide, a major component of the outer membrane characterized by a highly dynamic structure responding to environmental changes. We previously showed that Gram-negative biofilm bacteria undergo an increase in lipid A palmitoylation mediated by the PagP enzyme, contributing to increased resistance to host defenses. Here we describe a regulatory pathway leading to transcriptional induction of pagP in response to specific conditions created in the biofilm environment. We show that pagP expression is induced via the Rcs envelope stress system independently of the Rcs phosphorelay cascade and that it requires the GadE auxiliary regulator. Moreover, we identify an increase in osmolarity (i.e., ionic stress) as a signal able to induce pagP expression in an RcsB-dependent manner. Consistently, we show that the biofilm is a hyperosmolar environment and that RcsB-dependent pagP induction can be dampened in the presence of an osmoprotectant.

We previously reported that cells dispersed from a biofilm are yeast cells that originate from the top-most hyphal layers of the biofilm. Compared to their planktonic counterparts, these biofilm dispersal yeast cells displayed enhanced virulence-associated characteristics and drug resistance. However, little is known about their molecular properties. To address that issue, in this study we aimed to define the molecular characteristics of these biofilm dispersal cells. We found that the inducer of dispersal, PES1, genetically interacts with the repressor of filamentation, NRG1, in a manner consistent with the definition of dispersed cells as yeast cells. Further, using a flow biofilm model, we performed comprehensive comparative RNA sequencing on freshly dispersed cells in order to identify unique transcriptomic characteristics. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that dispersed cells largely inherit a biofilm-like mRNA profile. Strikingly, however, dispersed cells seemed transcriptionally reprogrammed to acquire nutrients such as zinc and amino acids and to metabolize alternative carbon sources, while their biofilm-associated parent cells did not induce the same high-affinity transporters or express gluconeogenetic genes, despite exposure to the same nutritional signals. Collectively, the findings from this study characterize cell dispersal as an intrinsic step of biofilm development which generates propagules more adept at colonizing distant host sites. This developmental step anticipates the need for virulence-associated gene expression before the cells experience the associated external signals.","authors":[{"name":"Priya Uppuluri"},{"name":"Maikel Acosta Zaldívar"},{"name":"Matthew Z Anderson"},{"name":"Matthew J Dunn"},{"name":"Judith Berman"},{"name":"Jose Luis Lopez Ribot"},{"name":"Julia R Köhler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"RNA-seq"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"carbon metabolism"},{"word":"dispersal"},{"word":"gene expression"},{"word":"planktonic"}]},"article281":{"pmid":"30131121","title":"Selection of potential non-Sacharomyces probiotic yeasts from food origin by a step-by-step approach.","date":"2019-10-17","abs":"Due to healthcare is increasing in nowadays, the use of the commercial probiotics is in progress and each day they are more demanded.

This barrier can however be overcome on healthy and in particular on compromised skin. Mycosis, diaper/incontinence dermatitis and wound healing are examples of cases where microbial infection is promoted by the altered skin conditions or environment. Fungi have a complex system that senses ambient pH that leads to metabolic responses allowing adhesion, growth and invasion, as microbial metabolites further increase skin pH resulting in a clinically manifest infection (mycosis). Diabetic patients with a higher pH in intertriginous areas are particularly vulnerable to candidiasis. In diaper and incontinence dermatitis, the increase in skin pH and damage to the skin barrier function is triggered by the contact with urine and faeces with or without occlusion and maintained by host and microbial enzymes and metabolites. This leads to the reduction of the protective resident microflora and fungal overgrowth, mostly with Candida albicans. Skin care with slightly acidic products may help to prevent and treat this kind of dermatitis. Wound healing is a complex sequence of biologic events correlated with ambient pH, which influences the different phases of the healing process. The pH determines the appropriate activity of immune cells and key enzymes as well as biofilm formation. Chronic wounds emerging from the disruption of the healing process are characterized by a neutral to slightly alkaline pH and may benefit from wound pH monitoring and therapeutic acidification.","authors":[{"name":"Frank Rippke"},{"name":"Enzo Berardesca"},{"name":"Teresa M Weber"}],"keywords":[]},"article283":{"pmid":"30130704","title":"Integrated fixed-film activated sludge membrane bioreactors versus membrane bioreactors for nutrient removal: A comprehensive comparison.","date":"2018-11-05","abs":"This research elucidates the pollutants (nutrients and carbon) removal performance and nitrous oxide (N","authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Mannina"},{"name":"George A Ekama"},{"name":"Marco Capodici"},{"name":"Alida Cosenza"},{"name":"Daniele Di Trapani"},{"name":"Hallvard Ødegaard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Greenhouse gases"},{"word":"Membrane fouling"},{"word":"Nutrient removal"},{"word":"Respirometry"}]},"article284":{"pmid":"30130698","title":"Biodegradation of sulfadiazine in microbial fuel cells: Reaction mechanism, biotoxicity removal and the correlation with reactor microbes.","date":"2019-10-28","abs":"Sulfadiazine (SDZ) is a high priority sulfonamide antibiotic and was always detected in environmental samples.

In the present study, polished and unpolished welded coupons prepared by shielded metal arc welding were assayed to identify the effect of surface roughness and local changes in the metal microstructure on microbial colonization. Experiments were performed in glass cell vessels with fresh and sterile seawater to establish the presence or absence of microorganisms. For comparison, nonwelded coupons were simultaneously tested as a control. On the 15th day, both polished and unpolished welded coupons and the nonwelded coupons immersed in fresh seawater showed microbial colonization, though the corrosion products were more abundant for the welded coupons. Nevertheless, unpolished welded coupons showed a higher predominance of pitting around the beads than polished coupons. These results suggest that filler material creates conditions more favorable for biofilm development, thus intensifying the localized corrosion on the welds. It can be concluded that adhesion and subsequent biocorrosion are directly influenced by surface roughness, whereas microstructural modifications due to welding interfere little with microbial adhesion, regardless of the greater pit depths compared to those of nonwelded coupons. Additionally, although open circuit potential measurements indicated that metal surfaces are protected when coated with biofilms, pitting corrosion was more pronounced in welded coupons immersed in fresh seawater than in those immersed in seawater without microorganisms. Therefore, the use of open circuit analysis alone is not recommended for biocorrosion monitoring of welded coupons.","authors":[{"name":"V S Liduino"},{"name":"M T S Lutterbach"},{"name":"E F C Sérvulo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocorrosion"},{"word":"Carbon steel X65"},{"word":"Pitting"},{"word":"Seawater"},{"word":"Welding"}]},"article286":{"pmid":"30130574","title":"Evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of various root canal disinfection methods against Enterococcus faecalis biofilm.

Recent work in bacteria demonstrated that polyP increases oxidative stress resistance by preventing stress-induced protein aggregation and promotes biofilm formation by stimulating functional amyloid formation. To gain insights into these two seemingly contradictory functions of polyP, we investigated the effects of polyP on the folding model lactate dehydrogenase. We discovered that the presence of polyP during the thermal unfolding process stabilizes folding intermediates of lactate dehydrogenase as soluble micro-β-aggregates with amyloid-like properties. Size and heterogeneity of the oligomers formed in this process were dependent on the polyP chain length, with longer chains forming smaller, more homogenous complexes. This ability of polyP to stabilize thermally unfolded proteins even upon exposure to extreme temperatures appears to contribute to the observed resistance of uropathogenic Escherichia coli toward severe heat shock treatment. These results suggest that the working mechanism of polyP is the same for both soluble and amyloidogenic proteins, with the ultimate outcome likely being determined by a combination of polyP chain length and the client protein itself.

These oscillations emerge once the colony reaches a large enough number of cells. However, it remains unclear whether the amplitude of the oscillations, and thus their effectiveness, builds up over time gradually or if they can emerge instantly with a nonzero amplitude. Here we address this question by combining microfluidics-based time-lapse microscopy experiments with a minimal theoretical description of the system in the form of a delay-differential equation model. Analytical and numerical methods reveal that oscillations arise through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, which enables instant high-amplitude oscillations. Consequently, the model predicts a bistable regime where an oscillating and a nonoscillating attractor coexist in phase space. We experimentally validate this prediction by showing that oscillations can be triggered by perturbing the media conditions, provided the biofilm size lies within an appropriate range. The model also predicts that the minimum size at which oscillations start decreases with stress, a fact that we also verify experimentally.

Decades of research on virulence factor regulation in ETEC has revealed a variety of environmental factors that influence gene expression, including bile, pH, bicarbonate, osmolarity, and glucose. However, other hallmarks of the intestinal tract, such as low oxygen availability, have not been examined. Further, determining how ETEC integrates these signals in the complex host environment is challenging. To address this, we characterized ETEC's response to the human host using samples from a controlled human infection model. We found ETEC senses environmental oxygen to globally influence virulence factor expression via the oxygen-sensitive transcriptional regulator fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) regulator. In vitro anaerobic growth replicates the in vivo virulence factor expression profile, and deletion of fnr in ETEC strain H10407 results in a significant increase in expression of all classical virulence factors, including the colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) adhesin operon and both heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxins. These data depict a model of ETEC infection where FNR activity can globally influence virulence gene expression, and therefore proximity to the oxygenated zone bordering intestinal epithelial cells likely influences ETEC virulence gene expression in vivo. Outside of the host, ETEC biofilms are associated with seasonal ETEC epidemics, and we find FNR is a regulator of biofilm production. Together these data suggest FNR-dependent oxygen sensing in ETEC has implications for human infection inside and outside of the host.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander A Crofts"},{"name":"Simone M Giovanetti"},{"name":"Erica J Rubin"},{"name":"Frédéric M Poly"},{"name":"Ramiro L Gutiérrez"},{"name":"Kawsar R Talaat"},{"name":"Chad K Porter"},{"name":"Mark S Riddle"},{"name":"Barbara DeNearing"},{"name":"Jessica Brubaker"},{"name":"Milton Maciel"},{"name":"Ashley N Alcala"},{"name":"Subhra Chakraborty"},{"name":"Michael G Prouty"},{"name":"Stephen J Savarino"},{"name":"Bryan W Davies"},{"name":"M Stephen Trent"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ETEC"},{"word":"FNR"},{"word":"cfa"},{"word":"enterotoxigenic E. coli"},{"word":"toxin"}]},"article298":{"pmid":"30126472","title":"Disinfection Processes.","date":"2019-06-25","abs":"A review of the literature published in 2017 on topics relating to disinfection processes is presented.

Biofilms cause problems in clinics and food production and are highly recalcitrant to antibiotics and sanitizers. Bacteriophage endolysins kill bacteria by degrading their cell wall and are therefore deemed promising antimicrobials and anti-biofilm agents. Depolymerases targeting polysaccharides in the extracellular matrix have been suggested as parts of a multi-enzyme approach to eradicate biofilms. The efficacy of endolysins and depolymerases against S. aureus biofilms in static models has been demonstrated. However, there is a lack of studies evaluating their activity against biofilms grown under more realistic conditions. Here, we investigated the efficacy of the endolysin LysK and the poly-N-acetylglucosamine depolymerase DA7 against staphylococcal biofilms in static and dynamic (flow cell-based) models. LysK showed activity against multiple S. aureus strains, and both LysK and DA7 removed static and dynamic biofilms from polystyrene and glass surfaces at low micromolar and nanomolar concentrations, respectively. When combined, the enzymes acted synergistically, as demonstrated by crystal violet staining of static biofilms, significantly reducing viable cell counts compared to individual enzyme treatment in the dynamic model, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Overall, our results suggest that LysK and DA7 are potent anti-biofilm agents, alone and in combination.","authors":[{"name":"Nanna M C Olsen"},{"name":"Elowine Thiran"},{"name":"Tobias Hasler"},{"name":"Thomas Vanzieleghem"},{"name":"Georgios N Belibasakis"},{"name":"Jacques Mahillon"},{"name":"Martin J Loessner"},{"name":"Mathias Schmelcher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"S. aureus"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"depolymerase"},{"word":"dynamic model"},{"word":"endolysin"},{"word":"flow cell"},{"word":"synergy"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"30126038","title":"Impact of dental cement on the peri-implant biofilm-microbial comparison of two different cements in an in vivo observational study.","date":"2019-02-21","abs":"The type of cement used in cemented fixed implant-supported restorations influences formation of undetected excess cement and composition of the peri-implant biofilm.

In addition, the degradation rate of the scaffolds appeared to be closely related to the progress of infection, influencing the bone repairing potential of the scaffolds in infected bone defects models.

Spatial patterns have been detected in planktonic bacterial communities at distances <20 m, but little is known about the occurrence of similar variation for other microbial groups and changes in microbial meta-community assembly at different levels of a meta-community. To examine this variation, the biofilm of eight saline ponds were used to investigate processes shaping diversity within ponds (β) and between ponds (δ). Bacterial and ciliate communities were assessed using ARISA and T-RFLP respectively, while diversity partitioning methods were used to examine the importance of taxonomic turnover and variation partitioning was used to distinguish spatial from environmental determinants. The results show that turnover is important for determining β- and δ-diversity of biofilms. Spatial factors are important drivers of bacterial β-diversity but were unimportant for ciliate β-diversity. Environmental variation was a strong determinant of bacterial and ciliate δ-diversity, suggesting sorting processes are important for assembling pond communities. Determinants of diversity in bacteria are not universal for ciliates, suggesting higher functional redundancy of bacteria or the greater niche breadth of ciliates may be important in discriminating assembly processes between the two organisms.","authors":[{"name":"Christopher R J Kavazos"},{"name":"Megan J Huggett"},{"name":"Ute Mueller"},{"name":"Pierre Horwitz"}],"keywords":[]},"article308":{"pmid":"30123701","title":"Occurrence of virulent multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in the pigs, farmers and farm environments in Malaysia.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are ubiquitous opportunistic pathogens found in the guts of humans and farmed animals.

A strong inhibition of microbial viability on surfaces can potentially delay the development of biofilms on treated surfaces, thereby enhancing the performance of water-purification technologies and medical devices, for example, to prevent hospital-acquired infections. However, the synergistic effects of surface-immobilized antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have not yet been reported. Here, we demonstrate the synergistic antimicrobial effects of the AMPs PGLa and magainin-2 on modified reverse-osmosis (RO) membranes. These AMPs are known to act synergistically in the free state, but their antimicrobial synergistic effects have not yet been reported in a surface-immobilized state. The AMPs were functionalized with alkyne linkers and covalently attached to RO membranes modified with azides, using a click chemistry reaction. The resulting RO membranes showed reduced contact angles, indicating increased wettability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the two peptides on the membranes via changes in the amounts of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur, which led to an increased S/C ratio, probably because of the sulfur present in the methionine residue of the peptides. The synergistic activity was measured with the free peptides in solution and covalently bound on RO membrane surfaces by observing increased leakage of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein from large unilamellar vesicles. The synergistic antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed using surface-activity assays, where the AMP-modified RO membranes showed an effective inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilm growth, as compared with unmodified membranes. An enhanced activity of antimicrobials on surfaces might lead to potent antimicrobial surfaces, which could result in more fouling-resistant water-treatment membranes.","authors":[{"name":"Nitzan Shtreimer Kandiyote"},{"name":"Gunasekaran Mohanraj"},{"name":"Canwei Mao"},{"name":"Roni Kasher"},{"name":"Christopher J Arnusch"}],"keywords":[]},"article312":{"pmid":"30121931","title":"Disintegration of Bacterial Film by Electrochemically Activated Water Solution.","date":"2018-11-19","abs":"The structure of bacterial film formed at the inner surface of the recirculation reactor tube, is studied.

The subject of this article was to evaluate the chemical composition, antimicrobial and cytotoxic effect of Stachys koelzii essential oil and its main components against Prevotella intermedia. GC-FID and GC-MS analysis were used to determine the chemical composition. The antimicrobial effects of S. koelzii essential oil was evaluated by micro-broth dilution assay. Time kill curve assays, leakage of cytoplasmic materials and anti-biofilm effects were determined. Its cytotoxic effect was evaluated by MTT assay. Essential oil with main components of α-pinene, trans-caryophyllene and 1,8-cineole inhibited P. intermedia with MIC and MBC values of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/mL. Its biofilm formation was higher than α-pinene, followed by trans-caryophyllene and 1,8-cineole. Essential oil and its main components increased the leakage of cytoplasmic components.

In order to colonize the human host, these fungi express several virulence factors such as the response to oxidative stress and the formation of biofilms. In the expression of these virulence factors, the cell wall of C. albicans and C. glabrata is of fundamental importance. As the outermost structure of the yeast, the cell wall is the first to come in contact with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during the respiratory outbreak, and in the formation of biofilms, it is the first to adhere to organs or medical devices implanted in the human host. In both processes, several cell wall proteins (CWP) are required, since they promote attachment to human cells or abiotic surfaces, as well as to detoxify ROS. In our working group we have identified moonlighting CWP in response to oxidative stress as well as in the formation of biofilms. Having identified moonlighting CWP in Candida species in response to two virulence factors indicates that these proteins may possibly be immunodominant.

Roots of these plants engage in interactions with a broad range of microorganisms, collectively referred to as the microbiota. The microbiota contributes to the natural process of phytodepuration, whereby pollutants are removed from contaminated water bodies through plants. The outermost layer of the root corpus, the rhizoplane, is a hot-spot for these interactions where microorganisms establish specialized aggregates designated biofilm. Earlier studies suggest that biofilm-forming members of the microbiota play a crucial role in the process of phytodepuration. However, the composition and recruitment cue of the Phragmites, and Typha microbiota remain poorly understood. We therefore decided to investigate the composition and functional capacities of the bacterial microbiota thriving at the P. australis and T. latifolia root-soil interface. By using 16S rRNA gene Illumina MiSeq sequencing approach we demonstrated that, despite a different composition of the initial basin inoculum, the microbiota associated with the rhizosphere and rhizoplane of P. australis and T. latifolia tends to converge toward a common taxonomic composition dominated by members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Planctomycetes. This indicates the existence of a selecting process acting at the root-soil interface of these aquatic plants reminiscent of the one observed for land plants. The magnitude of this selection process is maximum at the level of the rhizoplane, where we identified different bacteria enriched in and discriminating between rhizoplane and rhizosphere fractions in a species-dependent and -independent way. This led us to hypothesize that the structural diversification of the rhizoplane community underpins specific metabolic capabilities of the microbiota. We tested this hypothesis by complementing the sequencing survey with a biochemical approach and scanning electron microscopy demonstrating that rhizoplane-enriched bacteria have a bias for biofilm-forming members. Together, our data will be critical to facilitate the rational exploitation of plant-microbiota interactions for phytodepuration.","authors":[{"name":"Laura Pietrangelo"},{"name":"Antonio Bucci"},{"name":"Lucia Maiuro"},{"name":"Davide Bulgarelli"},{"name":"Gino Naclerio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Phragmites"},{"word":"Typha"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"microbiota"},{"word":"phytodepuration"},{"word":"rhizoplane"},{"word":"wetlands"}]},"article329":{"pmid":"30116222","title":"ArsRS-Dependent Regulation of homB Contributes to Helicobacter pylori Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"One elusive area in the Helicobacter pylori field is an understanding of why some infections result in gastric cancer, yet others persist asymptomatically for the life-span of the individual. Even before the genomic era, the high level of intraspecies diversity of H. pylori was well recognized and became an intriguing area of investigation with respect to disease progression. Of interest in this regard is the unique repertoire of over 60 outer membrane proteins (OMPs), several of which have been associated with disease outcome. Of these OMPs, the association between HomB and disease outcome varies based on the population being studied. While the molecular roles for some of the disease-associated OMPs have been evaluated, little is known about the role that HomB plays in the H. pylori lifecycle. Thus, herein we investigated homB expression, regulation, and contribution to biofilm formation. We found that in H. pylori strain G27, homB was expressed at a relatively low level until stationary phase. Furthermore, homB expression was suppressed at low pH in an ArsRS-dependent manner; mutation of arsRS resulted in increased homB transcript at all tested time-points. ArsRS regulation of homB appeared to be direct as purified ArsR was able to specifically bind to the homB promoter. This regulation, combined with our previous finding that ArsRS mutations lead to enhanced biofilm formation, led us to test the hypothesis that homB contributes to biofilm formation by H. pylori. Indeed, subsequent biofilm analysis using a crystal-violet quantification assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that loss of homB from hyper-biofilm forming strains resulted in reversion to a biofilm phenotype that mimicked wild-type. Furthermore, expression of homB in trans from a promoter that negated ArsRS regulation led to enhanced biofilm formation even in strains in which the chromosomal copy of homB had been deleted. Thus, homB is necessary for hyper-biofilm formation of ArsRS mutant strains and aberrant regulation of this gene is sufficient to induce a hyper-biofilm phenotype. In summary, these data suggest that the ArsRS-dependent regulation of OMPs such as HomB may be one mechanism by which ArsRS dictates biofilm development in a pH responsive manner.","authors":[{"name":"Stephanie L Servetas"},{"name":"Ryan S Doster"},{"name":"Aeryun Kim"},{"name":"Ian H Windham"},{"name":"Jeong-Heon Cha"},{"name":"Jennifer A Gaddy"},{"name":"D Scott Merrell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ArsRS"},{"word":"H. pylori"},{"word":"OMPs"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"homB"}]},"article330":{"pmid":"30116190","title":"Antibacterial Properties of Medicinal Plants From Pakistan Against Multidrug-Resistant ESKAPE Pathogens.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Local people in the Sudhnoti district of Pakistan share a rich practice of traditional medicine for the treatment of a variety of ailments.

Mutation of fliW results in C. jejuni cells that have greatly truncated flagella, are less motile, less able to form biofilms, and exhibit a reduced ability to colonize chicks. The loss of FliW results in the altered expression of 153 flagellar and non-flagellar proteins, the majority of which are members of the CsrA regulon. The number of proteins dysregulated in the fliW mutant was greater at mid-log phase (120 proteins) than at stationary phase (85 proteins); 52 proteins showed altered expression at both growth phases. Loss of FliW altered the growth-phase- and CsrA-mediated regulation of FlaA flagellin. FliW exerts these effects by binding to both FlaA and to CsrA, as evidenced by pull-down assays, protein-protein cross-linking, and size-exclusion chromatography. Taken together, these results show that CsrA-mediated regulation of both flagellar and non-flagellar proteins is modulated by direct binding of CsrA to the flagellar chaperone FliW.

C. glabrata and Lactobacilli co-colonise mucosal surfaces. Lactic acid at a concentration produced by vaginal Lactobacillus spp. causes CgHog1 phosphorylation and accumulation in the nucleus.

However, conclusive material-based data for minimal microbial colonization to establish acceptance criteria for the use of elastomeric ligatures are hardly available. Thus, there is a need for further studies with dual emphasis on exploring microbial associations based on surface chemistries of different elastomers and their requisite modifications for hampering microbial biofilms to evolve efficacious oral health friendly orthodontic ligatures.","authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Sawhney"},{"name":"Ravish Sharma"},{"name":"Kavita Sharma"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Orthodontic ligatures"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"elastomers"},{"word":"microbial colonization"}]},"article348":{"pmid":"30112215","title":"The Bacteriology and Its Virulence Factors in Neonatal Infections: Threats to Child Survival Strategies.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Neonatal infection refers to the infection of the newborn during the first twenty-eight days of life.

To investigate if S. aureus biofilm growth in the CF airways is impacted by virus coinfection, we evaluated S. aureus growth on CF AECs.

In a second step, they were exposed to human oral environment in situ in order to explore potential application in dentistry. In vitro, the cuticular structures were found to resist wetting by albumin solutions for up to 3 h and colonization by Staphylococcus epidermidis was inhibited.

Also the degree of bacterial colonization varied considerably. In conclusion, the springtail cuticle partially modulates bioadhesion in the oral cavity in a unique and specific manner, but it has no universal effect.

Bacteriophages (phages) and honey are both seen as a promising approach for biofilm related infections.

In general, colonization was higher in the porcine skins and the presence of a second microorganism in a consortium of species did not affect the effectiveness of the treatments. The antibacterial effect of combined therapy against dual-species biofilms led to bacterial reductions that were greater for biofilms formed on polystyrene than on skin. Monospecies biofilms of E. coli were better destroyed with phages and honey than P. aeruginosa monospecies biofilms.

Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of B. cenocepacia cells treated with one of these inhibitors, and compared it with a cepI deleted strain. Our results demonstrate that the effects of the compound are similar to the deletion of cepI, clearly confirming that these molecules function as inhibitors of the acyl homoserine lactone synthase. Moreover, to deepen our knowledge about the binding mechanisms of the compound to CepI, we exploited previously published in silico structural insights about this enzyme structure and validated different candidate binding pockets on the enzyme surface using site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analyses.

Sulfate reduction at low pH was accompanied by the formation of mineral precipitates strongly adhering to solid surfaces. A structural investigation by laser scanning microscopy, electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis revealed the formation of Al hydroxides and Fe sulfides which were densely populated by cells. Al hydroxides precipitated first, enabling initial cell attachment. Colonization of solid surfaces coincided with increased sulfate reducing activity indicating more favourable growth conditions within biofilms compared with free-living cells. These findings point out the importance of cell-mineral interaction for biofilm formation and contribute to our understanding how sulfate reducing prokaryotes thrive in both natural and engineered systems at low pH.","authors":[{"name":"Viola Rüffel"},{"name":"Mona Maar"},{"name":"Markus N Dammbrück"},{"name":"Bärbel Hauröder"},{"name":"Thomas R Neu"},{"name":"Jutta Meier"}],"keywords":[]},"article373":{"pmid":"30105643","title":"Role of Chemical Mediators in Aquatic Interactions across the Prokaryote-Eukaryote Boundary.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"There is worldwide growing interest in the occurrence and diversity of metabolites used as chemical mediators in cross-kingdom interactions within aquatic systems.

The purpose of this work was to develop, build and demonstrate the use of a microbial culture chamber enabling both in situ and laboratory-based studies. The design uses an enclosed chamber surrounded by two porous membranes that enables the comparison of growth of two separate microbial populations but allowing free exchange of small molecules. Initially, we tested if the presence of the macroalga Fucus vesiculosus inside the chamber affected colonization of the outer membranes by marine bacteria. The alga did indeed enrich the total population of colonizing bacteria by more than a factor of four. These findings lead us to investigate the effect of the presence of the coccolithophoric alga Emiliania huxleyi on attachment and biofilm formation of the marine bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens DSM17395. These organisms co-exist in the marine environment and have a well-characterized interdependence on secondary metabolites. P. inhibens attached in significantly higher numbers when having access to E. huxleyi as compared to when exposed to sterile media. The experiment was carried out using a wild type (wt) strain as well as a TDA-deficient strain of P. inhibens. The ability of the bacterium to produce the antibacterial compound, tropodithietic acid (TDA) influenced its attachment since the P. inhibens DSM17395 wt strain attached in higher numbers to a surface within the first 48 h of incubation with E. huxleyi as compared to a TDA-negative mutant. Whilst the attachment of the bacterium to a surface was facilitated by presence of the alga, however, we cannot conclude if this was directly affected by the algae or whether biofilm formation was dependent on the production of TDA by P. inhibens, which has been implied by previous studies. In the light of these results, other applications of immersed culture chambers are suggested.","authors":[{"name":"Mariane S Thøgersen"},{"name":"Jette Melchiorsen"},{"name":"Colin Ingham"},{"name":"Lone Gram"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Emiliania huxleyi"},{"word":"Phaeobacter inhibens"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"co-culture"},{"word":"microbial culture chamber"},{"word":"qPCR"}]},"article380":{"pmid":"30104621","title":"Gold nanoparticle biodissolution by a freshwater macrophyte and its associated microbiome.","date":"2019-08-13","abs":"Predicting nanoparticle fate in aquatic environments requires mimicking of ecosystem complexity to observe the geochemical processes affecting their behaviour.

Several aspects of farnesol's mechanism of action remain incompletely uncharacterized. Among these are a thorough accounting of the cellular receptors and transporters for farnesol. This work suggests these processes are linked through the Zn cluster transcription factors Tac1 and Znc1 and their induction of the multidrug efflux pump Cdr1. Specifically, we have demonstrated that Tac1 and Znc1 are functionally activated by farnesol through a mechanism that mimics other means of hyperactivation of Zn cluster transcription factors. This is consistent with our observation that many genes acutely induced by farnesol are dependent on TAC1, ZNC1, or both. A related molecule, 1-dodecanol, invokes a similar TAC1-ZNC1 response, while several other proposed C. albicans quorum-sensing molecules do not. Tac1 and Znc1 both bind to and upregulate the CDR1 promoter in response to farnesol. Differences in inducer and DNA binding specificity lead to Tac1 and Znc1 having overlapping, but nonidentical, regulons. Induction of genes by farnesol via Tac1 and Znc1 was inversely related to the level of CDR1 present in the cell, suggesting a model in which induction of CDR1 by Tac1 and Znc1 leads to an increase in farnesol efflux. Consistent with this premise, our results show that CDR1 expression, and its regulation by TAC1 and ZNC1, facilitates growth in the presence of high farnesol concentrations in C. albicans and in certain strains of its close relative, C. dubliniensis.","authors":[{"name":"Zhongle Liu"},{"name":"John M Rossi"},{"name":"Lawrence C Myers"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"farnesol"},{"word":"zinc cluster transcription factor"}]},"article383":{"pmid":"30104272","title":"Treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Present in Endotracheal Tubes by Poly-l-Lysine.","date":"2019-10-10","abs":"The endotracheal tube (ETT) is an essential interface between the patient and ventilator in mechanically ventilated patients.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading pathogens that cause biofilm infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Poly-l-lysine (pLK) is a cationic polypeptide possessing antibacterial properties and mucolytic activity by compacting DNA. Here, we explored the antibiofilm activity of pLK to treat P. aeruginosa biofilms on ETTs while taking into consideration the necessary constraints for clinical translation in our experimental designs. First, we showed that pLK eradicates a P. aeruginosa biofilm formed in vitro on 96-well microplates. We further demonstrated that pLK alters bacterial membrane integrity, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy, and eventually eradicates biofilm formed either by reference or clinical strains of P. aeruginosa biofilms generated in vitro on ETTs. Second, we collected the ETT from patients with P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia. We observed that a single dose of pLK is able to immediately disrupt the biofilm structure and kills more than 90% of bacteria present in the biofilm. Additionally, we did not observe any lung tolerance issue when the pLK solution was instilled into the ETT of ventilated pigs, an animal model particularly relevant to mimic invasive mechanical ventilation in humans. In conclusion, pLK appears as an innovative antibiofilm molecule, which could be applied in the ETT of mechanically ventilated patients.","authors":[{"name":"Antoine Guillon"},{"name":"Delphine Fouquenet"},{"name":"Eric Morello"},{"name":"Clémence Henry"},{"name":"Sonia Georgeault"},{"name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar"},{"name":"Virginie Hervé"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiofilm agent"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"endotracheal tube"},{"word":"poly-l-lysine"},{"word":"ventilator-associated pneumonia"}]},"article384":{"pmid":"30104269","title":"Screening a Repurposing Library for Inhibitors of Multidrug-Resistant Candida auris Identifies Ebselen as a Repositionable Candidate for Antifungal Drug Development.","date":"2019-09-30","abs":"Since its original isolation in 2009, Candida auris has spread across the globe as a causative agent of invasive candidiasis.

Our initial screen, using standardized susceptibility testing methodologies, identified nine miscellaneous compounds with no previous clinical indication as antifungals or antiseptics that displayed activity against C. auris Confirmation and follow-up studies identified ebselen as the drug displaying the most potent activity, with 100% inhibition of growth detected at concentrations as low as 2.5 μM. We further evaluated the ability of ebselen to inhibit C. auris biofilm formation and examined the effects of combination therapies of ebselen with clinically used antifungals. We extended our studies to different C. auris strains with various susceptibility patterns and also confirmed its antifungal activity against Candida albicans and clinical isolates of multiple other Candida species. Furthermore, ebselen displayed a broad spectrum of antifungal actions on the basis of its activity against a variety of medically important fungi, including yeasts and molds.

Activation of these two phenotypes requires the chitin-induced regulator TfoX, but also integrates signals from quorum sensing via the intermediate regulator QstR, which belongs to the LuxR-type family of regulators. Here, we define the QstR regulon using RNA sequencing. Moreover, by mapping QstR binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing we demonstrate that QstR is a transcription factor that binds upstream of the up- and down-regulated genes. Like other LuxR-type family transcriptional regulators we show that QstR function is dependent on dimerization. However, in contrast to the well-studied LuxR-type biofilm regulator VpsT of V. cholerae, which requires the second messenger c-di-GMP, we show that QstR dimerization and function is c-di-GMP independent. Surprisingly, although ComEA, which is a periplasmic DNA-binding protein essential for transformation, is produced in a QstR-dependent manner, QstR-binding was not detected upstream of comEA suggesting the existence of a further regulatory pathway. Overall, these results provide detailed insights into the function of a key regulator of natural competence and type VI secretion in V. cholerae.","authors":[{"name":"Milena Jaskólska"},{"name":"Sandrine Stutzmann"},{"name":"Candice Stoudmann"},{"name":"Melanie Blokesch"}],"keywords":[]},"article390":{"pmid":"30102275","title":"Self-standing Electrochemical Set-up to Enrich Anode-respiring Bacteria On-site.","date":"2019-03-18","abs":"Anaerobic respiration coupled with electron transport to insoluble minerals (referred to as extracellular electron transport [EET]) is thought to be critical for microbial energy production and persistence in many subsurface environments, especially those lacking soluble terminal electron acceptors. While EET-capable microbes have been successfully isolated from various environments, the diversity of bacteria capable of EET is still poorly understood, especially in difficult-to-sample, low energy or extreme environments, such as many subsurface ecosystems. Here, we describe an on-site electrochemical system to enrich EET-capable bacteria using an anode as a respiratory terminal electron acceptor. This anode is connected to a cathode capable of catalyzing abiotic oxygen reduction. Comparing this approach with electrocultivation methods that use a potentiostat for poising the electrode potential, the two-electrode system does not require an external power source. We present an example of our on-site enrichment utilized in an alkaline pond at the Cedars, a terrestrial serpentinization site in Northern California. Prior attempts to cultivate mineral reducing bacteria were unsuccessful, which is likely due to the low-biomass nature of this site and/or the low relative abundance of metal reducing microbes. Prior to implementing our two-electrode enrichment, we measured the vertical profile of dissolved oxygen concentration. This allowed us to place the carbon felt anode and platinum-electroplated carbon felt cathode at depths that would support anaerobic and aerobic processes, respectively. Following on-site incubation, we further enriched the anodic electrode in the laboratory and confirmed a distinct microbial community compared to the surface-attached or biofilm communities normally observed at the Cedars. This enrichment subsequently led to the isolation of the first electrogenic microbe from the Cedars. This method of on-site microbial enrichment has the potential to greatly enhance the isolation of EET-capable bacteria from low biomass or difficult to sample habitats.","authors":[{"name":"Akihiro Okamoto"},{"name":"Annette Rowe"},{"name":"Xiao Deng"},{"name":"Kenneth H Nealson"}],"keywords":[]},"article391":{"pmid":"30101982","title":"Diverse Profiles of Biofilm and Adhesion Genes in Staphylococcus Aureus Food Strains Isolated from Sushi and Sashimi.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is able to form multilayer biofilms embedded within a glycocalyx or slime layer. Biofilm formation poses food contamination risks and can subsequently increase the risk of food poisoning. Identification of food-related S. aureus strains will provide additional data on staphylococcal food poisoning involved in biofilm formation. A total of 52 S. aureus strains isolated from sushi and sashimi was investigated to study their ability for biofilm formation using crystal violet staining. The presence of accessory gene regulator (agr) groups and 15 adhesion genes was screened and their associations in biofilm formation were studied. All 52 S. aureus strains showed biofilm production on the tested hydrophobic surface with 44% (23/52) strains classified as strong, 33% (17/52) as moderate, and 23% (12/52) as weak biofilm producers. The frequency of agr-positive strains was 71% (agr group 1 = 21 strains; agr group 2 = 2 strains; agr group 3 = 12 strains; agr group 4 = 2 strains) whereas agr-negative strains were 29% (15/52). Twelve adhesion genes were detected and 98% of the S. aureus strains carried at least one adhesion gene. The ebps was significantly (p < .05) associated with strong biofilm producing strains. In addition, eno, clfA, icaAD, sasG, fnbB, cna, and sasC were significantly higher in the agr-positive group compared to the agr-negative group. The results of this study suggest that the presence of ebps, eno, clfA, icaAD, sasG, fnbB, cna, and sasC may play an important role in enhancing the stage of biofilm-related infections and warrants further investigation.","authors":[{"name":"Suat Moi Puah"},{"name":"Jin Ai Mary Anne Tan"},{"name":"Ching Hoong Chew"},{"name":"Kek Heng Chua"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"adhesion genes"},{"word":"agr"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article392":{"pmid":"30100900","title":"Quantitative Proteomics Analysis of Membrane Proteins in Enterococcus faecalis With Low-Level Linezolid-Resistance.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Despite increasing reports of low-level linezolid-resistant enterococci worldwide, the mechanism of this resistance remains poorly understood. Previous transcriptome studies of low-level linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolates have demonstrated a number of significantly up-regulated genes potentially involved in mediation of drug resistance. However, whether the transcriptome faithfully reflects the proteome remains unknown. In this study, we performed quantitative proteomics analysis of membrane proteins in an E. faecalis isolate (P10748) with low-level linezolid-resistance in comparison with two linezolid-susceptible strains 3138 and ATCC 29212, all of which have been previously investigated by whole transcriptome analysis. A total of 8,197 peptides associated with 1,170 proteins were identified in all three isolates with false discovery rate (FDR) at 1% and P < 0.05. There were 14 significantly up-regulated and 6 significantly down-regulated proteins in strain P10748 compared to strains 3138 and ATCC 29212, which were in general positively correlated with transcription levels revealed in previous transcriptome studies. Our analysis suggests that the low-level linezolid-resistance in E. faecalis is conferred primarily by the ATP-binding cassette protein OptrA through ribosomal protection and, possibly, also by the enterococcal surface protein (Esp) and other proteins through biofilm formation. The genetic transfer of optrA is potentially regulated by the surface exclusion protein Sea1, conjugal transfer protein TraB, replication protein RepA and XRE family transcription regulator protein. This report represents the first investigation of the mechanisms of linezolid-resistance in E. faecalis by a quantitative proteomics approach.","authors":[{"name":"Jia Yan"},{"name":"Yun Xia"},{"name":"Mi Yang"},{"name":"Jiaqi Zou"},{"name":"Yingzhu Chen"},{"name":"Dawei Zhang"},{"name":"Liang Ma"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"linezolid"},{"word":"low-level resistance"},{"word":"membrane proteins"},{"word":"quantitative proteomics"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"30100762","title":"Ex vivo decontamination of yeast-colonized dentures by iodine-thiocyanate complexes.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Under well-defined experimental conditions, and in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, lactoperoxidase produces stable iodine-thiocyanate complexes that have antimicrobial properties.

Quorum sensing (QS) widely exists in bacteria to monitor their population densities and regulate numerous physiological activities, such as the secretion of siderophores, swarming motility and biofilm formation. Thus, searching for quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) may be another promising way to control the deterioration of food caused by P. fluorescens. Here, we screened a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database to discover potential QSIs with lesser toxicity. The gene sequences of LuxI- and LuxR-type proteins of P. fluorescens P07 were obtained through whole-genome sequencing. In addition, the protein structures built by homology modelling were used as targets to screen for QSIs. Twenty-one compounds with a dock score greater than 6 were purchased and tested by biosensor strains (Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136). The results showed that 10 of the compounds were determined as hits (hit rate: 66.67%). Benzyl alcohol, rhodinyl formate and houttuynine were effective QSIs. The impact of the most active compound (benzyl alcohol) on the phenotypes of P. fluorescens P07, including swimming and swarming motility, production of extracellular enzymes and siderophores, N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHLs) content and biofilm formation were determined. The inhibitory mechanism of benzyl alcohol on the QS system of P. fluorescens P07 is further discussed.

Furthermore, peracetic acid increased its efficacy against S. aureus biofilms by the combined application with these EOs.
