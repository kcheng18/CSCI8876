The main objective of the present study was to investigate the antifungal effects and underlying mechanisms of HMH when combined with azoles to determine whether such combinations act in a synergistic manner. As a result, we found that HMH exhibits synergistic antifungal effects in combination with azoles against resistant Candida albicans (C. albicans) planktonic cells, as well as resistant C. albicans biofilm in the early stage. Antifungal potential of HMH with fluconazole was also explored in vivo using an invertebrate model. Our results suggest that HMH combined with azoles is synergistic against resistant C. albicans in vitro and in vivo. No synergy is seen with azole sensitive C. albicans strains nor with other Candida species. Such synergistic mechanisms on resistance C. albicans are involved in increasing intracellular azoles, inhibiting hyphal growth, disturbing cytosolic calcium concentration, and inducing apoptosis of resistant C. albicans cells.","authors":[{"name":"Xiuyun Li"},{"name":"Xuexin Wu"},{"name":"Yan Gao"},{"name":"Lina Hao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Galleria mellonella"},{"word":"azoles"},{"word":"harmine hydrochloride"},{"word":"resistant Candida albicans"},{"word":"synergistic mechanism"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"31749666","title":"Quantitative analysis of Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis proteome in response to antibiotics and during exposure to different environmental conditions.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (MAH) belongs to the clinically important non-tuberculous mycobacterial group that infects immunocompromised patients and individuals with underling lung conditions. The need for prolonged therapy is a major challenge of MAH treatment, influencing the development of persistent and drug-resistant infections. The reason why bactericidal drugs take several months to eliminate MAH is unknown. To investigate MAH proteome remodeling under aerobic, anaerobic and biofilm conditions (as it is encountered in patient lungs) and identify metabolic changes potentially associated with bacterial persistent state, we performed the relative protein quantitative analysis using Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry sequencing. MAH was exposed to amikacin (4 μg/ml) and clarithromycin (16 μg/ml) under aerobic, anaerobic or biofilm condition for 24 h and the response was compared with bacterial proteomics of the corresponding conditions. Overall, 4000 proteins were identified out of 5313 MAH proteome of across all experimental groups. Numerous sets of de novo synthesized proteins belonging to metabolic pathways not evidenced in aerobic condition were found commonly enriched in both anaerobic and biofilm conditions, including pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and chloroalkene degradation, known to be associated with bacterial tolerance in M. tuberculosis. The common pathways observed in anaerobic and biofilm conditions following drug treatments were peptidoglycan biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism and protein export. The LprB lipoprotein, highly synthesized in MAH biofilms during drug treatments and shown to be essential for M. tuberculosis virulence and survival in vivo, was selected and overexpressed in MAH. Results demonstrate that LprB is secreted in MAH biofilms and the overexpression clone is more tolerant to antimicrobials than the wild-type strain. Our study identified promising metabolic pathways that can be targeted to prevent the bacterial tolerance mechanism and, subsequently, reduce the length of MAH therapy.","authors":[{"name":"Rajoana Rojony"},{"name":"Matthew Martin"},{"name":"Anaamika Campeau"},{"name":"Jacob M Wozniak"},{"name":"David J Gonzalez"},{"name":"Pankaj Jaiswal"},{"name":"L Danelishvili"},{"name":"Luiz E Bermudez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Amikacin"},{"word":"Anaerobic condition"},{"word":"Antibiotic susceptibility"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Clarithromycin"},{"word":"M. avium proteomics"},{"word":"Macrophage"},{"word":"Tolerance"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"31749041","title":"Viability and collagen secretion by fibroblasts on titanium surfaces with different acid-etching protocols.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"From the consolidation of surface treatments of dental implants and knowledge on the cellular mechanisms of osseointegration, studies have highlighted the importance of a connective tissue seal against the implant to prevent contamination from the oral environment and consequent biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Vilton Zimmermann de Souza"},{"name":"Rafael Manfro"},{"name":"Júlio César Joly"},{"name":"Carlos Nelson Elias"},{"name":"Daiane Cristina Peruzzo"},{"name":"Marcelo Henrique Napimoga"},{"name":"Elizabeth Ferreira Martinez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Connective tissue"},{"word":"Dental implant"},{"word":"Surface treatment"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"31748868","title":"Peculiarities of Biofilms Formation by Campylobacter Bacteria in Mixed Populations with Other Microbial Contaminants of Food Products.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Peculiarities of biofilms formation by Campylobacter bacteria in mixed populations with other microbial contaminants was studied by real-time impedance spectroscopy on an automated xCelligence real time cell analyzer (RTCA).

While current therapies against bacteria often employ antibiotics, most bacterial pathogens can form biofilms and prevent effective treatment of infections. Biofilm cells can aggregate and encased themselves in a self-secreted protective exopolymeric matrix, to reduce the penetration by antibiotics. Biofilm formation is mediated by c-di-GMP signaling, the ubiquitous secondary messenger in bacteria. Synthesis of c-di-GMP by diguanylate cyclases leads to biofilm formation via the loss of motility, increased surface attachment, and production of biofilm matrix, whereas c-di-GMP degradation by phosphodiesterases causes biofilm dispersal to new sites via increased bacterial motility and matrix breakdown. The highly variable nature of biofilm development and antimicrobial tolerance imposes tremendous challenges in conventional antimicrobial therapies, indicating an imperative need to develop anti-biofilm drugs against biofilm infections. In this review, we focus on two main emergent approaches-active dispersal and disruption. While both approaches aim to demolish biofilms, we will discuss their fundamental differences and associated methods. Active dispersal of biofilms involves signaling the bacterial cells to leave the biofilm, where resident cells ditch their sessile lifestyle, gain motility and self-degrade their matrix. Biofilm disruption leads to direct matrix degradation that forcibly releases embedded biofilm cells. Without the protection of biofilm matrix, released bacterial cells are highly exposed to antimicrobials, leading to their eradication in biofilm infections. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches will allow optimized utility with antimicrobials in clinical settings.","authors":[{"name":"Miao Yu"},{"name":"Song Lin Chua"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial treatment"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chronic infections"},{"word":"dispersal"},{"word":"disruption"}]},"article8":{"pmid":"31746024","title":"Quinine Improves the Fungicidal Effects of Antimicrobial Blue Light: Implications for the Treatment of Cutaneous Candidiasis.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen of clinical importance and is the primary cause of fungal-associated wound infections, sepsis, or pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals.

We found that compared to Escherichia coli Crp, C helix amino acid substitutions in Y. pestis Crp did not impact the cAMP dependency of Crp to bind DNA promoters. To investigate Y. pestis Crp-regulated genes during plague pneumonia, we performed RNA sequencing on both wild-type and Δcrp mutant bacteria growing in planktonic and biofilm states in minimal media with glucose or glycerol. Y. pestis Crp was found to dramatically alter expression of hundreds of genes in a manner dependent upon carbon source and growth state. Gel shift assays confirmed direct regulation of the malT and ptsG promoters, and Crp was then linked to Y. pestis growth on maltose as a sole carbon source. Iron regulation genes ybtA and fyuA were found to be indirectly regulated by Crp. A new connection between carbon source and quorum sensing was revealed as Crp was found to regulate production of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) through direct and indirect regulation of genes for AHL synthetases and receptors. AHLs were subsequently identified in the lungs of Y. pestis-infected mice when crp expression was highest in Y. pestis biofilms. Thus, in addition to the well-studied pla gene, other Crp-regulated genes likely have important functions during plague infection.","authors":[{"name":"Jeremy T Ritzert"},{"name":"George Minasov"},{"name":"Ryan Embry"},{"name":"Matthew J Schipma"},{"name":"Karla J F Satchell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Crp"},{"word":"RNA-seq"},{"word":"Yersinia pestis"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"catabolite repression"},{"word":"cyclic AMP"},{"word":"plague"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"regulation of gene expression"},{"word":"structure"},{"word":"three-dimensional structure"}]},"article10":{"pmid":"31744920","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa Leucine Aminopeptidase Influences Early Biofilm Composition and Structure via Vesicle-Associated Antibiofilm Activity.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, known as one of the leading causes of disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, secretes a variety of proteases. These enzymes contribute significantly to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and biofilm formation in the chronic colonization of CF patient lungs, as well as playing a role in infections of the cornea, burn wounds, and chronic wounds. We previously characterized a secreted P. aeruginosa peptidase, PaAP, that is highly expressed in chronic CF isolates. This leucine aminopeptidase is highly expressed during infection and in biofilms, and it associates with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), structures known to contribute to virulence mechanisms in a variety of Gram-negative species and one of the major components of the biofilm matrix. We hypothesized that PaAP may play a role in P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Using a lung epithelial cell/bacterial biofilm coculture model, we show that PaAP deletion in a clinical P. aeruginosa background alters biofilm microcolony composition to increase cellular density, while decreasing matrix polysaccharide content, and that OMVs from PaAP-expressing strains but not PaAP alone or in combination with PaAP deletion strain-derived OMVs could complement this phenotype. We additionally found that OMVs from PaAP-expressing strains could cause protease-mediated biofilm detachment, leading to changes in matrix and colony composition. Finally, we showed that the OMVs could also mediate the detachment of biofilms formed by both nonself P. aeruginosa strains and Klebsiella pneumoniae, another respiratory pathogen. Our findings represent novel roles for OMVs and the aminopeptidase in the modulation of P. aeruginosa biofilm architecture.","authors":[{"name":"Caitlin N Esoda"},{"name":"Meta J

Similarly, extracellular protease production was increased in a LAC msa mutant but not a UAMS-1 msa mutant. This difference was reflected in the accumulation and distribution of secreted virulence factors and in the impact of extracellular proteases on biofilm formation in a LAC msa mutant. Most importantly, it was reflected in the relative impact of mutating msa as assessed in a murine osteomyelitis model, which had a significant impact in LAC but not in UAMS-1. In contrast, mutation of sarA had a greater impact on all of these in vitro and in vivo phenotypes than mutation of msaABCR, and it did so in both LAC and UAMS-1.

Here, we present comparative structural and sequence analysis of various PilZ-related domains and describe three principal types of them: (i) the canonical PilZ domain, whose structure includes a six-stranded beta-barrel and a C-terminal alpha helix, (ii) an atypical PilZ domain that contains two extra alpha helices and forms stable tetramers, and (iii) divergent PilZ-related domains, which include the eponymous PilZ protein and PilZN (YcgR_N) and PilZNR (YcgR_2) domains.

These serve as scaffolding for controlled drug release and prevent bacterial infections. Films of polylactic acid (PLA) polymers that are Mg-reinforced have demonstrated they have suitable properties and bioactive behavior for promoting the osseointegration process. However little attention has been paid to studying whether the degradation process can alter the adhesive physical properties of the biodegradable film and whether this can modify the biofilm formation capacity of pathogens. Moreover, considering that the concentration of Mg and other corrosion products may not be constant during the degradation process, the question that arises is whether these changes can have negative consequences in terms of the bacterial colonization of surfaces. Bacteria are able to react differently to the same compound, depending on its concentration in the medium and can even become stronger when threatened. In this context, physical surface parameters such as hydrophobicity, surface tension and zeta potential of PLA films reinforced with 10% Mg have been determined before and after degradation, as well as the biofilm formation capacity of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The addition of Mg to the films makes them less hydrophobic and the degradation also reduces the hydrophobicity and increases the negative charge of the surface, especially over long periods of time. Early biofilm formation at 8 h is consistent with the physical properties of the films, where we can observe a reduction in the bacterial biofilm formation. However, after 24 h of incubation, the biofilm formation increases significantly on the PLA/Mg films with respect to PLA control. The explosive release of Mg ions and other corrosion products within the first hours were not enough to prevent a greater biofilm formation after this initial time. Consequently, the Mg addition to the polymer matrix had a bacteriostatic effect but not a bactericidal one. Future works should aim to optimize the design and biofunctionality of these promising bioabsorbable composites for a degradation period suitable for the intended application.","authors":[{"name":"M Coronada Fernández-Calderón"},{"name":"Daniel Romero-Guzmán"},{"name":"Ana Ferrández-Montero"},{"name":"Ciro Pérez-Giraldo"},{"name":"Jose L González-Carrasco"},{"name":"Marcela Lieblich"},{"name":"Rosario Benavente"},{"name":"Begoña Ferrari"},{"name":"M Luisa González-Martín"},{"name":"Amparo M Gallardo-Moreno"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Hydrophobicity"},{"word":"Magnesium"},{"word":"Polylactic acid"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"zeta potential"}]},"article28":{"pmid":"31740248","title":"α-Haloacetophenone and analogues as potential antibacterial agents and nematicides.","date":"2020-01-03","abs":"A series of α-haloacetophenones and analogues were synthesized.

Antibacterial activity assay and MIC detection against seven pathogens (Dickeya dadantii Onc5, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25933, Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Serratia marcescens MG1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC31532) demonstrated that S. aureus ATCC25933 and S. marcescens MG1 had the higher sensitivity to M. bracteata EO, while P. aeruginosa PAO1 displayed the strongest resistance to M. bracteata EO.

The challenges associated with biofilm infections have urged researchers to pursue a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the formation and dispersal of biofilms, and this has led to the identification of several steps that could be targeted in order to eradicate these challenging infections. Here we describe mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of biofilm development in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii, and provide examples of chemical compounds that have been developed to specifically inhibit these processes. These compounds include (i) pilicides and curlicides which inhibit the initial steps of biofilm formation by E. coli; (ii) compounds that interfere with c-di-GMP signaling in P. aeruginosa and E. coli; and (iii) compounds that inhibit quorum-sensing in P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.

Multiple subgroups are often detected in individual women, and interactions between these subgroups are expected to influence their population dynamics and associated clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. In the present study, contact-independent and contact-dependent interactions between the four Gardnerella subgroups were investigated in vitro. The cell free supernatants of mono- and co-cultures had no effect on growth rates of the Gardnerella subgroups suggesting that there are no contact-independent interactions (and no contest competition). For contact-dependent interactions, mixed communities of 2, 3, or 4 subgroups were created and the initial (0 h) and final population sizes (48 h) were quantified using subgroup-specific PCR. Compared to the null hypothesis of neutral interactions, most (69.3%) of the mixed communities exhibited competition. Competition reduced the growth rates of subgroups A, B, and C. In contrast, the growth rate of subgroup D increased in the presence of the other subgroups. All subgroups were able to form biofilm alone and in mixed communities.

The meta-functional output from the microbiome results from complex interactions among the different community members with distinct taxonomic identities and metabolic capacities. Particularly, the bacterial communities of the root surface are spatially organized structures composed of root-attached biofilms and planktonic cells arranged in complex layers. With the distinct but coordinated roles among the different member cells, bacterial communities resemble properties of a multicellular organism. High throughput sequencing technologies have allowed rapid and large-scale analysis of taxonomic composition and metabolic capacities of bacterial communities. However, these methods are generally unable to reconstruct the assembly of these communities, or how the gene expression patterns in individual cells/species are coordinated within these communities. Single-cell transcriptomes of community members can identify how gene expression patterns vary among members of the community, including differences among different cells of the same species. This information can be used to classify cells based on functional gene expression patterns, and predict the spatial organization of the community. Here we discuss strategies for the isolation of single bacterial cells, mRNA enrichment, library construction, and analysis and interpretation of the resulting single-cell RNA-Seq datasets.

We found that its genome contains two loci encoding for contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) systems. These systems serve to kill or inhibit the growth of non-sibling bacteria by delivering toxins into the cytoplasm of target cells, thereby conferring the host strain a significant competitive advantage.

We assessed heterogeneity within the confined engineered ecosystem of a shower hose by high-resolution sampling (200 individual biofilm sections per hose) on varying scales (μm to m). We postulated that a biofilm grown on a single material under uniform conditions should be homogeneous in its structure, bacterial numbers, and community composition. A biofilm grown for 12 months under controlled laboratory conditions, showed homogeneity on large-scale. However, some small-scale heterogeneity was clearly observed. For example, biofilm thickness of cm-sections varied up to 4-fold, total cell concentrations (TCC) 3-fold, and relative abundance of dominant taxa up to 5-fold. A biofilm grown under real (i.e., uncontrolled) use conditions developed considerably more heterogeneity in all variables which was attributed to more discontinuity in environmental conditions. Interestingly, biofilm communities from both hoses showed comparably low diversity, with <400 taxa each, and only three taxa accounting for 57%, respectively, 73% of the community. This low diversity was attributed to a strong selective pressure, originating in migrating carbon from the flexible hoses as major carbon source.

Many aspects of cell physiology such as cell motility, predation, and biofilm production can be affected by cell shape. Bacterial cells are three-dimensional (3D) objects, although they are rarely treated as such. Most microscopy techniques result in two-dimensional (2D) images leading to the loss of data pertaining to the actual 3D cell shape and localization of proteins. Certain shape parameters, such as Gaussian curvature (the product of the two principal curvatures), can only be measured in 3D because 2D images do not measure both principal curvatures. Additionally, not all cells lie flat when mounting and 2D imaging of curved cells may not accurately represent the shapes of these cells. Accurately measuring protein localization in 3D can help determine the spatial regulation and function of proteins. A forward convolution technique has been developed that uses the blurring function of the microscope to reconstruct 3D cell shapes and to accurately localize proteins. Here, a protocol for preparing and mounting samples for live cell imaging of bacteria in 3D both to reconstruct an accurate cell shape and to localize proteins is described. The method is based on simple sample preparation, fluorescent image acquisition, and MATLAB-based image processing. Many high-quality fluorescent microscopes can be simply modified to take these measurements. These cell reconstructions are computationally intensive and access to high-throughput computational resources is recommended, although not necessary.

In immunocompromised hosts, this fungal organism can cause mucosal candidiasis in these sites. C. albicans also causes fungemia, a serious consequence of cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is thought to develop from fungal translocation through compromised mucosal barriers. Changes in endogenous bacterial population size or composition as well as changes in the host environment can transform fungal commensals into opportunistic pathogens in the upper and lower GI tract. Pioneering studies from our group have shown that a ubiquitous oral commensal of the mitis streptococcal group (Streptococcus oralis) has a mutualistic relationship with C. albicans, with C. albicans enabling streptococcal biofilm growth at mucosal sites, and S. oralis facilitating invasion of the oral and esophageal mucosa by C. albicans. In these studies, we used a cortisone-induced immunosuppression mouse model. More recently, the development of a novel mouse chemotherapy model has allowed us to examine the interactions of C. albicans with the endogenous bacterial microbiota in the oral and small intestinal mucosa, two sites adversely affected by cytotoxic chemotherapy.

These nutritional symbioses can reciprocally influence the local microenvironments by altering the pH and by detoxifying oxidative compounds. Signal transduction mechanisms include two-component systems, tyrosine phosphorelays, quorum sensing systems, and cyclic nucleotide secondary messengers. Signaling converges on transcriptional programs and can result in synergistic or antagonistic interbacterial interactions that sculpt community development. The sum of all these interactions can be a well-organized polymicrobial community that remains in homeostasis with the host, or a dysbiotic community that provokes pathogenic responses in the host.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel P Miller"},{"name":"Richard J Lamont"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Communication"},{"word":"Communities"},{"word":"Oral bacteria"},{"word":"Regulation"}]},"article58":{"pmid":"31732930","title":"Advances in Oral Mucosal Immunity and the Microbiome.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"The 1st International Conference on Oral Mucosal Immunity and the Microbiome (OMIM) took place at the Avra Imperial Hotel, Chania, Crete, Greece, between 26th and 30th September 2018, under the auspices of the Aegean Conferences.

Among these agents, chitosan and its derivatives have got more attention due to their properties such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-allergenic and non-toxicity. Recent researches have focused on employing chitosan and its derivatives as effective agents to inhibit biofilm formation and attenuate virulence properties by various pathogenic bacteria. Such antibiofilm activity of chitosan and its derivatives can be further enhanced by conjugation with a wide range of bioactive compounds. The present review describes the antibiofilm properties of chitosan and its derivatives against the pathogenic bacteria.

To successfully design these materials, the amount of NO released within a certain duration, the targeted pathogens and the trigger mechanisms upon external stimulation with light, temperature, and chemicals should be taken into consideration. Meanwhile, NO donors like S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) and N-diazeniumdiolates (NONOates) have been widely utilized for developing antimicrobial polymeric agents through polymer-NO donor conjugation or physical encapsulation. In addition, antimicrobial materials with visible light responsive NO donor are also reported as strong and physiological friendly tools for rapid bacterial clearance.

Mortality rates associated with these infections have risen sharply due to the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of C. albicans and other Candida spp., highlighting the urgent need of new antifungal therapies. Rhesus theta (θ) defensin-1 (RTD-1), a natural macrocyclic antimicrobial peptide, was recently shown to be rapidly fungicidal against clinical isolates of MDR C. albicans in vitro. Here we found that RTD-1 was rapidly fungicidal against blastospores of fluconazole/caspofungin resistant C. albicans strains, and was active against established C. albicans biofilms in vitro. In vivo, systemic administration of RTD-1, initiated at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection, promoted long term survival in candidemic mice whether infected with drug-sensitive or MDR strains of C. albicans. RTD-1 induced an early (4 h post treatment) increase in neutrophils in naive and infected mice. In vivo efficacy was associated with fungal clearance, restoration of dysregulated inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17, and homeostatic reduction in numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. Because these effects occurred using peptide doses that produced maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of less than 1% of RTD-1 levels required for in vitro antifungal activity in 50% mouse serum, while inducing a transient neutrophilia, we suggest that RTD-1 mediates its antifungal effects in vivo by host directed mechanisms rather than direct fungicidal activity. Results of this study suggest that θ-defensins represent a new class of host-directed compounds for treatment of disseminated candidiasis.","authors":[{"name":"Virginia Basso"},{"name":"Dat Q Tran"},{"name":"Justin B Schaal"},{"name":"Patti Tran"},{"name":"Yoshihiro Eriguchi"},{"name":"Diana Ngole"},{"name":"Anthony E Cabebe"},{"name":"A Young Park"},{"name":"Paul M Beringer"},{"name":"André J Ouellette"},{"name":"Michael E Selsted"}],"keywords":[]},"article71":{"pmid":"31729188","title":"Calcium transcriptionally regulates movement, recombination and other functions of Xylella fastidiosa under constant flow inside microfluidic chambers.","date":"2020-03-08","abs":"Xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited bacterial pathogen causing devastating diseases in many economically important crops.

A microfluidic chamber with two parallel channels was used, and RNA isolated from cells grown inside the system was analysed by RNA-Seq.

Hence quantifying the molecular diffusion coefficient is important to determine whether there is an influence of biofilm microenvironment on the mobility of molecules. Here, we use single plane illumination microscopy fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (SPIM-FCS) to obtain 3D diffusion coefficient maps with micrometre spatial and millisecond temporal resolution of entire Pseudomonas aeruginosa microcolonies. We probed how molecular properties such as size and charge as well as biofilm properties such as microcolony size and depth influence diffusion of fluorescently labelled dextrans inside biofilms. The 2 MDa dextran showed uneven penetration and a reduction in diffusion coefficient suggesting that the biofilm acts as a molecular sieve. Its diffusion coefficient was negatively correlated with the size of the microcolony. Positively charged dextran molecules and positively charged antibiotic tobramycin preferentially partitioned into the biofilm and remained mobile inside the microcolony, albeit with a reduced diffusion coefficient. Lastly, we measured changes of diffusion upon induction of dispersal and detected an increase in diffusion coefficient inside the biofilm before any loss of biomass. Thus, the change in diffusion is a proxy to detect early stages of dispersal. Our work shows that 3D diffusion maps are very sensitive to physiological changes in biofilms, viz. dispersal. However, this study also shows that diffusion, as mediated by the biofilm matrix, does not account for the high level of antibiotic tolerance associated with biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Jagadish Sankaran"},{"name":"Nicholas J H J Tan"},{"name":"Ka Pui But"},{"name":"Yehuda Cohen"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"},{"name":"Thorsten Wohland"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobials"},{"word":"Bacteriology"},{"word":"Biofilms"}]},"article75":{"pmid":"31728201","title":"Rapid microevolution of biofilm cells in response to antibiotics.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii are increasingly antibiotic resistant, generating a significant public health problem.

However, it is unclear how adaptation to fluctuating environments differs from adaptation to constant environments at the genetic level. For bacteria, one key axis of environmental variation is selection for planktonic or biofilm modes of growth. We conducted an evolution experiment with Burkholderia cenocepacia, comparing the evolutionary dynamics of populations evolving under constant selection for either biofilm formation or planktonic growth with populations in which selection fluctuated between the two environments on a weekly basis. Populations evolved in the fluctuating environment shared many of the same genetic targets of selection as those evolved in constant biofilm selection, but were genetically distinct from the constant planktonic populations. In the fluctuating environment, mutations in the biofilm-regulating genes wspA and rpfR rose to high frequency in all replicate populations. A mutation in wspA first rose rapidly and nearly fixed during the initial biofilm phase but was subsequently displaced by a collection of rpfR mutants upon the shift to the planktonic phase. The wspA and rpfR genotypes coexisted via negative frequency-dependent selection around an equilibrium frequency that shifted between the environments. The maintenance of coexisting genotypes in the fluctuating environment was unexpected. Under temporally fluctuating environments, coexistence of two genotypes is only predicted under a narrow range of conditions, but the frequency-dependent interactions we observed provide a mechanism that can increase the likelihood of coexistence in fluctuating environments.","authors":[{"name":"Caroline B Turner"},{"name":"Sean W Buskirk"},{"name":"Katrina B Harris"},{"name":"Vaughn S Cooper"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adaptation"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"experimental evolution"},{"word":"population ecology"}]},"article81":{"pmid":"31725458","title":"Chronic wound biofilms: diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"To review the diagnosis of chronic wound biofilms and discuss current treatment approaches.","authors":[{"name":"Di Wei"},{"name":"Xiao-Mei Zhu"},{"name":"Yong-Yi Chen"},{"name":"Xu-Ying Li"},{"name":"Yu-Pan Chen"},{"name":"Hua-Yun Liu"},{"name":"Min Zhang"}],"keywords":[]},"article82":{"pmid":"31725203","title":"Combining culture and culture-independent methods reveals new microbial composition of halitosis patients' tongue biofilm.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Oral malodor is a very discomforting condition deriving from the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the expired air.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the topical administration of a photosensitizer in combination with light of an appropriate wavelength and molecular oxygen that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote damage to several vital components of the microorganism. Tagetes species are known as a source of thiophenes, biologically active compounds whose antifungal activity is enhanced by irradiation with UVA. The present investigation evaluated Tagetes minuta extracts as a photosensitizer on growth of Candida and dermatophytes and their effect on Candida virulence factors. T. minuta root hexane and dichloromethane extracts demonstrated high photodynamic antifungal activity. Bioautographic assays and chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of five thiophenes with reported photodynamic antifungal activities under UVA. Analysis of ROS production indicated that both type I and II reactions were involved in the activity of the extracts. In addition, the extracts inhibited virulence factors of Candida, such as adherence to epithelial surfaces and germ tube formation and showed efficacy against different Candida morphologies: budding cells, cells with germ tube and biofilms.

The addition of the trisaccharide β-Gal-(1,3)-α-GalNAc-(1,3)-β-GalNAc to membrane exported proteins in Burkholderia cenocepacia is required for bacterial fitness and resistance to environmental stress. However, the underlying causes of the defects observed in the absence of glycosylation are unclear. Using proteomics, luciferase reporter assays, and DNA cross-linking, we demonstrate the loss of glycosylation leads to changes in transcriptional regulation of multiple proteins, including the repression of the master quorum CepR/I. These proteomic and transcriptional alterations lead to the abolition of biofilm formation and defects in siderophore activity. Surprisingly, the abundance of most of the known glycosylated proteins did not significantly change in the glycosylation-defective mutants, except for BCAL1086 and BCAL2974, which were found in reduced amounts, suggesting they could be degraded. However, the loss of these two proteins was not responsible for driving the proteomic alterations, biofilm formation, or siderophore activity. Together, our results show that loss of glycosylation in B. cenocepacia results in a global cell reprogramming via alteration of the transcriptional regulatory systems, which cannot be explained by the abundance changes in known B. cenocepacia glycoproteins.","authors":[{"name":"Cameron C Oppy"},{"name":"Leila Jebeli"},{"name":"Miku Kuba"},{"name":"Clare V Oates"},{"name":"Richard Strugnell"},{"name":"Laura E Edgington-Mitchell"},{"name":"Miguel A Valvano"},{"name":"Elizabeth L Hartland"},{"name":"Hayley J Newton"},{"name":"Nichollas E Scott"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia cenocepacia"},{"word":"CepR"},{"word":"DNA binding"},{"word":"glycoproteins"},{"word":"glycosylation"},{"word":"pathogenesis"},{"word":"posttranslational modifications"},{"word":"protein modification"},{"word":"proteomics"}]},"article86":{"pmid":"31722981","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor signaling suppresses αvβ6 integrin and promotes periodontal inflammation and bone loss.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"In periodontal disease (PD), bacterial biofilms cause gingival inflammation, leading to bone loss.

Furthermore, biofilm induced the expression of endogenous EGFR ligands that suppressed ITGB6 and stimulated IL1B expression, indicating that the effects of the biofilm were mediated by autocrine EGFR signaling. Biofilm and EGFR ligands induced inhibitory phosphorylation of the TGF-β1 signaling mediator Smad3 at S208. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective mutant of Smad3 (S208A) reduced the β6 integrin suppression.

These infections are often associated with the formation of biofilms on the medical implants that are difficult to treat because of their resistance to the classical antifungal drugs. The most common fungi isolated from catheters and other medical devices are Candida species. The Candida genus contains multiple species of which C. albicans and C. glabrata are the two most common pathogenic yeasts in humans. A limited number of animal models is available for investigating host-pathogen interactions and testing novel antifungal drugs in vivo against these species. Fungal load in biofilms in these models is traditionally analyzed postmortem, requiring host sacrifice and enumeration of microorganisms from individual biofilms in order to evaluate the amount of colony forming units and the efficacy of antifungal treatment. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) made compatible with small animal models for in vivo biofilm formation is a valuable tool to follow biofilm development and its treatment longitudinally. Due to the noninvasive nature of BLI, the imaging procedure can be repeated in the same animal, allowing for follow-up of the biofilm growth in vivo without removing the implanted device or detaching the biofilm from its substrate. Although detecting a quantifiable in vivo BLI signal from biofilms formed on the inside of implanted catheters is challenging, BLI proved to be a practical tool in the study of fungal biofilms. This method describes the use of BLI for in vitro and in vivo follow-up of device-related fungal biofilm formation in mice and rats and antifungal activity testing against both C. albicans and C. glabrata device-associated biofilms.

Here, we explored how the prrH locus sRNA influences P. aeruginosa virulence in the context of the QS regulatory network. First, gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that PrrH affects pyocyanin, elastase and rhamnolipid production; biofilm formation; and swimming and swarming motility and impaired the viability of P. aeruginosa in human whole blood. Next, our investigation disclosed that LasI and PhzC/D were directly repressed by PrrH. In addition, RhlI, the key member of the rhl QS system, diminished the expression of PrrH and enhanced the expression of downstream genes. Bioinformatics analysis found two binding sites of RhlR, the transcription factor of the rhl system, on the promoter region of prrH. Further β-galactosidase reporter and qPCR assays confirmed that PrrH was transcriptionally repressed by RhlR. Collectively, our data identified a novel RhlI/R-PrrH-LasI/PhzC/PhzD regulatory circuitry that may contribute to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.

Biofilms are comprised of surface-attached bacteria embedded in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, which confers increased antibiotic resistance and host immune evasion. Therefore, disruption of this matrix is essential to tackle the biofilm-embedded bacteria. Here, we propose a novel nanotechnology to do this, based on protease-functionalized nanogel carriers of antibiotics. Such active antibiotic nanocarriers, surface coated with the protease Alcalase 2.4 L FG, digest their way through the biofilm EPS matrix, reach the buried bacteria, and deliver a high dose of antibiotic directly on their cell walls, which overwhelms their defenses. We demonstrated their effectiveness against six wound biofilm-forming bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. We confirmed a 6-fold decrease in the biofilm mass and a substantial reduction in bacterial cell density using fluorescence, atomic force, and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we showed that co-treatments of ciprofloxacin and Alcalase-coated Carbopol nanogels led to a 3-log reduction in viable biofilm-forming cells when compared to ciprofloxacin treatments alone. Encapsulating an equivalent concentration of ciprofloxacin into the Alcalase-coated nanogel particles boosted their antibacterial effect much further, reducing the bacterial cell viability to below detectable amounts after 6 h of treatment. The Alcalase-coated nanogel particles were noncytotoxic to human adult keratinocyte cells (HaCaT), inducing a very low apoptotic response in these cells. Overall, we demonstrated that the Alcalase-coated nanogels loaded with a cationic antibiotic elicit very strong biofilm-clearing effects against wound-associated biofilm-forming pathogenic bacteria. This nanotechnology approach has the potential to become a very powerful treatment of chronically infected wounds with biofilm-forming bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Paul J Weldrick"},{"name":"Matthew J Hardman"},{"name":"Vesselin N Paunov"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alcalase 2.4 L FG"},{"word":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"ciprofloxacin"},{"word":"nanogels"},{"word":"protease"}]},"article109":{"pmid":"31718037","title":"In Vitro and In Vivo Anti-Candida spp. Activity of Plant-Derived Products.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Candidiasis therapy, especially for candidiasis caused by Candida non-albicans species, is limited by the relatively reduced number of antifungal drugs and the emergence of antifungal tolerance.

However, amyloid also occurs in the extracellular matrix of bacterial biofilm, which protects bacteria from environmental stress and antibiotics. Many Pseudomonas strains produce functional amyloid where the main component is the highly fibrillation-prone protein FapC. FapC fibrillation may be inhibited by small molecules such as plant polyphenols, which are already known to inhibit formation of pathogenic amyloid, but the mechanism and biological impact of inhibition is unclear. Here, we elucidate how polyphenols modify the self-assembly of functional amyloid, with particular focus on epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), penta-O-galloyl-β-d-glucose (PGG), baicalein, oleuropein, and procyanidin B2. We find EGCG and PGG to be the best inhibitors. These compounds inhibit amyloid formation by redirecting the aggregation of FapC monomers into oligomeric species, which according to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements organize into core-shell complexes of short axis diameters 25-26 nm consisting of ~7 monomers. Using peptide arrays, we identify EGCG-binding sites in FapC's linker regions, C and N-terminal parts, and high amyloidogenic sequences located in the R2 and R3 repeats. We correlate our biophysical observations to biological impact by demonstrating that the extent of amyloid inhibition by the different inhibitors correlated with their ability to reduce biofilm, highlighting the potential of anti-amyloid polyphenols as therapeutic agents against biofilm infections.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Najarzadeh"},{"name":"Hossein Mohammad-Beigi"},{"name":"Jannik Nedergaard Pedersen"},{"name":"Gunna Christiansen"},{"name":"Thorbjørn Vincent Sønderby"},{"name":"Seyed Abbas Shojaosadati"},{"name":"Dina Morshedi"},{"name":"Kristian Strømgaard"},{"name":"Georg Meisl"},{"name":"Duncan Sutherland"},{"name":"Jan Skov Pedersen"},{"name":"Daniel E Otzen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FapC protein"},{"word":"aggregation inhibitor"},{"word":"bacterial amyloid"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"peptide array"}]},"article111":{"pmid":"31717766","title":"Chemical Composition and Antimicrobial Effectiveness of Ocimum gratissimum L.

The antibacterial action of EOOG was determined by disk diffusion, microdilution (MIC/MBC), growth curve under sub-MIC exposure, and the combinatorial activity with ciprofloxacin (CIP) and oxacillin (OXA) were determined by checkerboard assay. The EOOG antibiofilm action was performed against the established biofilm and analyzed by crystal violet, colony-forming unit count, and SEM analyses. EOOG yielded 1.66% w/w, with eugenol as the major component (74.83%). The MIC was 1000 µg/mL for the most tested strains. The growth curve showed a lag phase delay for both species, mainly S. aureus, and reduced the growth level of E. coli by half.

For this reason, treatment of TJR-associated infections and related complications remains a significant concern. The objective of this study was to develop a polymer-controlled dual antibiotic-releasing bone void filler (ABVF) with an underlying osseointegrating substrate to treat TJR implant-associated biofilm infections. An ABVF putty was designed to provide sustained vancomycin and rifampicin antibiotic release for 6 weeks while concurrently providing an osseointegrating support for regrowth of lost bone. The reported ABVF showed efficient antibacterial and antibiofilm activity both in vitro and in a rat infection model where the ABVF both showed complete bacterial elimination and supported bone growth. Furthermore, in an in vivo k-wire-based biofilm infection model, the ABVF putty was also able to eliminate the biofilm infection while supporting osseointegration. The retrieved k-wire implants were also free from biofilm and bacterial burden. The ABVF putty delivering combination antibiotics demonstrated that it can be a viable treatment option for implant-related osteomyelitis and may lead to retention of the hardware while enabling single-stage surgery.","authors":[{"name":"Raquib Hasan"},{"name":"Kambri Schaner"},{"name":"Meredith Schroeder"},{"name":"Abbey Wohlers"},{"name":"Jacob Shreffler"},{"name":"Codi Schaper"},{"name":"Hariharaputhiran Subramanian"},{"name":"Amanda Brooks"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"bone void filler"},{"word":"combination antibiotic delivery"},{"word":"drug release"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"osteomyelitis"},{"word":"rifampicin"},{"word":"total joint replacement"},{"word":"vancomycin"}]},"article114":{"pmid":"31717364","title":"Plant-Derived Inhibitors of AHL-Mediated Quorum Sensing in Bacteria: Modes of Action.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Numerous gram-negative phytopathogenic and zoopathogenic bacteria utilise acylated homoserine lactone (AHL) in communication systems, referred to as quorum sensing (QS), for induction of virulence factors and biofilm development.

When assembled into amyloid, FuBA is unusually robust and withstands most chemicals including denaturants and SDS. Uses include strengthening of bacterial biofilms, cell-to-cell communication, cell wall construction and even bacterial warfare. Biogenesis is under tight spatio-temporal control, thanks to a simple but efficient secretion system which in E. coli, Pseudomonas and other well-studied bacteria includes a major amyloid component that is kept unfolded in the periplasm thanks to chaperones, threaded through the outer membrane via a pore protein and anchored to the cell surface through a nucleator and possibly other helper proteins. In these systems, amyloid formation is promoted through imperfect repeats, but other evolutionarily unrelated proteins either have no or only partially conserved repeats or simply consist of small peptides with multiple structural roles.

In turn, insertional inactivation of cdrA enabled pslG-induced dispersion. Lowering of the intracellular c-di-GMP level via induction of PA2133 encoding a phosphodiesterase was not sufficient to induce dispersion by wild-type strains and strains overexpressing pslG, indicating that pslG-induced dispersion is independent of c-di-GMP modulation and, likely, LapG.","authors":[{"name":"Kathryn E Cherny"},{"name":"Karin Sauer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CdrA"},{"word":"PelA"},{"word":"PslG"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dispersion"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"glycoside hydrolase"},{"word":"matrix"},{"word":"untethering"}]},"article128":{"pmid":"31712267","title":"Clearance of Staphylococcus aureus from In Vivo Models of Chronic Infection by Immunization Requires Both Planktonic and Biofilm Antigens.","date":"2020-01-22","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a causative agent of chronic biofilm-associated infections that are recalcitrant to resolution by the immune system or antibiotics.

At low cell densities, when QS autoinducers are absent, V. cholerae forms biofilms. At high cell densities, when autoinducers have accumulated, biofilm formation is repressed, and dispersal occurs. Here, we focus on the roles of two well-characterized QS autoinducers that function in parallel. One autoinducer, called cholerae autoinducer-1 (CAI-1), is used to measure Vibrio abundance, and the other autoinducer, called autoinducer-2 (AI-2), is widely produced by different bacterial species and presumed to enable V. cholerae to assess the total bacterial cell density of the vicinal community. The two V. cholerae autoinducers funnel information into a shared signal relay pathway. This feature of the QS system architecture has made it difficult to understand how specific information can be extracted from each autoinducer, how the autoinducers might drive distinct output behaviors, and, in turn, how the bacteria use QS to distinguish kin from nonkin in bacterial communities. We develop a live-cell biofilm formation and dispersal assay that allows examination of the individual and combined roles of the two autoinducers in controlling V. cholerae behavior. We show that the QS system works as a coincidence detector in which both autoinducers must be present simultaneously for repression of biofilm formation to occur. Within that context, the CAI-1 QS pathway is activated when only a few V. cholerae cells are present, whereas the AI-2 pathway is activated only at much higher cell density. The consequence of this asymmetry is that exogenous sources of AI-2, but not CAI-1, contribute to satisfying the coincidence detector to repress biofilm formation and promote dispersal. We propose that V. cholerae uses CAI-1 to verify that some of its kin are present before committing to the high-cell-density QS mode, but it is, in fact, the broadly made autoinducer AI-2 that sets the pace of the V. cholerae QS program. This first report of unique roles for the different V. cholerae autoinducers suggests that detection of kin fosters a distinct outcome from detection of nonkin.","authors":[{"name":"Andrew A Bridges"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"}],"keywords":[]},"article137":{"pmid":"31710252","title":"Effects of surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) eluate on Candida spp.: antifungal activity, anti-biofilm properties, and protective effects on Galleria mellonella against C. albicans infection.","date":"2020-03-11","abs":"Surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) is a bioactive filler produced by PRG technology, which is applied to various dental materials.

For this, the genome sequencing and phenotypical tests were performed. The draft genome annotation revealed several complete pathways associated with carbon metabolism and a mucin-desulfating sulfatase which may contribute to intestine colonization, and a large number of virulence-associated genes encoding structures associated with adhesion, toxins, and secretion systems. The strain exhibited swimming and swarming motility, biofilm formation, and hemolytic activity. It was resistant to ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Although a cphA gene encoding a narrow-spectrum carbapenase was identified in the strain genome, no carbapenemase activity was detected in the antimicrobial susceptibility test.

Desert strains showed more diversity at the genetic level and were able to utilise more carbon sources than riverbank strains which were highly genetically conserved. Biofilm morphologies of desert and riverbank strains generally segregated and both groups formed different morphology clusters despite the astonishing diversity observed among riverbank strains.

More attention is required to address this global health issue owing to the increase in air pollution. Implantation of a silicone stent is the preferred treatment for epiphora; however, introducing a silicone stent into a narrow duct with complex geometry is challenging as it requires guidance by a sharp metal needle. Additionally, silicone can cause adverse reactions such as biofilm formation and tear flow resistance due to its extreme hydrophobicity. To overcome these problems, in this study we developed a new type of biocompatible shape memory polymer (SMP) stent with elasticity capacity for self-expansion. First, SMPs in the form of x%poly(ε-caprolactone)-co-y%poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (x%PCL-y%PGMA) were synthesized via ring opening polymerization by varying the molar ratio of PCL (x%) and PGMA (y%). Second, the shape memory and mechanical properties were tuned by controlling the crosslinking degree and concentration of x%PCL-y%PGMA solution to produce a test type of SMP stent. Lastly, this 94%PCL-06%PGMA stent exhibited more standout critical functions in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments such as a cell growth-supporting level of biocompatibility with nasal epithelial cells without significant inflammatory responses, better resistance to biofilm formation, and more efficient capacity to drain tear than the silicone control. Overall, 94%PCL-06%PGMA can be suggested as a superior alternative to the currently used materials for nasolacrimal stents. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Silicone intubation (stenting) has been widely used to treat nasolacrimal duct obstruction, however, it can cause adverse clinical effects such as bacterial infection; presents procedural challenges because of the curved nasolacrimal duct structure; and shows poor drainage efficiency stemming from the highly hydrophobic nature of silicone. In this work, we describe an innovative shape memory polymer (SMP) as a superior alternative to conventional silicone-based materials for nasolacrimal duct intubation. We demonstrate the clear advantages of the SMP over conventional silicone, including a much higher drainage capacity and superior resistance to bacterial infection.","authors":[{"name":"Ju Young Park"},{"name":"Jung Bok Lee"},{"name":"Woo Beom Shin"},{"name":"Mi-Lan Kang"},{"name":"Yong Cheol Shin"},{"name":"Deok Hyeon Son"},{"name":"Se Won Yi"},{"name":"Jeong-Kee Yoon"},{"name":"Ji Young Kim"},{"name":"JaeSang Ko"},{"name":"Chang-Soo Kim"},{"name":"Jin Sook Yoon"},{"name":"Hak-Joon Sung"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Epiphora"},{"word":"Nasolacrimal stent"},{"word":"Shape memory polymer"},{"word":"Silicone"}]},"article161":{"pmid":"31707076","title":"Strategies for improving the electroactivity and specific metabolic functionality of microorganisms for various microbial electrochemical technologies.","date":"2020-03-03","abs":"Electroactive microorganisms, which possess extracellular electron transfer (EET) capabilities, are the basis of microbial electrochemical technologies (METs) such as microbial fuel and electrolysis cells.

Various aspects related to the microorganisms, electrodes, separators, reactor design, and operational or process parameters influence the overall functioning of METs. The most fundamental and critical performance-determining factor is, however, the microorganism-electrode interactions. Modification of the electrode surfaces and microorganisms for optimizing their interactions has therefore been the major MET research focus area over the last decade. In the case of microorganisms, primarily their EET mechanisms and efficiencies along with the biofilm formation capabilities, collectively considered as microbial electroactivity, affect their interactions with the electrodes.

In this work, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were extracted separately from anammox granules and then characterized by multi-methods. The adhesion properties of anammox consortia to biotic and abiotic surfaces were examined separately before and after the extraction of three stratified EPS, using aggregation assays and a quartz crystal microbalance technique with dissipation monitoring, respectively. The extraction of each of the three stratified EPS gradually increased the initial aggregation of anammox consortia from 77.6 ± 3.0% to 85.2 ± 2.6%. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry confirmed that the aggregation of anammox consortia depended largely on the interactions between functional groups on the cell surfaces. All three stratified EPS had positive effects on the initial adhesion rate and mass of anammox consortia to abiotic surfaces. More importantly, the structure of the adhered layer was more compact before the extraction of each of the three stratified EPS. We therefore hypothesized that the initial adhesion among anammox consortia was due to the ability of the anammox bacteria to express adhesion molecules on the bacterial surfaces and that the three stratified EPS were excreted to adhere inert particulates and form a compact biofilm structure. This study clarifies the role of stratified EPS on the initial formation of anammox biofilms and provides a theoretical basis for accelerating the formation of anammox biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Weigang Wang"},{"name":"Yuan Yan"},{"name":"Yuhao Zhao"},{"name":"Qin Shi"},{"name":"Yayi Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anammox"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)"},{"word":"Nitrogen removal"},{"word":"Structure"}]},"article166":{"pmid":"31706123","title":"Feasibility of isolated novel facultative quorum quenching consortiums for fouling control in an AnMBR.","date":"2019-12-31","abs":"Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) technology is being recognized as an appealing strategy for wastewater treatment, however, severity of membrane fouling inhibits its widespread implementations. This study engineered novel facultative quorum quenching consortiums (FQQs) coping with membrane fouling in AnMBRs with preliminary analysis for their quorum quenching (QQ) performances. Herein, Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-based quorum sensing (QS) in a lab-scale AnMBR initially revealed that N-Hexanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N-Octanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL) and N-Decanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C10-HSL) were the dominant AHLs in AnMBRs in this study. Three FQQs, namely, FQQ-C6, FQQ-C8 and FQQ-C10, were harvested after anaerobic screening of aerobic QQ consortiums (AeQQs) which were isolated by enrichment culture, aiming to degrade C6-HSL, C8-HSL and C10-HSL, respectively. Growth of FQQ-C6 and FQQ-C10 using AHLs as carbon source under anaerobic condition was significantly faster than those using acetate, congruously suggesting that their QQ performance will not be compromised in AnMBRs. All FQQs degraded a wide range of AHLs pinpointing their extensive QQ ability. FQQ-C6, FQQ-C8 and FQQ-C10 remarkably alleviated extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production in a lab-scale AnMBR by 72.46%, 35.89% and 65.88%, respectively, and FQQ-C6 retarded membrane fouling of the AnMBR by 2 times. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that there was a major shift in dominant species from AeQQs to FQQs where Comamonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Stenotrophomonas sp. and Ochrobactrum sp. survived after anaerobic screening and were the majority in FQQs. High growth rate utilizing AHLs under anaerobic condition and enormous EPS retardation efficiency in FQQ-C6 and FQQ-C10 could be attributed to Comamonas sp.. These findings demonstrated that FQQs could be leveraged for QQ under anaerobic systems.

In silico analysis has identified a gene cluster encoding a hybrid NRPS-PKS system (composed of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases) in the L. lactis KF147 genome, as first example of a LAB possessing such hybrid mega-enzymes. Hybrid systems produce hybrid NRP-PK secondary metabolites (natural products) in a wide variety of bacteria, fungi, and plants. In the hybrid NRPS-PKS system of L. lactis KF147, a total of 21 NRPS and 8 PKS domains were identified that are arranged into 6 NRPS modules, 3 PKS modules, and two single functional domains (trans-acyl-transferase transAT and thioesterase). We found homologous hybrid systems having similar gene, module, and domain organization in six other L. lactis strains and 25 strains of the dental cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. This study mainly aimed to predict the structure and function of the hybrid NRP-PK product of L. lactis KF147 using comparative genomics techniques, and included a detailed analysis of the regulatory system. Various bioinformatical approaches were used to predict the substrate specificity of the six A domains and the iterative transAT domain. Functional conservation of the A domains within different-niche-associated strains supported the prediction of the primary core structure of the putative hybrid natural product to be Leu-DLeu-Asp-DAsn-Gly-MC-MC-MC-DAsp (MC = Malonyl-CoA). Oxidative stress resistance and biofilm formation are the most probable functions of this hybrid system.

QS is largely dependent on population density, and it triggers when the concentration of quorum sensing molecules accumulate in the environment and crosses a particular threshold Once a certain population density is achieved and the concentration of molecules cross a threshold the bacterial cells show a collective behavior in response to various chemical stimuli referred to as auto-inducers. The QS signaling is crucial for several phenotypic characteristics responsible for bacterial survival such as motility, virulence, and biofilm formation. Biofilm formation is also responsible for making bacterial cells resistant to antibiotics. The human gut is home to trillions of bacterial cells collectively called gut microbiota or gut microbes. Gut microbes are a consortium of more than 15,000 bacterial species and playa very crucial role in several body functions such as metabolism, development and maturation of immune system, and the synthesis of several essential vitamins. Due to its critical role in shaping the human survival and its modulating impact on body metabolisms, the gut microbial community has been referred to as the forgotten organ by O`Hara et al (2006) [9]. Several studies have demonstrated that chemical interaction between the members of bacterial cells in the gut is responsible for shaping the overall microbial community. Recent advances in phytochemical research have generated a lot of interests in finding new, effective, and safer alternatives to modern chemical-based medicines.

Using a simple chainlike colony of laterally confined cells, we show that the transition sets when individual cells become unstable to rotations; thus it is localized and mechanically deterministic. Asynchronous cell division renders the process stochastic, so that all the critical parameters that control the onset of the transition are continuously distributed random variables. Here we demonstrate that the occurrence of the first division in the colony can be approximated as a Poisson process in the limit of large cell numbers. This allows us to approximately calculate the probability distribution function of the position and time associated with the first extrusion. The rate of such a Poisson process can be identified as the order parameter of the transition, thus highlighting its mixed deterministic-stochastic nature.","authors":[{"name":"Zhihong You"},{"name":"Daniel J G Pearce"},{"name":"Anupam Sengupta"},{"name":"Luca Giomi"}],"keywords":[]},"article197":{"pmid":"31702119","title":"Antibacterial activity of human mesenchymal stem cells mediated directly by constitutively secreted factors and indirectly by activation of innate immune effector cells.","date":"2020-02-08","abs":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to improve wound healing and suppress inflammatory immune responses.

We found that MSC exhibited high levels of spontaneous direct bactericidal activity in vitro. Moreover, soluble factors secreted by MSC inhibited Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation in vitro and disrupted the growth of established biofilms. Secreted factors from MSC also elicited synergistic killing of drug-resistant bacteria when combined with several major classes of antibiotics. Other studies demonstrated interactions of activated MSC with host innate immune responses, including triggering of neutrophil extracellular trap formation and increased phagocytosis of bacteria. Finally, activated MSC administered systemically to mice with established S. aureus biofilm infections significantly reduced bacterial numbers at the wound site and improved wound healing when combined with antibiotic therapy.

The minimum heat inhibitory concentrations (MHIC) and the minimum biofilm fungicidal concentration (MBFC) were defined as the lowest antimicrobial concentration leading to the lack of heat flow production after 24 h for planktonic cells and 48 h for biofilm-embedded cells. C. auris exhibited a peculiar heat production profile. Thermogenic parameters of C. auris suggested a slower growth rate compared to Candida lusitaniae and a different distinct heat profile compared to that of C. haemulonii species complex strains, although they all belong to the Metschnikowiaceae clade. Amphotericin B MHIC and MBFC were 0.5 µg/mL and ≥8 µg/mL, respectively. C. auris strains were non-susceptible to fluconazole at tested concentrations (MHIC > 128 µg/mL, MBFC > 256 µg/mL). The heat curve represents a fingerprint of C. auris, which distinguished it from other species. Treatment based on amphotericin B represents a potential therapeutic option for C. auris infection.","authors":[{"name":"Mariagrazia Di Luca"},{"name":"Anna Koliszak"},{"name":"Svetlana Karbysheva"},{"name":"Anuradha Chowdhary"},{"name":"Jacques F Meis"},{"name":"Andrej Trampuz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida auris"},{"word":"Metschnikowiaceae clade"},{"word":"antifungal resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"isothermal microcalorimetry"}]},"article212":{"pmid":"31698179","title":"Effect of anaerobic sludge on the bioelectricity generation enhancement of bufferless single-chamber microbial fuel cells.","date":"2019-12-31","abs":"Enhancing the self-buffering capacity is critical in the operation of bufferless microbial fuel cells (BLMFCs).

In the considered time window, an increasing number of Candida BSI (p = 0.005) and of biofilm producing strains were observed (p<0.0001). Although C. albicans was the species more frequently isolated in BSI with a major biofilm production, an increased involvement of non-albicans species was reported, particularly of C. parapsilosis that displayed a high frequency in catheter infections, and lower biofilm production compared to C. albicans. Although trends of biofilm production were substantially stable in time, a decreasing biofilm production by C. parapsilosis in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was observed (p = 0.0041). Principal component analysis displayed a change in antifungal drugs consumption driven by two mutually independent temporal trends, i.e. voriconazole use in the general medicine wards initially, and fluconazole use mainly in the ICU; these factors explain 68.9% and 25.7% of total variance respectively. Moreover, a significant trend (p = 0.003) in fluconazole use during the whole time period considered emerged, particularly in the ICU (p = 0.017), but also in the general medicine wards (p = 0.03). These trends paralleled with significant increase MIC90 of fluconazole (p = 0.05), particularly for C. parapsilosis in the ICU (p = 0.04), with a general and significant decreased trend of the MIC90 values of caspofungin (p = 0.04), and with significant increased MIC50 values for amphotericin B (p = 0.01) over the study period.

DNA binding of BpsR is allosterically regulated by interaction with 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6HNA), the first product in the nicotinic acid degradation pathway. To understand the mechanism of this regulation, we have determined the crystal structures of BpsR and BpsR in complex with 6HNA.

The heavy burden of oral infectious diseases and their consequences on the patients' quality of life indicates a strong need for developing effective therapies. Advanced understandings of such oral diseases, e.g., inflammatory periodontal lesions, have raised the demand for antibacterial therapeutic strategies, because these diseases are caused by viruses and bacteria. The application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) on oral infectious diseases has attracted tremendous interest in the past decade. However, aPDT had a minimal effect on the viability of organized biofilms due to the hydrophobic nature of the majority of the photosensitizers (PSs). Therefore, novel nanotechnologies were rapidly developed to target the delivery of hydrophobic PSs into microorganisms for the antimicrobial performance improvement of aPDT. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art of nanomaterials applications in aPDT against oral infectious diseases. The first part of this article focuses on the cutting-edge research on the synthesis, toxicity, and therapeutic effects of various forms of nanomaterials serving as PS carriers for aPDT applications. The second part discusses nanomaterials applications for aPDT in treatments of oral diseases. These novel bioactive nanomaterials have demonstrated great potential to serve as carriers for PSs to substantially enhance the PDT therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the novel aPDT applications not only have exciting therapeutic potential to inhibit bacterial plaque-initiated oral diseases, but also have a wide applicability to other biomedical and tissue engineering applications.","authors":[{"name":"Manlin Qi"},{"name":"Minghan Chi"},{"name":"Xiaolin Sun"},{"name":"Xianju Xie"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Thomas W Oates"},{"name":"Yanmin Zhou"},{"name":"Lin Wang"},{"name":"Yuxing Bai"},{"name":"Hockin Hk Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-inflammatory"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"nanomaterials"},{"word":"oral diseases"},{"word":"photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"upconversion nanoparticles"}]},"article220":{"pmid":"31695365","title":"Green synthesis of AgNPs@PPE and its Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation activity compared to pomegranate peel extract.","date":"2020-01-06","abs":"Bacteria are able to form biofilm on the biotic and abiotic surfaces which helps to protect themselves from deleterious conditions, predation, desiccation, and exposure to antibacterial substances.

Bacterial burden was assessed by colony forming units (CFUs), tissue damage was assessed by histology and micro-computed tomography, biofilm was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), host gene expression was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and osseous integration was assessed via biomechanical push-out test. While CFUs were recovered from RP62A-contaminated implants and surrounding tissues after 14 days, the bacterial burden was significantly less than USA300-infected tibiae (p < 0.001). In addition, RP62A failed to produce any of the gross pathologies induced by USA300 (osteolysis, reactive bone formation, Staphylococcus abscess communities, marrow necrosis, and biofilm). However, fibrous tissue was present at the implant-host interface, and rigorous SEM confirmed the rare presence of cocci on RP62A-contaminated implants. Gene expression studies revealed that IL-1β, IL-6, RANKL, and TLR-2 mRNA levels in RP62A-infected bone were increased versus Sterile controls. Ex vivo push-out testing showed that RP62A-infected implants required significantly less force compared with the Sterile group (7.5 ± 3.4 vs. 17.3 ± 4.1 N; p < 0.001), but required 10-fold greater force than USA300-infected implants (0.7 ± 0.3 N; p < 0.001).

Subsequent results from protein sequence alignments and cellular c-di-GMP assessment indicated that 25 out of the 42 genes were likely to encode DGCs, nine genes were predicted to encode PDEs, four genes encoded bifunctional enzymes and the other four genes encoded enzymatically inactive proteins. This study offers a basic understanding of the roles of these 42 genes and can serve as a toolkit for investigators to further elucidate the functions of these GGDEF and EAL/HD-GYP domain-containing proteins.","authors":[{"name":"Hailing Nie"},{"name":"Yujie Xiao"},{"name":"Jinzhi He"},{"name":"Huizhong Liu"},{"name":"Liang Nie"},{"name":"Wenli Chen"},{"name":"Qiaoyun Huang"}],"keywords":[]},"article232":{"pmid":"31690999","title":"Habitat filters mediate successional trajectories in bacterial communities associated with the striped shore crab.","date":"2019-11-18","abs":"The relative importance of stochastic- and niche-based processes shifts during successional time and across different types of habitats. Microbial biofilms are known to undergo such successional shifts. However, little is known about the interaction between these successional trajectories and habitat filters. Harsh habitat filters could affect biofilm successional trajectories by strengthening niche-based processes and weakening stochastic processes. We used mesocosms to track successional trajectories in bacterial communities associated with the striped shore crab (Pachygrapsus transversus). We followed replicated microbial communities under strong and weak habitat filters associated with the crab's gut and carapace. For bacteria, colonization of the crab's gut is constrained by strong chemical and physical filtering, while the carapace remains relatively open for colonization. Consistent with successional models of bacterial biofilms, carapace microbial communities initially converged in community composition at day 8 and diverged thereafter. We expected gut microbial communities to deviate from the trajectory in the carapace and converge towards a subset of tolerant species. Instead, bacterial communities in the gut exhibited low richness, unchanging similarity in composition and turnover in species identities throughout the duration of our study. These habitat filter effects were linked with weak species interactions and low influence from colonization in the gut. If these findings are representative of differences in filter strength in a continuum of successional trajectories, habitat filters may provide basis for predictions that link successional models and habitat types.","authors":[{"name":"Catalina Cuellar-Gempeler"},{"name":"Pablo Munguia"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Colonization"},{"word":"Community assembly"},{"word":"Community structure"},{"word":"Habitat filters"},{"word":"Succession"}]},"article233":{"pmid":"31690794","title":"Decreased expression of femXAB genes and fnbp mediated biofilm pathways in OS-MRSA clinical isolates.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a significant threat to human health.

Antibiotic susceptibility revealed 74% of the isolates as resistant against one or two antibiotics, followed by 16% multidrug-resistant isolates (MDR), and 10% sensitive. The isolates were characterized as MRSA (n = 15), Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA, n = 48) and oxacillin susceptible mecA positive S. aureus (OS-MRSA, n = 11) based on oxacillin susceptibility, mecA gene PCR and PBP2a agglutination test. All OS-MRSA would have been misclassified as MSSA on the basis of susceptibility test. Therefore, both phenotypic and genotypic tests should be included to prevent strain misrepresentation. In addition, in-depth studies for understanding the emerging OS-MRSA phenotype is required. The role of fem XAB gene family has been earlier reported in OS-MRSA phenotype. Sequence analysis of the fem XAB genes revealed mutations in fem × (K3R, H11N, N18H and I51V) and fem B (L410F) genes. The fem XAB genes were also found down-regulated in OS-MRSA isolates in comparison to MRSA. In OS-MRSA isolates, biofilm formation is regulated by fibronectin binding proteins A & B. Molecular typing of the isolates revealed genetic diversity.

Our results indicate that soluble SRGO nanosheets were prepared using graphene oxide (GO) as a raw material.

Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements were used to determine Z-average sizes and surface charges of GO and SRGOs. X-ray diffractometry, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy revealed the progressive elimination of labile oxygen functional groups during hydrothermal treatment and restoration of the π-conjugated network. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed de-oxidation of SRGOs, which had high carbon to oxygen ratios (C/O) as compared with GO. Interactions of SRGO-1 and -10 with skin fibroblasts showed excellent biocompatibility even at a concentration of 200 μg/ml with cell viabilities up to 88% and 90%, respectively, whereas notable cytotoxicity was observed for GO at 20 μg/ml. Similarly, SRGO-1 and -10 did not exhibit toxicity to RBCs compared to GO.

Combined with detailed confocal microscopy of biofilms, our study also revealed novel phenotypes associated with extracellular matrix biosynthesis as well as the potent inhibition of SBW25 biofilm formation mediated by the PFLU1114 operon. We conclude that CRISPRi is a reliable and scalable approach to investigate gene networks in the diverse P. fluorescens group.","authors":[{"name":"Marie-Francoise Noirot-Gros"},{"name":"Sara Forrester"},{"name":"Grace Malato"},{"name":"Peter E Larsen"},{"name":"Philippe Noirot"}],"keywords":[]},"article254":{"pmid":"31685860","title":"Effect of low doses of biocides on the antimicrobial resistance and the biofilms of Cronobacter sakazakii and Yersinia enterocolitica.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"The susceptibility of Cronobacter sakazakii ATCC 29544 (CS) and Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 9610 (YE) to sodium hypochlorite (10% of active chlorine; SHY), peracetic acid (39% solution of peracetic acid in acetic acid; PAA) and benzalkonium chloride (BZK) was tested.

We reported previously that clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa promote the growth of a variety of streptococcal species. To explore the mechanistic basis of this interaction, we performed a genetic screen to identify mutants of Streptococcus sanginuis SK36 whose growth was no longer enhanced by P. aeruginosa PAO1. Mutations in the zinc uptake systems of S. sanguinis SK36 reduced growth of these strains by 1 to 3 logs compared to that of wild-type S. sanguinis SK36 when grown in coculture with P. aeruginosa PAO1, and exogenous zinc (0.1 to 10 μM) rescued the coculture defect of zinc uptake mutants of S. sanguinis SK36. Zinc uptake mutants of S. sanguinis SK36 had no obvious growth defect in monoculture. Consistent with competition for zinc driving coculture dynamics, S. sanguinis SK36 grown in coculture with P. aeruginosa showed increased expression of zinc uptake genes compared to that of S. sanguinis grown alone. Strains of P. aeruginosa PAO1 defective in zinc transport also supported ∼2-fold more growth by S. sanguinis compared to that in coculture with wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1. An analysis of 118 CF sputum samples revealed that total zinc levels varied from ∼5 to 145 μM. At relatively low zinc levels, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus spp. were found in approximately equal abundance; at higher zinc levels, we observed a decline in relative abundance of Streptococcus spp., perhaps as a result of increasing zinc toxicity. Together, our data indicate that the relative abundances of these microbes in the CF airway may be impacted by zinc levels.","authors":[{"name":"Kewei Li"},{"name":"Alex H Gifford"},{"name":"Thomas H Hampton"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Streptococcus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"polymicrobial"},{"word":"zinc"}]},"article256":{"pmid":"31685418","title":"Isolation and characterization of bacteriophage to control multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa planktonic cells and biofilm.","date":"2020-02-06","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is Gram-negative bacterium, one of the leading cause of drug-resistant nosocomial infections in developing countries.

Forward and reverse genetic screens led to the discovery that FlhF interacts with FimV to control flagellar rotation at a surface, and implicated cAMP signaling in this pathway. Although cAMP controls many transcriptional programs in P. aeruginosa, known targets of this second messenger were not required to modulate flagellar rotation in surface-attached bacteria. Instead, alterations in switching behavior of the motor appeared to result from direct or indirect effects of cAMP on switch complex proteins and/or the stators associated with them.","authors":[{"name":"Maren Schniederberend"},{"name":"Jessica F Williams"},{"name":"Emilee Shine"},{"name":"Cong Shen"},{"name":"Ruchi Jain"},{"name":"Thierry Emonet"},{"name":"Barbara I Kazmierczak"}],"keywords":[]},"article276":{"pmid":"31682631","title":"Nodosilinea signiensis sp. nov.

Nitric oxide (NO) is known to mediate biofilm formation in many bacteria via ligation to H-NOX (heme-NO/oxygen binding) domains. Most NO-responsive bacteria, however, lack H-NOX domain-containing proteins. We have identified another NO-sensing protein (NosP), which is predicted to be involved in two-component signaling and biofilm regulation in many species. Here, we demonstrate that NosP participates in the previously described H-NOX/NO-responsive multicomponent c-di-GMP signaling network in Shewanella oneidensis. Strains lacking either nosP or its co-cistronic kinase nahK (previously hnoS) produce immature biofilms, while hnoX and hnoK (kinase responsive to NO/H-NOX) mutants result in wild-type biofilm architecture. We demonstrate that NosP regulates the autophosphorylation activity of NahK as well as HnoK. HnoK and NahK have been shown to regulate three response regulators (HnoB, HnoC, and HnoD) that together comprise a NO-responsive multicomponent c-di-GMP signaling network. Here, we propose that NosP/NahK adds regulation on top of H-NOX/HnoK to modulate this c-di-GMP signaling network, and ultimately biofilm formation, by governing the flux of phosphate through both HnoK and NahK. In addition, it appears that NosP and H-NOX act to counter each other in a push-pull mechanism; NosP/NahK promotes biofilm formation through inhibition of H-NOX/HnoK signaling, which itself reduces the extent of biofilm formation. Addition of NO results in a reduction of c-di-GMP and biofilm formation, primarily through disinhibition of HnoK activity.","authors":[{"name":"Lisa-Marie Nisbett"},{"name":"Lucas Binnenkade"},{"name":"Bezalel Bacon"},{"name":"Sajjad Hossain"},{"name":"Nicholas J Kotloski"},{"name":"Evan D Brutinel"},{"name":"Raimo Hartmann"},{"name":"Knut Drescher"},{"name":"Dhruv P Arora"},{"name":"Sandhya Muralidharan"},{"name":"Kai M Thormann"},{"name":"Jeffrey A Gralnick"},{"name":"Elizabeth M Boon"}],"keywords":[]},"article278":{"pmid":"31682251","title":"Cephalosporin nitric oxide-donor prodrug DEA-C3D disperses biofilms formed by clinical cystic fibrosis isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"The cephalosporin nitric oxide (NO)-donor prodrug DEA-C3D ('DiEthylAmin-Cephalosporin-3'-Diazeniumdiolate') has been shown to initiate the dispersal of biofilms formed by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa laboratory strain PAO1.

Biofilm formation is one of the prime virulence factors of S. epidermidis that supports its colonization on biotic and abiotic surfaces. The global dissemination of three lineages of S. epidermidis superbugs highlights its clinical significance and the imperative need to combat its pathogenicity. Thus, in the current study, the antibiofilm activity of umbelliferone (UMB), a natural product of the coumarin family, was assessed against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE). UMB exhibited significant antibiofilm activity (83%) at 500 μg/ml concentration without growth alteration. Microscopic analysis corroborated the antibiofilm potential of UMB and unveiled its potential to impair intercellular adhesion, which was reflected in auto-aggregation and solid phase adherence assays. Furthermore, real time PCR analysis revealed the reduced expression of adhesion encoding genes (icaD, atlE, aap, bhp, ebh, sdrG, and sdrF). Down regulation of agrA and reduced production of secreted hydrolases upon UMB treatment were speculated to hinder invasive lifestyle of MRSE. Additionally, UMB hindered slime synthesis and biofilm matrix components, which were believed to augment antibiotic susceptibility. In vivo assays using Caenorhabditis elegans divulged the non-toxic nature of UMB and validated the antibiofilm, antivirulence, and antiadherence properties of UMB observed in in vitro assays. Thus, UMB impairs MRSE biofilm by turning down the initial attachment and intercellular adhesion. Altogether, the obtained results suggest the potent antibiofilm activity of UMB and the feasibility of using it in clinical settings for combating S. epidermidis infections.","authors":[{"name":"Thirukannamangai Krishnan Swetha"},{"name":"Murugesan Pooranachithra"},{"name":"Ganapathy Ashwinkumar Subramenium"},{"name":"Velayutham Divya"},{"name":"Krishnaswamy Balamurugan"},{"name":"Shunmugiah Karutha Pandian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance (AMR)"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"initial attachment"},{"word":"intercellular adhesion"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE)"},{"word":"umbelliferone"}]},"article281":{"pmid":"31681632","title":"The Transcriptional Regulator Lrp Contributes to Toxin Expression, Sporulation, and Swimming Motility in Clostridium difficile.","date":"2019-11-08","abs":"Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium, and major cause of nosocomial diarrhea.

Nasopharyngeal biofilms are structured with a matrix that includes extracellular DNA (eDNA), which is sourced from the same pneumococci and other bacteria. This eDNA also allows pneumococci to acquire new traits, including antibiotic resistance genes. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of lactoferrin (LF), at physiological concentrations found in secretions with bactericidal activity [i.e., colostrum (100 μM), tears (25 μM)], in eradicating pneumococcal biofilms from human respiratory cells. The efficacy of synthetic LF-derived peptides was also assessed. We first demonstrated that LF inhibited colonization of S. pneumoniae on human respiratory cells without affecting the viability of planktonic bacteria. LF-derived peptides were, however, bactericidal for planktonic pneumococci but they did not affect viability of pre-formed biofilms. In contrast, LF (40 and 80 μM) eradicated pneumococcal biofilms that had been pre-formed on abiotic surfaces (i.e., polystyrene) and on human pharyngeal cells, as investigated by viable counts and confocal microscopy. LF also eradicated biofilms formed by S. pneumoniae strains with resistance to multiple antibiotics. We investigated whether treatment with LF would affect the biofilm structure by analyzing eDNA. Surprisingly, in pneumococcal biofilms treated with LF, the eDNA was absent in comparison to the untreated control (∼10 μg/ml) or those treated with LF-derived peptides. EMSA assays showed that LF binds S. pneumoniae DNA and a time-course study of DNA decay demonstrated that the DNA is degraded when bound by LF. This LF-associated DNase activity inhibited acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes in both in vitro transformation assays and in a life-like bioreactor system. In conclusion, we demonstrated that LF eradicates pneumococcal-colonizing biofilms at a concentration safe for humans and identified a LF-associated DNAse activity that inhibited the acquisition of resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Uriel A Angulo-Zamudio"},{"name":"Jorge E Vidal"},{"name":"Kamran Nazmi"},{"name":"Jan G M Bolscher"},{"name":"Claudia Leon-Sicairos"},{"name":"Brenda S Antezana"},{"name":"Adrián Canizalez-Roman"},{"name":"Nidia León-Sicairos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNAse activity"},{"word":"disaggregates"},{"word":"lactoferrin"},{"word":"pneumococcal biofilms"},{"word":"resistance acquisition"}]},"article287":{"pmid":"31681200","title":"Gymnemic Acids Inhibit Adhesive Nanofibrillar Mediated Streptococcus gordonii-Candida albicans Mono-Species and Dual-Species Biofilms.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Dental caries and periodontitis are the most common oral disease of all age groups, affecting billions of people worldwide. These oral diseases are mostly associated with microbial biofilms in the oral cavity.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the pathogen interactions and identifying non-toxic compounds that block the growth of biofilms are important steps in the development of effective therapeutic approaches. In this in vitro study we report the inhibition of mono-species or dual-species biofilms of S. gordonii and C. albicans, and decreased levels of biofilm extracellular DNA (eDNA), when biofilms were grown in the presence of gymnemic acids (GAs), a non-toxic small molecule inhibitor of fungal hyphae. Scanning electron microscopic images of biofilms on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) surfaces revealed attachment of S. gordonii cells to C. albicans hyphae and to sHA surfaces via nanofibrils only in the untreated control, but not in the GAs-treated biofilms. Interestingly, C. albicans produced fibrillar adhesive structures from hyphae when grown with S. gordonii as a mixed biofilm; addition of GAs abrogated the nanofibrils and reduced the growth of both hyphae and the biofilm. To our knowledge, this is the first report that C. albicans produces adhesive fibrils from hyphae in response to S. gordonii mixed biofilm growth. Semi-quantitative PCR of selected genes related to biofilms from both microbes showed differential expression in control vs. treated biofilms. Further, GAs inhibited the activity of recombinant S. gordonii glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

Moreover, fungal biofilms impose an additional challenge, leading to multidrug resistance. This fact, along with the contamination of medical devices and the limited number of effective antifungal agents available on the market, demonstrates the importance of finding novel drug candidates targeting pathogenic fungal cells and biofilms. In this context, an alternative strategy is the use of antifungal peptides (AFPs) against fungal biofilms. AFPs are considered a group of bioactive molecules with broad-spectrum activities and multiple mechanisms of action that have been widely used as template molecules for drug design strategies aiming at greater specificity and biological efficacy. Among the AFP classes most studied in the context of fungal biofilms, defensins, cathelicidins and histatins have been described. AFPs can also act by preventing the formation of fungal biofilms and eradicating preformed biofilms through mechanisms associated with cell wall perturbation, inhibition of planktonic fungal cells' adhesion onto surfaces, gene regulation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, considering the critical scenario imposed by fungal biofilms and associated infections and the application of AFPs as a possible treatment, this review will focus on the most effective AFPs described to date, with a core focus on antibiofilm peptides, as well as their efficacy in vivo, application on surfaces and proposed mechanisms of action.","authors":[{"name":"Karen G N Oshiro"},{"name":"Gisele Rodrigues"},{"name":"Bruna Estéfani D Monges"},{"name":"Marlon Henrique Cardoso"},{"name":"Octávio Luiz Franco"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antifungal peptides"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"fungal biofilms"},{"word":"fungal infections"},{"word":"mechanisms of action"}]},"article290":{"pmid":"31680977","title":"Growth Inhibitory Activity of Callicarpa americana Leaf Extracts Against Cutibacterium acnes.","date":"2019-11-08","abs":"Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease affecting adolescents and young adults of all ethnic groups, negatively impacting self-esteem, self-confidence, and social life.

Finally, the anticancer effects of the mushroom extract were tested on colon (HT-29) and breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines by using the MTT assay. The results revealed that the total amount of phenolics in the ethanol extract of M. oreades was 10.990 ± 0.0007 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g, and the total amount of flavonoids was 1.139 ± 0.0052 mg quercetin equivalent/100 g. The ultraperformance liquid chromatography results indicated that the M. oreades ethanol extract contained various phenolic compounds: catechin, ferulic, gallic acid, and vanillic acid. The M. oreades ethanol extract scavenged about 80% of DPPH free radicals. It did not show any effect on the glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase enzyme activities, but its maximal concentration (10 mg/mL) increased superoxide dismutase activity (8%). The ethanol extract of M. oreades showed a moderate anticancer effect on the HT-29, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Although the ethanolic extract of the mushroom did not show sufficient antibacterial activity, it presented a strong antibiofilm effect against all studied pathogenic strains at the tested concentrations.","authors":[{"name":"Naznoosh Shomali"},{"name":"Okan Onar"},{"name":"Basar Karaca"},{"name":"Nergiz Demirtas"},{"name":"Arzu Coleri Cihan"},{"name":"Ilgaz Akata"},{"name":"Ozlem Yildirim"}],"keywords":[]},"article296":{"pmid":"31679142","title":"Physiological responses of three mono-species phototrophic biofilms exposed to copper and zinc.","date":"2020-01-30","abs":"In freshwater ecosystem, phototrophic biofilms play a crucial role through adsorption and sequestration of organic and inorganic pollutants.

Weathering further affects the sorption behavior of MPs for environmental pollutants because of the changed crystallinity, specific surface area and oxygen functional groups.

Deep mine biofilm samples that contain high amounts of mucoid exopolysaccharide often pose difficulties to obtaining refined community DNA. To circumvent this hindrance, we report our MINES method which we developed for optimal biofilm DNA recovery suitable for all types of high-resolution downstream applications. The method is also suitable for samples collected from landfill compost, kitchen digest (KD), and for Gram-positive Geobacillus sp. strain WSUCF1 and Gram-negative E. coli DH5α strains. In one form of the method, use of a gentle preprocessing technique to loosen the mucoid layer, combined with a multi-lytic polyzyme treatment to maximize yields from all cell types in the biofilm sample, yielded >1 μg of high molecular weight DNA (16-20 kb) per gram of the biofilm sample, with an A260/280 and A260/230 ratio of about 2. Furthermore, amplification of 16S rRNA genes as well as restriction digestion with BamHI and HindIII suggest that the newly developed method can minimize any inhibitory effects of contaminants. Results indicate that it is an appropriate methodology for the extraction of total genomic DNA for functional metagenomic studies and may be applicable to other environmental samples from which DNA extraction is challenging. IMPORTANCE: Our present knowledge of microorganisms and their enzymes from deep mine subsurfaces is based largely on laboratory studies of pure microbial cultures. These methods tend only to hit nearly 1% of the entire microbial community.

The strains differed in hemolysis, gelatin liquefaction, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and ability to activate the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB in cultured enterocytes. Only 3 strains, BB70, 224, and BB24 appreciably colonized the neonatal intestine on day 4 after artificial introduction with the first feeding. The best colonizer, strain BB70, effectively displaced E. faecalis of maternal origin. Whereas BB70 and BB24 significantly increased NEC pathology, strain 224 significantly protected from NEC. Our results show that different strains of E. faecalis may be pathogenic or protective in experimental NEC.","authors":[{"name":"Patrick T Delaplain"},{"name":"Brandon A Bell"},{"name":"Jin Wang"},{"name":"Mubina Isani"},{"name":"Emily Zhang"},{"name":"Christopher P Gayer"},{"name":"Anatoly V Grishin"},{"name":"Henri R Ford"}],"keywords":[]},"article318":{"pmid":"31675193","title":"Effect of toothpaste containing multiple ions-releasing filler on polymicrobial biofilm regrowth and dentin demineralization.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"To compare the efficacy of toothpaste containing surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) filler particles to that of conventional sodium fluoride (NaF) toothpaste for the prevention of dentin demineralization and biofilm regrowth.","authors":[{"name":"Kiyoshi Tomiyama"},{"name":"Toru Shiiya"},{"name":"Kiyoko Watanabe"},{"name":"Nobushiro Hamada"},{"name":"Yoshiharu Mukai"}],"keywords":[]},"article319":{"pmid":"31674244","title":"Antibiotic-loaded bone cement is associated with a lower risk of revision following primary cemented total knee arthroplasty: an analysis of 731,214 cases using National Joint Registry data.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Antibiotic-loaded bone cements (ALBCs) may offer early protection against the formation of bacterial biofilm after joint arthroplasty.

These 2 concepts are interrelated and have the potential to result in mesh-related complications. Effective porosity is a term well described in the textile industry. It is best defined as the changes to pore morphology after implantation of mesh in situ. It is heavily dependent on mesh construct and repair technique and has the potential to impact hernia repair by reducing mesh tissue integration and promoting fibrosis. Bacterial biofilm is a well-described condition affecting prosthesis in breast and join replacement surgery with catastrophic consequences. There is a paucity of information on bacterial biofilm in mesh hernia repair. We speculate that bacterial biofilm has the potential to reduce the effective porosity of mesh, resulting in non-suppurative mesh-related complications as well as the potential for late suppurative infections. We describe the aetiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and preventative measures to address bacterial biofilm in mesh hernia surgery.

The addition of an external soluble carbon source has been the usual procedure to achieve denitrification. However, the disadvantage of this treatment process is the need of a closed, rather sophisticated and costly process control as well as the risk of overdosing. Solid-phase denitrification using biodegradable polymers as biofilm carrier and carbon source was considered as an attractive alternative for biological denitrification. The start-up time of the novel process using PCL (polycaprolactone) as biofilm carrier and carbon source was comparable with that of conventional process using ceramsite as biofilm carrier and acetate as carbon source. Further, the solid-phase denitrification process showed higher nitrogen removal efficiency under shorter hydraulic retention time (HRT) and low carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio since the biofilm was firmly attached to the clear pores on the surface of PCL carriers and in this process bacteria that could degrade PCL carriers to obtain electron donor for denitrification was found. In addition, solid-phase denitrification process had a stronger resistance of shock loading than that in conventional process. This study revealed, for the first time, that the physical properties of the biodegradable polymer played a vital role in denitrification, and the different microbial compositions of the two processes was the main reason for the different denitrification performances under low C/N ratio.","authors":[{"name":"Qian Zhang"},{"name":"Xue Chen"},{"name":"Heng Wu"},{"name":"Wandong Luo"},{"name":"Xiangyang Liu"},{"name":"Li Feng"},{"name":"Tiantao Zhao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ceramsite filter"},{"word":"conventional denitrification"},{"word":"nitrate removal"},{"word":"polycaprolactone (PCL)"},{"word":"solid-phase denitrification"}]},"article328":{"pmid":"31671533","title":"Candida albicans Biofilm Heterogeneity and Tolerance of Clinical Isolates: Implications for Secondary Endodontic Infections.","date":"2020-01-28","abs":"Endodontic infections are caused by the invasion of various microorganisms into the root canal system.

Ideally, the interface will encourage osseointegration with the host bone, resulting in strong fixation and implant stability. However, implant failure can occur due to the lack of integration with bone tissue or bacterial infection. The chosen material and surface topography of orthopedic implants are key factors that influence the early events following implantation and may ultimately define the success of a device. Early attachment, rapid migration and improved differentiation of stem cells to osteoblasts are necessary to populate the surface of biomedical implants, potentially preventing biofilm formation and implant-associated infection. This article explores these early stem cell specific events by seeding human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on four clinically relevant materials: polyether ether ketone (PEEK), Ti6Al4V (smooth Ti), macro-micro rough Ti6Al4V (Endoskeleton®), and macro-micro-nano rough Ti6Al4V (nanoLOCK®). The results demonstrate the incorporation of a hierarchical macro-micro-nano roughness on titanium produces a stellate morphology typical of mature osteoblasts/osteocytes, rapid and random migration, and improved osteogenic differentiation in seeded MSCs.

We found that Trichoplax adhaerens, the simplest multicellular animal ever described, engages in social feeding behavior. T. adhaerens lacks muscle tissue, nervous and digestive systems - yet is capable of aggregating and forming groups of closely connected individuals who collectively feed. The tight physical interactions between the animals are transitory and appear to serve the goal of staying connected to neighbors during the external digestion of algae when enzymes are released on the biofilm and nutrients are absorbed through the ventral epithelium. We found that T. adhaerens are more likely to engage in social feeding when the concentrations of algae are high - both in a semi-natural conditions and in vitro. It is surprising that T. adhaerens - an organism without a nervous system - is able to engage in this social feeding behavior. Whether this behavior is cooperative is still an open question. Nevertheless, the social feeding behavior of T. adhaerens, an early multicellular animal, suggests that sociality may have played an important role in the early evolution of animals. It also suggests that T. adhaerens could be used as a simple model organism for exploring questions regarding ecology and sociobiology.","authors":[{"name":"Angelo Fortunato"},{"name":"Athena Aktipis"}],"keywords":[]},"article347":{"pmid":"31666982","title":"Insights into flagellar function and mechanism from the squid-vibrio symbiosis.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Flagella are essential and multifunctional nanomachines that not only move symbionts towards their tissue colonization site, but also play multiple roles in communicating with the host.

This species feasts in the biofilm among sand grains, but also on macroalgae and ice within which it can likely survive long-distance rafting dispersal due to its varying lifecycle stages; eggs encapsulated in cocoons and dormant encystment stages.

We screened only the common proteins from nine different sources of A. veronii by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and identified the gene hisJ. We then constructed ΔhisJ (deleted) and C-hisJ (complemented) variants of A. veronii TH0426 to assess the biological function of hisJ. While the ΔhisJ strain did not show altered growth (P > 0.05), we observed that it had reduced colony formation and biofilm formation and reduced adhesion to and invasion of epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells by 2.0-, 1.9-, and 10.8-fold, respectively. Additionally, infection experiments on zebrafish and mouse infection experiments showed that the virulence of the ΔhisJ strain was decreased by 865-fold (P < 0.001) compared with the wild-type strain; virulence of the complemented C-hisJ strain was reduced only 2.8-fold. Furthermore, in the context of hisJ deletion, flagella of A. veronii TH0426 were easily detached and the expression of virulence genes was downregulated.

It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of diabetes along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced during periodontal inflammation can interfere with the actions of insulin receptors and worsen the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, affecting over 300 million people and bacteria associated with periodontitis are also linked with systemic problems like endocarditis, atherosclerosis. Recent work has highlighted a major role for the host sugar sialic acid in the biofilm physiology and host-pathogen interactions of T. forsithya, a key periodontal pathogen. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Serum sialic acids were estimated in Indian population by diphenylamine method and Thiobarbituric acid method. The average values were 68 ± 2.6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ± 5 mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric acid assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic acid level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy.

Thus (TSSA) level could be considered as novel biomarker in the progression of periodontal disease and diabetic status.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, biofilm formation is regulated by cell-to-cell communication, called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing facilitates a variety of bacterial physiological functions such as swarming motility and protease, pyoverdine, and pyocyanin productions. Peptide mix from the marine mollusc, Olivancillaria hiatula, has been studied for its antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Microscopy and microtiter plate-based assays were used to evaluate biofilm inhibitory activities. Effect of the peptide mix on quorum sensing-mediated processes was also evaluated. Peptide mix proved to be a good antibiofilm agent, requiring less than 39 μg/mL to inhibit 50% biofilm formation. Micrographs obtained confirmed biofilm inhibition at 1/2 MIC whereas 2.5 mg/mL was required to degrade preformed biofilm. There was a marked attenuation in quorum sensing-mediated phenotypes as well.

Additionally, swarming motility was repressed by peptide in a dose-dependent manner.

The analyses performed in this study increased the understanding of the horizontal transfer of plasmids found within Pseudomonas populations inhabiting Antarctic soils. It was shown that the majority of the studied plasmids are narrow-host-range replicons, whose transfer across taxonomic boundaries may be limited. Moreover, structural and functional analyses enabled identification and characterization of various accessory genetic modules, including genes encoding major pilin protein (PilA), that enhance biofilm formation, as well as active transposable elements.

In particular, with current microbial MALDI-MSI methods chemical coverage is strongly limited to well ionizing compounds and a safe MSI-compatible inactivation of microbial viability and quenching of metabolism is not possible. Here, we introduce a membrane-based culturing workflow that enables a rapid MSI-compatible steam inactivation of pathogens and generation of a flat surface. We equipped precision mass spectrometers with laser-postionization (MALDI-2) modules to increase the analytical sensitivity by up to several orders of magnitude. In this way, for example 39 different 2-alkylquinolones with differential expression patterns and a similar number of glycerophospholipids were simultaneously visualized from single cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at about 50 μm resolution. To visualize the metabolic exchange between competing microorganisms, we challenged commensal Escherichia coli MG1655 and virulence factor-depleted E. coli C600 strains with enteropathogenic Shiga-toxin negative E. coli O26:H11, and Staphylococcus aureus with antagonistic P. aeruginosa.

In Vibrio cholerae, quorum sensing coordinates virulence, biofilm formation, and DNA uptake by natural competence. The transcription factors AphA and HapR, expressed at low and high cell density respectively, play a key role. In particular, AphA triggers the entire virulence cascade upon host colonisation. In this work we have mapped genome-wide DNA binding by AphA. We show that AphA is versatile, exhibiting distinct modes of DNA binding and promoter regulation. Unexpectedly, whilst HapR is known to induce natural competence, we demonstrate that AphA also intervenes. Most notably, AphA is a direct repressor of tfoX, the master activator of competence. Hence, production of AphA markedly suppressed DNA uptake; an effect largely circumvented by ectopic expression of tfoX. Our observations suggest dual regulation of competence. At low cell density AphA is a master repressor whilst HapR activates the process at high cell density. Thus, we provide deep mechanistic insight into the role of AphA and highlight how V. cholerae utilises this regulator for diverse purposes.","authors":[{"name":"James R J Haycocks"},{"name":"Gemma Z L Warren"},{"name":"Lucas M Walker"},{"name":"Jennifer L Chlebek"},{"name":"Triana N Dalia"},{"name":"Ankur B Dalia"},{"name":"David C Grainger"}],"keywords":[]},"article376":{"pmid":"31657672","title":"Dominant, Heritable Resistance to Stewart's Wilt in Maize Is Associated with an Enhanced Vascular Defense Response to Infection with Pantoea stewartii.","date":"2019-11-21","abs":"Vascular wilt bacteria such as Pantoea stewartii, the causal agent of Stewart's bacterial wilt of maize (SW), are destructive pathogens that are difficult to control. These bacteria colonize the xylem, where they form biofilms that block sap flow leading to characteristic wilting symptoms. Heritable forms of SW resistance exist and are used in maize breeding programs but the underlying genes and mechanisms are mostly unknown. Here, we show that seedlings of maize inbred lines with pan1 mutations are highly resistant to SW. However, current evidence suggests that other genes introgressed along with pan1 are responsible for resistance. Genomic analyses of pan1 lines were used to identify candidate resistance genes. In-depth comparison of P. stewartii interaction with susceptible and resistant maize lines revealed an enhanced vascular defense response in pan1 lines characterized by accumulation of electron-dense materials in xylem conduits visible by electron microscopy. We propose that this vascular defense response restricts P. stewartii spread through the vasculature, reducing both systemic bacterial colonization of the xylem network and consequent wilting. Though apparently unrelated to the resistance phenotype of pan1 lines, we also demonstrate that the effector WtsE is essential for P. stewartii xylem dissemination, show evidence for a nutritional immunity response to P. stewartii that alters xylem sap composition, and present the first analysis of maize transcriptional responses to P. stewartii infection.","authors":[{"name":"Paula Doblas-Ibáñez"},{"name":"Kaiyue Deng"},{"name":"Miguel F Vasquez"},{"name":"Laura Giese"},{"name":"Paul A Cobine"},{"name":"Judith M Kolkman"},{"name":"Helen King"},{"name":"Tiffany M Jamann"},{"name":"Peter Balint-Kurti"},{"name":"Leonardo De La Fuente"},{"name":"Rebecca J Nelson"},{"name":"David Mackey"},{"name":"Laurie G Smith"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pantoea stewartii"},{"word":"Stewart’s bacterial wilt"},{"word":"WtsE"},{"word":"bacterial pathogenesis"},{"word":"electron-dense materials"},{"word":"maize"},{"word":"plant responses to pathogens"},{"word":"secretion and cell wall changes"},{"word":"type-3 secretion"},{"word":"vascular defense response"},{"word":"xylem-dwelling bacteria"}]},"article377":{"pmid":"31657209","title":"Antibiofilm Platform based on the Combination of Antimicrobial Polymers and Essential Oils.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"The development of potent strategies to counter microbial biofilm is an urgent priority in healthcare. The majority of bacterial infections in humans are biofilm related, however, effective treatments are still lacking especially for combating multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Herein, we report an effective antibiofilm platform based on the use of synthetic antimicrobial polymers in combination with essential oils, where the antimicrobial polymers play a secondary role as delivery vehicle for essential oils. Two ternary antimicrobial polymers consisting of cationic primary amines, low-fouling oligo(ethylene glycol) and hydrophobic ethylhexyl groups were synthesized in the form of random and block copolymers, and mixed with either carvacrol or eugenol. Coadministration of these compounds improved the efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms compared to the individual compounds. We observed about a 60-75% and 70-85% biofilm inhibition effect for all tested combinations against wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 and MDR strain PA37, respectively, upon 6.5 h of incubation time. While both random and block copolymers demonstrated similar biofilm inhibition potencies in combination with essential oils, only the block copolymer acted synergistically with essential oils in killing biofilm. Treatment of PAO1 biofilm for 20 min with the block copolymer-oil combinations resulted in the killing of >99.99% of biofilm bacteria. This synergistic bactericidal activity is attributed to the targeted delivery of essential oils to the biofilm, driven by the electrostatic interaction between positively charged delivery vehicles, in the form of polymeric micelles, and negatively charged bacteria. This study thus highlights the advantage of combining essential oils and antimicrobial polymers as an effective avenue for antibacterial applications.","authors":[{"name":"Rashin Namivandi-Zangeneh"},{"name":"Yiling Yang"},{"name":"Sihao Xu"},{"name":"Edgar H H Wong"},{"name":"Cyrille Boyer"}],"keywords":[]},"article378":{"pmid":"31657125","title":"A comparative study on the cellular viability and debridement efficiency of antimicrobial-based wound dressings.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"A concentrated surfactant gel containing polyhexamethylene biguanide (CSG-PHMB) (CSG: Plurogel) was evaluated for in vitro cell cytotoxicity using the direct contact, extraction, and cell insert assays, along with its ability to breakdown artificial wound eschar and slough, compared with other clinically available wound gels: a wound gel loaded with 0.13% benzalkonium chloride (BXG) and a highly viscous gel loaded with 0.1% polyhexamethylene biguanide (PXG).

Within the in vitro debridement model, CSG-PHMB exhibited an ability to potentially increase the loosening of the collagen matrix.

Extensive data collected over the past decades on this chronic disease demonstrate that its progression is infrequent and episodic, and the susceptibility to it can vary among individuals. Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate measurable biological indicators of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary omics technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the microbiome. The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other. Vast such data is derived from oral biological fluids, including gingival crevicular fluid and saliva, which is progressively completed and catalogued as the analytical technologies and bioinformatics tools progressively advance.

Usps play an important role in adaptation of bacteria to a variety of environmental stresses. There is increasing evidence that Usps facilitate pathogens to adapt host environment and are involved in pathogenicity. Edwardsiella piscicida (formerly included in E. tarda) is a severe fish pathogen and infects various important economic fish including tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In E. piscicida, a number of systems and factors that are involved in stress resistance and pathogenesis were identified. However, the function of Usps in E. piscicida is totally unknown. In this study, we examined the expressions of 13 usp genes in E. piscicida and found that most of these usp genes were up-regulated expression under high temperature, oxidative stress, acid stress, and host serum stress. Particularly, among these usp genes, usp13, exhibited dramatically high expression level upon several stress conditions. To investigate the biological role of usp13, a markerless usp13 in-frame mutant strain, TX01Δusp13, was constructed. Compared to the wild type TX01, TX01Δusp13 exhibited markedly compromised tolerance to high temperature, hydrogen peroxide, and low pH. Deletion of usp13 significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis showed that the inactivation of usp13 significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida to invade into host cell and infect host tissue. Introduction of a trans-expressed usp13 gene restored the lost virulence of TX01Δusp13. In support of these results, host immune response induced by TX01 and TX01Δusp13 was examined, and the results showed reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in TX01Δusp13-infected macrophages were significantly higher than those in TX01-infected cells. The expression level of several cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and CC2) in TX01Δusp13-infected fish was significantly higher than that in TX01-infected fish. These results suggested that the deletion of usp13 attenuated the ability of bacteria to overcome the host immune response to pathogen infection. Taken together, our study indicated Usp13 of E. piscicida was not only important participant in adversity resistance, but also was essential for E. piscicida pathogenicity and contributed to block host immune response to pathogen infection.","authors":[{"name":"Qing-Jian Fang"},{"name":"Yue-Xin Han"},{"name":"Yan-Jie Shi"},{"name":"Hui-Qin Huang"},{"name":"Zai-Guang Fang"},{"name":"Yong-Hua Hu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adversity resistance"},{"word":"Edwardsiella piscicida"},{"word":"Immune response"},{"word":"Tilapia"},{"word":"Usp"}]},"article389":{"pmid":"31654686","title":"Spray-drying of inhalable, multifunctional formulations for the treatment of biofilms formed in cystic fibrosis.","date":"2019-12-01","abs":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a serious lung disease, commonly susceptible to Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. The dense mucus together with biofilm formation limit drug permeability and prevent the drug from reaching the site of action, causing treatment failure of the bacterial infection. Besides the use of antibiotics, the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is recommended to be co-administered in the treatment of CF. Although several formulations have been developed for inhalation therapy to improve the pulmonary condition in CF patients, there is still no comprehensive study on a combined multifunctional dry powder formulation of antibiotics with NAC. In this work, we developed an innovative multifunctional dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation based on salt formation between NAC and antibiotics and characterized their solid state properties and physical stability. NAC could be spray dried together with three different antibiotics, azithromycin (Azi), tobramycin (Tobra) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro), without the use of organic solvents to form Azi/NAC, Tobra/NAC and Cipro/NAC DPI formulations. Solid-state characterization of these DPI formulations showed that they were amorphous after spray drying. Azi/NAC and Tobra/NAC form co-amorphous salt systems that were physically stable under storage at stress conditions. For particle characterization, the obtained mass median aerodynamic diameters were in a suitable range for inhalation (< 5.0μm). The multifunctional antibiotic/NAC formulations conserved or improved the antibiotic susceptibility and showed promising results regarding the inhibition of P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Nashrawan Lababidi"},{"name":"Eric Ofosu Kissi"},{"name":"Walid A M Elgaher"},{"name":"Valentin Sigal"},{"name":"Jörg Haupenthal"},{"name":"Bianca C Schwarz"},{"name":"Anna K H Hirsch"},{"name":"Thomas Rades"},{"name":"Marc Schneider"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotics"},{"word":"Bacterial infection"},{"word":"Co-amorphous drug delivery"},{"word":"Dry-powder formulation"},{"word":"Inhalation"},{"word":"Salt formation"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"31654510","title":"Molecules and Metabolites from Natural Products as Inhibitors of Biofilm in Candida spp. pathogens.","date":"2020-02-12","abs":"Biofilm is a critical virulence factor associated with the strains of Candida spp. pathogens as it confers significant resistance to the pathogen against antifungal drugs.","authors":[{"name":"Rajeev K Singla"},{"name":"Ashok K Dubey"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-Candida metabolites"},{"word":"Antifungaldrugs"},{"word":"Biofilm inhibitors"},{"word":"Candida-biofilm"},{"word":"Natural products"},{"word":"Virulence factor."}]},"article391":{"pmid":"31653861","title":"Unexpected large evasion fluxes of carbon dioxide from turbulent streams draining the world's mountains.","date":"2020-01-27","abs":"Inland waters, including streams and rivers, are active components of the global carbon cycle.

Here, we inactivated the SK gene of the TCS MtrAB, mtrB, generating the strain ΔmtrB We show that mtrB loss reduces the bacterium's ability to survive in macrophages and increases its association with autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Notably, the ΔmtrB strain was markedly defective in establishing lung infection in mice, with no detectable lung pathology following aerosol challenge. ΔmtrB was less able to withstand hypoxic and acid stresses and to form biofilms and had decreased viability under hypoxia. Transcriptional profiling of ΔmtrB by gene microarray analysis, validated by quantitative RT-PCR, indicated down-regulation of the hypoxia-associated dosR regulon, as well as genes associated with other pathways linked to adaptation of M. tuberculosis to the host environment. Using in vitro biochemical assays, we demonstrate that MtrB interacts with DosR (a noncognate RR) in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that MtrB enhances the binding of DosR to the hspX promoter, suggesting an unexpected role of MtrB in DosR-regulated gene expression in M. tuberculosis Taken together, these findings indicate that MtrB functions as a regulator of DosR-dependent gene expression and in the adaptation of M. tuberculosis to hypoxia and the host environment. We propose that MtrB may be exploited as a chemotherapeutic target against tuberculosis.","authors":[{"name":"Srijon Kaushik Banerjee"},{"name":"Suruchi Lata"},{"name":"Arun Kumar Sharma"},{"name":"Shreya Bagchi"},{"name":"Manish Kumar"},{"name":"Sanjaya Kumar Sahu"},{"name":"Debasree Sarkar"},{"name":"Pushpa Gupta"},{"name":"Kuladip Jana"},{"name":"Umesh Datta Gupta"},{"name":"Ramandeep Singh"},{"name":"Sudipto Saha"},{"name":"Joyoti Basu"},{"name":"Manikuntala Kundu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MtrB"},{"word":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"word":"bacterial persistence"},{"word":"bacterial signal transduction"},{"word":"bacterial survival"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dormancy"},{"word":"hypoxia"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"sensor kinase"},{"word":"two component system"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"31653277","title":"Evaluation of polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA) and glycerol teichoic acid (Gly-TA) arisen antibodies to prevention of biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis as opportunistic pathogens, notable for their frequency and severity of infections are recognized as the most usual reasons for medical device-associated infections that strike hospitalized patients and also immunocompromised individuals.

The microbial profile of 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed a persistent infection with Gardnerella and other bacterial taxa such as Atopobium and Bifidobacterium. In addition, taxonomic and functional analysis by whole metagenome sequencing in the endometrial fluid sample collected before one clinical miscarriage suggested the presence of multiple Gardnerella vaginalis clades with a greater abundance of clade 4, usually associated with metronidazole resistance.

The truncated 19-mer derived from the N-terminus exhibited similar antimicrobial potency when compared to the parent peptide, but the haemolytic effect of this truncated peptide was significantly decreased. Based on previous studies, the charge and hydrophobicity of truncated derivatives can affect the bioactivity of these peptides and thus we designed a 10-mer derivative with an optimised positive charge and a cyclohexylalanine (Cha) at the C-terminus for enhancing the hydrophobicity, DMPC-10A, which retained the antimicrobial activity of the parent peptide. To further investigate the influence of Cha at the C-terminus on activity, it was substituted by alanine (Ala) to generate another derivative, DMPC-10, but this was found to be much less potent.

In RAS, the majority of water volume is circulated via mechanical and biological filters and reused in the tanks. However, the prevention and treatment of diseases in these systems are challenging, as the pathogens spread throughout the system, and the addition of chemicals and antibiotics disrupts the microbiome of the biofilters. The increasing antibiotic resistance has made phage therapy a relevant alternative for antibiotics in food production. Indeed, as host-specific and self-replicating agent they might be optimal for targeted pathogen eradication in RAS. We tested the survival and spread of Flavobacterium columnare -infecting phage FCL-2 in recirculating aquaculture fish farm with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in a fully controlled study. After a single addition, phage persisted in water samples collected from tank, fixed bed, moving bed, and aeration unit up to 14 days, and in the water of rearing tanks, rainbow trout mucus, and bioreactor carrier media from the fixed and moving bed biofilters for 21 days. Furthermore, phage adsorbed preferentially to moving bed carrier media, which contained biofilm attached and from which higher phage numbers were recovered.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests were conducted to confirm antifungal activity against Candida species. In all the tested species, the silver nanoparticles inhibited the growth of Candida. Moreover, the SEM images of Candida species treated with silver nanoparticles synthesized using natural extracts of Lycopersicon esculentum showed that silver nanoparticles adhered to the surface of Candida, which induced pore formation in the membranes and prevented their normal growth. Ultimately, these abnormal forms of Candida were thought to be less able to form biofilms than normal Candida. The antifungal and antibiofilm activities of silver nanoparticles against Candida are expected to be utilized in various fields and contribute in particular to developments in nanomedicine.","authors":[{"name":"Jeong Su Choi"},{"name":"Ji Woong Lee"},{"name":"Un Chul Shin"},{"name":"Min Woo Lee"},{"name":"Dae Jin Kim"},{"name":"Suhng Wook Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"Lycopersicon esculentum"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"}]},"article398":{"pmid":"31652713","title":"A New Bioactive Complex between Zn(II) and a Fluorescent Symmetrical Benzanthrone Tripod for an Antibacterial Textile.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"A new fluorescent Zn(II) complex of symmetrical tripod form based on a 3-substituted benzanthrone (BT) has been synthesized and characterised.

Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut-oral microbiota and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritides, and psoriasis), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties. An association between abundance of oral Porphyromonas gingivalis and intestinal Prevotella copri in RA patients compared to healthy controls has been clearly demonstrated. These new findings open important future horizons both for understanding disease pathophysiology and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies. The changes and decreased diversity of oral and gut microbiota seem to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of RA and OA. However, specific microbial clusters and biomarkers belonging to oral and gut microbiota need to be further investigated to highlight the mechanisms related to alterations in bones and joints inflammatory pathway.","authors":[{"name":"Drago Lorenzo"},{"name":"Zuccotti GianVincenzo"},{"name":"Romanò Carlo Luca"},{"name":"Goswami Karan"},{"name":"Villafane Jorge"},{"name":"Mattina Roberto"},{"name":"Parvizi Javad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"gut microbiota"},{"word":"joint inflammation"},{"word":"microbiota axis"},{"word":"oral microbiota arthritis"}]}}
