However, current self-etching adhesives in orthodontic treatments have no antibacterial activity. The objectives of this study were to develop a self-etching and antibacterial orthodontic adhesive, and to investigate its enamel bond strength and antibacterial properties. A novel quaternary ammonium monomer dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) was incorporated into a commercial self-etching adhesive (Adper Easy One, 3M).

However, biofilms are often considered a single entity when their role in biogeochemical transformations is assessed, even though these biofilms harbour functionally diverse microbial communities (Battin, Besemer, Bengtsson, Romani, & Packmann, ; Veach, Stegen, Brown, Dodds, & Jumpponen, ). Often overlooked are the biotic interactions among biofilm components that can affect ecosystem-scale processes such as primary production and nutrient cycling. These interactions are likely to be especially important under resource limitation. Light is a primary resource mediating algal photosynthesis and both phototrophic and heterotrophic production due to bacterial reliance on C-rich algal exudates (Cole, ). However, current understanding of function-structure linkages in streams has yet to unravel the relative degree of these microbial feedbacks under resource availability gradients. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Bengtsson, Wagner, Schwab, Urich, and Battin () studied stream biofilm responses to light availability to understand its impact across three domains of life. By integrating biogeochemical rate estimation and metatranscriptomics within a microcosm experiment, they were able to link primary production and nutrient uptake rates to algal and bacterial metabolic processes and specify what taxa contributed to gene expression. Under low light, diatoms and cyanobacteria upregulated photosynthetic machinery and diatom-specific chloroplast rRNA suggesting heightened transcriptional activity under light limitation to maintain phototrophic energy demands. Under high light, heterotrophic bacteria upregulated mRNAs related to phosphorous (P) metabolism while biofilm P uptake increased indicating high bacterial-specific P demand when algal biomass was high. Together, these results indicate that biogeochemical function is mediated by complex microbial interactions across trophic levels.","authors":[{"name":"Allison M Veach"},{"name":"Natalie A Griffiths"}],"keywords":[]},"article4":{"pmid":"29998422","title":"Function and Regulation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Cell Surface Structures that Promote Attachment.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Agrobacterium tumefaciens attaches stably to plant host tissues and abiotic surfaces. During pathogenesis, physical attachment to the site of infection is a prerequisite to infection and horizontal gene transfer to the plant. Virulent and avirulent strains may also attach to plant tissue in more benign plant associations, and as with other soil microbes, to soil surfaces in the terrestrial environment. Although most A. tumefaciens virulence functions are encoded on the tumor-inducing plasmid, genes that direct general surface attachment are chromosomally encoded, and thus this process is not obligatorily tied to virulence, but is a more fundamental capacity. Several different cellular structures are known or suspected to contribute to the attachment process. The flagella influence surface attachment primarily via their propulsive activity, but control of their rotation during the transition to the attached state may be quite complex. A. tumefaciens produces several pili, including the Tad-type Ctp pili, and several plasmid-borne conjugal pili encoded by the Ti and At plasmids, as well as the so-called T-pilus, involved in interkingdom horizontal gene transfer. The Ctp pili promote reversible interactions with surfaces, whereas the conjugal and T-pili drive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) interactions with other cells and tissues. The T-pilus is likely to contribute to physical association with plant tissues during DNA transfer to plants. A. tumefaciens can synthesize a variety of polysaccharides including cellulose, curdlan (β-1,3 glucan), β-1,2 glucan (cyclic and linear), succinoglycan, and a localized polysaccharide(s) that is confined to a single cellular pole and is called the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP). Lipopolysaccharides are also in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. Cellulose and curdlan production can influence attachment under certain conditions. The UPP is required for stable attachment under a range of conditions and on abiotic and biotic surfaces. Other factors that have been reported to play a role in attachment include the elusive protein called rhicadhesin. The process of surface attachment is under extensive regulatory control and can be modulated by environmental conditions, as well as by direct responses to surface contact. Complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional control circuitry underlies much of the production and deployment of these attachment functions.","authors":[{"name":"Melene A Thompson"},{"name":"Maureen C Onyeziri"},{"name":"Clay Fuqua"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Attachment"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Cell surface structures"},{"word":"Regulation"}]},"article5":{"pmid":"29998093","title":"Microbial Interaction as a Determinant of the Quality of Supply Drinking Water: A Conceptual Analysis.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"This conceptual analysis elucidates the microbial interaction inside municipal distribution pipes, subsequent deterioration in the quality of the supply water, and its impacts on public health.

In this study we investigated curli production in a unique collection of soil-persistent E. coli isolates and examined the role of curli formation in environmental persistence. Although most soil-persistent E. coli were curli-positive, 10% of isolates were curli-negative (17 out of 170). Curli-producing E. coli (COB583, COB585, and BW25113) displayed significantly more attachment to quartz sand than the curli-negative strains. Long-term soil survival experiments indicated that curli production was not required for long-term survival in live soil (over 110 days), as a curli-negative mutant BW25113ΔcsgB had similar survival compared to wild type BW25113. Mutations in two genes associated with c-di-GMP metabolism, dgcE and pdeR, correlated with loss of curli in eight soil-persistent strains, although this did not significantly impair their survival in soil compared to curli-positive strains. Overall, the data indicate that curli-deficient and biofilm-defective strains, that also have a defect in attachment to quartz sand, are able to reside in soil for long periods of time thus pointing to the possibility that niches may exist in the soil that can support long-term survival independently of biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Yinka M Somorin"},{"name":"Tara Vollmerhausen"},{"name":"Nicholas Waters"},{"name":"Leighton Pritchard"},{"name":"Florence Abram"},{"name":"Fiona Brennan"},{"name":"Conor O'Byrne"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"RpoS"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"curli"},{"word":"soil"}]},"article10":{"pmid":"29997579","title":"Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy to Control Clinically Relevant Biofilm Infections.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilm describes a microbially-derived sessile community in which microbial cells are firmly attached to the substratum and embedded in extracellular polymeric matrix.

Antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy (aPDT) had been recently proposed to combat clinically relevant biofilms such as dental biofilms, ventilator associated pneumonia, chronic wound infections, oral candidiasis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. aPDT uses non-toxic dyes called photosensitizers (PS), which can be excited by harmless visible light to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). aPDT is a multi-stage process including topical PS administration, light irradiation, and interaction of the excited state with ambient oxygen. Numerous in vitro and in vivo aPDT studies have demonstrated biofilm-eradication or substantial reduction. ROS are produced upon photo-activation and attack adjacent targets, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids present within the biofilm matrix, on the cell surface and inside the microbial cells.

A de novo transcriptome assembly was performed, where sequenced sample reads were assembled into an ~11.5-Mb transcriptome consisting of 5,848 genes. Differential expression (DE) analysis demonstrated that 791 and 464 genes were upregulated in biofilm formation and planktonic cells, respectively, with a minimum 2-fold change. Adhesin-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell wall genes were upregulated at all time points of biofilm formation. As the biofilm developed into intermediate and mature stages, a number of genes encoding efflux pumps were upregulated, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters. When we assessed efflux pump activity biochemically, biofilm efflux was greater than that of planktonic cells at 12 and 24 h.

Comparable richness and evenness of bacterial communities were observed on M. verticillatum and bio-cord, both being higher than for free-living bacteria in the water column but lower than for bacteria in the surface sediment. The highest similarity of bacterial community composition and structure also occurred between M. verticillatum and the bio-cord, dominated by α- and γ-proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Bacteroidetes. Firmicutes and Planctomycetes, respectively, were the exclusive abundant phyla in M. verticillatum and the bio-cord, probably indicating the unique interaction between M. verticillatum and their epiphytic bacteria. Some abundant genera, such as Roseomonas, Pseudomonas, and Rhodopirellula, which were exclusively observed in M. verticillatum or the bio-cord, have been reported to have the same capacity to remove nitrogen and organic matter in wastewater treatment systems. In conclusion, in the studied eco-ditch, the bio-cord was found to play a similar role as submerged macrophytes in harboring bacterial assemblages, and we therefore propose that bio-cord may be a good alternative or supplement to enhance wastewater treatment in agricultural ditches.","authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhou"},{"name":"Chengrong Bai"},{"name":"Jian Cai"},{"name":"Yang Hu"},{"name":"Keqiang Shao"},{"name":"Guang Gao"},{"name":"Erik Jeppesen"},{"name":"Xiangming Tang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Artificial carrier"},{"word":"Biofilm bacterial community"},{"word":"Ecological ditch system"},{"word":"Myriophyllum verticillatum L."}]},"article30":{"pmid":"29992358","title":"Exopolysaccharides of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.","date":"2019-06-13","abs":"Agrobacterium exopolysaccharides play a major role in the life of the cell.

In this work, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotics to control multidrug-resistant E. coli and reduce their ability to form biofilms. Six E. coli resistant to at least five antibiotics (Ceftazidime, Ampicillin, Clarithromycin, Amoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid and Ceftriaxone) were isolated in this work.

Two E. coli isolates, namely E. coli WW1 and IC2, which were most resistant to all antibiotics were subjected to antibiofilm experiments. Interestingly, the CFSM of MRS fermented by all probiotics resulted in inhibition of biofilm formation while B. longum caused highest inhibition (57.94%) in case of E. coli IC2 biofilms and L. plantarum was responsible for 64.57% reduction of E. coli WW1 biofilms.

Biofilm structures were examined at different stages in their development (H3, H24, H48, H72, H96 and H144) using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in conjunction with fluorescent dyes for live cells (SYTO 9), dead cells (propidium iodide), proteins (fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I), lipids (DiD'oil), α-polysaccharides (concanavalin A, tetramethylrhodamine conjugate), and β-polysaccharides (calcofluor white M2R).

The largest biovolume of live cells was also detected at H72 (128,110.3 ± 4,969.1 μm3), decreasing thereafter, which was probably owing to the detachment of cells prior to a new phase of colonization.

The scattering is interpreted as originating from PGM fiber-like structures that adopt rod-like bottle-brush conformation in dilute solutions. On the basis of the knowledge about molecular structure of mucins and SAXS data for dilute solutions, we propose a theoretical model for predicting mucin conformation in solution and calculate the corresponding scattering profile. This bottle-brush model comprises a protein backbone with carbohydrate side chains and corresponding structural parameters, such as grafting distance and lengths of the backbone and side chains. It describes the experimental PGM data from dilute solutions in the full q range very well. It furthermore suggests that the carbohydrate side chains are grafted with a regular separation of around 5 nm and a length of 14 nm. The cross-section size with a radius of about 1 nm is also in accordance with the size of the carbohydrate units. Structuring of PGM solutions at higher concentrations was investigated by analyzing semidilute and concentrated PGM samples. Starting at about 20 wt %, Bragg peaks become clearly visible indicating a more ordered mucin system. In very dehydrated and fully dry mucin samples these peaks are not present indicating lack of long-range order. The SAXS data show that the structural change occurring at about 80 wt % mucin and 25 °C corresponds to a glass transition in agreement with our previous calorimetric results. Temperature also has an effect on the phase behavior of mucin. At intermediate levels of hydration, a phase transition is observed at about 60-70 °C.

By exploiting E. faecalis wild-type and mutant cells, we demonstrate that reduced demethylmenaquinone in the respiratory chain in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is crucial for the EET.

Thus, we describe novel nanostructures, a fusion of copper and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which increase antimicrobial activity against biofilms without being toxic to human cells. Simulations based on the stochastic response were performed to predict the efficiency of synthesizing nanostructures. The synthesized Cu/MWCNTs inhibit the growth of Methylobacterium spp., which forms biofilms; antimicrobial testing and cytotoxicity assessments showed that the Cu/MWCNTs were not cytotoxic to human cells. The Cu/MWCNTs come in direct contact with the bacterial cell surface, damage the cell wall, and cause secondary oxidation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the Cu/MWCNTs release copper ions, which inhibit the quorum sensing in Methylobacterium spp., thereby inhibiting the expression of the genes that form biofilms. Additionally, we confirmed excellent electrical and thermal conductivity of Cu/MWCNTs as well as biofilm removal efficiency in the microfluidic channel.","authors":[{"name":"Youngmin Seo"},{"name":"Jangsun Hwang"},{"name":"Eunwon Lee"},{"name":"Young Jin Kim"},{"name":"Kyungwoo Lee"},{"name":"Chanhwi Park"},{"name":"Yonghyun Choi"},{"name":"Hojeong Jeon"},{"name":"Jonghoon Choi"}],"keywords":[]},"article64":{"pmid":"29985417","title":"The inducible chemical-genetic fluorescent marker FAST outperforms classical fluorescent proteins in the quantitative reporting of bacterial biofilm dynamics.","date":"2019-10-11","abs":"To increase our understanding of bacterial biofilm complexity, real- time quantitative analyses of the living community functions are required. To reach this goal, accurate fluorescent reporters are needed. In this paper, we used the classical fluorescent genetic reporters of the GFP family and demonstrated their limits in the context of a living biofilm. We showed that fluorescence signal saturated after only a few hours of growth and related this saturation to the reduction of oxygen concentration induced by bacterial consumption. This behaviour prevents the use of GFP-like fluorescent proteins for quantitative measurement in living biofilms. To overcome this limitation, we propose the use of a recently introduced small protein tag, FAST, which is fluorescent in the presence of an exogenously applied fluorogenic dye, enabling to avoid the oxygen sensitivity issue. We compared the ability of FAST to report on biofilm growth with that of GFP and mCherry, and demonstrated the superiority of the FAST:fluorogen probes for investigating dynamics in the complex environment of a living biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Amaury Monmeyran"},{"name":"Philippe Thomen"},{"name":"Hugo Jonquière"},{"name":"Franck Sureau"},{"name":"Chenge Li"},{"name":"Marie-Aude Plamont"},{"name":"Carine Douarche"},{"name":"Jean-François Casella"},{"name":"Arnaud Gautier"},{"name":"Nelly Henry"}],"keywords":[]},"article65":{"pmid":"29985324","title":"Oral Biofilm Formation on Different Materials for Dental Implants.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Dental implants and their prosthetic components are prone to bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. The use of materials that provides low microbial adhesion may reduce the prevalence and progression of peri-implant diseases.

This article describes a series of protocols implemented for comparing oral biofilm formation on titanium and ceramic materials for prosthetic abutments, as well as the methods involved in oral biofilms analyses at the morphological and cellular levels. The in situ model to evaluate oral biofilm formation on titanium and zirconia materials for dental prosthesis abutments as described in this study provides a satisfactory preservation of the 48 h biofilm, thereby demonstrating methodological adequacy. Multiphoton microscopy allows the analysis of an area representative of the biofilm formed on the test materials. In addition, the use of fluorophores and the processing of the images using multiphoton microscopy allows the analysis of the bacterial viability in a very heterogeneous population of microorganisms. The preparation of biological specimens for electron microscopy promotes the structural preservation of biofilm, images with good resolution, and no artifacts.","authors":[{"name":"Thalisson S O Silva"},{"name":"Alice R Freitas"},{"name":"Marília L L Pinheiro"},{"name":"Cássio do Nascimento"},{"name":"Evandro Watanabe"},{"name":"Rubens F Albuquerque"}],"keywords":[]},"article66":{"pmid":"29984114","title":"Fungi in the Wound Microbiome.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Lindsay Kalan"},{"name":"Elizabeth A Grice"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronic wounds"},{"word":"fungi"},{"word":"microbiome"}]},"article67":{"pmid":"29984046","title":"Efficacy of an LED toothbrush on a Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm on a sandblasted and acid-etched titanium surface: an in vitro study.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of a newly devised toothbrush with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on Porphyromonas gingivalis attached to sandblasted and acid-etched titanium surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Hae Lee"},{"name":"Yong-Gun Kim"},{"name":"Heung-Sik Um"},{"name":"Beom-Seok Chang"},{"name":"Si Young Lee"},{"name":"Jae-Kwan Lee"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Erythrosine"},{"word":"Photochemotherapy"},{"word":"Porphyromonas gingivalis"},{"word":"Toothbrushing"}]},"article68":{"pmid":"29983434","title":"Biofilm Production and Antimicrobial Resistance among Uropathogens in Pediatric Cases: a Hospital Based Study.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"The study was designed to provide account of etiological agents of urinary tract infection in pediatric patients and the antimicrobial resistance pattern plus biofilm producing profile of the isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Dhiraj Shrestha"},{"name":"Pratigya Thapa"},{"name":"Dinesh Bhandari"},{"name":"Hiramani Parajuli"},{"name":"Prakash Chaudhary"},{"name":"Kabi Thapa"},{"name":"Vijay Kumar Sharma"},{"name":"Pradip Kumar Shah"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AMR; antimicrobial resistance; biofilm; urinary tract infection; UTI."}]},"article69":{"pmid":"29983233","title":"Sequence-based identification, genotyping and virulence factors of Trichosporon asahii strains isolated from urine samples of hospitalized patients (2011-2016).","date":"2019-01-11","abs":"Trichosporon asahii is the most common species that causes trichosporonosis.","authors":[{"name":"G Hazirolan"},{"name":"N Koçak"},{"name":"A Karagöz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Genotyping"},{"word":"Intergenic spacer 1 region"},{"word":"Sequence-based identification"},{"word":"Trichosporon asahii"},{"word":"Virulence factors"}]},"article70":{"pmid":"29982994","title":"Cloning and characterization of short-chain N-acyl homoserine lactone-producing Enterobacter asburiae strain L1 from lettuce leaves.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"In gram-negative bacteria, bacterial communication or quorum sensing (QS) is achieved using common signaling molecules known as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL).

Analysis of a tfb3 insertion mutant showed that genes encoding proteins of the Ups pili and the Ced DNA importer are no longer induced in a tfb3 insertion mutant after UV treatment, which was confirmed by aggregation assays. Thus, TFB3 plays a crucial role in the activation of these genes. Genome wide transcriptome analysis allowed a differentiation between a TFB3-dependent and a TFB3-independent early UV response. The TFB3-dependent UV response is characterized by the early induction of TFB3, followed by TFB3-dependent expression of genes involved in e.g. Ups pili formation and the Ced DNA importer.

We analyzed the phenotypic susceptibility of 782 Escherichia coli isolates against 24 antimicrobials and we measured the relative abundances of five ARGs in water and sediment extracts of a small stream. We did not find evidence for a general increase in the proportion of resistant E. coli isolated from sediments as compared to those found in stream water. For most antimicrobials, the likelihood of detecting a resistant isolate was similar in water and sediment or it was even lower in the latter compartment. The mean relative abundance of ARGs was moderately increased in sediment-borne samples. Generally, absolute abundances of resistant cells and resistance genes in the sediment exceeded the pelagic level owing to higher bacterial densities.

Mat samples were collected from 15 meltwater stream sites, comprising a natural gradient from ultraoligotrophic glacier flows to meltwater streams exposed to anthropogenic activities. Our analyses show that microbial community structure differences between mats are explained by environmental NH4+, NO3-, DIN, soluble reactive silicon and conductivity. Microbial mats living under ultraoligotrophic meltwater conditions did not exhibit a dominance of cyanobacterial photoautotrophs, as has been documented for other Antarctic limnetic microbial mats. Instead, ultraoligotrophic mat communities were characterized by the presence of microbes recognized as heterotrophs and photoheterotrophs. This suggests that microbial capabilities for recycling organic matter may be a key factor to dwell in ultra-low nutrient conditions.

Here, we identify potential pathogenicity mechanisms and demonstrate the direct regulation of several virulence factors by temperature with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), RNAi, pyoverdine (PVD) quantification, the chrome azurol S (CAS) assay, growth curve measurements, a biofilm assay, and artificial infection. The principal component analysis, the heat map generation and hierarchical clustering, together with the functional annotations of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) demonstrated that, under different growth temperatures, the animation and focus of P. plecoglossicida are quite different, which may be the key to pathogenicity. Genes involved in PVD synthesis and in the type VI secretion system (T6SS) are specifically upregulated at the virulent temperature of 18°C. Silencing of the PVD-synthesis-related genes reduces the iron acquisition, growth, biofilm formation, distribution in host organs and virulence of the bacteria. Silencing of the T6SS genes also leads to the reduction of biofilm formation, distribution in host organs and virulence. These findings reveal that temperature regulates multiple virulence mechanisms in P. plecoglossicida, especially through iron acquisition and T6SS secretion. Meanwhile, integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data provide us with a new perspective into the pathogenesis of P. plecoglossicida, which would not have been easy to catch at either the protein or mRNA differential analyses alone, thus illustrating the power of multi-omics analyses in microbiology.","authors":[{"name":"Lixing Huang"},{"name":"Wenjia Liu"},{"name":"Qingling Jiang"},{"name":"Yanfei Zuo"},{"name":"Yongquan Su"},{"name":"Lingmin Zhao"},{"name":"Yingxue Qin"},{"name":"Qingpi Yan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas plecoglossicida"},{"word":"proteomics"},{"word":"temperature"},{"word":"transcriptome"},{"word":"virulence"},{"word":"white nodules disease"}]},"article91":{"pmid":"29977590","title":"Targeted disruption of the extracellular polymeric network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by alginate oligosaccharides.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Acquisition of a mucoid phenotype by Pseudomonas sp. in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with subsequent over-production of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), plays an important role in mediating the persistence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections.

Although the emergence of this variant was not directly linked to the presence of P. amylolyticus, its establishment in the coculture enhanced the productivity of both species due to mutations that stimulated biofilm formation.

Examinations of the biofilm formed in cocultures of P. amylolyticus and the new variant of X. retroflexus revealed a distinct spatial organisation: P. amylolyticus only resided in biofilms in association with X. retroflexus and occupied the outer layers. The X. retroflexus variant therefore facilitated increased P. amylolyticus growth as it produced more biofilm biomass. The increase in X. retroflexus biomass was thus not at the expense of P. amylolyticus, demonstrating that interspecies interactions can shape diversification in a mutualistic coculture and reinforce these interactions, ultimately resulting in enhanced communal performance.","authors":[{"name":"Henriette L Røder"},{"name":"Jakob Herschend"},{"name":"Jakob Russel"},{"name":"Michala F Andersen"},{"name":"Jonas S Madsen"},{"name":"Søren J Sørensen"},{"name":"Mette Burmølle"}],"keywords":[]},"article97":{"pmid":"29976956","title":"Synthetic antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) against S. mutans and S. sobrinus inhibit caries formation.","date":"2019-10-28","abs":"Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus are the main causative agents of human dental caries.

Peptide loading and release, as well as the consequences of these processes on the microgel and peptide properties, were studied by in situ ellipsometry, confocal microscopy, zeta potential measurements, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results show that the microgel-peptide interactions are electrostatically dominated, thus promoted at higher microgel charge density, while PEGylation suppresses peptide binding. PEGylation also enhances the α-helix induction observed for KYE28 upon microgel incorporation. Additionally, peptide release is facilitated at physiological salt concentration, particularly so for KYE28PEG, which illustrates the importance of electrostatic interactions. In vitro studies on Escherichia coli show that the microgel-modified surfaces display potent antifouling properties in both the absence and presence of the incorporated peptide. While contact killing dominates at low ionic strength for the peptide-loaded microgels, released peptides also provide antimicrobial activity in bulk at a high ionic strength. Additionally, KYE28- and KYE28PEG-loaded microgels display anti-inflammatory effects on human monocytes.

The major cause of biofouling is the irreversible attachment of recalcitrant biofilms formed by bacteria and their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on membrane surfaces. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and protobiofilms are recently identified as important precursors of membrane fouling. Despite considerable amount of research on SWRO biofouling, the control of biofouling still remains a challenge. While adoption of better pretreatment methods may help in preventing membrane biofouling in new desalination setups, it is also crucial to effectively disperse old, recalcitrant biofilms and prolong membrane life in operational plants. Most current practices employ the use of broad spectrum biocides and chemicals that target bacterial cells to disperse mature biofilms, which are evidently inefficient. EPS, being known as the strongest structural framework of biofilms, it is essential to breakdown and disintegrate the EPS components for effective biofilm removal. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand the chemical composition and key elements that constitute the EPS of major biofouling bacterial groups in multi-species, mature biofilms. However, significant gaps in understanding the complexity of EPS are evident by the failure to achieve effective prevention and mitigation of fouling in most cases. Some of the reasons may be difficulty in sampling membranes from fully operational full-scale plants, poor understanding of microbial communities and their ecological shifts under dynamic operational conditions within the desalination process, selection of inappropriate model species for laboratory-scale biofouling studies, and the laborious process of extraction and purification of EPS. This article reviews the novel findings on key aspects of SWRO membrane fouling and control measures with particular emphasis on the key sugars in EPS. As a novel strategy to alleviate biofouling, future control methods may be aimed towards specifically disintegrating and breaking down these key sugars rather than using broad spectrum chemicals such as biocides that are currently used in the industry.","authors":[{"name":"Veena Nagaraj"},{"name":"Lucy Skillman"},{"name":"Dan Li"},{"name":"Goen Ho"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Control"},{"word":"Desalination"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)"},{"word":"Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes"}]},"article100":{"pmid":"29974750","title":"Behavior of Marine Bacteria in Clean Environment and Oil Spill Conditions.","date":"2019-03-22","abs":"Alcanivorax borkumensis is a bacterial community that dominates hydrocarbon-degrading communities around many oil spills.

Limitations include the need for photosensitizer proximity to tissue because of the short (3.5 μs) lifetime of singlet oxygen in contact with water; the strong optical absorption of the photosensitizer, which limits the penetration depth; and hypoxic environments that restrict the concentration of available oxygen. In this article, we describe a novel superhydrophobic singlet oxygen delivery device for the selective inactivation of bacterial biofilms. The device addresses the current limitations by: immobilizing photosensitizer molecules onto inert silica particles; embedding the photosensitizer-containing particles into the plastron (i.e. the fluid-free space within a superhydrophobic surface between the solid substrate and fluid layer); distributing the particles along an optically transparent substrate such that they can be uniformly illuminated; enabling the penetration of oxygen via the contiguous vapor space defined by the plastron; and stabilizing the superhydrophobic state while avoiding the direct contact of the sensitizer to biomaterials. In this way, singlet oxygen generated on the sensitizer-containing particles can diffuse across the plastron and kill bacteria even deep within the hypoxic periodontal pockets. For the first time, we demonstrate complete biofilm inactivation (>5 log killing) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium implicated in periodontal disease using the superhydrophobic singlet oxygen delivery device.

The goals of this study were to investigate the potential role of VicR in the regulation of adjacent downstream genes and evaluate transcription levels of vicR during planktonic and biofilm growth. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to investigate whether vicRKX and adjacent downstream genes were cotranscribed. Binding of purified recombinant VicR protein to promoter regions of vicR, rnc, and syfA genes was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and by chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses. VicR antisense (AS vicR) RNA was detected by Northern blotting and qRT-PCR assays. AS vicR overexpression mutants were constructed, and the biofilm biomass was determined by crystal violet microtiter assay. Adjacent downstream genes rnc, smc, syfA, smu.1511, and syfB were cotranscribed with vicRKX. The predicted promoter regions of vicR, rnc, and syfA genes were directly regulated by VicR. An AS vicR RNA transcript was detected upstream of the rnc gene. Expression of the AS vicR RNA transcript was elevated in planktonic cultures and repressed during biofilm growth. In addition, Western blot data showed that expression of the VicR protein decreased by 35% in planktonic as compared with biofilm cultures. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of AS vicR led to a reduction in biofilm formation. The downstream genes rnc, smc, syfA, smu.1511, and syfB are cotranscribed with vicRKX. VicR is autophosphorylated, and rnc and syfA are directly regulated by VicR. Expression of VicR protein correlated inversely with different levels of AS vicR RNA transcript and growth conditions.

Recently, a class of LuxI homologs has been shown to use CoA-linked aromatic or amino acid substrates for AHL synthesis. By using an informatics approach, we found the CoA class of LuxI homologs exists primarily in α-Proteobacteria. The genome of Prosthecomicrobium hirschii, a dimorphic prosthecate bacterium, possesses a luxI-like AHL synthase gene that we predicted to encode a CoA-utilizing enzyme.

However, given that bacteria can survive well in aquatic environments independently of their hosts, bacterial diseases have become major impediments to aquaculture development. On the other hand, the indiscriminate uses of antimicrobial agents has led to resistant strains and the need to switch to other antibiotics, although it seems that an integrated approach that considers not only the pathogen but also the host and the environment will be the most effective method in the long-term to improve aquatic animal health. This review covers the mechanisms of bacterial pathogenicity and details the foundations underlying the interactions occurring between pathogenic bacteria and the fish host in the aquatic environment, as well as the factors that influence virulence.

Colony biofilms represent an ideal system for studying molecular mechanisms and regulations involved in development and internal organization of biofilm structure as well as those that are involved in fungal domestication. We have identified here antagonistic functional interactions between transcriptional regulators Cyc8p and Tup1p that modulate the life-style of natural S. cerevisiae strains between biofilm and domesticated mode. Herein, strains with different levels of Cyc8p and Tup1p regulators were constructed, analyzed for processes involved in colony biofilm development and used in the identification of modes of regulation of Flo11p, a key adhesin in biofilm formation. Our data show that Tup1p and Cyc8p regulate biofilm formation in the opposite manner, being positive and negative regulators of colony complexity, cell-cell interaction and adhesion to surfaces. Notably, in-depth analysis of regulation of expression of Flo11p adhesin revealed that Cyc8p itself is the key repressor of FLO11 expression, whereas Tup1p counteracts Cyc8p's repressive function and, in addition, counters Flo11p degradation by an extracellular protease. Interestingly, the opposing actions of Tup1p and Cyc8p concern processes crucial to the biofilm mode of yeast multicellularity, whereas other multicellular processes such as cell flocculation are co-repressed by both regulators. This study provides insight into the mechanisms regulating complexity of the biofilm lifestyle of yeast grown on semisolid surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Phu Van Nguyen"},{"name":"Otakar Hlaváček"},{"name":"Jana Maršíková"},{"name":"Libuše Váchová"},{"name":"Zdena Palková"}],"keywords":[]},"article127":{"pmid":"29965780","title":"Salmonella enterica Contamination of Market Fresh Tomatoes: A Review.","date":"2019-11-05","abs":"Salmonella contamination associated with market fresh tomatoes has been problematic for the industry and consumers.

Moreover, protein (PN) and DNA in the EPS, TB-EPS, and LB-EPS decreased with an increasing temperature. Carbohydrates (PS) in the EPS and LB-EPS increased as temperature increased, nevertheless, PS in TB-EPS decreased. Furthermore, 25℃ was identified as the breaking-point temperature in the variation of PN, DNA and PS concentrations. At 15℃ and 25℃, PN was the main component in TB-EPS and LB-EPS. PS has the second highest concentration and DNA the least. However, PS were the dominant component at 35℃, with PN having the second highest concentration, and DNA having a subtle concentration. Moreover, at 15℃ and 25℃, the EPS content increased in the nitrification process and reduced in the denitrification process.","authors":[{"name":"Hong-Wei Sun"},{"name":"Cui-Zhong Chen"},{"name":"Chang-Feng Wu"},{"name":"Hua-Nan Zhao"},{"name":"Xue Yu"},{"name":"Xiao-Hang Fang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biological denitrification"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substance"},{"word":"nitrite accumulation rate"},{"word":"temperature"}]},"article138":{"pmid":"29965369","title":"[Applicability and Microbial Community Structure of Denitrification Suspended Carriers].","date":"2018-11-20","abs":"In order to investigate the effects of temperature and organic loading on the bioactivity reactivation of anoxic biofilm in suspended carriers, the experiment was carried out under low organic loading, shock loading and low temperature conditions.

Previous studies established FapC as the major amyloid subunit, but its mechanism of fibril formation in P. aeruginosa remained largely unexplored. Here, we examine the FapC sequence in greater detail through a combination of bioinformatics and protein engineering, and we identify specific motifs that are implicated in amyloid formation. Sequence regions of high evolutionary conservation tend to coincide with regions of high amyloid propensity, and mutation of amyloidogenic motifs to a designed, non-amyloidogenic motif suppresses fibril formation in a pH-dependent manner. We establish the particular significance of the third repeat motif in promoting fibril formation and also demonstrate emergence of soluble oligomer species early in the aggregation pathway.

Enumeration of colony forming units and metabolic activity using the XTT assay, confirmed growth of bacteria in wounds and showed a significant reduction in viable cells after phage treatment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the growth of biofilms in wounds, and showed phage treatment could significantly reduce the formation of these communities.

Pre- and post-vaccination sera from subjects who experienced recurrence of vulvovaginal candidiasis (R) vs. those who were recurrence-free [non-recurrent (NR)] were evaluated. Anti-Als3p antisera obtained were evaluated for (1) titer and subclass profile and (2) their ability to influence C. albicans virulence traits including hyphal elongation, adherence to plastic, invasion of vaginal epithelial cells, biofilm formation on plastic and catheter material, and susceptibility to neutrophil killing in vitro. Serum IgG titers in NR patients were consistently higher than in R patients, particularly for anti-Als3 subclass IgG2. Sera from vaccinated NR patients reduced hyphal elongation, adhesion to plastic, invasion of vaginal epithelial cells, and biofilm formation significantly more than pre-immune sera, or sera from R- or placebo-group subjects. Pre-adsorption of sera with C. albicans germ tubes eliminated these effects, while heat inactivation did not. Finally, sera from NR subjects enhanced neutrophil-mediated killing of C. albicans relative to pre-immune sera or sera from R patients.

We determined that these molecules were most effective with an amine functionality at R1 and benzene functionalities at R2 and R3. From a library of 188 compounds, we studied the properties of 5 lead agents in detail, observing a fivefold to eightfold decrease in the 90% effective concentration of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and aztreonam toward P. aeruginosa isolates. Additionally, we determined that our molecules were not only active toward P. aeruginosa, but toward Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus as well. The specificity of our molecules to efflux pump inhibition was confirmed using ethidium bromide accumulation assays, and in studies with strains that displayed varying abilities in their efflux potential. When assessing off target effects we observed no disruption of bacterial membrane polarity, no general toxicity toward mammalian cells, and no inhibition of calcium channel activity in human kidney cells. Finally, combination treatment with our lead agents engendered a marked increase in the bactericidal capacity of tetracycline, and significantly decreased viability within P. aeruginosa biofilms. As such, we report a unique polyamine scaffold that has strong potential for the future development of novel and broadly active efflux pump inhibitors targeting multi-drug resistant bacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Renee M Fleeman"},{"name":"Ginamarie Debevec"},{"name":"Kirsten Antonen"},{"name":"Jessie L Adams"},{"name":"Radleigh G Santos"},{"name":"Gregory S Welmaker"},{"name":"Richard A Houghten"},{"name":"Marc A Giulianotti"},{"name":"Lindsey N Shaw"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial resistance"},{"word":"efflux pump inhibitors"},{"word":"efflux pumps"},{"word":"polyamines"},{"word":"potentiation"}]},"article155":{"pmid":"29963022","title":"Experimental Microbial Alteration and Fe Mobilization From Basaltic Rocks of the ICDP HSDP2 Drill Core, Hilo, Hawaii.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The interaction of a single bacterial species (Burkholderia fungorum) with basaltic rocks from the ICDP HSDP2 drill core and synthetic basaltic glasses was investigated in batch laboratory experiments to better understand the role of microbial activity on rock alteration and Fe mobilization. Incubation experiments were performed with drill core basaltic rock samples to investigate differences in the solution chemistry during biotic and abiotic alteration. Additionally, colonization experiments with synthetic basaltic glasses of different Fe redox states and residual stresses were performed to evaluate their influence on microbial activity and surface attachment of cells. In biotic incubation experiments bacterial growth was observed and the release of Fe and other major elements from drill core basaltic rocks to solution exceeded that of abiotic controls only when the rock sample assay was nutrient depleted. The concentration of dissolved major elements in solution in biotic colonization experiments with synthetic basaltic glasses increased with increasing residual stress and Fe(II) content. Furthermore, the concentration of dissolved Fe and Al increased similarly in biotic colonization experiments indicating that their dissolution might be triggered by microbial activity. Surface morphology imaging by SEM revealed that cells on basaltic rocks in incubation experiments were most abundant on the glass and surfaces with high roughness and almost absent on minerals. In colonization experiments, basaltic glasses with residual stress and high Fe(II) content were intensely covered with a cellular biofilm. In contrast, glasses with high Fe(III) content and no residual stress were sparsely colonized. We therefore conclude that structurally bound Fe is most probably used by B. fungorum as a nutrient. Furthermore, we assume that microbial activity overall increased rock dissolution as soon as the environment becomes nutrient depleted. Our results show that besides compositional effects, other factors such as redox state and residual stress can control microbial alteration of basaltic glasses.","authors":[{"name":"Marius Stranghoener"},{"name":"Axel Schippers"},{"name":"Stefan Dultz"},{"name":"Harald Behrens"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia"},{"word":"Fe mobilization"},{"word":"Fe redox state"},{"word":"ICDP"},{"word":"bio-mediated alteration"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"microbe-basalt interaction"},{"word":"volcanic islands"}]},"article156":{"pmid":"29963020","title":"Herring Oil and Omega Fatty Acids Inhibit Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Formation and Virulence.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is notorious for its ability to become resistant to antibiotics and biofilms play a critical role in antibiotic tolerance.

In this study, soluble EPSs and loosely bound EPSs can be extracted by centrifugation first and tightly bound EPSs in activated sludge require additional eight treatments for extraction, respectively. Three physical methods (centrifugation, sonication, and heating) and five chemical methods (cation exchange resin, NaOH, formaldehyde+NaOH, EDTA, and formaldehyde+EDTA) were tested, and the content and composition of TB-EPS were analyzed. Meanwhile, the functional groups and elements in TB-EPS were investigated. Results showed that the heating method did not introduce exogenous substances during the EPS extraction process and that the destruction of cells from this method was relatively slight. Heating was shown to be a gentle and efficient method in this study. The three-dimensional excitation and emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the cation exchange resin method had good extraction effect on humic-like and protein-like substances.

Infrared spectroscopy showed that no notable difference appeared in the functional groups of the TB-EPS extracted by physical methods, whereas chemical methods induced big differences and showed particular bands that did not appear in the TB-EPS extracted by physical methods. Overall, the amounts of TB-EPS elements extracted using chemical methods were greater than those extracted using physical methods. In conclusion, a method must be selected and established for each case, taking into consideration the experimental purpose, and the most appropriate method should be chosen carefully.","authors":[{"name":"Xiu-Yue Sun"},{"name":"Zhu Tang"},{"name":"Xin-Ping Yang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"activated sludge"},{"word":"component"},{"word":"elements"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substances(EPSs)"},{"word":"extraction"}]},"article162":{"pmid":"29962006","title":"Implants induce a new niche for microbiomes.","date":"2018-09-06","abs":"Although much work is being done to develop new treatments, research and knowledge regarding factors underlying implant-related microbial colonization leading to infection are less comprehensive. Presence of microorganisms in and around implants clinically characterized as uninfected remains unknown. The objective of this study was to detect and identify bacteria and fungi on implants from various groups of patients with no prior indications of implant related infections. Patient samples (implants and tissue) were collected from five different hospitals in the Capital region of Denmark. By in-depth microbiological detection methods, we examined the prevalence of bacteria and fungi on 106 clinically uninfected implants from four patient groups (aseptic loosening, healed fractures, craniofacial complications and recently deceased). Of 106 clinically uninfected implants and 39 negative controls investigated, 66% were colonized by bacteria and 40% were colonized by fungi (p < 0.0001 compared to negative controls). A large number of microbes were found to colonize the implants, however, the most prevalent microbes present were not common aetiological agents of implant infections. The findings indicate that implants provide a distinct niche for microbial colonization. These data have broad implications for medical implant recipients, as well as for supporting the idea that the presence of foreign objects in the body alters the human microbiome by providing new colonization niches.","authors":[{"name":"Tim H Jakobsen"},{"name":"Steffen R Eickhardt"},{"name":"Alexandra G Gheorghe"},{"name":"Charlotte Stenqvist"},{"name":"Majken Sønderholm"},{"name":"Camilla Stavnsberg"},{"name":"Peter Ø Jensen"},{"name":"Anders Odgaard"},{"name":"Marvin Whiteley"},{"name":"Claus Moser"},{"name":"Jesper Hvolris"},{"name":"Hans Petter Hougen"},{"name":"Thomas Bjarnsholt"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Implants"},{"word":"foreign bodies"},{"word":"microbes"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"non-pathogenic colonization"}]},"article163":{"pmid":"29961193","title":"Low-Virulence Organisms and Periprosthetic Joint Infection-Biofilm Considerations of These Organisms.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a critical review of peer-reviewed literature over the last 5 years related to low virulent organisms associated with periprosthetic joint infection (PJI).

The purpose of this study was to investigate how bis-GMA changes the virulence properties of Streptococcus mutans, a major cariogenic bacterium in humans. The results show that bis-GMA not only inhibited the planktonic growth of cells in medium containing glucose, fructose, or mannose, but also reduced the viability of S. mutans. However, the presence of bis-GMA increased sugar transport and intracellular polysaccharide accumulation in S. mutans, thereby increasing the potential of cell persistence. In addition, bis-GMA could enhance S. mutans's adhesion to hard surfaces and glucan synthesis, which could contribute to biofilm formation. Although free bis-GMA made cells vulnerable to acidic stress, it also provided increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide, which might confer an advantage in competition with other oral microorganisms during the early stage of biofilm development. Interestingly, the presence of bis-GMA did not change the ability of S. mutans to interact with saliva. The results suggest that leachable bis-GMA could contribute to biofilm-related secondary dental caries at the marginal interface between resin-based materials and teeth by altering the virulent properties of S. mutans, although bis-GMA reduced the planktonic growth and viability of S. mutans.","authors":[{"name":"Kyungsun Kim"},{"name":"Jung-Sub An"},{"name":"Bum-Soon Lim"},{"name":"Sug-Joon Ahn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Bis-GMA"},{"word":"Composite resin"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"Virulent property"}]},"article165":{"pmid":"29960245","title":"Fast start-up of the single-stage nitrogen removal using anammox and partial nitritation (SNAP) from conventional activated sludge in a membrane-aerated biofilm reactor.","date":"2018-10-17","abs":"The single-stage nitrogen removal using anammox and partial nitritation (SNAP) is a promising alternative for low-cost ammonium removal from wastewaters.

One important but poorly understood system, ubiquitous among Gram-negative organisms, involves packaging cargo into outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). These biological nanoparticles are involved in processes ranging from toxin delivery to cell-cell communication. Despite this, we know comparatively little about how OMVs are formed. Building upon the discovery that the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) stimulates OMV biogenesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we proposed a model where PQS interacts with the outer membrane to induce curvature and ultimately OMV formation. Though this model is well supported in P. aeruginosa, it remained unclear whether other organisms produce similar compounds. Here we describe the development of a tightly controlled experimental system to test the interaction of bacterially-produced factors with target cells. Using this system, we show that multiple species respond to PQS by increasing OMV formation, that PQS accumulates in the induced vesicles, and that other bacteria secrete OMV-promoting factors. Analysis of induced vesicles indicates that recipient-mediated mechanisms exist to control vesicle size and that relatedness to the producer organism can dictate susceptibility to OMV-inducing compounds. This work provides evidence that small molecule induced OMV biogenesis is a widely conserved process and that cross-talk between systems may influence OMV production in neighboring bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander M Horspool"},{"name":"Jeffrey W Schertzer"}],"keywords":[]},"article170":{"pmid":"29959041","title":"Coupling xylitol with remineralizing agents improves tooth protection against demineralization but reduces antibiofilm effect.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"To explore the efficiency of xylitol chewing gum enriched or not with remineralizing agents to protect tooth against cariogenic biofilm formation and demineralization.

The advantage of this review is to present the most critical challenges and opportunities. These challenges have necessitated the design of MBR derivatives such as anaerobic MBR (AnMBR), osmotic MBR (OMBR), biofilm MBR (BF-MBR), membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR), and magnetically-enhanced systems. Likewise, electrochemical reactors with different configurations such as parallel, cylindrical, rotating impeller-electrode, packed bed, and moving particle configurations have emerged. One of the most effective approaches towards reducing energy consumption and membrane fouling rate is the integration of MBR with low-voltage electrochemical processes in an electrically-enhanced membrane bioreactor (eMBR). Meanwhile, research on eMBR modeling and sludge reuse is limited. Future trends should focus on novel/fresh concepts such as electrically-enhanced AnMBRs, electrically-enhanced OMBRs, and coupled systems with microbial fuel cells to further improve energy efficiency and effluent quality.","authors":[{"name":"Adewale Giwa"},{"name":"Abdallah Dindi"},{"name":"Joanna Kujawa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Electrically-enhanced membrane bioreactor"},{"word":"Electrochemical processes"},{"word":"Energy consumption"},{"word":"Membrane bioreactor"},{"word":"Membrane fouling"}]},"article172":{"pmid":"31897448","title":"The Quantitative Assessment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)14 Biofilm Surface Coverage on Slippery Liquid Infused Polymer Surfaces (SLIPS).","date":"2020-01-07","abs":"Slippery, porous polymeric antimicrobial surfaces for biofilm attachment inhibition of the clinical strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) have been prepared.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are among the newest antibiotics; these peptides are integral compounds in all kinds of organisms and play a significant role in microbial ecology, and critically contribute to the innate immunity of organisms by destroying invading microorganisms. Moreover, AMPs may encourage cells to produce chemokines, stimulate angiogenesis, accelerate wound healing, and influence programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. Bacteria differ in their inherent susceptibility and resistance mechanisms to these peptides when responding to the antimicrobial effects of AMPs. Generally, the development of AMP resistance mechanisms is driven by direct competition between bacterial species, and host and pathogen interactions. Several studies have shown diverse mechanisms of bacterial resistance to AMPs, for example, some bacteria produce proteases and trapping proteins; some modify cell surface charge, change membrane fluidity, and activate efflux pumps; and some species make use of biofilms and exopolymers, and develop sensing systems by selective gene expression. A closer understanding of bacterial resistance mechanisms may help in developing novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of infections caused by pathogenic organisms that are successful in developing extensive resistance to AMPs.

Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of high-risk/immunocompromised patients by enterococci exhibiting resistance to vancomycin (VRE) can lead to life-threating infections, including bloodstream infections and endocarditis. Decolonization of VRE from the GIT of high-risk patients represents an alternative method to suppress the risk of the infection. It could be considered as a preventative measure to protect against VRE infections in high-risk individuals. Though multiple agents (ramoplanin and bacitracin) have been evaluated clinically, no drugs are currently approved for use in VRE decolonization of the GIT. The present study evaluates ebselen, a clinical molecule, for use as a decolonizing agent against VRE. When evaluated against a broad array of enterococcal isolates in vitro, ebselen was found to be as potent as linezolid (minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of clinical isolates tested was 2 μg/ml). Though VRE has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antibacterial agents, no resistance to ebselen emerged after a clinical isolate of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was serially-passaged with ebselen for 14 days. Against VRE biofilm, a virulence factor that enables the bacteria to colonize the gut, ebselen demonstrated the ability to both inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt mature biofilm. Furthermore, in a murine VRE colonization reduction model, ebselen proved as effective as ramoplanin in reducing the bacterial shedding and burden of VRE present in the fecal content (by > 99.99%), cecum, and ileum of mice. Based on the promising results obtained, ebselen warrants further investigation as a novel decolonizing agent to quell VRE infection.","authors":[{"name":"Ahmed AbdelKhalek"},{"name":"Nader S Abutaleb"},{"name":"Haroon Mohammad"},{"name":"Mohamed N Seleem"}],"keywords":[]},"article189":{"pmid":"29952324","title":"Microorganism levels in spray from warm-water bidet toilet seats: factors affecting total viable and heterotrophic plate counts, and examination of the fluctuations and origins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2018-10-04","abs":"The objectives of this study were to conduct an appropriate microbial evaluation of warm-water bidet toilet seats.

Diallyl disulfide (DADS) is one of the most abundant sulfur-containing compounds in garlic oil. This study investigated the effects of DADS on the growth, virulence factor production (elastase, pyocyanin, biofilm, and swarming motility), and essential gene expression of P. aeruginosa PAO1, particularly as they apply to QS and virulence. DADS at 1.28 mg/mL did not affect P. aeruginosa PAO1 growth, although it decreased elastase and pyocyanin production, biofilm formation, and swarming motility. Each of these phenomena is regulated by the three QS systems of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (las, rhl, and pqs). Real-time q-PCR revealed that DADS down-regulated the transcription levels of several important QS genes (lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, pqsA, and pqsR) in the three systems. Furthermore, the transcription levels of QS-regulated virulence genes were also down-regulated. The lasB gene, encoding LasB elastase, is co-regulated by the las, rhl, and pqs systems, and thus the down-regulation of genes across the three systems further down-regulated lasB. Additionally, phzM (encoding pyocyanin), pslB (responsible for the production of a biofilm matrix polysaccharide), and chiC (encoding chitinase) were positively activated by LasR, and a decrease in lasR transcription further down-regulated the transcription of phzM, pslB, and chiC.

Drug-resistant strains often undergo mutations, adopt alternative pathways, and express drug efflux pumps to reduce or eliminate drug doses. Besides these intrinsic resistance mechanisms, bacteria can evade drug doses by forming biofilms. Biofilms are the concerted growth of adherent microorganisms, which can also be formed at the air-water interface. The growth is supported by the extracellular polymer matrix which is self-produced by the microorganisms. Reduced metabolic activity in a nutrient-deficient environment in the biofilm may cause the microorganisms to take alternative pathways that can make the microorganisms recalcitrant to the drug doses. Recent works have shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis expresses several proteins during its growth in biofilm, those when deleted, did not show any effect on mycobacterial growth in normal nutrient-sufficient conditions. Studying these unconventional proteins in mycobacterial biofilms is therefore of utmost importance. In this article, I will discuss one such mycobacterial biofilm-related protein FabG4 that is recently shown to be important for mycobacterial survival in the presence of antibiotic stressors and limited nutrient condition.

Here, we used mechanical indentation and shear rheometry to analyse the viscoelasticity of RSCV and mucoid colony-biofilms compared to their isogenic parent at 2-, 4-, and 6-d. While the viscoelasticity of parental colony-biofilms underwent fluctuating temporal changes, in contrast, RSCV and mucoid colony-biofilms showed a gradual progression to more elastic-solid behaviour. Theoretical indices of mucociliary and cough clearance predict that mature 6-d parental and RSCV biofilms may show reduced cough clearance from the lung, while early mucoid biofilms may show reduced clearance by both mechanisms. We propose that viscoelasticity be considered a virulence property of biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Erin S Gloag"},{"name":"Guy K German"},{"name":"Paul Stoodley"},{"name":"Daniel J Wozniak"}],"keywords":[]},"article210":{"pmid":"29945306","title":"In Vitro Study of Bacteriophage AB3 Endolysin LysAB3 Activity Against Acinetobacter baumannii Biofilm and Biofilm-Bound A. baumannii.","date":"2019-09-16","abs":"The increase in the prevalence of drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is a serious public health concern, which is closely linked to the formation of biofilm.

Some strains, adapted to the CF lung microenvironment, show distinguishable phenotypes linked to biofilm production when compared to other strains. Using a novel image analysis quantification approach with crystal violet-stained biofilms, we compared the biofilm formation of four different P. aeruginosa isolates in 24-well plates: PAO1, the reference strain, LESB58 from CF patients' lungs and PPF-1 and Urg-7, two environmental isolates from dental unit waterlines. We also observed the formation of biofilm-like structures (BLSs) floating in the medium and investigated growth inhibition of the attached biofilm and BLS with Mg2+ or Zn2+. Urg-7 produced the most attached biofilms, but not the most BLSs. Attached biofilms had different responses to cations than BLSs did, but the effect of the cations was similar for all strains. These results demonstrate some diversity of biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa and indicate that chemical inhibition of attached biofilm formation for a specific strain or isolate cannot be predicative of a result on other P. aeruginosa strains or on BLSs.","authors":[{"name":"Cynthia Gagné-Thivierge"},{"name":"Jean Barbeau"},{"name":"Roger C Levesque"},{"name":"Steve J Charette"}],"keywords":[]},"article212":{"pmid":"29945138","title":"Cariogenicity of a Milk-Based Drink Used as a Dietary Supplement for Older Adults Using a Root Caries Experimental Model.","date":"2019-10-01","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the cariogenicity of a milk-based drink intended for older adults that was used as part of a governmental initiative in Chile to improve their nutritional conditions.

Slabs exposed to 10% sucrose or 0.9% NaCl were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Biofilms were analyzed for bacterial counts and acidogenicity. Dentin demineralization was estimated by the loss of surface microhardness and integrated mineral loss. Results were compared by analysis of variance and Tukey's test. The milk-based drink showed higher acidogenicity than milk with its entire (whole) or reduced total fat content (skim). The milk-based drink supplemented with -sucrose had similar acidogenicity as the 10% sucrose positive control (p = 0.506). Whole milk exposure elicited lower bacterial counts than the positive control, the milk-based drink, and the milk-based drink supplemented with sucrose (p = 0.002; 0.006 and 0.014 respectively). Although skim milk induced higher demineralization than whole milk, both milk types produced lower demineralization than the milk-based drink. Regarding integrated mineral loss, demineralization induced by the milk-based drink and the milk-based drink supplemented with sucrose was similar to that induced by the positive control and skim milk (p > 0.05).

Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in circulation, playing crucial roles in the control and elimination of bacterial pathogens. Specifically, here we show that, unlike single-celled populations, S. aureus biofilms rapidly skew neutrophils toward neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation through the combined activity of leukocidins Panton-Valentine leukocidin and γ-hemolysin AB. By eliciting this response, S. aureus was able to persist, as the antimicrobial activity of released NETs was ineffective at clearing biofilm bacteria. Indeed, these studies suggest that NETs could inadvertently potentiate biofilm infections.

The genetic mediators of persister formation for P. aeruginosa are poorly understood. We generated a high-density transposon insertion library of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and determined the relative frequency of each insertion following fluoroquinolone treatment using transposon sequencing (Tn-seq). Of the 4,411 disrupted genes included in the screen, 137 had a ≥10-fold impact on survival. The gene disruption that resulted in the lowest survival rate was disruption of carB, which codes for the large subunit of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase). CPSase is a metabolic enzyme that is involved in pyrimidine and arginine synthesis. Disruption of carB resulted in survival rates that were reduced by up to 2,500-fold following antibiotic treatment, and this phenotype was abolished by the addition of uracil, highlighting the importance of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis for persister formation. Disruption of carB resulted in intracellular ATP accumulation, and lowering ATP levels using arsenate restored the antibiotic tolerance profile of the mutant to levels similar to those seen with the wild type. A decrease in ATP would lead to reduced antibiotic target activity and increased survival.","authors":[{"name":"David R Cameron"},{"name":"Yue Shan"},{"name":"Eliza A Zalis"},{"name":"Vincent Isabella"},{"name":"Kim Lewis"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Tn-seq"},{"word":"antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"persisters"}]},"article224":{"pmid":"29941383","title":"Comparative virulence characterization of the Shiga toxin phage-cured Escherichia coli O104:H4 and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-01-11","abs":"Escherichia coli O104:H4 (E. coli O104:H4), which caused in 2011 a massive foodborne outbreak in Germany, is characterized by an unusual combination of virulence traits.

However, the outbreak strain shares highest DNA sequence similarity with enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and displays the EAEC-characteristic tight adherence to epithelial cells. The virulence potential of the underlying EAEC background has not been investigated and it is therefore not clear whether E. coli O104:H4 displays distinct virulence characteristics in comparison to prototypical EAEC.

We have developed novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug-silica particles co-assembled for long-term release and high payload incorporated into dental adhesives. The release of the drug, octenidine dihydrochloride, is modulated by the oral degradative environment and mathematically modeled to predict effective service life. Steady-state release kills cariogenic bacteria, preventing biofilm formation over the adhesive surface, with no toxicity. This novel material could extend dental restoration service life and may be applied to other long-term medical device-tissue interfaces for responsive drug release upon bacterial infection.","authors":[{"name":"Cameron A Stewart"},{"name":"Jenny H Hong"},{"name":"Benjamin D Hatton"},{"name":"Yoav Finer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial materials"},{"word":"Bacterial esterase"},{"word":"Biodegradation"},{"word":"Controlled drug release"},{"word":"Dental caries"},{"word":"Dental materials"},{"word":"Esterase-triggered drug release"},{"word":"Salivary esterase"}]},"article235":{"pmid":"29940364","title":"Four release tests exhibit variable silver stability from nanoparticle-modified reverse osmosis membranes.","date":"2018-11-12","abs":"Modification of polyamide reverse osmosis (RO) membranes with silver nanoparticles (AgNP) may effectively control biofouling. While silver leaching tests are usually performed during membrane development, the lack of common testing protocols limits cross-comparison among different labs. We compare four release tests to quantify the release of dissolved and nanoparticulate silver from polyamide RO membranes prepared through in situ surface functionalization: (1) batch immersion, (2) dead-end filtration, (3) cross-flow filtration, and (4) low-pressure water jetting. For the first time, we demonstrated the possibility of AgNP release to membrane-treated water through direct AgNP detachment. When using Nanopure water as an extraction solution, water jetting resulted in the fastest silver mass release, while dead-end filtration caused the slowest release based on the initial release kinetic data. Dead-end filtration exhibited silver mass release an order of magnitude lower than the other three tests. Although cross-flow filtration may best represent the RO membrane operation, quantifying silver release suffers from poor mass balance due to the adsorption of dissolved silver by various reactor components and large volumes of water usage. A commonly applied batch immersion method was low cost and easily performed, but may not induce hydraulic shear sufficient for AgNP detachment from a RO membrane. The information on silver release behavior may depend on the specific test, which is important for assessing antimicrobial efficacy and service life of the nanoparticle-functionalized membranes.","authors":[{"name":"Yuqiang Bi"},{"name":"Bingru Han"},{"name":"Sean Zimmerman"},{"name":"Francois Perreault"},{"name":"Shahnawaz Sinha"},{"name":"Paul Westerhoff"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial"},{"word":"Biofilm release"},{"word":"Dissolution"},{"word":"Fouling"},{"word":"Nanotechnology"}]},"article236":{"pmid":"29940363","title":"Flow-cytometric quantification of microbial cells on sand from water biofilters.","date":"2018-11-12","abs":"Rapid quantification of absolute microbial cell abundances is important for a comprehensive interpretation of microbiome surveys and crucial to support theoretical modelling and the design of engineered systems.

Thus, our study aimed to assign functions to proteins previously described as HPs, present in the genome of E. antarcticum B7. We used an extensive in silico workflow combining several bioinformatics tools for function annotation, sub-cellular localization and physicochemical characterization, three-dimensional structure determination, and protein-protein interactions. This genome contains 2772 genes, of which 765 CDS were annotated as HPs. The amino acid sequences of all HPs were submitted to our workflow and we successfully attributed function to 132 HPs. We identified 11 proteins that play important roles in the mechanisms of adaptation to adverse environments, such as flagellar biosynthesis, biofilm formation, carotenoids biosynthesis, and others. In addition, three predicted HPs are possibly related to arsenic tolerance. Through an in vitro assay, we verified that E. antarcticum B7 can grow at high concentrations of this metal. The approach used was important to precisely assign function to proteins from diverse classes and to infer relationships with proteins with functions already described in the literature.

The difficulty in removing these organisms frustrates maritime and oceanographic communities, and fascinates biomedical and industrial communities seeking synthetic adhesives that cure and hold steadfast in aqueous environments. Protein analysis can reveal the chemical composition of natural adhesives; however, developing synthetic analogs that mimic their performance remains a challenge due to an incomplete understanding of adhesion processes. Here, it is shown that acorn barnacles (Amphibalanus (=Balanus) amphitrite) secrete a phase-separating fluid ahead of growth and cement deposition. This mixture consists of a phenolic laden gelatinous phase that presents a phase rich in lipids and reactive oxygen species at the seawater interface. Nearby biofilms rapidly oxidize and lift off the surface as the secretion advances. While phenolic chemistries are ubiquitous to arthropod adhesives and cuticles, the findings demonstrate that A. amphitrite uses these chemistries in a complex surface-cleaning fluid, at a substantially higher relative abundance than in its adhesive. The discovery of this critical step in underwater adhesion represents a missing link between natural and synthetic adhesives, and provides new directions for the development of environmentally friendly biofouling solutions.","authors":[{"name":"Kenan P Fears"},{"name":"Beatriz Orihuela"},{"name":"Daniel Rittschof"},{"name":"Kathryn J Wahl"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofouling"},{"word":"in situ Raman microscopy"},{"word":"in vivo confocal microscopy"},{"word":"nanofibrils"},{"word":"protein self‐assembly"}]},"article246":{"pmid":"29938072","title":"Biofilm formation and toxin production provide a fitness advantage in mixed colonies of environmental yeast isolates.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Microbes can engage in social interactions ranging from cooperation to warfare.

The complexity of eukaryotic cell signaling and communication suggests the possibility of different social dynamics. Using the tractable model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can form biofilms, we investigate the interactions of environmental isolates with different social phenotypes. We find that biofilm strains spatially exclude nonbiofilm strains and that biofilm spatial structure confers a consistent and robust fitness advantage in direct competition. Furthermore, biofilms may protect against killer toxin, a warfare phenotype. During biofilm formation, cells are susceptible to toxin from nearby competitors; however, increased spatial use may provide an escape from toxin producers.

Microbiological methods showed that the growth inhibition of MSSA was higher than that of MRSA in presence of both arsenic ions. As(III) showed 24% and 33% higher anti-microbial effects than As(V) against MSSA and MRSA respectively. A similar result was found also in the experiment of reduction of biofilm-formation. By using spectrophotometry, it was revealed that As(III) induced higher antioxidant production in both bacterial cultures.

All of these changes in the results were found to be significant statistically. Taken together, these experiments proved that in comparison with MSSA, MRSA is less susceptible not only to the antimicrobial effects of antibiotics but also against effects caused by metalloids, as arsenic.

The two key reasons for the rising demand of quorum sensing (QS) inhibitory molecules are low selective pressure to develop resistance by pathogens and possibility of more species-specific effects. Due to complex interactions in a unique niche of live plant tissues, endophytes, as a survival mechanism, potentially produce various bioactive compounds such as QS inhibitors. We report the isolation of an endophytic fungus Kwoniella sp. PY016 from the medicinal plant Bahera (Terminalia bellirica), which exhibits substantial quorum sensing inhibition and anti-biofilm activities against the standard test organism, Chromobacterium violaceum. Sugar, sugar alcohol, carboxylic acid, lipid, and phenolic classes of metabolites (predominantly xylitol) are responsible components of the metabolome for the desired bioactivity. A judicious combination of single-factor-at-a-time strategy and artificial neural network modeling combined with genetic algorithm was employed for the selection and optimization of the critical process and medium parameters. Through this newly adopted hybrid model-based optimization, the quorum sensing inhibitory activity of the endophytic metabolome was increased by ~ 30%.

The pathogenicity of S.aureus isolates are related with features like adherence, various toxins, enzymes, structural and extracellular factors. Slime factor and biofilm formation are also the pathogenicity factors of the bacteria. Biofilm formation is usually associated with chronic infections and has become a subject of interest in a wide area of research. Biofilm is an adherent structure formed by bacteria encased within a matrix produced on natural body surfaces or medical devices. As the biofilm producing S.aureus isolates are more resistant to antibiotics and and their biofilms prevent phagocytosis, the treatment of infections caused by biofilm positive S.aureus isolates become difficult. The icaADBC locus and some proteins have provento be responsible for the formation of S.aureus type biofilm. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the genotypic and phenotypic detection methods of biofilm formation with icaA, icaD and bap genes and phenotype expressions which are responsible for the formation of biofilm in S.aureus isolates. One hundred seventy five S.aureus isolates from various clinical specimens were included in the study. For the phenotypic detection of biofilm producing isolates Congo red agar (CRA) medium and microplate method were used. The biofilm-producing strain Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984 and S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. One hundred fifty two S.aureus biofilm producing isolates were detected at least by either Congo Red agar or microplate method and all isolates were screened for icaA, icaD and bap genes by PCR. The production of polysaccharide intracellular adhesins /poly-N-acetyl-beta-1-6-glucosamine (PIA/PNAG) was also investigated in S.aureus isolates. For the detection of PIA/PNAG chemiluminescence dot-blot method was used. According to the phenotypic evaluations based on colony morphologies in CRA medium, biofilm formation were found as negative in 101 of 175 isolates (57.7%), while biofilm formation were positive in 74 (42.3%) of the isolates. As a result of quantitative evaluation by microplate method based on absorbance measurement, biofilm production was determined as negative in 34 (19.4%) specimens, moderate in 112 (64.0%) specimens and strong in 29 (16.6%) specimens. Microplate and CRA methods were incompatible with each other when compared for their biofilm production determination (p< 0.001). Among the 152 clinical isolates used to determine the presence of icaA and icaD genes responsible for the formation of biofilms, the genes were detected in 136 (89.5%) of the isolates and in the S.epidermidis ATCC 35984 strain used as a positive control. icaA and icaD genes were not detected in sixteen of the 152 (10.5%) clinical isolates and in the S.epidermidis ATCC 12228 strain used as a negative control. A weak-moderate correlation was found between icaA and icaD genes and biofilm production determined in CRA medium. A good correlation was found between icaA and icaD genes and biofilm production detected in microplate method. bap gene was determined in only one of the 152 clinical S.aureus isolates studied and in S.aureus V329 strain used as positive control. For the detection of PIA/PNAG which was synthesized by icaADBC genes, 50 clinical S.aureus isolates were used. PNAG production was determined in 42 isolates with positive icaA and icaD genes by the chemiluminescence dot-blot method, and no PNAG production was determined among eight isolates with negative ica genes. As a result, it was found that the microplate method was more sensitive and reliable for the phenotypic determination of biofilm formation in S.aureus isolates, high level of biofilm formation among clinical S.aureus isolates (about 80%), the role of icaA and icaD genes and products (PIA/PNAG) in biofilm production was determined.","authors":[{"name":"Rasim Şahin"},{"name":"İlknur Kaleli"}],"keywords":[]},"article261":{"pmid":"29933557","title":"Phenolic and Nonpolar Fractions of Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.)

To test biofilm formation inhibition, porcine skin explants were inoculated and incubated for 4 hours before treatment. The explants were then dressed with test or control materials. To test biofilm elimination, mature 3-day biofilms were established and then treated and wiped daily. Explants from each group were harvested daily, and total and biofilm-associated bacterial counts were generated up through day 3 posttreatment. The control explants developed a biofilm with ~106 CFU over the course of 3 days for each of the bacteria tested. The surfactant-treated samples had viable bacteria, but with the exception of a single time point for Staphylococcus aureus without silver sulfadiazine, there was no biofilm formation. Unlike previous results, the surfactants could not eliminate the A. baumannii biofilm, unless it was formulated with relevant antibiotics. The surfactant was effective in preventing the formation of biofilms over a 3-day period.

The main objective of the present research is to evaluate the biofilm formation on different lithotypes exposed to similar environmental polluted conditions, and to investigate whether the presence of subaerial biofilms can be associated to an increased magnitude of deterioration of the colonized surfaces with respect to the not colonized ones. In particular, the research examines the extensive biological colonization of the stone surfaces of the façade of the Cathedral of Monza (Italy). Four metamorphic stones widely used in the façade and showing rather different compositional, mineralogical and microstructural features were studied. The state of conservation of the stones was characterized under the mineralogical and compositional point of view by X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transformed infrared analysis. The microstructure of colonized substrates and of reference not colonized ones was studied by means of optical and electron microscopy, to comparatively evaluate the damage extent and weathering patterns in both conservative conditions. The structure and the architecture of biofilms growing on different lithic surfaces were investigated by CLSM in both fluorescence and reflection modes. Captured images were analyzed for 3D reconstructions of biofilm samples. The biovolumes were also calculated to estimate the total biomass. The results indicate that the four lithotypes showed different colonization extents.

High-density infections are particularly difficult to treat due to their adaptive multidrug-resistance and currently there are no therapies that adequately address this important issue. Here, a large-scale in vivo study was performed to enhance the activity of antibiotics to treat high-density infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It was shown that synthetic peptides can be used in conjunction with the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, meropenem, erythromycin, gentamicin, and vancomycin to improve the treatment outcome of murine cutaneous abscesses caused by clinical hard-to-treat pathogens including all ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae) pathogens and Escherichia coli. Promisingly, combination treatment often showed synergistic effects that significantly reduced abscess sizes and/or improved clearance of bacterial isolates from the infection site, regardless of the antibiotic mode of action. In vitro data suggest that the mechanisms of peptide action in vivo include enhancement of antibiotic penetration and potential disruption of the stringent stress response.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Pletzer"},{"name":"Sarah C Mansour"},{"name":"Robert E W Hancock"}],"keywords":[]},"article278":{"pmid":"29928013","title":"Impact of stagnation and sampling volume on water microbial quality monitoring in large buildings.","date":"2019-04-15","abs":"Microbial drinking water quality can be altered in large buildings, especially after stagnation. In this study, bacterial profiles were generated according to the stagnation time and the volume of water collected at the tap. Successive volumes of cold and hot water were sampled after controlled stagnation periods. Bacterial profiles revealed an important decline (> 2 log) in culturable cells in the first 500 mL sampled from the hot and cold water systems, with a steep decline in the first 15 mL. The strong exponential correlation (R2 ≥ 0.97) between the culturable cell counts in water and the pipe surface-to-volume ratio suggests the biofilm as the main contributor to the rapid increase in suspended culturable cells measured after a short stagnation of one-hour. Results evidence the contribution of the high surface-to-volume ratio at the point of use and the impact of short stagnation times on the increased bacterial load observed. Simple faucets with minimal internal surface area should be preferred to minimize surface area. Sampling protocol, including sampling volume and prior stagnation, was also shown to impact the resulting culturable cell concentration by more than 1000-fold. Sampling a smaller volume on first draw after stagnation will help maximize recovery of bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Emilie Bédard"},{"name":"Céline Laferrière"},{"name":"Eric Déziel"},{"name":"Michèle Prévost"}],"keywords":[]},"article279":{"pmid":"29927925","title":"Community interactions and spatial structure shape selection on antibiotic resistant lineages.","date":"2019-01-24","abs":"Polymicrobial interactions play an important role in shaping the outcome of antibiotic treatment, yet how multispecies communities respond to antibiotic assault is still little understood. Here we use an individual-based simulation model of microbial biofilms to investigate how competitive and mutualistic interactions between an antibiotic-resistant and a susceptible strain (or species) influence the two-lineage community response to antibiotic exposure. Our model predicts that while increasing competition and antibiotics leads to increasing competitive release of the antibiotic-resistant strain, hitting a mutualistic community of cross-feeding species with antibiotics leads to a mutualistic suppression effect where both susceptible and resistant species are harmed. We next show that the impact of antibiotics is further governed by emergent spatial feedbacks within communities. Mutualistic cross-feeding communities can rescue susceptible members by subsidizing their growth inside the biofilm despite lack of access to the nutrient-rich and high-antibiotic growing front. Moreover, we show that antibiotic detoxification by resistant cells can protect nearby susceptible cells, but such cross-protection is more effective in mutualistic communities because mutualism drives mixing of resistant and susceptible cells. In contrast, competition leads to segregation, which ultimately prevents susceptible cells to profit from detoxification. Understanding how the interplay between microbial metabolic interactions and community spatial structuring shapes the outcome of antibiotic treatment can be key to effectively leverage the power of antibiotics and promote microbiome health.","authors":[{"name":"Sylvie Estrela"},{"name":"Sam P Brown"}],"keywords":[]},"article280":{"pmid":"29927357","title":"Enhanced Control of Plant Wilt Disease by a Xylose-Inducible degQ Gene Engineered into Bacillus velezensis Strain SQR9XYQ.","date":"2019-08-12","abs":"Bacillus velezensis SQR9 (former B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9) is a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) that promotes plant growth and health. The colonization of PGPR strains along plant roots is a prerequisite for them to execute their specific functions. However, one problem of microbial introduction in practice is that the applied PGPR strains do not always successfully colonize the rhizosphere. In Bacillus spp., two-component signal transduction system (TCS) DegS/U regulates flagellar motility, biofilm formation and antibiotic production. Phosphorylation of DegU by DegS is positively affected by DegQ protein. In this study, we constructed a xylose-inducible degQ genetically engineered strain SQR9XYQ to improve the biocontrol activity. The results from in vitro, root in situ, greenhouse experiments and RT-qPCR studies demonstrate that (i) the phosphorylation of DegU in SQR9XYQ can be gradually activated by xylose, which is a component of both cucumber and tomato root exudates, and (ii) biofilm formation, antibiotic expression, colonization activity, and biocontrol efficiency were improved in SQR9XYQ compared with the wild-type strain SQR9.

To inhibit the bacterial adhesion and proliferation on biomaterials, several surface functionalization strategies have been developed. However, most of these strategies lead to bacteriostatic effect and only few of these are able to reach the bactericidal condition. In this work, bactericidal surfaces were designed through the functionalization of titanium surfaces with poly-l-lysine (PLL) as the mediator for the incorporation of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). This functionalization influences the adsorption of the particles on the substrate impeding the agglomeration observed when bare titanium surfaces are used, leading to a homogeneous distribution of AgNPs on the surfaces. The antimicrobial activity of this surface has been tested against two different strains, namely, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For both strains and different AgNPs sizes, the surface modified with PLL and AgNPs shows a much enhanced antimicrobial activity in comparison with AgNPs deposited on bare titanium. This enhanced antibacterial activity is high enough to reach bactericidal effect, a condition hard to achieve in antimicrobial surfaces. Importantly, the designed surfaces are able to decrease the bacterial viability more than 5 orders with respect to the initial bacterial inoculum. That means that a relative low load of AgNPs on the PLL-modified titanium surfaces reaches 99.999% bacterial death after 24 h. The results of the present study are important to avoid infections in indwelling materials by reinforcing the preventive antibiotic therapy usually dosed throughout the surgical procedure and during the postoperative period.","authors":[{"name":"Fiorela Ghilini"},{"name":"Miriam C Rodríguez González"},{"name":"Alejandro G Miñán"},{"name":"Diego Pissinis"},{"name":"Alberto Hernández Creus"},{"name":"Roberto C Salvarezza"},{"name":"Patricia L Schilardi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bactericidal"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"poly-l-lysine"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"},{"word":"titanium functionalization"}]},"article282":{"pmid":"29926958","title":"Dental plaque-induced gingival conditions.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"This review proposes revisions to the current classification system for gingival diseases and provides a rationale for how it differs from the 1999 classification system.","authors":[{"name":"Shinya Murakami"},{"name":"Brian L Mealey"},{"name":"Angelo Mariotti"},{"name":"Iain L C Chapple"}],"keywords":[{"word":"diagnosis"},{"word":"evidence-based dentistry"},{"word":"gingivitis"}]},"article283":{"pmid":"29926954","title":"Peri-implant mucositis.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"This narrative review was prepared for the 2017 World Workshop of the American Academy of Periodontology and European Federation of Periodontology to address key questions related to the clinical condition of peri-implant mucositis, including: 1) the definition of peri-implant mucositis, 2) conversion of peri-implant health to the biofilm-induced peri-implant mucositis lesion, 3) reversibility of peri-implant mucositis, 4) the long-standing peri-implant mucositis lesion, 5) similarities and differences between peri-implant mucositis at implants and gingivitis at teeth, and 6) risk indicators/factors for peri-implant mucositis.","authors":[{"name":"Lisa J A Heitz-Mayfield"},{"name":"Giovanni E Salvi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"peri-implant disease"},{"word":"peri-implant mucositis"},{"word":"peri-implantitis"},{"word":"risk factor"},{"word":"risk indicator"}]},"article284":{"pmid":"29926944","title":"Periodontal health and gingival diseases and conditions on an intact and a reduced periodontium: Consensus report of workgroup 1 of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"Periodontal health is defined by absence of clinically detectable inflammation.

Calibrated phantoms consisting of mono-dispersed fluorescent and X-ray absorbent beads were used to evaluate the uncertainty associated with our protocol along with three different segmentation techniques, namely hysteresis, watershed and region growing, to determine the bias relative to image binarization.

Structure and properties play a functional role in both the biofilm life cycle and biotechnological applications. Among all the cellulose-producing bacteria, acetic acid bacteria of the Komagataeibacter xylinus species play the most important role because they are considered the highest producers. Bacterial cellulose from acetic acid bacteria is widely investigated as native and modified biopolymer in functionalized materials, as well as in terms of differences arising from the static or submerged production system.

Since in acetic acid bacteria biofilm and cellulose production are two main phenotypes with industrial impact, new insights into biofilm production are provided.","authors":[{"name":"Maria Gullo"},{"name":"Salvatore La China"},{"name":"Pasquale Massimiliano Falcone"},{"name":"Paolo Giudici"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial cellulose"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biopolymer"},{"word":"Cellulose synthase"},{"word":"Komagataeibacter xylinus"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"}]},"article293":{"pmid":"29925870","title":"Effects of water-aging for 6 months on the durability of a novel antimicrobial and protein-repellent dental bonding agent.","date":"2019-04-15","abs":"Biofilms at the tooth-restoration bonded interface can produce acids and cause recurrent caries. Recurrent caries is a primary reason for restoration failures. The objectives of this study were to synthesize a novel bioactive dental bonding agent containing dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) to inhibit biofilm formation at the tooth-restoration margin and to investigate the effects of water-aging for 6 months on the dentin bond strength and protein-repellent and antibacterial durability. A protein-repellent agent (MPC) and antibacterial agent (DMAHDM) were added to a Scotchbond multi-purpose (SBMP) primer and adhesive. Specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 1, 30, 90, or 180 days (d). At the end of each time period, the dentin bond strength and protein-repellent and antibacterial properties were evaluated. Protein attachment onto resin specimens was measured by the micro-bicinchoninic acid approach. A dental plaque microcosm biofilm model was used to test the biofilm response. The SBMP + MPC + DMAHDM group showed no decline in dentin bond strength after water-aging for 6 months, which was significantly higher than that of the control (P < 0.05). The SBMP + MPC + DMAHDM group had protein adhesion that was only 1/20 of that of the SBMP control (P < 0.05). Incorporation of MPC and DMAHDM into SBMP provided a synergistic effect on biofilm reduction. The antibacterial effect and resistance to protein adsorption exhibited no decrease from 1 to 180 d (P > 0.1). In conclusion, a bonding agent with MPC and DMAHDM achieved a durable dentin bond strength and long-term resistance to proteins and oral bacteria. The novel dental bonding agent is promising for applications in preventive and restorative dentistry to reduce biofilm formation at the tooth-restoration margin.","authors":[{"name":"Ning Zhang"},{"name":"Ke Zhang"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"David J Xu"},{"name":"Mark A Reynolds"},{"name":"Yuxing Bai"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"}],"keywords":[]},"article294":{"pmid":"29925842","title":"Publisher Correction: Anti-Psl Targeting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms for Neutrophil-Mediated Disruption.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"A correction to this article has been published and is linked from the HTML and PDF versions of this paper.

In pursuit of complementary morphologies, formation of graphene foams is often preferred over the native two-dimensional (2D) forms due to the higher available area. Graphene foams have been successfully prepared by several routes including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods and by wet-chemical approaches. For these methods, one often needs either high temperature furnaces and highly pure gases or large amounts of strong acids and oxidants. In 2014, using a commercial laser scribing system as found in most machine shops, a direct lasing of polyimide (PI) plastic films in the air converted the PI into 3D porous graphene, a material termed laser-induced graphene (LIG). This is a one-step method without the need for high-temperature reaction conditions, solvent, or subsequent treatments, and it affords graphene with many five-and seven-membered rings. With such an atomic arrangement, one might call LIG kinetic graphene since there is no annealing in the process that causes the rearrangement to the preferred all-six-membered-ring form. In this Account, we will first introduce the approaches that have been developed for making LIG and to control the morphology as either porous sheets or fibrils, and to control porosity, composition, and surface properties. The surfaces can be varied from being either superhydrophilic with a 0° contact angle with water to being superhydrophobic having >150° contact angle with water. While it was initially thought that the LIG process could only be performed on PI, it was later shown that a host of other polymeric substrates, nonpolymers, metal/plastic composites, and biodegradable and naturally occurring materials and foods could be used as platforms for generating LIG. Methods of preparation include roll-to-roll production for fabrication of in-plane electronics and two different 3D printing (additive manufacturing) routes to specific shapes of LIG monoliths using both laminated object manufacturing and powder bed fabrication methods. Use of the LIG in devices is performed very simply. This is showcased with high performance supercapacitors, fuel cell materials for oxygen reduction reactions, water splitting for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions coming from the same plastic sheet, sensor devices, oil/water purification platforms, and finally applications in both passive and active biofilm inhibitors. So the ease of formation of LIG, its simple scale-up, and its utility for a range of applications highlights the easy transition of this substrate-bound graphene foam into commercial device platforms.","authors":[{"name":"Ruquan Ye"},{"name":"Dustin K James"},{"name":"James M Tour"}],"keywords":[]},"article299":{"pmid":"29924414","title":"Reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms from implant materials in a diffusion dominated environment.","date":"2019-05-09","abs":"Antibiotic-loaded calcium sulfate beads (CS-B) are used to treat biofilm-related periprosthetic joint infections (PJI).

Finally, the effects of angelicin on a mouse model of periodontitis were also investigated.

There were no significant differences in the viability of monocyte-like THP-1 cells and human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) treated with either psoralen or angelicin compared to the untreated control cells. Psoralen and angelicin also markedly decreased the mRNA expression and release of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β and IL-8) by THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner.

These lipids fulfill various important functions, from sliding motility or biofilm formation to interaction with host cells and intramacrophage trafficking. Being highly immunogenic, the induction of a strong humoral response is likely to select for rough low-GPL producers. These, in contrast to the smooth high-GPL producers, display aggregative properties, which strongly impacts upon intracellular survival. A propensity to grow as extracellular cords allows these low-GPL producing bacilli to escape the innate immune defenses.

This effect was only observed in the wild-type strain, suggesting that interactions between TasA and dextran-associated EP plays an important role in inter-species interactions during initial stages of multispecies biofilm development.","authors":[{"name":"Danielle Duanis-Assaf"},{"name":"Tal Duanis-Assaf"},{"name":"Guanghong Zeng"},{"name":"Rikke Louise Meyer"},{"name":"Meital Reches"},{"name":"Doron Steinberg"},{"name":"Moshe Shemesh"}],"keywords":[]},"article315":{"pmid":"29921833","title":"Antifungal Activity and Synergism with Azoles of Polish Propolis.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The aim of our work was to check if one of the products of natural origin, namely honey bee propolis, may be an alternative or supplement to currently used antifungal agents.

The need to develop new therapeutic strategies against multidrug resistant microorganisms, such as the combination of selected antimicrobials, can be considered as a suitable alternative. The in vitro activities of two groups of conventional antimicrobial agents alone and in combination with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were investigated against a set of ten multidrug resistant clinical isolate and two references strains by MIC assays and checkerboard testing, as well as their cytotoxicity, which was evaluated on human fibroblasts by MTT assay at the same concentration of the antimicrobial agents alone and in combination. Interesting results were achieved when the AgNPs and their combinations were characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Zeta Potential, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), UV⁻visible spectroscopy and Fourier Transforms Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The in vitro activities of ampicillin, in combination with AgNPs, against the 12 microorganisms showed one Synergy, seven Partial Synergy and four Additive effects, while the results with amikacin and AgNPs showed three Synergy, eight Partial Synergy and one Additive effects. The cytotoxic effect at these concentrations presented a statistically significant decrease of their cytotoxicity (p < 0.05). These results indicate that infections caused by multidrug resistant microorganisms could be treated using a synergistic combination of antimicrobial drugs and AgNPs.

Here, an optimized proteomics approach allowed simultaneous observation of inactivation and molecular changes. Site-specific fingerprints of degradation kinetics have been generated and visualized in the three-dimensional proteins. Oxidation of tryptophan, the chromophoric target, initiated secondary reactions. Evidence was obtained that tyrosine residues act as intramolecular antioxidants, reflected in decelerated decay of tryptophan-containing peptides and enhanced decay of tyrosine-containing peptides. In addition, subsequent methionine oxidation and disulfide reduction contribute to heterogeneous photodamage. The proximity to tryptophan residues explains >95% of the photodamage across the protein structures. The presence of redox active organic matter or a model antioxidant in solution quenched not only photoinactivation and tryptophan oxidation but also all subsequent damage.

M. smegmatis contains four distinct rpf homologues, namely, MSMEG_5700 (rpfA), MSMEG_5439 (rpfB), MSMEG_4640 (rpfE2), and MSMEG_4643 (rpfE).

In-frame unmarked deletion mutants (single and combinatorial) were generated and displayed altered colony morphologies and the inability to form typical biofilms.

The released xhp1 particles can reinfect the xhp1-cured XH001 strain and result in tiny blurry plaques. Moreover, xhp1 promotes XH001 biofilm formation through spontaneous induction and the release of host extracellular DNA (eDNA).

Their tolerances are often attributed to reduced activities of antibiotic targets, which limit corruption and damage in persisters compared with bacteria that die from treatment. However, that model does not hold for nongrowing populations treated with ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, where antibiotic-induced damage is comparable between cells that live and those that die. To understand how those persisters achieve this feat, we employed a genetic system that uses orthogonal control of MazF and MazE, a toxin and its cognate antitoxin, to generate model persisters that are uniformly tolerant to ofloxacin. Despite this complete tolerance, MazF model persisters required the same DNA repair machinery (RecA, RecB, and SOS induction) to survive ofloxacin treatment as their nongrowing, WT counterparts and exhibited similar indicators of DNA damage from treatment. Further investigation revealed that, following treatment, the timing of DNA repair was critical to MazF persister survival because, when repair was delayed until after growth and DNA synthesis resumed, survival was compromised. In addition, we found that, with nongrowing, WT planktonic and biofilm populations, stalling the resumption of growth and DNA synthesis after the conclusion of fluoroquinolone treatment with a prevalent type of stress at infection sites (nutrient limitation) led to near complete survival. These findings illustrate that the timing of events, such as DNA repair, following fluoroquinolone treatment is important to persister survival and provide further evidence that knowledge of the postantibiotic recovery period is critical to understanding persistence phenotypes.","authors":[{"name":"Wendy W K Mok"},{"name":"Mark P Brynildsen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNA damage"},{"word":"MazF"},{"word":"SOS response"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"starvation"}]},"article333":{"pmid":"29914989","title":"The OmpR Regulator of Burkholderia multivorans Controls Mucoid-to-Nonmucoid Transition and Other Cell Envelope Properties Associated with Persistence in the Cystic Fibrosis Lung.","date":"2019-10-08","abs":"Bacteria from the Burkholderia cepacia complex grow in different natural and man-made environments and are feared opportunistic pathogens that cause chronic respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients.

As bacteria commonly reside in biofilms, there has been an increased interest in studying these phenomena within biofilms in recent years. This review summarizes the present knowledge within this important area of research. Studies on bacterial evolution in biofilms have shown that mature biofilms develop into diverse communities over time. There is growing evidence that the biofilm lifestyle may be more mutagenic than planktonic growth. Furthermore, all three main mechanisms for HGT have been observed in biofilms. This has been shown to occur both within and between bacterial species, and higher transfer rates in biofilms than in planktonic cultures were detected. Of special concern are the observations that mutants with increased antibiotic resistance occur at higher frequency in biofilms than in planktonic cultures even in the absence of antibiotic exposure. Likewise, efficient dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes, as well as virulence genes, has been observed within the biofilm environment. This new knowledge emphasizes the importance of biofilm awareness and control.","authors":[{"name":"Live L Nesse"},{"name":"Roger Simm"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial evolution"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Horizontal gene transfer"},{"word":"Mutations"}]},"article335":{"pmid":"29914193","title":"Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Activities of Citrus Water-Extracts Obtained by Microwave-Assisted and Conventional Methods.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Citrus pomace is a huge agro-food industrial waste mostly composed of peels and traditionally used as compost or animal feed.

This study demonstrates that the aggregation of N. gonorrhoeae can reduce the susceptibility to antibiotics, and suggests that antibiotic utilization can select for GC surface molecules that promote aggregation which in turn drive pathogen evolution. Inhibiting aggregation may be a potential way of increasing the efficacy of ceftriaxone treatment, consequently reducing treatment failure.","authors":[{"name":"Liang-Chun Wang"},{"name":"Madeline Litwin"},{"name":"Zahraossadat Sahiholnasab"},{"name":"Wenxia Song"},{"name":"Daniel C Stein"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gonorrhea"},{"word":"increased susceptibility"},{"word":"recurrence"},{"word":"treatment failure"}]},"article339":{"pmid":"29913401","title":"Removal of precursors of typical nitrogenous disinfection byproducts in ozonation integrated with biological activated carbon (O","date":"2018-10-16","abs":"The O","authors":[{"name":"Jian Zheng"},{"name":"Tao Lin"},{"name":"Wei Chen"},{"name":"Hui Tao"},{"name":"Yiwen Tan"},{"name":"Baiwen Ma"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biological activated carbon"},{"word":"Drinking water treatment"},{"word":"Nitrogenous disinfection byproducts"},{"word":"Precursors"},{"word":"Soluble microbial products"}]},"article340":{"pmid":"29913266","title":"The mechanism of iron-compensation for manganese deficiency of Streptococcus pneumoniae.","date":"2019-10-22","abs":"Given their involvement in catalysis, infection, and biofilm formation, Fe and Mn are essential for bacterial survival and virulence.

In addition, it was noted that supplementing MDCM with Fe resulted in the recovery of bacterial growth. Quantitative proteomics using stable-isotope dimethyl labeling was performed to investigate the adaptive growth mechanism of S. pneumoniae under Mn-deficient conditions. It was found that the expression levels of 25 proteins were downregulated, whereas those of 54 proteins were upregulated in S. pneumoniae grown in MDCM. It was also noted that several of the downregulated proteins were involved in cell energy metabolism, amino acid synthesis, and reduction of oxidation products. More importantly, several ATP-binding cassette transporters related to Fe uptake, such as PiuA, PiaA, PitA, and SPD_1609, were overexpressed for increased Fe uptake from the MDCM. The results suggest that Mn deficiency disturbs multiple metabolic processes in S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, it causes a compensatory effect of Fe for Mn, which is beneficial for the survival of the bacterium in extreme environments.","authors":[{"name":"Kun Cao"},{"name":"Fubin Lai"},{"name":"Xin-Lu Zhao"},{"name":"Qiu-Xia Wei"},{"name":"Xin-Yu Miao"},{"name":"Ruiguang Ge"},{"name":"Qing-Yu He"},{"name":"Xuesong Sun"}],"keywords":[]},"article341":{"pmid":"29913149","title":"Synthesis and detoxification of nitric oxide in the plant beneficial rhizobacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR9 and its effect on biofilm formation.","date":"2018-12-17","abs":"Nitric oxide (NO) is an important gas signal that regulates many biological processes, and due to the high nitrogen recycling activity in the rhizosphere, NO is an important signaling molecule in this region.

Bacteria adopt multiple mechanisms, such as inhibition of phage adsorption and CRISPR/Cas systems, to resist phage infection. Here, a phage-resistant mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA1 under the infection of lytic phage PaP1 was selected for further study. The PaP1-resistant variant, termed PA1RG, showed decreased adsorption to PaP1 and was devoid of long chain O-antigen on its cell envelope. Whole genome sequencing and comparative analysis revealed a single nucleotide mutation in the gene PA1S_08510, which encodes the O-antigen polymerase Wzy that is involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. PA1_Wzy was classified into the O6 serotype based on sequence homology analysis and adopts a transmembrane topology similar to that seem with P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. Complementation of gene wzy in trans enabled the mutant PA1RG to produce the normal LPS pattern with long chain O-antigen and restored the susceptibility of PA1RG to phage PaP1 infection. While wzy mutation did not affect bacterial growth, mutant PA1RG exhibited decreased biofilm production, suggesting a fitness cost of PA1 associated with resistance of phage PaP1 predation.

Synthesis of these polymers often involves the assembly of monomer oligosaccharide units on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl-phosphate at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. For many polymers, including cell wall peptidoglycan, the lipid-linked precursors must be transported across the membrane by flippases to facilitate polymerization at the membrane surface. Flippase activity for this class of polysaccharides is most often attributed to MOP (Multidrug/Oligosaccharidyl-lipid/Polysaccharide) family proteins. Little is known about how this ubiquitous class of transporters identifies and translocates its cognate precursor over the many different types of lipid-linked oligosaccharides produced by a given bacterial cell. To investigate the specificity determinants of MOP proteins, we selected for variants of the WzxC flippase involved in Escherichia coli capsule (colanic acid) synthesis that can substitute for the essential MurJ MOP-family protein and promote transport of cell wall peptidoglycan precursors. Variants with substitutions predicted to destabilize the inward-open conformation of WzxC lost substrate specificity and supported both capsule and peptidoglycan synthesis. Our results thus suggest that specific substrate recognition by a MOP transporter normally destabilizes the inward-open state, promoting transition to the outward-open conformation and concomitant substrate translocation.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the biological activities of Mangifera indica kernel extracts grown in Northern Thailand (Kaew-Moragot cultivar), related to anti-acne properties including antimicrobial effect against acne-inducing bacteria together with the first elucidation of the mechanism of action against Propionibacterium acnes, anti-oxidation, and anti-inflammation. The kernels of M. indica, obtained from raw and ripe fruits, were macerated using various solvents. Agar diffusion and broth microdilution methods were performed to investigate the antibacterial activities of the extracts against P. acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The ethanolic fractions exhibited the strongest antimicrobial effect against P. acnes with minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of 1.56 mg/mL and 12.50 mg/mL, respectively. Bactericidal effect against P. acnes of these extracts could be observed after 3 h of incubation from time-kill curve. The chromatograms of high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the extracts existed gallic acid with high total phenolic content. These extracts additionally showed strong free radical scavenging properties on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) as well as a notable inhibitory effect on linoleic acid peroxidation, which highly correlated to their antimicrobial effect, total phenolic, and gallic acid contents. The images, studied through using transmission electron microscopy, revealed that the extract certainly disrupted P. acnes cell membrane after exposure for 1 h as well as induced the consequent leakage of cytoplasmic materials. The inhibitory effects of the extracts on IL-8 secretion from LPS-inducing RAW 264.7 cells were also presented. In conclusion, the kernel extracts of raw M. indica fruit were effective against aerobic and anaerobic acne-inducing bacteria particularly P. acnes and exerted antioxidant along with anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, the extracts might be potential agents for inflammatory acne treatment. However, clinical study is needed for further investigation.","authors":[{"name":"Worrapan Poomanee"},{"name":"Wantida Chaiyana"},{"name":"Monika Mueller"},{"name":"Helmut Viernstein"},{"name":"Watcharee Khunkitti"},{"name":"Pimporn Leelapornpisid"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acne vulgaris"},{"word":"Anti-inflammatory activity"},{"word":"Antimicrobial agent"},{"word":"Mangifera indica"},{"word":"Polyphenol"},{"word":"Propionibacterium acnes"}]},"article366":{"pmid":"29906686","title":"Lipidated α/α-AA heterogeneous peptides as antimicrobial agents.","date":"2019-07-15","abs":"With an increase of resistance in bacteria there is an urgent need for alternative treatment methods that could complement conventional antibiotics.

No less than seven sRNAs (McaS, RprA, GcvB, RydC, RybB, OmrA and OmrB) are known to repress the expression of the curli activator CsgD. Many of the sRNAs repress CsgD production by binding to the csgD mRNA at sites far upstream of the ribosomal binding site. The precise mechanism behind sRNA-mediated regulation of CsgD synthesis is largely unknown. In this study, we identify a conserved A/U-rich region in the csgD mRNA 5' untranslated region, which is cleaved upon binding of the small RNAs, McaS, RprA or GcvB, to sites located more than 30 nucleotides downstream. Mutational analysis shows that the A/U-rich region as well as an adjacent stem-loop structure are required for McaS-stimulated degradation, also serving as a binding platform for the RNA chaperone Hfq. Prevention of McaS-activated cleavage completely relieves repression, suggesting that endoribonucleolytic cleavage of csgD mRNA is the primary regulatory effect exerted by McaS.

The adhesion and biofilm formation was monitored, as well as cell properties such as hydrophobicity, zeta potential and motility. Two groups of isolates were observed: one with high adhesion to polymer surfaces and one with low adhesion (the latter including PAO1). Furthermore, detailed biofilm assays in a flow system were performed using five characteristic isolates from the two groups. Confocal microscopy showed that the adhesion and biofilm formation of four of these five strains could be reduced dramatically on zwitterionic surface coatings. However, one isolate with pronounced swarming colonized and formed biofilm also on the antifouling surface. We demonstrate that the biofilm properties of clinical isolates can differ greatly from that of a standard lab strain and propose two clinical model strains for testing of materials designed for prevention of biofilm formation in the respiratory tract.

Therefore, native biofilms, as the prominent life form of microorganisms in almost all known ecosystems, will be subjected to AgNP exposure. Despite the exponentially growing research activities worldwide, it is still difficult to assess nanoparticle-mediated toxicity in natural environments. In order to obtain an ecotoxicologically relevant exposure scenario, we performed experiments with artificial stream mesocosm systems approaching low dose AgNP concentrations close to predicted environmental concentrations. Pregrown freshwater biofilms were exposed for 14 days to citrate-stabilized AgNPs at a concentration of 600 μg l-1 in two commonly used sizes (30 and 70 nm). Sublethal effects of AgNP treatment were assessed with regard to biofilm structure by gravimetric measurements (biofilm thickness and density) and by two biomass parameters, chlorophyll a and protein content. The composition of bacterial biofilm communities was characterized by t-RFLP fingerprinting combined with phylogenetic studies based on the 16S gene. After 14 days of treatment, the structural parameters of the biofilm such as thickness, density, and chlorophyll a and protein content were not statistically significantly changed by AgNP exposure. Furthermore, t-RFLP fingerprint analysis showed that the bacterial diversity was not diminished by AgNPs, as calculated by Shannon Wiener and evenness indices. Nevertheless, t-RFLP analysis also indicated that AgNPs led to an altered biofilm community composition as was shown by cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on the Bray Curtis index. Sequence analysis of cloned 16S rRNA genes further revealed that changes in community composition were related with the displacement of putatively AgNP-sensitive bacterial taxa Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria by taxa known for their enhanced adaptability towards metal stress, such as Acidobacteria, Sphingomonadales, and Comamonadaceae. This measurable community shift, even after low dose AgNP treatment, causes serious concerns with respect to the broad application of AgNPs and their potentially adverse impact on the ecological function of lotic biofilms, such as biodegradation or biostabilization.","authors":[{"name":"Alexandra Y Grün"},{"name":"Constantin B App"},{"name":"Andreas Breidenbach"},{"name":"Jutta Meier"},{"name":"George Metreveli"},{"name":"Gabriele E Schaumann"},{"name":"Werner Manz"}],"keywords":[]},"article382":{"pmid":"29902223","title":"Modelling of ciprofloxacin killing enhanced by hyperbaric oxygen treatment in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms.","date":"2018-12-31","abs":"In chronic lung infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) the bacteria thrive in biofilm structures protected from the immune system of the host and from antibiotic treatment.

This is achieved in a reaction-diffusion model that describes the combined effect of ciprofloxacin diffusion, oxygen diffusion and depletion, bacterial growth and killing, and adaptation of the bacteria to ciprofloxacin. In the model, the oxygen diffusion and depletion use a set of parameters derived from experimental results presented in this work. The part of the model describing ciprofloxacin killing uses parameter values from the literature in combination with our estimates (Jacobs, et al., 2016; Grillon, et al., 2016).

The parameters were validated against existing data from an HBOT experiment by Kolpen et al. (2017). The complete oxygen model comprises a reaction-diffusion equation describing the oxygen consumption by using a Michaelis-Menten reaction term. The oxygen model performed well in predicting oxygen concentrations in both time and depth into the biofilm. At 2.8 bar pure oxygen pressure, HBOT increases the penetration depth of oxygen into the biofilm almost by a of factor 4 in agreement with the scaling that follows from the stationary balance between the consumption term and diffusion term.","authors":[{"name":"Peter Alexander Vistar Gade"},{"name":"Terkel Bo Olsen"},{"name":"Peter Østrup Jensen"},{"name":"Mette Kolpen"},{"name":"Niels Høiby"},{"name":"Kaj-Åge Henneberg"},{"name":"Thomas Sams"}],"keywords":[]},"article383":{"pmid":"29902011","title":"Block Copolymer Nanoparticles Remove Biofilms of Drug-Resistant Gram-Positive Bacteria by Nanoscale Bacterial Debridement.","date":"2018-12-14","abs":"Biofilms and the rapid evolution of multidrug resistance complicate the treatment of bacterial infections.

DA95B5 self-assembles into core-shell nanoparticles with a nonfouling dextran shell and a cationic core. These nanoparticles diffuse into biofilms and attach to bacteria but do not kill them; instead, they promote the gradual dispersal of biofilm bacteria, probably because the solubility of the bacteria-nanoparticle complex is enhanced by the nanoparticle dextran shell. DA95B5, when applied as a solution to a hydrogel pad dressing, shows excellent in vivo MRSA biofilm removal efficacy of 3.6 log reduction in a murine excisional wound model, which is significantly superior to that for vancomycin. Furthermore, DA95B5 has very low in vitro hemolysis and negligible in vivo acute toxicity. This new strategy for biofilm removal (nanoscale bacterial debridement) is orthogonal to conventional rapidly developing resistance traits in bacteria so that it is as effective toward resistant strains as it is toward sensitive strains and may have widespread applications.","authors":[{"name":"Jianghua Li"},{"name":"Kaixi Zhang"},{"name":"Lin Ruan"},{"name":"Seow Fong Chin"},{"name":"Nirmani Wickramasinghe"},{"name":"Hanbin Liu"},{"name":"Vikashini Ravikumar"},{"name":"Jinghua Ren"},{"name":"Hongwei Duan"},{"name":"Liang Yang"},{"name":"Mary B Chan-Park"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"biocompatibility"},{"word":"cationic copolymer nanoparticles"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"nonhemolytic"}]},"article384":{"pmid":"29901811","title":"Decreased susceptibility of Streptococcus anginosus to vancomycin in a multispecies biofilm is due to increased thickness of the cell wall.","date":"2019-10-10","abs":"Streptococcus anginosus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are often co-isolated from the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients.

With respect to biofilm formation, the activity of this wavelength was completely different compared to its activity on planktonic suspension. Irradiation with 260 nm did not inhibit the total biofilm formation by the six-isolate culture; moreover, isolates such as the resistant Eryth23 or the susceptible Pseudoalt17, even gained abundance in the mixed isolate biofilm. The only decrease in total biofilm was obtained from irradiation at 280 nm, which was less active against the planktonic culture. These results indicate that the complexity of the biofilm-forming microbial community may contribute to its resistance to UV-C irradiation.","authors":[{"name":"I Kviatkovski"},{"name":"H Mamane"},{"name":"A Lakretz"},{"name":"I Sherman"},{"name":"D Beno-Moualem"},{"name":"D Minz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"UV resistance"},{"word":"UV-C irradiation"},{"word":"bacterial resistance"},{"word":"biofilm community"},{"word":"biofouling"}]},"article389":{"pmid":"29900920","title":"Effectiveness of nanoparticles solutions and conventional endodontic irrigants against Enterococcus faecalis biofilm.","date":"2018-12-17","abs":"To overcome the challenge imposed by the presence of biofilm and reach significant bacterial reduction of the root canals, many irrigants have been indicated during endodontic treatment, among them nanoparticles solutions.","authors":[{"name":"Josiane de Almeida"},{"name":"Bruna Casagrande Cechella"},{"name":"Anarela Vassen Bernardi"},{"name":"Andrea de Lima Pimenta"},{"name":"Wilson Tadeu Felippe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"silver"},{"word":"zinc oxide"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"29900886","title":"Effect of chlorine on Mycobacterium gordonae and Mycobacterium chubuense in planktonic and Biofilm State.","date":"2019-03-22","abs":": There is evidence that drinking water could be a source of infections with pathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) potentially risky to human health.

All these peptides, encompassing fragments of this region or designed on the basis of short repeated cationic sequences identified in the same region, show toxic activities against a broad spectrum of bacteria and interesting immunomodulatory effects. However, the ability of these molecules to exert antibiofilm properties has not been described so far. In the present work, we report the characterization of a novel peptide, corresponding to residues 133 to 167 of human apolipoprotein E, here named ApoE (133-167). This peptide, besides presenting interesting properties comparable with those reported for other ApoE-derived peptides, such as a direct killing activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria or the ability to downregulate lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine release, is also endowed with significant antibiofilm properties. Indeed, the peptide is able to strongly affect the formation of the extracellular matrix and also the viability of encapsulated bacteria. Noteworthy, ApoE (133-167) is not toxic toward human and murine cell lines and is able to assume ordered conformations in the presence of membrane mimicking agents. Taken together, collected evidences about biological and structural properties of ApoE (133-167) open new perspectives in the design of therapeutic agents based on human-derived bioactive peptides.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Zanfardino"},{"name":"Andrea Bosso"},{"name":"Giovanni Gallo"},{"name":"Valeria Pistorio"},{"name":"Michela Di Napoli"},{"name":"Rosa Gaglione"},{"name":"Eliana Dell'Olmo"},{"name":"Mario Varcamonti"},{"name":"Eugenio Notomista"},{"name":"Angela Arciello"},{"name":"Elio Pizzo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"apolipoprotein E"},{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"lipopolysaccharide"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"29899738","title":"Role of the Mycobacterium marinum ESX-1 Secretion System in Sliding Motility and Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Mycobacterium marinum is a close relative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that can cause systemic tuberculosis-like infections in ectotherms and skin infections in humans. Sliding motility correlates with biofilm formation and virulence in most bacteria. In this study, we used a sliding motility assay to screen 2,304 transposon mutants of M. marinum NTUH-M6885 and identified five transposon mutants with decreased sliding motility. Transposons that interrupted the type VII secretion system (T7SS) ESX-1-related genes, espE (mmar_5439), espF (mmar_5440), and eccA1 (mmar_5443), were present in 3 mutants. We performed reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to verify genes from mmar_5438 to mmar_5450, which were found to belong to a single transcriptional unit. Deletion mutants of espE, espF, espG (mmar_5441), and espH (mmar_5442) displayed significant attenuation regarding sliding motility and biofilm formation. M. marinum NTUH-M6885 possesses a functional ESX-1 secretion system. However, deletion of espG or espH resulted in slightly decreased secretion of EsxB (which is also known as CFP-10). Thus, the M. marinum ESX-1 secretion system mediates sliding motility and is crucial for biofilm formation. These data provide new insight into M. marinum biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Li-Yin Lai"},{"name":"Tzu-Lung Lin"},{"name":"Yi-Yin Chen"},{"name":"Pei-Fang Hsieh"},{"name":"Jin-Town Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ESX-1"},{"word":"Mycobacterium marinum"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"sliding motility"},{"word":"type VII secretion system"}]},"article395":{"pmid":"29899518","title":"An intriguing relationship between the cyclic diguanylate signaling system and horizontal gene transfer.","date":"2019-09-01","abs":"The second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is ubiquitously used by bacteria to modulate and shift between different phenotypes including motility, biofilm formation and virulence.

Controlling biofilm formation in soil requires a fundamental understanding of how bacterial cells interact with soil under relevant environmental conditions. Here, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to quantify the adhesion forces acting between a model soil microbe, Pseudomonas putida, and a model of quartz sand under a range of ionic strengths (ISs; 0.02M-0.52M) that bracket common environmental conditions present in soil. AFM forces were decoupled into specific and nonspecific components following the established Poisson statistical analysis method. The experimental nonspecific forces were compared to theoretical forces calculated using the soft-particle analysis of the Derjaguin, Landau, Verwie, and Overbeek theory of colloidal interactions. Their data indicated that both specific and nonspecific forces increased as the IS increased with specific forces being 37% higher on average than nonspecific forces. The AFM findings were validated by measuring the transport of P. putida in sand columns kinetically as a function of IS. Collected breakthrough curves were modeled using one-dimensional colloidal filtration theory. Their nanoscale AFM measurements of bacterial adhesion correlated positively with the bacterial macroscale sticking collision efficiencies with both increasing as the IS increased. Collectively, their results suggest that applying biofilms for bioclogging applications is suitable in sandy, hydrophobic environments with elevated ISs where specific forces such as hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions may have a critical role in promoting bacterial adhesion.","authors":[{"name":"Somayeh Ramezanian"},{"name":"Hien Xuan Ta"},{"name":"Balasingam Muhunthan"},{"name":"Nehal Abu-Lail"}],"keywords":[]},"article397":{"pmid":"29898180","title":"Dental caries and bacterial load in saliva and dental biofilm of type 1 diabetics on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Since most of the studies evaluates diabetics on multiple daily injections therapy and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion may help gain better metabolic control and prevent complications, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dental caries, the unstimulated salivary flow rate and the total bacteria load, Streptococcus spp. levels and Lactobacillus spp. levels in saliva and supragingival dental biofilm of type 1 diabetics on insulin pump.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Coelho"},{"name":"Anabela Paula"},{"name":"Marta Mota"},{"name":"Mafalda Laranjo"},{"name":"Margarida Abrantes"},{"name":"Francisco Carrilho"},{"name":"Manuel Ferreira"},{"name":"Mário Silva"},{"name":"Filomena Botelho"},{"name":"Eunice Carrilho"}],"keywords":[]},"article398":{"pmid":"29898172","title":"Efficacy of relacin combined with sodium hypochlorite against Enterococcus faecalis biofilms.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Relacin is a synthetic molecule that targets RelA, an essential protein in a conserved bacterial stress response system.
