Current antibacterial coatings to combat implant-associated infections are generally composed of toxic metals or nondegradable polymers and involve multistep surface modifications. Here, we present a charge-switchable antibacterial and antibiofilm coating based on water-insoluble cationic hydrophobic polymers that are soluble in organic solvents and can be noncovalently coated onto different surfaces. Toward this, a library of quaternary polyethylenimine (QPEI) polymers with an amide or ester group in their pendant alkyl chain was developed. These QPEIs are shown to hydrolyze from active cationic to nontoxic zwitterionic polymers under acidic or enzymatic conditions. Notably, polymers with both zwitterionic and cationic groups, obtained upon partial hydrolysis of QPEIs, are shown to retain their antibacterial activity with much lower toxicity toward mammalian cells. Furthermore, the zwitterionic polymer, a fully hydrolyzed product of the QPEIs, is shown to be nontoxic to mammalian cells in vitro as well as in vivo. The QPEIs, when coated onto surfaces, kill bacteria and prevent formation of biofilms. In an in vivo mice model, the QPEI-coated medical grade catheter is shown to reduce methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus contamination both on the catheter surface and in the adjacent tissues (99.99% reduction compared to a noncoated catheter). Additionally, biofilm formation is inhibited on the catheter surface with negligible inflammation in the adjacent tissue. The above results thus highlight the importance of these polymers to be used as effective antibacterial coatings in biomedical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Jiaul Hoque"},{"name":"Sreyan Ghosh"},{"name":"Krishnamoorthy Paramanandham"},{"name":"Jayanta Haldar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-infective biomaterials"},{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"bactericidal coating"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"side-chain hydrolysable polymers"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"31549575","title":"Brevinin-GR23 from frog Hylarana guentheri with antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"Brevinin-GR23 (B-GR23) was a brevinin-2 like antimicrobial peptide, which had antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 16 μM.

Here we observe a notable effect of oxygen tension on the macroscopic and biofilm morphotypes of the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. A hypoxia-typic morphotype is generated through the expression of a subtelomeric gene cluster containing genes that alter the hyphal surface and perturb interhyphal interactions to disrupt in vivo biofilm and infection site morphologies. Consequently, this morphotype leads to increased host inflammation, rapid disease progression and mortality in a murine model of invasive aspergillosis.

Geobacter sulfurreducens is a commonly enriched electricity-producing organism, forming thick conductive biofilms that magnify total activity by supporting respiration of cells not in direct contact with electrodes. Hypotheses explaining why these biofilms fail to produce higher current densities suggest inhibition by formation of pH, nutrient, or redox potential gradients; but these explanations are often contradictory, and a lack of direct measurements of cellular growth within biofilms prevents discrimination between these models. To address this fundamental question, we measured the anabolic activity of G. sulfurreducens biofilms using stable isotope probing coupled to nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS). Our results demonstrate that the most active cells are at the anode surface, and that this activity decreases with distance, reaching a minimum 10 µm from the electrode. Cells nearest the electrode continue to grow at their maximum rate in weeks-old biofilms 80-µm-thick, indicating nutrient or buffer diffusion into the biofilm is not rate-limiting. This pattern, where highest activity occurs at the electrode and declines with each cell layer, is present in thin biofilms (<5 µm) and fully grown biofilms (>20 µm), and at different anode redox potentials. These results suggest a growth penalty is associated with respiring insoluble electron acceptors at micron distances, which has important implications for improving microbial electrochemical devices as well as our understanding of syntrophic associations harnessing the phenomenon of microbial conductivity.","authors":[{"name":"Grayson L Chadwick"},{"name":"Fernanda Jiménez Otero"},{"name":"Jeffrey A Gralnick"},{"name":"Daniel R Bond"},{"name":"Victoria J Orphan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Geobacter sulfurreducens"},{"word":"electrode reduction"},{"word":"extracellular electron transfer"},{"word":"nanoSIMS"},{"word":"stable isotope tracers"}]},"article7":{"pmid":"31548326","title":"Expression of the Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae Type IV Pilus Is Stimulated by Coculture with Host Respiratory Tract Epithelial Cells.","date":"2020-01-21","abs":"The type IV pilus (Tfp) of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) mediates adherence, colonization, motility, and biofilm formation, and the major protein subunit, PilA, is a promising vaccine candidate. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Tfp expression is regulated within the microenvironments of the human nasopharynx, which NTHI colonizes asymptomatically, and the more distal regions of the respiratory tract where NTHI-induced diseases occur. Here, we examined the effects of coculture of NTHI with human airway epithelial cells and heme availability on Tfp expression at temperatures typical of the human nasopharynx (34°C) or warmer anatomical sites during infection (37°C). Tfp expression was estimated by pilA promoter activity, pilA gene expression, and relative abundances of PilA and pilin protein. The results revealed that at both temperatures, NTHI cocultured with airway epithelial cells demonstrated significantly greater expression of pilA, PilA/pilin protein, and likely, fully assembled Tfp than NTHI cultured on an abiotic surface. Because NTHI is a heme auxotroph, we hypothesized that availability of heme from host cells might be a signal for Tfp expression. Thereby, we cultured NTHI in iron-limited medium, and we observed that supplementation with heme significantly increased pilA promoter activity. Collectively, our data suggested that NTHI Tfp expression was stimulated by soluble factor(s) released by epithelial cells, which are present in all microenvironments of the respiratory tract. The expression of this target antigen under conditions that mimic the human airway strongly supports the rationale for the use of PilA as a vaccine immunogen to prevent NTHI-induced diseases of the respiratory tract.","authors":[{"name":"Elaine M Mokrzan"},{"name":"Taylor J Johnson"},{"name":"Lauren O Bakaletz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"COPD"},{"word":"PilA"},{"word":"heme"},{"word":"otitis media"},{"word":"vaccine"}]},"article8":{"pmid":"31548325","title":"Direct Microscopic Observation of Human Neutrophil-Staphylococcus aureus Interaction In Vitro Suggests a Potential Mechanism for Initiation of Biofilm Infection on an Implanted Medical Device.","date":"2020-01-21","abs":"The ability of human neutrophils to clear newly attached Staphylococcus aureus bacteria from a serum-coated glass surface was examined in vitro using time-lapse confocal scanning laser microscopy.

Importantly, these infections are often difficult to treat effectively in part due to the recalcitrance of biofilms to antimicrobial therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that polymicrobial interactions can lead to dramatic and unexpected changes in the ability of antibiotics to eradicate biofilms and often result in decreased antimicrobial efficacy in vitro In this review, we discuss the influence of polymicrobial interactions on the antibiotic susceptibility of biofilms, and we highlight the studies that first documented the shifted antimicrobial susceptibilities of mixed-species cultures. Recent studies have identified several mechanisms underlying the recalcitrance of polymicrobial biofilm communities, including interspecies exchange of antibiotic resistance genes, β-lactamase-mediated inactivation of antibiotics, changes in gene expression induced by metabolites and quorum sensing signals, inhibition of the electron transport chain, and changes in properties of the cell membrane. In addition to elucidating multiple mechanisms that contribute to the altered drug susceptibility of polymicrobial biofilms, these studies have uncovered novel ways in which polymicrobial interactions can impact microbial physiology. The diversity of findings discussed highlights the importance of continuing to investigate the efficacy of antibiotics against biofilm communities composed of different combinations of microbial species. Together, the data presented here illustrate the importance of studying microbes as part of mixed-species communities rather than in isolation. In light of our greater understanding of how interspecies interactions alter the efficacy of antimicrobial agents, we propose that the methods for measuring the drug susceptibility of polymicrobial infections should be revisited.","authors":[{"name":"Giulia Orazi"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"polymicrobial"},{"word":"recalcitrance"},{"word":"resistance"},{"word":"tolerance"}]},"article10":{"pmid":"31548061","title":"Antimicrobial resistance and genetic characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococci from bovine mastitis milk samples in Korea.","date":"2020-02-17","abs":"Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are one of the most common bovine mastitis pathogens found worldwide.

Further evaluation of the CNS isolates revealed 14 CNS species among the samples and 3 predominant species-namely, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus simulans, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Resistance was higher in S. epidermidis than in other CNS species except for resistance against oxacillin in Staphylococcus sciuri. Resistance to β-lactams was the most common in all CNS species (8.4% in ampicillin, 21.2% in oxacillin, and 13.5% in penicillin).

Twenty-one isolates from 4 species were mecA-carrying MRCNS strains, including 18 S. epidermidis and 1 each of S. sciuri, Staphylococcus equorum, and Staphylococcus hominis. The majority of the mecA-carrying MRCNS isolates were produced in the biofilm. Furthermore, multidrug-resistant sequence type 179 isolate produced the strongest biofilm. Seven genotypes were detected in the 18 MR S. epidermidis strains, the most predominant of which persisted on a farm for 2 yr.

Recent observations have provided additional evidence that sRNAs are key regulators of bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. These sRNAs have been divided into 5 functional groups: cis-encoded RNAs, trans-encoded RNAs, RNA regulators of protein activity, bacterial CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) RNAs, and a novel category of miRNA-size small RNAs (msRNAs). In this review, we discuss a critical group of key commensal and opportunistic oral pathogens. In general, supragingival bacterial sRNAs function synergistically to fine-tune the regulation of cellular processes and stress responses in adaptation to environmental changes. Particularly in the cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans, both the antisense vicR RNA and msRNA1657 can impede the metabolism of bacterial exopolysaccharides, prevent biofilm formation, and suppress its cariogenicity. In Enterococcus faecalis, selected sRNAs control the expression of proteins involved in diverse cellular processes and stress responses. In subgingival plaques, sRNAs from periodontal pathogens can function as novel bacterial signaling molecules that mediate bacterial-human interactions in periodontal homeostasis. In Porphyromonas gingivalis, the expression profiles of putative sRNA101 and sRNA42 were found to respond to hemin availability after hemin starvation. Regarding Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), a major periodontal pathogen associated with aggressive periodontitis, the predicted sRNAs interact with several virulence genes, including those encoding leukotoxin and cytolethal distending toxin. Furthermore, in clinical isolates, these associated RNAs could be explored not only as potential biomarkers for oral disease monitoring but also as alternative types of regulators for drug design. Thus, this emerging subspecialty of bacterial regulatory RNAs could reshape our understanding of bacterial gene regulation from their key roles of endogenous regulatory RNAs to their activities in pathologic processes.","authors":[{"name":"L Lei"},{"name":"Y Yang"},{"name":"Y Yang"},{"name":"S Wu"},{"name":"X Ma"},{"name":"M Mao"},{"name":"T Hu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"noncoding RNA"},{"word":"pathogenicity"},{"word":"polysaccharides"},{"word":"regulation"}]},"article13":{"pmid":"31547513","title":"The Core Proteome of Biofilm-Grown Clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates.","date":"2020-02-04","abs":"Comparative genomics has greatly facilitated the identification of shared as well as unique features among individual cells or tissues, and thus offers the potential to find disease markers.

Both the modified surfaces have shown slight decrease in hardness and elastic modulus, which may be attributed to improper impregnation of polymer inside porous surface. However, after the release of drug, the solvent-based etched surface regains its mechanical and tribological properties, in similar range to the unmodified UHMWPE surface. Both the modified surfaces have shown an impressive drug release profile and in vitro antibacterial efficacy. The drug release duration was more for electrostatic spray modified surface. Hence, these surfaces modified implant parts shown great promise for fighting against post-surgery bacterial infection.","authors":[{"name":"R Manoj Kumar"},{"name":"Swati Haldar"},{"name":"K Rajesh"},{"name":"Souvik Ghosh"},{"name":"Debrupa Lahiri"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial infection"},{"word":"Drug delivery"},{"word":"Orthopedic implant"},{"word":"Surface modification"},{"word":"Tribology"}]},"article21":{"pmid":"31546354","title":"Accelerated corrosion of pipeline steel in the presence of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans biofilm due to carbon source deprivation in CO","date":"2020-02-04","abs":"The chemistry of bacterial biofilms as well as the nutritional composition of culture environments may differ at any time within a growth process, especially for SRB consortia within oil wells with limited carbon sources.

In this review, the in vitro and in vivo studies provided us with the insight into the role of Candida virulence factors that mediate their success as pathogens, such as: membrane and cell wall (CW) barriers, dimorphism, biofilm formation, signal transduction pathway, proteins related to stress tolerance, hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., proteases, lipases, haemolysins), and toxin production. The review characterized the virulence of clinically important C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei. Due to the white-opaque transition in the mating type locus MTL-homozygous cells, C. albicans demonstrates advantage over the other less related species of Candida as a human commensal and pathogen. It was reviewed that Candida ergosterol biosynthesis genes play a role in cellular stress and are essential for Candida pathogenesis both in invasive and superficial infections. Hydrolases associated with CW are involved in the host-pathogen interactions. Adhesins are crucial in colonization and biofilm formation, an important virulence factor for candidiasis. Calcineurin is involved in membrane and CW stress as well as virulence. The hyphae- specific toxin, named candidalysin, invades mucosal cells facilitating fungal invasion into deeper tissues. Expression of this protein promotes resistance to neutrophil killing in candidiasis. The virulence factors provide immunostimulatory factors, activating dendric cells and promoting T cell infiltration and activation. Targeting virulence factors can reduce risk of resistance development in Candida infections.","authors":[{"name":"Staniszewska Monika"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"morphogenesis"},{"word":"pathogenicity"},{"word":"stress regulator"},{"word":"surface barriers"},{"word":"toxin"},{"word":"virulence targets"}]},"article28":{"pmid":"31544364","title":"Risk assessments in orthodontic patients developing white spot lesions.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"To determine whether caries risk factors, including cariogenic bacterial levels and salivary function, can be used to identify orthodontic patients who develop white spot lesions (WSL).","authors":[{"name":"Danielle K Leeper"},{"name":"Amal Noureldin"},{"name":"Katie Julien"},{"name":"Phillip M Campbell"},{"name":"Peter H Buschang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"decalcification"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"orthodontics"},{"word":"risk"},{"word":"saliva"}]},"article29":{"pmid":"31544055","title":"Gas Sensor Array System Properties for Detecting Bacterial Biofilms.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Gas sensor array system is a device that mimics the work of how the nose smells using the gas sensors that could give response toward specific odors.

Novel, innovative strategies are needed to eradicate bacteria, particularly within biofilms, and diminish the likelihood of recurrence. In this study, we investigated whether glutathione (GSH) can act as a biofilm disruptor, and enhance antibiotic effectiveness against various bacterial pathogens. Biological levels (10 mM) of GSH did not have a significant effect in inhibiting growth or disrupting the biofilm in four out of six species tested. However, exposure to 30 mM GSH showed >50% decrease in growth for all bacterial species, with almost 100% inhibition of Streptococcus pyogenes and an average of 94-52% inhibition for Escherichia coli, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) isolates, respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter sp. isolates were however, highly resistant to 30 mM GSH. With respect to biofilm viability, all species exhibited a >50% decrease in viability with 30 mM GSH, with confocal imaging showing considerable change in the biofilm architecture of MRAB isolates. The mechanism of GSH-mediated biofilm disruption is possibly due to a concentration-dependent increase in GSH acidity that triggers cleaving of the matrix components. Enzymatic treatment of MRAB revealed that eDNA and polysaccharides are essential for biofilm stability and eDNA removal enhanced amikacin efficiency. Combination of GSH, amikacin and DNase-I showed the greatest reduction in MRAB biofilm viability. Additionally, GSH alone and in combination with amikacin fostered human fibroblast cell (HFF-1) growth and confluence while inhibiting MRAB adhesion and colonization.","authors":[{"name":"Theerthankar Das"},{"name":"Denis Paino"},{"name":"Arthika Manoharan"},{"name":"Jessica Farrell"},{"name":"Greg Whiteley"},{"name":"Frederik H Kriel"},{"name":"Trevor Glasbey"},{"name":"Jim Manos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acinetobacter baumannii"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"glutathione"},{"word":"thiol antioxidants"}]},"article33":{"pmid":"31543869","title":"Type VI Secretion System in Pathogenic Escherichia coli: Structure, Role in Virulence, and Acquisition.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Bacterial pathogens utilize a myriad of mechanisms to invade mammalian hosts, damage tissue sites, and evade the immune system. One essential strategy of Gram-negative bacteria is the secretion of virulence factors through both inner and outer membranes to reach a potential target. Most secretion systems are harbored in mobile elements including transposons, plasmids, pathogenicity islands, and phages, and Escherichia coli is one of the more versatile bacteria adopting this genetic information by horizontal gene transfer. Additionally, E. coli is a bacterial species with members of the commensal intestinal microbiota and pathogens associated with numerous types of infections such as intestinal, urinary, and systemic in humans and other animals. T6SS cluster plasticity suggests evolutionarily divergent systems were acquired horizontally. T6SS is a secretion nanomachine that is extended through the bacterial double membrane; from this apparatus, substrates are conveyed straight from the cytoplasm of the bacterium into a target cell or to the extracellular space. This nanomachine consists of three main complexes: proteins in the inner membrane that are T4SS component-like, the baseplate complex, and the tail complex, which are formed by components evolutionarily related to contractile bacteriophage tails. Advances in the T6SS understanding include the functional and structural characterization of at least 13 subunits (so-called core components), which are thought to comprise the minimal apparatus. So far, the main role of T6SS is on bacterial competition by using it to kill neighboring non-immune bacteria for which antibacterial proteins are secreted directly into the periplasm of the bacterial target after cell-cell contact. Interestingly, a few T6SSs have been associated directly to pathogenesis, e.g., roles in biofilm formation and macrophage survival. Here, we focus on the advances on T6SS from the perspective of E. coli pathotypes with emphasis in the secretion apparatus architecture, the mechanisms of pathogenicity of effector proteins, and the events of lateral gene transfer that led to its spread.","authors":[{"name":"Fernando Navarro-Garcia"},{"name":"Fernando Ruiz-Perez"},{"name":"Ángel Cataldi"},{"name":"Mariano Larzábal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial competition"},{"word":"diarrheagenic E. coli"},{"word":"effector proteins"},{"word":"genome plasticity"},{"word":"inner and outer membranes"},{"word":"protein translocation"},{"word":"type 6 secretion system"}]},"article34":{"pmid":"31543653","title":"Biofilm Formation of Methicillin-resistant Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci Isolated from Clinical Samples in Northern Thailand.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) are multidrug-resistant bacteria that are difficult to treat because of their ability to form biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Thawatchai Kitti"},{"name":"Rathanin Seng"},{"name":"Rapee Thummeepak"},{"name":"Chalermchai Boonlao"},{"name":"Thanyasiri Jindayok"},{"name":"Sutthirat Sitthisak"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm-associated protein"},{"word":"intracellular adhesion AD"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus"}]},"article35":{"pmid":"31543613","title":"Detection of Enterococcus faecalis in subgingival biofilms of healthy, gingivitis, and chronic periodontitis subjects.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic coccus that can survive under harsh conditions.

To improve its performance in MSL system, the relationship between biophysiological characteristics of denitrifying species and operating conditions was studied. Microbial species diversity of activated sludge and soil samples were analyzed. The significant effects of independent factors and their interactions on microbial species diversity and denitrifying species abundance were revealed on the basis of factorial analysis.

These three factors, including activated sludge, PBS in SMBs, and submersion condition had different significant effects on microbial responses. They were favorable for denitrification and ensuring a better removal efficiency of nitrate and total nitrogen. The porous zeolites were served as the habitats for most of aerobic bacteria to form biofilms, which could promote the oxygen consumption in both sewage and system to improve denitrification in SMBs.

While the former approach is subjective and experience-dependant, the latter technique is susceptible to missing subsurface, biofilm-associated colonization, and any peripheral bacterial burden, and also delays confirmation by up to 5 days. The MolecuLight i:X is a handheld, noncontact fluorescence imaging device, which can reveal real-time information about clinically significant levels of bacteria and their biodistribution in surface and subsurface burn wound tissues. We conducted a single-center observational study to assess the device efficacy in identifying critical bacterial levels in pediatric burn wounds and to test the children's compliance and the overall feasibility of the device integration into the current diagnostic practice. Ten patients with 16 wounds were recruited and assessed for the presence or absence of clinical signs and symptoms of infection and the presence or absence of bacterial fluorescence on images, with swabs taken to confirm findings. Results demonstrate the device's ability to visualize clinically significant bacterial burden and to localize distribution of pathogens.

Thus, adaptations are necessary for ensuring the rapid onset of substrate degradation and the integrity of the cells. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 can use the toxic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a growth substrate and employs, among others, cell aggregation as a protection mechanism. The degradation itself is also a protection mechanism and has to be rapidly induced upon contact to SDS. In this study, gene regulation of the enzymes initiating SDS degradation in strain PAO1 was studied. The gene and an atypical DNA-binding site of the LysR-type regulator SdsB1 were identified and shown to activate expression of the alkylsulfatase SdsA1 initiating SDS degradation. Further degradation of the resulting 1-dodecanol is catalyzed by enzymes encoded by laoCBA, which were shown to form an operon. Expression of this operon is regulated by the TetR-type repressor LaoR. Studies with purified LaoR identified its DNA-binding site and 1-dodecanoyl coenzyme A as the ligand causing detachment of LaoR from the DNA. Transcriptional studies revealed that the sulfate ester detergent sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) induced expression of sdsA1 and the lao operon. Growth experiments revealed an essential involvement of the alkylsulfatase SdsA1 for SLES degradation.

RA is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, the production of anti-citrullinated proteins antibodies (ACPA) leading to synovial joint inflammation and destruction. PD is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with a dysbiotic microbial biofilm affecting the supporting tissues around the teeth leading to the destruction of mineralized and non-mineralized connective tissues. Chronic inflammation associated with both RA and PD is similar in the predominant adaptive immune phenotype, in the imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and in the role of smoking and genetic background as risk factors. Structural damage that occurs in consequence of chronic inflammation is the ultimate cause of loss of function and disability observed with the progression of RA and PD. Interestingly, the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated in the generation of ACPA in RA patients, suggesting a direct biological intersection between PD and RA. However, more studies are warranted to confirm this link, elucidate potential mechanisms involved, and ascertain temporal associations between RA and PD. This review is mainly focused on recent clinical and translational research intends to discuss and provide an overview of the relationship between RA and PD, exploring the similarities in the immune-pathological aspects and the possible mechanisms linking the development and progression of both diseases.

In all the species, the biofilm biovolume and thickness increased over time and reached a plateau after seven days; however, the final biomass reached was very different. The roughness decreased during maturation, reflecting cell division and voids filling. The extracellular polymeric substances content of the matrix remained constant in some species, and increased over time in some others. Vertical profiles showed that young biofilms presented a maximum cell density at 20 μm above the substratum co-localized with matrix components. In mature biofilms, the maximum density of cells moved at a greater distance from the substratum (30-40 μm), whereas the maximum coverage of matrix components remained in a deeper layer.

Thus, a growing need exists to develop alternative treatments to reduce both the occurrence of bacterial infection and biofilm development, as well as pathological progression post-infection. Silk derived from Bombyx mori silkworms serves as a unique biomaterial that is biocompatible with low immunogenicity and high versatility, and thereby ideal for stabilizing therapeutics. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxicity of P. aeruginosa on human corneal stromal stem cells and two mucosal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT29-MTX). To determine whether antibiotic-immobilized scaffolds can serve as alternative therapeutics to free, diffuse forms, we developed novel gentamicin-conjugated silk films as functional scaffolds and compared antimicrobial effects and free gentamicin. The advantages of generating a surface coating with a covalently-bound antibiotic may reduce potential side-effects associated with free gentamicin, as well as limit the diffusion of the drug. Our results suggest that gentamicin conjugated to native silk and carboxyl-enriched silk inhibits P. aeruginosa growth. Development of stabilized antibiotic treatments with surface toxicity selective against bacteria may serve as an alternative approach to treat active infections, as well as potential prophylactic use as coatings in high-risk cases, such as post-surgical complications or prolonged hospitalization.","authors":[{"name":"Tina B McKay"},{"name":"Rachael N Parker"},{"name":"Morgan J Hawker"},{"name":"Meghan McGill"},{"name":"David L Kaplan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic"},{"word":"scaffold"},{"word":"silk"}]},"article57":{"pmid":"31540203","title":"Effects of Ultrasound on Zinc Oxide/Vermiculite/Chlorhexidine Nanocomposite Preparation and Their Antibacterial Activity.","date":"2019-11-01","abs":"Microbial infection and biofilm formation are both problems associated with medical implants and devices. In recent years, hybrid organic-inorganic nanocomposites based on clay minerals have attracted significant attention due to their application potential in the field of antimicrobial materials. Organic drug/metal oxide hybrids exhibit improved antimicrobial activity, and intercalating the above materials into the interlayer of clay endows a long-term and controlled-release behavior. Since antimicrobial activity is strongly related to the structure of the material, ultrasonic treatment appears to be a suitable method for the synthesis of these materials as it can well control particle size distribution and morphology. This study aims to prepare novel, structurally stable, and highly antimicrobial nanocomposites based on zinc oxide/vermiculite/chlorhexidine. The influence of ultrasonic treatment at different time intervals and under different intercalation conditions (ultrasonic action in a breaker or in a Roset's vessel) on the structure, morphology, and particle size of prepared hybrid nanocomposite materials was evaluated by the following methods: scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, carbon phase analysis, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, specific surface area measurement, particle size analysis, and Zeta potential analysis. Particle size analyses confirmed that the ultrasonic method contributes to the reduction of particle size, and to their homogenization/arrangement. Further, X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that ultrasound intercalation in a beaker helps to more efficiently intercalate chlorhexidine dihydrochloride (CH) into the vermiculite interlayer space, while a Roset's vessel contributed to the attachment of the CH molecules to the vermiculite surface. The antibacterial activity of hybrid nanocomposite materials was investigated on Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) bacterial strains by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration. All hybrid nanocomposite materials prepared by ultrasound methods showed high antimicrobial activity after 30 min, with a long-lasting effect and without being affected by the concentration of the antibacterial components zinc oxide (ZnO) and CH. The benefits of the samples prepared by ultrasonic methods are the rapid onset of an antimicrobial effect and its long-term duration.","authors":[{"name":"Karla Čech Barabaszová"},{"name":"Sylva Holešová"},{"name":"Kateřina Šulcová"},{"name":"Marianna Hundáková"},{"name":"Barbora Thomasová"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial activity"},{"word":"chlorhexidine"},{"word":"mechanical stirring"},{"word":"ultrasonic intercalation"},{"word":"vermiculite"},{"word":"zinc oxide nanoparticles"}]},"article58":{"pmid":"31540175","title":"The Pathogenic Factors from Oral Streptococci for Systemic Diseases.","date":"2020-01-31","abs":"The oral cavity is suggested as the reservoir of bacterial infection, and the oral and pharyngeal biofilms formed by oral bacterial flora, which is comprised of over 700 microbial species, have been found to be associated with systemic conditions.

However, the risk of peri-implantitis and implant failure is the main complication of implantology. The presence of a micro gap at the implant-abutment connection (IAC) allows microorganisms to penetrate and colonize the inner part of the implant leading to biofilm accumulation and consequently to peri-implantitis development. Some chemical devices (CD) has been studied to reduce bacterial penetration at IAC level but no one have been demonstrated to be effective for this purpose. Aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new chemical formulation STCX-1, placed in the internal part of dental implants for killing bacteria present in the IAC. To identify the antibacterial power of SXTC-1 at interface between implant-abutment connection, the passage of genetically modified Escherichia coli across IAC was evaluated. A total of eight implants were used (Edierre Implant System, Edierre SpA, Genova, Italy). The inner side of four out of the eight implants were firstly contaminated with few microliters of pure bacteria, subsequently were treated with SXTC-1 for few second and finally, the antibacterial was replaced with Lysogeny Broth (LB) and antibiotics without bacteria. The remaining four implants were not treated with SXTC-1 and just filled with LB with antibiotics. Bacteria viability was determined by measuring their Optical Density (OD) at 600nm. The analysis revealed that, in untreated implants, bacteria grew (internally and externally) for the first 48 hours, but subsequently they started to dye. In treated implants, instead, bacteria grew just in the space surrounding the device suggesting that, even if bacteria were able to get into, they immediately died thanks to the presence of SXTC-1. The STCX-1 liquid formulation have been demonstrated to be an adjuvant CD effective for prevention of of bacterial colonization at IAC level.","authors":[{"name":" "},{"name":"L Oberti"},{"name":"F Gabrione"},{"name":"G Greco"},{"name":"M Severino"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chemical devices"},{"word":"implant-abutment connection"},{"word":"microbiological leakage"},{"word":"peri-implantitis"}]},"article68":{"pmid":"31538444","title":"The effects of a new decontaminant solution on root canal bleeding during endodontic treatment: a randomized controlled study.","date":"2019-10-01","abs":"Blood contamination of the canal during preparation and obturation can be a problem in Endodontics; this may result in apical microleakage.

The model was validated by the experimental data and could predict chemical profiles and microbial distributions in sediments. The model revealed complicated interactions between different microbial communities and environmental factors, including competition between aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The results of model simulations showed that the effects of environmental factors, especially dissolved oxygen and ammonia in overlying water, on methane fluxes are very complicated. Rapid environmental changes (which can be caused by tide, day-night alternation, or zoobenthic and human activity) and intensive competition between microbes greatly affected methane fluxes and resulted in alternation between atmospheric methane source and sink in unstable sediments.

Sandblasted and acid-etched commercially pure titanium discs were used as substrates for bacteria (n = 107). The discs were immersed in an S mutans solution and incubated for 21 hours to form an S mutans biofilm. Twenty colonized discs were subjected to air abrasion with Bioglass 45S5 (45S5 BAG), experimental zinc oxide containing BAG (Zn4 BAG), and inert glass. After the abrasion, the discs were incubated for 5 hours in an anaerobic chamber followed by an assessment of viable S mutans cells. Surface morphology was evaluation using scanning electron microscopy (n = 12). The thrombogenicity of the glass particle-abraded discs (n = 75) was evaluated spectrophotometrically using whole-blood clotting measurement at predetermined time points. Air abrasion with 45S5 and Zn4 BAG eradicated S mutans biofilm. Significantly fewer viable S mutans cells were found on discs abraded with the 45S5 or Zn4 BAGs compared with the inert glass (P < .001). No significant differences were found in thrombogenicity since blood clotting was achieved for all substrates at 40 minutes. Air abrasion with BAG particles is effective in the eradication of S mutans biofilm from sandblasted and acid-etched titanium surfaces. Zn4 and 45S5 BAGs had similar biofilm-eradicating effects, but Zn4 BAG could be more tissue friendly.

Bacteria produce a surface biofilm which may act as a public good providing protection from invaders, storage for resources, and greater access to oxygen for microbes embedded within it.

In this study, we investigated the effect of glucose on the biofilm formation ability of P. aeruginosa and carried out a metabolomic analysis to identify whether glucose alters the metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa in biofilms. We found that glucose efficiently promoted P. aeruginosa biofilm formation by upregulating the expression of the extracellular polysaccharide-related gene pslA. Treatment with glucose caused an increase in 7 metabolites (including 3-hydroxypropionic acid, glucose-6-phosphate, and 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid) and a decrease in 18 metabolites (including myo-inositol, glutamine, and methoxamedrine) in the biofilm. In addition, there was a synergistic effect between glucose and horse serum on biofilm formation when the two were added in combination, which also increased the resistance of biofilm to levofloxacin therapy. Thus, our work sheds light on the underlying mechanisms by which glucose may enhance biofilm formation and identifies novel targets for developing strategies to counteract biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Pengfei She"},{"name":"Yanle Wang"},{"name":"Yiqing Liu"},{"name":"Fang Tan"},{"name":"Lihua Chen"},{"name":"Zhen Luo"},{"name":"Yong Wu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"extracellular polysaccharide"},{"word":"glucose"},{"word":"metabolomics"}]},"article97":{"pmid":"31532261","title":"On-Farm Surfaces in Contact with Milk: The Role of Staphylococcus aureus-Containing Biofilms for Udder Health and Milk Quality.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes intramammary infections and bulk tank milk (BTM) contamination in dairy operations around the world in spite of on-farm application of preventive measures.

However, robots designed to damage deleterious biostructures could also have important impact. In particular, there is an urgent need for new strategies to eradicate bacterial biofilms as we approach a post-antibiotic era. Biofilms are intractable and firmly attached structures ubiquitously associated with drug-resistant infections and destruction of surfaces. Existing treatments are inadequate to both kill and remove bacteria leading to reinfection. Here we design catalytic antimicrobial robots (CARs) that precisely and controllably kill, degrade and remove biofilms with remarkable efficiency. CARs exploit iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with dual catalytic-magnetic functionality that (i) generate bactericidal free radicals, (ii) breakdown the biofilm exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix, and (iii) remove the fragmented biofilm debris via magnetic field driven robotic assemblies. We develop two distinct CAR platforms. The first platform, the biohybrid CAR, is formed from NPs and biofilm degradation products. After catalytic bacterial killing and EPS disruption, magnetic field gradients assemble NPs and the biodegraded products into a plow-like superstructure. When driven with an external magnetic field, the biohybrid CAR completely removes biomass in a controlled manner, preventing biofilm regrowth. Biohybrid CARs can be swept over broad swathes of surface or can be moved over well-defined paths for localized removal with microscale precision. The second platform, the 3D molded CAR, is a polymeric soft robot with embedded catalytic-magnetic NPs, formed in a customized 3D printed mold to perform specific tasks in enclosed domains. Vane-shaped CARs remove biofilms from curved walls of cylindrical tubes, and helicoid-shaped CARs drill through biofilm clogs, while simultaneously killing bacteria. In addition, we demonstrate applications of CARs to target highly confined anatomical surfaces in the interior of human teeth. These 'kill-degrade-and-remove' CARs systems could have significant impact in fighting persistent biofilm-infections and in mitigating biofouling of medical devices and diverse surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Geelsu Hwang"},{"name":"Amauri J Paula"},{"name":"Elizabeth E Hunter"},{"name":"Yuan Liu"},{"name":"Alaa Babeer"},{"name":"Bekir Karabucak"},{"name":"Kathleen Stebe"},{"name":"Vijay Kumar"},{"name":"Edward Steager"},{"name":"Hyun Koo"}],"keywords":[]},"article104":{"pmid":"31531109","title":"Evaluation of Alternative Methods to Assess the Biological Properties of Propolis on Metabolic Activity and Biofilm Formation in Streptococcus mutans.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Several biological activities have been reported for the Chilean propolis, among their antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties, due to its high polyphenol content.

Whole genome sequence analysis revealed a complete replacement of the initial predominant variant by another isogenic variant.

Previously, we observed production of S. aureus thermonuclease during the early stages of biofilm formation in a mammalian cell culture medium. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay, we detected thermonuclease activity of S. aureus biofilms grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) earlier than that of widely studied biofilms grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB). The thermonuclease found was Nuc1, confirmed by mass spectrometry and competitive Luminex assay. These results indicate that biofilm development in IMDM may not rely on eDNA for structural stability. A bacterial viability assay in combination with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining confirmed the accumulation of dead cells and eDNA in biofilms grown in TSB. However, in biofilms grown in IMDM, minimal amounts of eDNA were found; instead, polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) was detected. To investigate if this early production of thermonuclease plays a role in immune modulation by biofilm, we studied the effect of thermonuclease on human neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation using a nuc knockout and complemented strain. We confirmed that thermonuclease produced by early-stage biofilms grown in IMDM degraded biofilm-induced NETs. Additionally, neither the presence of biofilms nor thermonuclease stimulated an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by neutrophils. Our findings indicated that S. aureus, during the early stages of biofilm formation, actively evades the host immune responses by producing thermonuclease.","authors":[{"name":"Andi R Sultan"},{"name":"Tamara Hoppenbrouwers"},{"name":"Nicole A Lemmens-den Toom"},{"name":"Susan V Snijders"},{"name":"Johan W van Neck"},{"name":"Annelies Verbon"},{"name":"Moniek P M de Maat"},{"name":"Willem J B van Wamel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"NETosis"},{"word":"NETs"},{"word":"ROS"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"early biofilm"},{"word":"thermonuclease"}]},"article120":{"pmid":"31527029","title":"Bacteriophages as Adjuvant to Antibiotics for the Treatment of Periprosthetic Joint Infection Caused by Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-02-24","abs":"We documented the adjunctive bacteriophage therapy to treat a chronic relapsing periprosthetic joint infection of the knee and chronic osteomyelitis of the femur caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa The combined antibiotic-phage treatment eradicated the infection, and no side effects to phages were observed.","authors":[{"name":"Tamta Tkhilaishvili"},{"name":"Tobias Winkler"},{"name":"Michael Müller"},{"name":"Carsten Perka"},{"name":"Andrej Trampuz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacteriophage therapy"},{"word":"biofilm infections"},{"word":"periprosthetic joint infection"}]},"article121":{"pmid":"31526987","title":"Mutual effect between electrochemically active bacteria (EAB) and azo dye in bio-electrochemical system (BES).","date":"2020-01-28","abs":"Herein, the mutual effect between azo dye and the performance of electrochemically active bacteria (EAB) is investigated in detail, which is crucial to understand and control the bio-electrochemical systems (BESs) operation for azo dye containing wastewater treatment.

The objective of the present study was to test the ability of spore-forming strains isolated from dairy environments for their spoilage-causing activities at typical sour cream (24°C) and yogurt (42°C) fermentation temperatures. A total of 25 spore-forming strains were isolated from different sources, including raw milk, pasteurizer balance tank, biofilms formed on heat exchangers, and milk powder. These strains were tested for proteolytic and lipolytic activities and for their ability to degrade phospholipids, common stabilizers (starch, gelatin, xanthan gum, pectin), and exopolysaccharides (EPS) at sour cream and yogurt fermentation temperatures. A higher percentage of positive strains was observed for selected activities at yogurt fermentation temperature compared with sour cream fermentation temperature. Identified proteolytic spore-forming strains, based on a skim milk agar method, were subsequently quantified for their level of proteolysis using non-casein nitrogen (NCN) content and sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE (SDS-PAGE). The proteolytic strains that showed the highest levels of proteolysis (highest percentages of NCN content) at 24°C were Bacillus mojavensis BC, Bacillus cereus DBC, Bacillus subtilis DBC, B. mojavensis DBC1, and Paenibacillus polymyxa DBC1. At 42°C the strains with the highest levels of proteolysis (highest percentages of NCN content) were B. subtilis DBC, B. mojavensis BC, B. mojavensis DBC1, B. cereus DBC, and Bacillus licheniformis DBC6.

Instead, core microbial genera which occurred in ≥90% of sludge (20 genera) and biofilm (12 genera) samples could potentially account for the AnMBR performance. A further calculation on net growth rate (NGR) of core genera in sludge suggested distribution into two main groups (i.e., I: low relative abundance and NGR, II: high relative abundance or high NGR). Consistent positive correlations between bacterial genera were observed among those that exhibited either high relative abundance or high NGR. The anaerobic microbial consortium in both sludge and biofilm were largely affected by stochastic dispersal and migration processes (i.e., neutral assembly). However, Acinetobacter spp. and Methanobacterium spp. occurred consistently in higher frequency in the biofilm but in lower occurrence frequency in the AnMBR permeate.

The pre-incubation of WGA and BJcuL with their preferential sugars inhibited the biological activity of WGA, but not that of BJcuL, suggesting that biofilm disruption does not involve carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). Quantitative real-time PCR showed that BJcuL promotes modulation of expression of S. aureus genes involved in biofilm formation. Light microscopy revealed cocci and small cell clusters after biofilm formation in the presence of BJcuL, showing that the lectin treatment was unable to completely disrupt biofilm structure. Exposing the free cells to 50 times the minimum inhibitory concentration of gentamicin or ciprofloxacin did not prevent biofilm reestablishment, although inhibition was stronger than in the control (no lectin).

The incidence of C glabrata infection has increased significantly in the last two decades, mainly due to this species' abilities to resist various antifungal drugs and to form biofilms. We focused on the relationship between biofilm formation and the product of QDR2, a C glabrata member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) gene family, given that fungal biofilm formation limits drug penetration and is associated with persistent infection. The fungal cells in biofilms were compared between a C glabrata ∆qdr2 mutant and its wild-type strain. Cells were analysed for metabolism activity and drug susceptibility (using tetrazolium assay), adhesion activity, growth assay and intracellular pH (using flow cytometry). Compared to the wild type, the C glabrata ∆qdr2 showed lower adhesion activity and higher fluconazole susceptibility when assessed as a biofilm. The mutant also showed decreased metabolic activity during biofilm formation. Furthermore, the mutant grew more slowly under neutral-basic pH conditions. The qdr2 deletion in C glabrata resulted in an impaired ability to maintain pH homeostasis, which led in turn to a reduction of cell growth and of adherence to an artificial matrix. These results suggested that the Qdr2p function is needed for proper biofilm formation and biofilm maintenance in C glabrata as well as biofilm drug resistance towards fluconazole.

The organisms most associated with severe periodontitis are the periodontal pathogens of the red complex: Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola and Porphyromonas gingivalis. These organisms express sialidases, which cleave sialic acid from host glycoproteins, and contribute to disease through various mechanisms. Here, we expressed and purified recombinant P. gingivalis sialidase SiaPG (PG_0352) and characterized its activity on a number of substrates, including host sialoglycoproteins and highlighting the inability to cleave diacetylated sialic acids - a phenomenon overcome by the NanS sialate-esterase from T. forsythia. Indeed SiaPG required NanS to maximize sialic acid harvesting from heavily O-acetylated substrates such as bovine salivary mucin, hinting at the possibility of interspecies cooperation in sialic acid release from host sources by these members of the oral microbiota. Activity of SiaPG and P. gingivalis was inhibited using the commercially available chemotherapeutic zanamivir, indicating its potential as a virulence inhibitor, which also inhibited sialic acid release from mucin, and was capable of inhibiting biofilm formation of P. gingivalis on oral glycoprotein sources. Zanamivir also inhibited attachment and invasion of oral epithelial cells by P. gingivalis and other periodontal pathogens, both in monospecies but also in multispecies infection experiments, indicating potential to suppress host-pathogen interactions of a mixed microbial community.

It was found that interspecies interactions led to varying levels of selection for a new colony phenotype of X. retroflexus, depending on the presence/absence of other species. When M. oxydans was absent, X. retroflexus was not able to establish in the top layers of the biofilm, which led to selection for a hyper-matrix forming phenotype of X. retroflexus that successfully established in the biofilm top layers. No such phenotypic X. retroflexus variants were identified in the presence of M. oxydans.

Recently, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was successfully accomplished in the presence of Eucalyptus citriodora leaf extract as a reducing agent. In this study, the antimicrobial mechanisms of AgNPs against important hospital-acquired pathogens, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi were further assessed. The results indicated that AgNPs could enhance a broad antimicrobial spectrum against drug-resistant organisms, with a range of minimum inhibitory concentration from 0.02 to 0.36 μg/mL. Time-kill assay showed that AgNPs produced bactericidal effects on the microorganisms. AgNPs could significantly reduce biofilm production in pathogens without affecting growth of the pathogens (p < 0.05). AgNPs inhibited cell viability and biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Cell membrane damage in microorganisms resulting from effects of AgNPs was observed. A significant increase in per cent uptake of crystal violet was observed in all isolates treated with AgNPs when compared with the control (p < 0.05). Upon treatment with AgNPs, the surface charge of the reference strains and clinical isolates of pathogens moved towards neutral. The alteration of surface potential after exposure to AgNPs could contribute to membrane disruption and cell viability.

However, the definitive molecular role of nirS in ascribing the resistance remained elusive. In the present study, the nirS gene was deleted from the chromosome of P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and the resulting phenotypic changes of ΔnirS were studied alongside the wild-type (WT) strain under aerobic conditions. The results demonstrated a decline in the formations of biofilms but not planktonic growth by ΔnirS as compared to WT, especially in the presence of benzisothiazolinone (BIT). Meanwhile, the deletion of nirS impaired swimming motility of P. aeruginosa under the stress of BIT. To assess the influence of nirS on the transcriptome of P. aeruginosa, RNA-seq experiments comparing the ΔnirS with WT were also performed. A total of 694 genes were found to be differentially expressed in ΔnirS, of which 192 were up-regulated, while 502 were down-regulated. In addition, these differently expressed genes were noted to significantly enrich the carbon metabolism along with glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolisms. Meanwhile, results from RT-PCR suggested the contribution of mexEF-oprN to the development of BIT resistance by ΔnirS. Further, c-di-GMP was less in ΔnirS than in WT, as revealed by HPLC. Taken together, our results confirm that nirS of P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 plays a role in BIT resistance along with biofilm formation and further affects several metabolic patterns under aerobic conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Gang Zhou"},{"name":"Hong Peng"},{"name":"Ying-Si Wang"},{"name":"Cai-Ling Li"},{"name":"Peng-Fei Shen"},{"name":"Xiao-Mo Huang"},{"name":"Xiao-Bao Xie"},{"name":"Qing-Shan Shi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm formation and dispersal"},{"word":"Isothiazolones"},{"word":"Nitrite reductase"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"RNA-seq technology"}]},"article182":{"pmid":"31511592","title":"Metabolomics Deciphered Metabolic Reprogramming Required for Biofilm Formation.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Biofilm formation plays a key role in many bacteria causing infections, which mostly accounts for high-frequency infectious recurrence and antibiotics resistance.

Solid boundaries can strongly influence a cell's propulsion mechanism, thus leading many flagellated bacteria to describe long circular trajectories stably entrapped by the surface. Experimental studies on near-surface bacterial motility have, however, neglected the fact that real environments have typical microstructures varying on the scale of the cells' motion. Here, we show that micro-obstacles influence the propagation of peritrichously flagellated bacteria on a flat surface in a non-monotonic way. Instead of hindering it, an optimal, relatively low obstacle density can significantly enhance cells' propagation on surfaces due to individual forward-scattering events. This finding provides insight on the emerging dynamics of chiral active matter in complex environments and inspires possible routes to control microbial ecology in natural habitats.","authors":[{"name":"Stanislaw Makarchuk"},{"name":"Vasco C Braz"},{"name":"Nuno A M Araújo"},{"name":"Lena Ciric"},{"name":"Giorgio Volpe"}],"keywords":[]},"article184":{"pmid":"31511371","title":"Global Transcriptomic Analysis of the Candida albicans Response to Treatment with a Novel Inhibitor of Filamentation.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"The opportunistic pathogenic fungus Candida albicans can cause devastating infections in immunocompromised patients. Its ability to undergo a morphogenetic transition from yeast to filamentous forms allows it to penetrate tissues and damage tissues, and the expression of genes associated with a number of pathogenetic mechanisms is also coordinately regulated with the yeast-to-hypha conversion. Therefore, it is widely considered that filamentation represents one of the main virulence factors of C. albicans We have previously identified N-[3-(allyloxy)-phenyl]-4-methoxybenzamide (compound 9029936) as the lead compound in a series of small-molecule inhibitors of C. albicans filamentation and characterized its activity both in vitro and in vivo This compound appears to be a promising candidate for the development of alternative antivirulence strategies for the treatment of C. albicans infections. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of samples obtained from C. albicans cells grown under filament-inducing conditions in the presence or absence of this compound. Overall, treatment with compound 9029936 resulted in 618 upregulated and 702 downregulated genes. Not surprisingly, some of the most downregulated genes included well-characterized genes associated with filamentation and virulence such as SAP5, ECE1 (candidalysin), and ALS3, as well as genes that impact metal chelation and utilization. Gene ontology analysis revealed an overrepresentation of cell adhesion, iron transport, filamentation, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis processes among the genes downregulated during treatment with this leading compound.

For a reliable risk assessment, knowledge about the microbial community composition of biofilms in the milking systems of dairy farms must be improved. In this work, swab samples of milking machine biofilms of two dairy farms were investigated by a combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods. Spots in the milking system with enhanced microbial colonization were identified by quantification on selective and non-selective media. In addition, stainless steel coupons were placed into the piping system of a milking machine, removed after several milking intervals, and investigated for colonization by cultivation and culture-independently. Isolates were differentiated and identified by a combination of chemotaxonomical methods and 16S rRNA sequencing. The culture-independent approach involved treatment of the samples with the viability dye propidium monoazide prior to direct DNA-extraction by enzymatic cell lysis and cloning to exclude bias from dead biomass. The milking equipment retainers and the outlet of the milk bulk tank were identified as highly colonized spots on both farms. A high bacterial diversity was detected covering the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Presence of biofilms was demonstrated on several materials including stainless steel and plastic, which are frequently used in milking machines, but also in dairy processing plants. Growth of mainly Gram-positive bacteria with high percentages of the phylum Actinobacteria was detected on the stainless steel coupons after exposition in the milking system for two to three days. Knowledge about the heterogenic microbial load on different parts of the milking machines and the stainless steel coupons will help to identify primary colonizers of the milking system, to assess the risk potential of biofilms for raw milk, to improve sanitation processes and to identify parts of the milking machine, which should be improved by hygienic design.","authors":[{"name":"Mareike Weber"},{"name":"Janine Liedtke"},{"name":"Susanne Plattes"},{"name":"André Lipski"}],"keywords":[]},"article189":{"pmid":"31509195","title":"Study of the activity of Punica granatum-mediated silver nanoparticles against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, alone or in combination with azoles or polyenes.","date":"2019-09-11","abs":"The continuous emergence of Candida strains resistant to currently used antifungals demands the development of new alternatives that could reduce the burden of candidiasis.

Antibacterial Activity: Three specimens of each material were prepared and placed on bacterial suspensions of Streptococcus mutans for 1, 5 and 10 days. After these periods the counting of the colonies (log10) was performed. Assays was performed in triplicate. Physical Properties: Three-body Abrasion (TBA): Ten specimens of each material were prepared and stored at 37°C/24 h. The surface roughness (Ra) and hardness (KHN) were analyzed. Next, the specimens were submitted to abrasive wear (30,000 cycles) and re-evaluated for Ra and KHN; Sorption/solubility (SS): cylindrical specimens (n=10) were prepared and weighted. The specimens were immersed in deionized water for 7 days at 37°C and then their weight was verified again.

Cathelicidins are AMPs that preferentially kill Gram-negative bacteria in vitro, purportedly by assembling into higher-order structures that perforate the membrane. We utilized high-resolution, single-cell fluorescence microscopy to examine their mechanism of action in real time. Engineered cathelicidins rapidly bound to Gram-negative and Gram-positive cells and penetrated the cytoplasmic membrane. Rapid failure of the peptidoglycan superstructure in regions of active turnover caused leakage of cytoplasmic contents and the formation of membrane-bound blebs. A mutation anticipated to destabilize interactions between cathelicidin subunits had no effect on bactericidal activity, suggesting that cathelicidins have activities beyond perforating the membrane. Nanomolar concentrations of cathelicidins, although not bactericidal, reduced the growth rate of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The cells exhibited expression changes in multiple essential processes, including protein synthesis, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, respiration, and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Time-lapse imaging revealed that ROS accumulation preceded bleb formation, and treatments that reduced cellular ROS levels overcame these bactericidal effects. We propose that that the primary effect of cathelicidins is to induce the production of ROS that damage bacterial molecules, leading to slowed growth or cell death. Given their low circulating levels in vivo, AMPs may serve to slow bacterial population expansion so that cellular immunity systems can respond to and battle the infection.","authors":[{"name":"Dean A Rowe-Magnus"},{"name":"Adenine Y Kao"},{"name":"Antonio Cembellin Prieto"},{"name":"Meng Pu"},{"name":"Cheng Kao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Gram-negative bacteria"},{"word":"ROS"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cathelicidins"},{"word":"single-cell"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"31506311","title":"Emergent Properties in Streptococcus mutans Biofilms Are Controlled through Adhesion Force Sensing by Initial Colonizers.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Bacterial adhesion is accompanied by altered gene expression, leading to emergent properties of biofilm bacteria that are alien to planktonic ones. With the aim of revealing the role of environmental adhesion forces in emergent biofilm properties, genes in Streptococcus mutans UA159 and a quorum-sensing-deficient mutant were identified that become expressed after adhesion to substratum surfaces. Using atomic force microscopy, adhesion forces of initial S. mutans colonizers on four different substrata were determined and related to gene expression. Adhesion forces upon initial contact were similarly low across different substrata, ranging between 0.2 and 1.2 nN regardless of the strain considered. Bond maturation required up to 21 s, depending on the strain and substratum surface involved, but stationary adhesion forces also were similar in the parent and in the mutant strain. However, stationary adhesion forces were largest on hydrophobic silicone rubber (19 to 20 nN), while being smallest on hydrophilic glass (3 to 4 nN). brpA gene expression in thin (34 to 48 μm) 5-h S. mutans UA159 biofilms was most sensitive to adhesion forces, while expression of gbpB and comDE expressions was weakly sensitive. ftf, gtfB, vicR, and relA expression was insensitive to adhesion forces. In thicker (98 to 151 μm) 24-h biofilms, adhesion-force-induced gene expression and emergent extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production were limited to the first 20 to 30 μm above a substratum surface.

Thus, our goal was to bioengineered spider silk proteins with AMP (6mer-HNP1) as an antibacterial drug-free coating for commercial silk sutures (Perma-Hand®) for decreasing bacterial infections.

In vitro tests, using human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC5), showed that coated sutures sustained cell viability, and also, the contact with red blood cells (RBCs) demonstrate blood compatibility. Also, the coatings inhibited significantly the adherence and formation of biofilm, where sutures coated with 6mer-HNP1 produced a 1.5 log reduction of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a 2 log reduction of Escherichia coli (E. coli) compared to the uncoated Perma-Hand® suture. The mechanical properties of Perma-Hand® sutures were not affected by the presence of bioengineered spider silk proteins.

The anti-biofilm growth (Bgrowth) and anti-preformed biofilm (Bpreformed) activities of micafungin (0 to 3.94 μM) and EB487 (0 to 20.32 mM) were comparatively studied separately and combined, using XTT, flow cytometry and cell counts approaches. Concentrations causing 50% inhibition of the studied steps (IC50) were evaluated. When tested separately, IC50 Bgrowth was obtained for 4.8 mM and 0.13 μM of EB487 and micafungin respectively, and IC50 Bpreformed for 3.6 mM and 0.06 μM of EB487 and micafungin respectively. Micafungin used alone was not able to totally eradicate fungi. Micafungin combined with EB487 displayed synergistic activity (both anti-growth- and anti-preformed biofilm-activities). Optimal combination concentrations were EB487 (≤9.12 mM -strain ATCC 28367™ or ≤8.12 mM -strain CAI4-p), micafungin (≤0.05 μM for both) and caused a total eradication of fungi. Dose reduction indexes obtained using these concentrations were at least 9 (micafungin) and 3.2 (EB487) for both anti-biofilm growth- and anti-preformed biofilm-activities. Combinations indexes were consistently below one, demonstrating a synergistic relationship between micafungin and EB487 in these conditions.

Thus, development of M. tuberculosis biofilms appears to be associated with an enrichment of population, in which challenging growth conditions within biofilm architecture select for cells that maintain intrinsic tolerance to exogenous stresses, including antibiotic exposure. We further observed that the intrinsic drug tolerance of constituent cells of a biofilm determines the frequency of persisters. These findings together allow us to propose that the selection of elite cells during biofilm development promotes the frequency of persisters. Furthermore, probing the possibility that the population enrichment is an outcome of unique environment within biofilms, we demonstrate biofilm-specific induction in the synthesis of isonitrile lipopeptide (INLP).

Although innate immunity and adaptive immunity play crucial roles in preventing mycoplasma infection, immune response that develops after infection fails to completely eliminate this bacterium under certain circumstances. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that mycoplasmas employ some mechanisms to deal with coercion of host defense system. In this review, we will highlight and provide a comprehensive overview of immune evasion strategies that have emerged in mycoplasma infection, which can be divided into four aspects: (i) Molecular mimicry and antigenic variation on the surface of the bacteria to evade the immune surveillance; (ii) Overcoming the immune effector molecules assaults: Induction of detoxified enzymes to degradation of reactive oxygen species; Expression of nucleases to degrade the neutrophil extracellular traps to avoid killing by Neutrophil; Capture and cleavage of immunoglobulins to evade humoral immune response; (iii) Persistent survival: Invading into the host cell to escape the immune damage; Formation of a biofilm to establish a persistent infection; (iv) Modulation of the immune system to down-regulate the intensity of immune response. All of these features increase the probability of mycoplasma survival in the host and lead to a persistent, chronic infections. A profound understanding on the mycoplasma to subvert the immune system will help us to better understand why mycoplasma is so difficult to eradicate and ultimately provide new insights on the development of therapeutic regimens against this bacterium in future.","authors":[{"name":"Lianmei Qin"},{"name":"Yiwen Chen"},{"name":"Xiaoxing You"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antigenic variation"},{"word":"immune evasion"},{"word":"mycoplasma"},{"word":"neutrophil extracellular traps"},{"word":"oxidative stress"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"31496754","title":"Antibacterial mechanism of peptide Cec4 against Acinetobacter baumannii.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"A case of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), known as gram-negative bacteria, causes a range of nosocomial infections.

The bioelectrochemical system (BES), an integrated microbial-electrochemical energy conversion process, is projected to be a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy technology. However, low power density is still one of the main limiting factors restricting the practical application of BESs. To enhance power output, functional group modification on anode surfaces has been primarily developed to improve the bioelectrochemical performances of BESs in terms of startup, power density, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and coulombic efficiency (CE). This modification could change the anode surface characteristics: roughness, hydrophobicity, biocompatibility, chemical bonding and electrochemically active surface area. This will facilitate bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation and extracellular electron transfer (EET). Additionally, some antibacterial functional groups are applied on air cathodes in order to suppress aerobic biofilms and enhance cathodic oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). Various modification strategies such as: soaking, heat treatment and plasma modification have been reported to introduce functional groups typically as O-, N- and S-containing groups. In this review, the effects of anode functional groups on electroactive bacteria through the whole biofilm formation process are summarized. In addition, the application of those modification technologies to improve bioelectricity generation, resource recovery, bioelectrochemical analysis and the production of value-added chemicals and biofuels is also discussed.

Secretory nucleases also provide means of survival to other bacteria like iron-reducing Shewanella and such functions help them adapt and survive proficiently. Other than their pro-pathogen roles in survival, nucleases can be used directly as therapeutics. One of the powerful armours of pathogens is the formation of biofilms, thus helping them resist and persist in the harshest of environments. As eDNA forms the structural and binding component of biofilm, nucleases can be used against the adhering component, thus increasing the permeability of antimicrobial agents.

Liposomal encapsulation could help overcome these limitations and would make hypericin available for daily clinical practice. The use of liposomes as carriers for hypericin in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is quite new. The aim of this work was to improve the photodynamic efficiency of the previously mentioned carriers by entrapping hypericin in the aqueous compartment of the liposomes. Therefore, a water-soluble inclusion complex of hypericin and (2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (Hyp-HPβCD) was prepared.

The photodynamic efficiency towards the gram-positive model strain Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. bovis. was tested on planktonic cells as well as on biofilms. DSPC liposomes achieved a 4.1log reduction and the DSPC/DPPC/DSPE-PEG liposomes a 2.6log reduction in growth of planktonic bacteria, while Hyp-HPβCD showed total eradication.

The phenotypic transition from a planktonic to biofilm state is regulated by the activity of the transcriptional repressor, SinR, and its inactivation by its primary antagonist, SinI.

We also present the solution NMR structure of the antagonist SinI dimer and probe the mechanism behind the SinR-SinI interaction using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques.

Microbial communication signals are involved both in interactions among microbial cells within microbial social systems, including the human body-inhabiting microconsortium, and the dialog between the microbiota and the host organism. The microbiota inhabits various niches of the host organism, especially the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Microorganisms release diverse signal molecules and, in addition, specifically respond to host signals. This enables them to constantly interact with the nervous system including the brain and the immune system of the host organism. Evolutionarily conserved signals that are involved in the communication between microbiota and the host include neuroactive substances (neurochemicals) such as peptides, amino acids, biogenic amines, short-chain fatty acids, and gaseous substances. This ongoing dialog may either stabilize the host's physical and mental health state or, alternatively, cause serious health problems. Attempts are made to correct imbalances in the brain-gut-microbiota axis with probiotics including their subgroup called psychobiotics that release neuroactive substances directly influencing the human brain, psyche, and behavior. A number of recent review works address the microbiota-host system and its communication signals. Some of the publications focus on the involvement of neurochemicals in the bidirectional communication within the host-microbiota system. However, this work concentrates on the impact of bacterial cell components, metabolites, and signal molecules as promising alternatives to the currently widespread probiotics that have both advantages and disadvantages.

Here, we report that carbon starvation stress (CSS) can induce the expression of pprB and genes in the PprB regulon. CSS-induced pprB transcription is mediated by the stress response sigma factor RpoS rather than the two-component sensor PprA. We also observed a strong negative regulation of PprB on the transcription of itself. Further experiments showed that PprB overexpression greatly enhanced cell-cell adhesion (CCA) and cell-surface adhesion (CSA) in P. aeruginosa Specifically, under the background of PprB overexpression, both the BapA adhesin and CupE fimbriae displayed positive effects on CCA and CSA, while the type IVb pili showed an unexpected negative effect on CCA and no effect on CSA. In addition, expression of the PprB regulon genes were significantly increased in 3-day colony biofilms, indicating a possible carbon limitation state.

The Single Tube Method (ASTM E2871) is a standard method that measures the efficacy of antimicrobials against biofilm bacteria that has been shown to be reproducible, responsive and rugged.

The antimicrobial activity of hydrogel is derived from its acidic pH-dependent nanofiber network destabilization and activated release of IKFQFHFD, which is antimicrobial only at acidic pH due to the antimicrobial peptide-like molecular structure. In addition, supramolecular nanofiber networks loaded with drugs of cypate (photothermal agent) and proline (procollagen component) are further developed. In vitro experiments show that loaded drugs exhibit acidic pH (pH ∼ 5.5)-responsive release profiles, and synergistic biofilm eradication and subsequent healing cascade activation of cells proliferation are achieved on the basis of the supramolecular nanofiber networks. Remarkably, the nanofiber networks of hydrogel enable in vivo complete healing of MRSA biofilm infected wound in diabetic mice within 20 days, showing great potential as promising chronic wound dressings. The proposed synergistic strategy for eradicating biofilm and activating subsequent healing cascades may offer a powerful modality for the management of clinical chronic wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Jianhao Wang"},{"name":"Xiao-Yi Chen"},{"name":"Yuan Zhao"},{"name":"Yanmei Yang"},{"name":"Weijie Wang"},{"name":"Chun Wu"},{"name":"Baozhu Yang"},{"name":"Zhaotian Zhang"},{"name":"Leshuai Zhang"},{"name":"Yun Liu"},{"name":"Xuancheng Du"},{"name":"Weifeng Li"},{"name":"Lin Qiu"},{"name":"Pengju Jiang"},{"name":"Xiao-Zhou Mou"},{"name":"Yong-Qiang Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial hydrogel"},{"word":"biofilm eradication"},{"word":"chronic wound healing"},{"word":"nanofiber network"},{"word":"pH-switchable drug release"}]},"article270":{"pmid":"31490060","title":"Controlling Heterogeneity and Increasing Titer from Riboswitch-Regulated Bacillus subtilis Spores for Time-Delayed Protein Expression Applications.","date":"2020-02-21","abs":"Sporulated cells have potential as time-delayed expression chassis of proteins for applications such as on-demand biologics production, whole cell biosensors, or oral vaccines.

Such modifications can result in enhanced pathogenicity due to toxin production, increased toxin release, altered antigenicity, and resistance to antibiotics. In the case of bacteriophages, the phage genome can stably integrate into the bacterial chromosome as a prophage, to produce a lysogenic cell. Oral enterococcal strains have been isolated from subgingival plaque and the root canals of endodontically-treated teeth that have failed to heal. Previously, we isolated a bacteriophage, phage ɸEf11, induced from a lysogenic Enterococcus faecalis strain recovered from the root canal of a failed endodontic case. PCR analysis using phage ɸEf11-specific oligonucleotide primers, disclosed that lysogens containing ɸEf11 prophages were commonly found among oral E. faecalis strains, being detected in 19 of 61 (31%) strains examined. Furthermore, in comparison to an isogenic cured strain, cultures of a lysogen harboring an ɸEf11 prophage exhibited altered phenotypic characteristics, such as increased persistence at high density, enhanced biofilm formation, and resistance to a bacteriophage lytic enzyme.

We develop a Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg method-based model to explore the collective evolution of biofilm morphology arising from cell-cell and cell-fluid interactions.

Many aquifers contain naturally high levels of iron and some are shallow with surface water intrusion in the wet season. Therefore, environmental bacteria such as iron-cycling bacteria promoting biofilm formation in pipes or opportunistic pathogens can occur in these waters. An opportunistic pathogen endemic to northern Australia and Southeast Asia and emerging worldwide is Burkholderia pseudomallei. It causes the frequently fatal disease melioidosis in humans and animals. As we know very little about the microbial composition of drinking water in remote communities, this study aimed to provide a first snapshot of the microbiota and occurrence of opportunistic pathogens in bulk water and biofilms from the source and through the distribution system of three remote water supplies with varying iron levels. Using 16s-rRNA gene sequencing, we found that the geochemistry of the groundwater had a substantial impact on the untreated microbiota. Different iron-cycling bacteria reflected differences in redox status and nutrients. We cultured and sequenced B. pseudomallei from bores with elevated iron and from a multi-species biofilm which also contained iron-oxidizing Gallionella, nitrifying Nitrospira and amoebae. Gallionella are increasingly used in iron-removal filters in water supplies and more research is needed to examine these interactions. Similar to other opportunistic pathogens, B. pseudomallei occurred in water with low organic carbon levels and with low heterotrophic microbial growth. No B. pseudomallei were detected in treated water; however, abundant DNA of another opportunistic pathogen group, non-tuberculous mycobacteria was recovered from treated parts of one supply. Results from this study will inform future studies to ultimately improve management guidelines for water supplies in the wet-dry tropics.","authors":[{"name":"Mirjam Kaestli"},{"name":"Michelle O'Donnell"},{"name":"Alea Rose"},{"name":"Jessica R Webb"},{"name":"Mark Mayo"},{"name":"Bart J Currie"},{"name":"Karen Gibb"}],"keywords":[]},"article285":{"pmid":"31487117","title":"Effect on total microbial load and community composition with two vs six-week topical Cadexomer Iodine for treating chronic biofilm infections in diabetic foot ulcers.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"This study compares two vs six weeks of topical antimicrobial therapy with Cadexomer Iodine in patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) complicated by chronic biofilm infections.

The pathogenesis of both bacteria starts by adhering to the intestinal epithelium by means of fimbriae, called colonization factors in human ETEC isolates and aggregative adherence fimbriae in EAEC isolates. Once ETEC adheres to the enterocyte, it produces one or both of its toxins and induces the secretion of chloride and sodium ions and water into the intestinal lumen, producing its characteristic watery diarrhea. EAEC binds to the intestinal epithelium forming a biofilm, induces the production of mucus, releases its toxins and promotes inflammation.

Under neutral physiological conditions, the bactericidal activity of rAgNAs is self-quenched because the toxic silver ions' release is largely inhibited; however, upon entry into the acidic biofilm microenvironment, the rAgNAs not only exhibit charge reversal to facilitate local accumulation and retention but also disassemble into small silver nanoclusters, thus enabling deep penetration and accelerated silver ions release for dramatically amplified bactericidal activity.

This study combined biofilm assays and molecular techniques to demonstrate that N. europaea makes very little biofilm on its own, and relies on the activity of associated heterotrophic bacteria to establish a biofilm. However, N. europaea has a vital role in the proliferation of mixed-species communities under carbon-limited conditions, such as in drinking water distribution systems, through the provision of organic carbon via ammonia oxidation. Results show that the addition of nitrification inhibitors to mixed-species nitrifying cultures under carbon-limited conditions disrupted biofilm formation and caused the dispersal of pre-formed biofilms. This dispersal effect was not observed when an organic carbon source, glucose, was included in the medium. Interestingly, inhibition of nitrification activity of these mixed-species biofilms in the presence of added glucose resulted in increased total biofilm formation compared to controls without the addition of nitrification inhibitors, or with only glucose added. This suggests that active AOB partially suppress or limit the overall growth of the heterotrophic bacteria. The experimental model developed here provides evidence that ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) are involved in both the formation and maintenance of multi-species biofilm communities. The results demonstrate that the activity of the AOB not only support the growth and biofilm formation of heterotrophic bacteria by providing organic carbon, but also restrict and limit total biomass in mixed community systems.","authors":[{"name":"Pejhman Keshvardoust"},{"name":"Vanessa A A Huron"},{"name":"Matthew Clemson"},{"name":"Florentin Constancias"},{"name":"Nicolas Barraud"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Microbial ecology"}]},"article303":{"pmid":"31481944","title":"Turning a Collagenesis-Inducing Peptide Into a Potent Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agent Against Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Antimicrobial resistance is becoming one the most serious health threats worldwide, as it not only hampers effective treatment of infectious diseases using current antibiotics, but also increases the risks of medical procedures like surgery, transplantation, bone and dental implantation, chemotherapy, or chronic wound management.

Dysbiosis of the oral biofilm and a dysfunctional immune response drive chronic inflammation, causing destruction of soft tissue and alveolar bone supporting the teeth. Treponema denticola, a spirochete abundant in the plaque biofilm of patients with severe periodontal disease, perturbs neutrophil function by modulating appropriate phosphoinositide (PIP) signaling. Through a series of immunoblotting and quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments, we show that Msp does not alter the gene transcription or protein content of key enzymes responsible for PIP3 signaling: 3' phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), or 5' Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP1). Instead, using immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we found that Msp activates PTEN through dephosphorylation specifically at the S380 site. Msp in intact organisms or outer membrane vesicles also restricts PIP signaling. SHIP1 phosphatase release was assessed using chemical inhibition and immunoprecipitation to show that Msp moderately decreases SHIP1 activity. Msp also prevents secondary activation of the PTEN/PI3K response. We speculate that this result is due to the redirection of the PIP3 substrate away from SHIP1 to PTEN. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a redistribution of PTEN from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane following exposure to Msp, which may contribute to PTEN activation. Mechanisms of how T. denticola modulates and evades the host immune response are still poorly described, and here we provide further mechanistic evidence of how spirochetes modify PIP signaling to dampen neutrophil function.

Thus, the surveillance on MDR microorganisms has recently been strengthened, taking into account the control of antibiotic abuse as well as the mechanisms underlying the transfer of antibiotic genes (ARGs) among microbiota naturally occurring in the environment. Indeed, ARGs are not only confined to pathogenic bacteria, whose diffusion in the clinical field has aroused serious concerns, but are widespread in saprophytic bacterial communities such as those dominating the food industry. In particular, fresh dairy products can be considered a reservoir of Pseudomonas spp. resistome, potentially transmittable to consumers. Milk and fresh dairy cheeses products represent one of a few hubs where commensal or opportunistic pseudomonads frequently cohabit together with food microbiota and hazard pathogens even across their manufacturing processes. Pseudomonas spp., widely studied for food spoilage effects, are instead underestimated for their possible impact on human health. Recent evidences have highlighted that non-pathogenic pseudomonads strains (P. fluorescens, P. putida) are associated with some human diseases, but are still poorly considered in comparison to the pathogen P. aeruginosa. In addition, the presence of ARGs, that can be acquired and transmitted by horizontal genetic transfer, further increases their risk and the need to be deeper investigated. Therefore, this review, starting from the general aspects related to the physiological traits of these spoilage microorganisms from fresh dairy products, aims to shed light on the resistome of cheese-related pseudomonads and their genomic background, current methods and advances in the prediction tools for MDR detection based on genomic sequences, possible implications for human health, and the affordable strategies to counteract MDR spread.","authors":[{"name":"Laura Quintieri"},{"name":"Francesca Fanelli"},{"name":"Leonardo Caputo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"control strategies"},{"word":"dairy products"},{"word":"genomics"},{"word":"pseudomonads"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"spoilage"}]},"article314":{"pmid":"31480443","title":"Suppressive Effects of Octyl Gallate on Streptococcus mutans Biofilm Formation, Acidogenicity, and Gene Expression.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The accumulation of biofilm by Streptococcus mutans bacteria on hard tooth tissues leads to dental caries, which remains one of the most prevalent oral diseases.

The Shannon diversity index of microbiota with algal symbiosis reached 5.34, which was higher than that of microbiota wherein algae were absent (4.80).

The taxa mostly associated with algae-symbiotic microbiota are the Actinobacteria phylum, and the Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria classes. The Cyanobacteria phylum was not associated with algae-symbiotic microbiota. As revealed by functional analysis, the bacteria mostly involved in the metabolism of sulfur were represented by brown and red algae in the biofilm symbiosis. Bacteria related to the metabolism of certain trace elements were observed only in specific groups. Moreover, phototrophy-related bacteria were less abundant in samples coexisting with algae.

These proteins are involved in bacterial adhesion due to their specific interaction with carbohydrates of the host epithelial cells. The tetrameric LecA lectin specifically binds galactose residues. A new therapeutic approach is based on the development of highly affine synthetic glycoclusters able to selectively link with LecA to interfere with the natural carbohydrate-LecA interaction. In this study, we combined atomic force microscopy imaging and molecular dynamics simulations to visualize and understand the arrangements formed by LecA and five different glycoclusters. Our glycoclusters are small scaffolds characterized by a core and four branches, which terminate in a galactose residue.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, swarming is dependent upon a functional flagella and aided by the production of biosurfactants. AmrZ, a conserved transcription factor across pseudomonads, has been shown to be a global regulator of multiple genes important for virulence and ecological fitness. In this study, we expand this concept of global control to swarming motility by showing that deletion of amrZ results in a severe defect in swarming, while multicopy expression of this gene stimulates swarming of P. aeruginosa. Mechanistic studies showed that the swarming defect of an amrZ mutant does not involve changes of biosurfactant production but is associated with flagellar malfunction. The ∆amrZ mutant exhibits increased levels of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) compared to the wild-type strain, under swarming conditions. We found that the diguanylate cyclase GcbA was the main contributor to the increased accumulation of c-di-GMP observed in the ∆amrZ mutant and was a strong inhibitor of flagellar-dependent motility. Our results revealed that the GcbA-dependent inhibition of motility required the presence of two c-di-GMP receptors containing a PilZ domain: FlgZ and PA14_56180. Furthermore, the ∆amrZ mutant exhibits enhanced production of Pel polysaccharide. Epistasis analysis revealed that GcbA and the Pel polysaccharide act independently to limit swarming in ΔamrZ. Our results support a role for AmrZ in controlling swarming motility, yet another social behavior besides biofilm formation that is crucial for the ability of P. aeruginosa to colonize a variety of surfaces.

At 50 °C, the half-life was 60 min and 260 min at pH 6.0. In general, addition of detergents and surfactants did not affect tannase activity significantly. Tannase has potential applications in various biotechnological processes such as the production of propyl gallate and in the treatment of tannin-rich effluents. The content of tannins and total phenolic compounds in effluents from leather treatment was reduced by 56-83% and 47-64%, respectively, after 2 h of enzyme treatment. The content of tannins and total phenolic compounds in the sorghum flour treated for 120 h with tannase were reduced by 61% and 17%, respectively.

In addition, cell envelope lipids are mycobacterial virulence factors. Cell envelope lipid biosynthesis is the target of a number of frontline tuberculosis treatments and has been the focus of much research. However, the transport mechanisms by which these lipids reach the mycomembrane remain poorly understood. Many envelope lipids are exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space via the mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) family of proteins. In other bacteria, lipoproteins can contribute to outer membrane biogenesis through direct binding of substrates and/or protein-protein associations with extracytoplasmic biosynthetic enzymes. In this report, we investigate whether the lipoprotein LpqN plays a similar role in mycobacteria. Using a genetic two-hybrid approach, we demonstrate that LpqN interacts with periplasmic loop domains of the MmpL3 and MmpL11 transporters that export mycolic acid-containing cell envelope lipids. We observe that LpqN also interacts with secreted cell envelope biosynthetic enzymes such as Ag85A via pulldown assays. The X-ray crystal structures of LpqN and LpqN bound to dodecyl-trehalose suggest that LpqN directly binds trehalose monomycolate, the MmpL3 and Ag85A substrate. Finally, we observe altered lipid profiles of the ΔlpqN mutant during biofilm maturation, pointing toward a possible physiological role for the protein. The results of this study suggest that LpqN may act as a membrane fusion protein, connecting MmpL transporters with periplasmic proteins, and provide general insight into the role of lipoproteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell envelope biogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Geoff C Melly"},{"name":"Haley Stokas"},{"name":"Jennifer L Dunaj"},{"name":"Fong Fu Hsu"},{"name":"Malligarjunan Rajavel"},{"name":"Chih-Chia Su"},{"name":"Edward W Yu"},{"name":"Georgiana E Purdy"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"word":"cell envelope"},{"word":"crystal structure"},{"word":"glycolipid"},{"word":"lipid transport"},{"word":"lipoprotein"},{"word":"membrane transport"},{"word":"periplasm"},{"word":"trehalose"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article347":{"pmid":"31471140","title":"Preparation, partial characterization and biological activity of exopolysaccharides produced from Lactobacillus fermentum S1.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"A high slime-producing Lactobacillus fermentum strain (named as L. fermentum S1) was isolated from traditional fermented Fuyuan pickle, which was made of white turnip and collected from Fuyuan county, Yunnan province, China.

Thus, inulin, biopolymers such as agar and sodium alginate, and glycerol were used to develop a single use edible material for food packaging. These biofilms were obtained and tested for three months. For inulin-based films, the results highlight improvements not only in physical properties (homogeneity, well-defined margins, light sweet taste, good optical properties, high solubility capacity or, as in the case of some samples, complete solubilization), but also superior mechanical properties (samples with high inulin content into composition had high tensile strength and extremely high elongation values). Even after three months of developing, the values of mechanical properties indicate a strong material. The optimization establishes the composition necessary to obtain a strong and completely water-soluble material.

The new peptides exhibited more efficient killing of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus compared with the parent peptide anoplin, and the dimer peptides were superior to the monomer peptides. It was important that the new peptides displayed low impact on bacterial resistance development. In addition, the antimicrobial activities were not significantly influenced by a physiological salt environment. They also presented high stability in the presence of protease or serum. Almost all of the new peptides had better selectivity towards anionic bacterial membranes over zwitterionic mammalian cell membranes. Moreover, the new peptides displayed synergistic or additive effects when used together with the antibiotics rifampicin and polymyxin B. These results showed that the new peptides could also prevent the formation of bacterial biofilms. Furthermore, outer/inner membrane permeabilization and cytoplasmic membrane depolarization experiments revealed that the new peptides had strong membrane permeabilization and depolarization. Confocal laser scanning microscopy, flow cytometry analysis and scanning electron microscopy further demonstrated that the new peptides could damage the integrity of the bacterial membrane.

We found that mice infected with the stationary phase and biofilm bacteria, which were enriched with persisters, produced more pronounced skin lesions that took longer to heal, and had more severe skin pathology and higher bacterial load than mice infected with log phase bacteria. Using our persistent infection mouse model, we showed that the clinically recommended treatment for recurrent S. aureus skin infection, doxycycline + rifampin, was not effective in eradicating the bacteria in mice. Analogous findings were observed in a Caenorhabditis elegans model, where stationary phase S. aureus caused greater virulence or mortality than log phase bacteria as early as two days post-infection. Our findings associate in vitro persisters and biofilm bacteria with more persistent and more severe infections and emphasize the importance of quality or metabolic status of the inoculum bacteria (persister bacteria versus growing bacteria) not just the number of bacteria in causing disease.

We engineered solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120 to yield streamlined chassis strains with higher growth rates and biomass yields, enhanced solvent tolerance, and improved process performance. In total, the genome was reduced by up to 10%. This was achieved by the elimination of genes that enable the cell to swim and form biofilms and by the deletion of the megaplasmid pSTY and large proviral segments. The resulting strain GRC1 had a 15% higher growth rate and biomass yield than the wildtype. However, this strain lacks the pSTY-encoded efflux pump TtgGHI, rendering it solvent-sensitive.

Given that common plastics are derived from fossil fuels, one would expect that Plastispheres should be enriched with obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (OHCB). So far, though, different polymer types do not seem to exert a strong effect on determining the composition of the Plastisphere, and putative biodegrading bacteria are only found as rare taxa within these biofilms. Here, we show through 16S rRNA gene sequencing that the enrichment of a prominent OHCB member on weathered and non-weathered polyethylene only occurred at early stages of colonization (i.e., after 2 days of incubation in coastal marine water; 5.8% and 3.7% of relative abundance, respectively, vs. 0.6% on glass controls). As biofilms matured, these bacteria decreased in relative abundance on all materials (< 0.3% after 9 days). Apart from OHCB, weathered polyethylene strongly enriched for other distinct organisms during early stages of colonization, such as a specific member of the Roseobacter group and a member of the genus Aestuariibacter (median 26.9% and 1.8% of the community, respectively), possibly as a consequence of the availability of short-oxidized chains generated from weathering. Our results demonstrate that Plastispheres can vary in accordance with the weathering state of the material and that very early colonizing communities are enriched with taxa that can potentially degrade hydrocarbons. Given the lack of persistent enrichment and overall community convergence between materials over time, common non-hydrolysable polymers might not serve as an important source of carbon for mature Plastispheres once the labile substrates generated from weathering have been depleted.","authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Erni-Cassola"},{"name":"Robyn J Wright"},{"name":"Matthew I Gibson"},{"name":"Joseph A Christie-Oleza"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Early biofilm"},{"word":"Marine plastic pollution"},{"word":"Microbial colonization"},{"word":"Plastisphere"},{"word":"Weathered polyethylene"}]},"article383":{"pmid":"31463403","title":"Effectiveness and safety of low-concentrated ozonized water for the reduction of contamination in dental unit water lines.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Contamination of dental unit waterlines (DUWL) with heterotrophic bacteria can cause problems in immune compromised patients (aged, tumor and organ transplantation-patients).

Their antibacterial and antibiofilm efficiency were compared with chlorhexidine (CHX) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). We measured the MIC, MBC and MBIC of DMADDM and DMAHDM respectively. We also detected the ratio of live/dead bacteria and bacterial composition in the biofilms treated by DMADDM and DMAHDM. We found that DMADDM and DMAHDM could inhibit the growth of bacteria and biofilms formation. The result showed that novel QAMs were remarkably efficient than CHX against biofilms. In addition, we found that Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were frequent isolates after treatment with antimicrobial compounds.","authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Kumar Tiwari"},{"name":"Xiao Guo"},{"name":"Yannan Huang"},{"name":"Xuedong Zhou"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"},{"name":"Biao Ren"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Mingyun Li"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"}],"keywords":[]},"article386":{"pmid":"31462414","title":"Bioinformatic and Molecular Analysis of Inverse Autotransporters from Escherichia coli.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Proteins secreted by the type V secretion system possess multiple functions, including the capacity to mediate adhesion, aggregation, and biolfilm formation. The type V secretion system can be divided into five subclasses, one of which is the type Ve system. Proteins of the type Ve secretion system are also referred to as inverse autotransporters (IATs). In this study, we performed an in silico analysis of 126 completely sequenced Escherichia coli genomes available in the NCBI database and identified several distinct IAT-encoding gene families whose distribution varied throughout the E. coli phylogeny. The genes included three characterized IATs (intimin, fdeC, and yeeJ) and four uncharacterized IATs (here named iatA, iatB, iatC, and iatD). The four iat genes were cloned from the completely sequenced environmental E. coli strain SMS-3-5 and characterized. Three of these IAT proteins (IatB, IatC, and IatD) were expressed at the cell surface and possessed the capacity to mediate biofilm formation in a recombinant E. coli K-12 strain. Further analysis of the iatB gene, which showed a unique association with extraintestinal E. coli strains, suggested that its regulation is controlled by the LeuO global regulator.

We collected diarrheal stools from 49 inpatients (18 of whom tested positive for CDI) under stringent inclusion criteria. We utilized a tiered sequencing approach to identify enriched bacterial and fungal taxa, using 16S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, with matched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics performed on a subset of the population. Distinct bacterial and fungal compositions distinguished CDI-positive and -negative patients, with the greatest differentiation between the cohorts observed based on bacterial metatranscriptomics. Bipartite network analyses demonstrated that Aspergillus and Penicillium taxa shared a strong positive relationship in CDI patients and together formed negative cooccurring relationships with several bacterial taxa, including the Oscillospira, Comamonadaceae, Microbacteriaceae, and Cytophagaceae Metatranscriptomics revealed enriched pathways in CDI patients associated with biofilm production primarily driven by Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas, quorum-sensing proteins, and two-component systems related to functions such as osmotic regulation, linoleic acid metabolism, and flagellar assembly. Differential expression of functional pathways unveiled a mechanism by which the causal dysbiosis of CDI may self-perpetuate, potentially contributing to treatment failures. We propose that CDI has a distinct fungus-associated bacteriome, and this first description of metatranscriptomics in human subjects with CDI demonstrates that inflammation, osmotic changes, and biofilm production are key elements of CDI pathophysiology.","authors":[{"name":"David B Stewart"},{"name":"Justin R Wright"},{"name":"Maria Fowler"},{"name":"Christopher J McLimans"},{"name":"Vasily Tokarev"},{"name":"Isabella Amaniera"},{"name":"Owen Baker"},{"name":"Hoi-Tong Wong"},{"name":"Jeff Brabec"},{"name":"Rebecca Drucker"},{"name":"Regina Lamendella"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Clostridioides difficile"},{"word":"metagenomics"},{"word":"metatranscriptomics"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"mycobiome"}]},"article388":{"pmid":"31461929","title":"Recombinant N-acyl homoserine lactone-Lactonase AiiA","date":"2020-03-05","abs":"Quorum quenching (QQ) is a promising alternative infection-control strategy to antibiotics that controls quorum-regulated virulence without killing the pathogens.

Indeed, some P. fluorescens strains are well-known rhizobacteria that promote plant growth by direct stimulation, by preventing the deleterious effects of pathogens, or both. Pseudomonas fluorescens C7R12 is a rhizosphere-competent strain that is effective as a biocontrol agent and promotes plant growth and arbuscular mycorrhization. This strain has been studied in detail, but no visual evidence has ever been obtained for extracellular structures potentially involved in its remarkable fitness and biocontrol performances. On transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained C7R12 cells, we observed the following appendages: multiple polar flagella, an inducible putative type three secretion system typical of phytopathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strains and densely bundled fimbria-like appendages forming a broad fractal-like dendritic network around single cells and microcolonies. The deployment of one or other of these elements on the bacterial surface depends on the composition and affinity for the water of the microenvironment. The existence, within this single strain, of machineries known to be involved in motility, chemotaxis, hypersensitive response, cellular adhesion and biofilm formation, may partly explain the strong interactions of strain C7R12 with plants and associated microflora in addition to the type three secretion system previously shown to be implied in mycorrhizae promotion.","authors":[{"name":"Dorian Bergeau"},{"name":"Sylvie Mazurier"},{"name":"Corinne Barbey"},{"name":"Annabelle Merieau"},{"name":"Andrea Chane"},{"name":"Didier Goux"},{"name":"Sophie Bernard"},{"name":"Azeddine Driouich"},{"name":"Philippe Lemanceau"},{"name":"Maïté Vicré"},{"name":"Xavier Latour"}],"keywords":[]},"article390":{"pmid":"31460863","title":"Application of Lactobacillus gasseri 63 AM supernatant to Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected wounds prevents sepsis in murine models of thermal injury and dorsal excision.","date":"2019-10-11","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Taylor D Lenzmeier"},{"name":"Nithya S Mudaliar"},{"name":"Joshua A Stanbro"},{"name":"Chase Watters"},{"name":"Aatiya Ahmad"},{"name":"Mark P Simons"},{"name":"Gary Ventolini"},{"name":"John C Zak"},{"name":"Jane A Colmer-Hamood"},{"name":"Abdul N Hamood"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Lactobacillus gasseri"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"murine dorsal excision infection model"},{"word":"murine model of thermal injury"},{"word":"probiotic"},{"word":"sepsis"},{"word":"wound infection"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"31460858","title":"Prosthetic joint infections present diverse and unique microbial communities using combined whole-genome shotgun sequencing and culturing methods.","date":"2019-10-11","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Abigail A Weaver"},{"name":"Nur A Hasan"},{"name":"Mark Klaassen"},{"name":"Hiren Karathia"},{"name":"Rita R Colwell"},{"name":"Joshua D Shrout"}],"keywords":[{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"polymicrobial"},{"word":"prosthetic joint infection"},{"word":"whole-genome sequencing"}]},"article392":{"pmid":"31460753","title":"Toxic Burdens of Freshwater Biofilms and Use as a Source Tracking Tool in Rivers and Streams.","date":"2019-11-28","abs":"Biofilms, composed of periphyton, bacteria, and organic detritus, are the base of the food web in many streams and rivers.

The kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs showed pronounced activity in the case of Gram-negative bacteria compared to that in Gram-positive bacteria. Upon interaction with the bacteria, kanamycin could probably generate harmful agents such as hydroxyl radical that leads to bacterial cell damage. After being incorporated with copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs), the doped HAP NPs were applied for the bioimaging of bacterial cells. The biocompatibility of doped HAP NPs was also studied in HeLa cells. As compared to copper nanoclusters, the doped HAP NPs showed excellent biocompatibility even at higher concentrations of copper. The kanamycin-loaded doped HAP NPs were further applied toward Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm eradication. Thus, the as-synthesized copper nanocluster-doped HAP NPs were applied as nanocarriers for antibiotic drug delivery, bioimaging, and antibiofilm applications.","authors":[{"name":"Anitha T Simon"},{"name":"Deepanjalee Dutta"},{"name":"Arun Chattopadhyay"},{"name":"Siddhartha Sankar Ghosh"}],"keywords":[]},"article395":{"pmid":"31459612","title":"Reducing the Amyloidogenicity of Functional Amyloid Protein FapC Increases Its Ability To Inhibit α-Synuclein Fibrillation.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Functional amyloid (FA) proteins have evolved to assemble into fibrils with a characteristic cross-β structure, which stabilizes biofilms and contributes to bacterial virulence. Some of the most studied bacterial FAs are the curli protein CsgA, expressed in a wide range of bacteria, and FapC, produced mainly by members of the Pseudomonas genus. Though unrelated, both CsgA and FapC contain imperfect repeats believed to drive the formation of amyloid fibrils. While much is known about CsgA biogenesis and fibrillation, the mechanism of FapC fibrillation remains less explored. Here, we show that removing the three imperfect repeats of FapC (FapC ΔR1R2R3) slows down the fibrillation but does not prevent it. The increased lag phase seen for FapC ΔR1R2R3 allows for disulfide bond formation, which further delays fibrillation. Remarkably, these disulfide-bonded species of FapC ΔR1R2R3 also significantly delay the fibrillation of human α-synuclein, a key protein in Parkinson's disease pathology. This attenuation of α-synuclein fibrillation was not seen for the reduced form of FapC ΔR1R2R3. The results presented here shed light on the FapC fibrillation mechanism and emphasize how unrelated fibrillation systems may share such common fibril formation mechanisms, allowing inhibitors of one fibrillating protein to affect a completely different protein.","authors":[{"name":"Line Friis Bakmann Christensen"},{"name":"Kirstine Friis Jensen"},{"name":"Janni Nielsen"},{"name":"Brian Stougaard Vad"},{"name":"Gunna Christiansen"},{"name":"Daniel Erik Otzen"}],"keywords":[]},"article396":{"pmid":"31459428","title":"Highly Sensitive Dissolved Oxygen Sensor with a Sustainable Antifouling, Antiabrasion, and Self-Cleaning Superhydrophobic Surface.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Long-term sensing of dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution always suffers from adherence of algae, barnacles, and clams and formation of biofilms on the sensor surface, which strongly influences the diffusion of oxygen into the sensor film.
