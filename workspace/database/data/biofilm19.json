Once formed, biofilms are very difficult to destroy, and microorganisms in biofilms are much more resistant to antimicrobial agents than their free-floating counterparts. The current antimicrobial agents/disinfectants often have low residence time on biofilms, leading to low antimicrobial effect on biofilm microorganisms. We designed and synthesized an amphiphilic quaternary ammonium chitosan (CS612) as biocompatible antimicrobial agents that bind onto preformed biofilms to kill adherent microorganisms. CS612 was synthesized through an external acid-free approach, and showed excellent concentration-dependent cytocompatibility toward mammalian cells. Antimicrobial functions of CS612 were confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) tests against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. CS612 rapidly bound onto preformed bacterial and fungal biofilms, and killed adherent microorganisms living in the biofilms.

Phage morphology and genome sequencing analysis show that vB_EcoP-EG1 belongs to the T7-like Podoviridae. vB_EcoP-EG1 possesses a genome (39,919 bp) containing 51 predicted genes and 149 bp terminal repeats. vB_EcoP-EG1 genome does not encode toxic proteins or proteins related to lysogeny.

One key step during the biofilm life cycle is dispersal, when motile cells abandon the mature biofilm to spread out and colonize new niches. Here, we show that in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis the general stress transcription factor SigB is essential for halting detrimental overgrowth of mature biofilm and for triggering dispersal when nutrients become limited. Specifically, SigB-deficient biofilms were larger than wild-type biofilms but exhibited accelerated cell death, significantly greater sensitivity to different stresses, and reduced dispersal. Interestingly, the signal detected by SigB to limit biofilm growth was transduced through the RsbP-dependent metabolic arm of the SigB regulatory cascade, which in turn positively controlled expression of SinR, the master regulator of biofilm formation and cell motility.

In this study, we compared the genomes of a collection of S. sanguinis strains comprised of both oral isolates and bloodstream isolates from patients diagnosed with IE. Oral and IE isolates could not be distinguished by phylogenetic analyses, and we did not succeed in identifying virulence genes unique to the IE strains. We then investigated the virulence of these strains in a rabbit model of IE using a variation of the Bar-seq (barcode sequencing) method wherein we pooled the strains and used Illumina sequencing to count unique barcodes that had been inserted into each isolate at a conserved intergenic region. After we determined that several of the genome sequences were misidentified in GenBank, our virulence results were used to inform our bioinformatic analyses, identifying genes that may explain the heterogeneity in virulence. We further characterized these strains by assaying for phenotypes potentially contributing to virulence. Neither strain competition via bacteriocin production nor biofilm formation showed any apparent relationship with virulence. Increased cell-associated manganese was, however, correlated with blood isolates.

Perturbations to this symbiotic relationship between host and microbiota has been linked to numerous microbial-driven pathological states, including Crohn's disease (CD). This is in part driven by the outgrowth of aggressive resident bacterial strains such as adherent and invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) and changes in bacterial physiology and function that promote enhanced mucosal association of pathobionts and aberrant stimulation of mucosal immunity. Endogenous bacteria from host-associated microbial communities can adopt a sessile lifestyle and form multicellular structures known as biofilms that are generated through the expression of extracellular adhesion factors that include curli amyloid fibrils, cellulose and type 1 pili. In addition to enabling bacterial attachment to mucosal surfaces, biofilm components also stimulate immune responses and can therefore instigate or perpetuate microbial-driven inflammatory diseases such as CD. These host-bacterial interactions provide pharmacological targets that can potentially be exploited to limit mucosal adherence of aggressive enteric bacteria, inappropriate stimulation of inflammatory immune responses and consequent development of chronic intestinal inflammation.","authors":[{"name":"Melissa Ellermann"},{"name":"R Balfour Sartor"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AIEC"},{"word":"Amyloids"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cellulose"},{"word":"Colitis"},{"word":"Enterobacteriaceae"},{"word":"Intestinal microbiota"},{"word":"Pathobiont"},{"word":"Type 1 pili"}]},"article28":{"pmid":"30393563","title":"Rapid diagnostic assay for detection of cellulose in urine as biomarker for biofilm-related urinary tract infections.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The ability of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to adopt a biofilm lifestyle in the urinary tract is suggested as one cause of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). A clinical role of UPEC biofilm is further supported by the presence of bacterial aggregates in urine of UTI patients. Yet, no diagnostics exist to differentiate between the planktonic and biofilm lifestyle of bacteria. Here, we developed a rapid diagnostic assay for biofilm-related UTI, based on the detection of cellulose in urine. Cellulose, a component of biofilm extracellular matrix, is detected by a luminescent-conjugated oligothiophene, which emits a conformation-dependent fluorescence spectrum when bound to a target molecule. We first defined the cellulose-specific spectral signature in the extracellular matrix of UPEC biofilm colonies, and used these settings to detect cellulose in urine. To translate this optotracing assay for clinical use, we composed a workflow that enabled rapid isolation of urine sediment and screening for the presence of UPEC-derived cellulose in <45 min. Using multivariate analysis, we analyzed spectral information obtained between 464 and 508 nm by optotracing of urine from 182 UTI patients and 8 healthy volunteers. Cellulose was detected in 14.8% of UTI urine samples. Using cellulose as a biomarker for biofilm-related UTI, our data provide direct evidence that UPEC forms biofilm in the urinary tract. Clinical implementation of this rapid, non-invasive and user-friendly optotracing diagnostic assay will potentially aid clinicians in the design of effective antibiotic treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Haris Antypas"},{"name":"Ferdinand X Choong"},{"name":"Ben Libberton"},{"name":"Annelie Brauner"},{"name":"Agneta Richter-Dahlfors"}],"keywords":[]},"article29":{"pmid":"30393533","title":"Correction: Engineering microbial physiology with synthetic polymers: cationic polymers induce biofilm formation in Vibrio cholerae and downregulate the expression of virulence genes.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1039/C7SC00615B.].","authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Perez-Soto"},{"name":"Lauren Moule"},{"name":"Daniel N Crisan"},{"name":"Ignacio Insua"},{"name":"Leanne M Taylor-Smith"},{"name":"Kerstin Voelz"},{"name":"Francisco Fernandez-Trillo"},{"name":"Anne Marie Krachler"}],"keywords":[]},"article30":{"pmid":"30393222","title":"Aloe vera extract: A novel antimicrobial and antibiofilm against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains.","date":"2019-08-16","abs":"Bacterial infectious maladies are the leading cause of death worldwide.

Biofilms play an important role in increased pathogenesis of bacteria and it is assumed that motility is one of the contributing factors towards biofilm initiation. This study was planned to identify the role of flagella in biofilm formation by constructing flagellated (wild type) and physically disrupted variants (non-motile). Total 10 clinical bacterial strains were isolated and characterized. Morphological and biochemical study identified these strains as Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Yersinia spp., Escherichia spp., Salmonella spp., Proteus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Bacillus spp. Among all strains, two strains including Yersinia spp and Bacillus spp. showed higher antibiotic resistance, hence studied at molecular and physiological level. Biofilm formation capacity of strains was analyzed using three methods including Congo red assay, Test tube assay and Liquid-interface coverslip assay. Afterwards, flagellar disintegration was induced by blending and centrifugation for 5, 10 and 15 minutes. 16S rRNA sequencing showed two strains as Bacillus cereus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Both strains produced significant biofilm by all three above mentioned methods. A motility test of these blended variants showed partial/diminished motility with increased blending time. The significant loss in biofilm formation after 15 minutes blending confirmed the important flagellar contribution to the initiation of biofilm formation. This biofilm defect observed in flagella paralysed/minus variants presumably may be due to defects in attachments to surface at early stages. This study indicated that flagellar motility is crucial initially for surface attachment and subsequently for biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Iram Liaqat"},{"name":"Safdar Ali Mirza"},{"name":"Riffat Iqbal"},{"name":"Nazish Mazhar Ali"},{"name":"Gulbeena Saleem"},{"name":"Samia Majid"},{"name":"Maryam Shahid"}],"keywords":[]},"article32":{"pmid":"30393179","title":"Enrichment of semen culture in the diagnosis of bacterial prostatitis.","date":"2019-07-01","abs":"The objective was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of our microbiological protocol to simplify the evaluation of bacterial prostatitis in the clinical practice.

The effects of the S4Sm culture supernatant on the transcription of three genes involved in protease activity, namely, vcpA, vcpB, and vcpR (encoding metalloproteases A and B and their transcriptional regulator, respectively), were examined by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR).

Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have been extensively used in the biomedical field because of their biocompatibility and magnetic properties. More recently, IONPs have been investigated as potential nanocarriers for antibiotics to be magnetically directed to/recovered from infection sites. Here, we conjugated the last-resort glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin to IONPs after surface functionalization with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES). Classical microbiological methods and fluorescence and electron microscopy analysis were used to compare antimicrobial activity and surface interactions of naked IONPs, amino-functionalized NPs (NP-APTES), and nanoconjugated teicoplanin (NP-TEICO) with non-conjugated teicoplanin. As bacterial models, differently resistant strains of three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis) and a Gram-negative representative (Escherichia coli) were used. The results indicated that teicoplanin conjugation conferred a valuable and prolonged antimicrobial activity to IONPs toward Gram-positive bacteria. No antimicrobial activity was detected using NP-TEICO toward the Gram-negative E. coli. Although IONPs and NP-APTES showed only insignificant antimicrobial activity in comparison to NP-TEICO, our data indicate that they might establish diverse interaction patterns at bacterial surfaces. Sensitivity of bacteria to NPs varied according to the surface provided by the bacteria and it was species specific. In addition, conjugation of teicoplanin improved the cytocompatibility of IONPs toward two human cell lines.

In this study, we developed a coordination compound consisting of zinc chloride and erythritol that exhibits penetrating and bactericidal activity against Streptococcus mutans biofilms. An in vitro biofilm model was established in microplates, and bactericidal activity against biofilms was evaluated using an Alamar blue assay. The cause of the antimicrobial activity of the zinc-erythritol mixture on mature biofilms was demonstrated using fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy and atomic force microscopy. We demonstrated that zinc chloride spontaneously formed cationic complexes with erythritol in water. The zinc-erythritol complexes reduced intra- and inter-molecular interactions between bacterial exopolysaccharides, a major component of EPS. This activity was confirmed by measuring the attenuation of the hardness of dried polysaccharides isolated from S. mutans biofilms. The reduction in the interactions between polysaccharides allowed the complexes to penetrate into biofilms and kill the embedded bacteria. While approximately 13% of biofilm-associated microbes were killed by a 10 min treatment with 6.6 mM zinc chloride, 45% were killed when a solution containing 19.8 mM erythritol and 6.6 mM zinc chloride was used.

A major cell-associated virulence factor, the Type IV pilus (T4P), is required for epithelial cell adherence and mediates a form of surface translocation termed twitching motility, which is necessary to establish a mature biofilm and actively expand these biofilms. P. aeruginosa twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion is a coordinated, multicellular behaviour, allowing cells to rapidly colonize surfaces, including implanted medical devices. Although at least 44 proteins are known to be involved in the biogenesis, assembly and regulation of the T4P, with additional regulatory components and pathways implicated, it is unclear how these components and pathways interact to control these processes. In the current study, we used a global genomics-based random-mutagenesis technique, transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS), coupled with a physical segregation approach, to identify all genes implicated in twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion in P. aeruginosa.

Our results revealed intriguing similarities between the community succession on the newly-colonized sediments and succession patterns previously observed for biofilms in other more dynamic aquatic environments, indicating that the assembly of microbial communities on surfaces may be governed by similar underlying mechanisms across a wide range of different habitats. Null model simulations on spatiotemporally resolved 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data further indicated selection of specific OTUs rather than random colonization as the main driver of community assembly. A small fraction of persistent OTUs that had established on the sediments during the first 115 days dominated the final communities (68%-85%), suggesting a key role of these early-colonizing organisms, in particular specific genera within the Comamonadaceae and Oxalobacteraceae, for community assembly and succession during the colonization of the sediments. Overall, our study suggests that differences between planktonic and sediment-attached communities often reported for groundwater environments are not the result of purely stochastic events, but that sediment surfaces select for specific groups of microorganisms that assemble over time in a reproducible, non-random way.","authors":[{"name":"Lucas Fillinger"},{"name":"Yuxiang Zhou"},{"name":"Claudia Kellermann"},{"name":"Christian Griebler"}],"keywords":[]},"article89":{"pmid":"30377966","title":"Insights into the role of extracellular polymeric substances in Zn","date":"2019-02-21","abs":"The adsorption behavior of Zn","authors":[{"name":"Yu-Xia Song"},{"name":"Cheng-Hai Lu"},{"name":"Peng Liu"},{"name":"Xi-Lin Chai"},{"name":"Xi Chen"},{"name":"Xiao-Bo Min"},{"name":"Chong-Jian Tang"},{"name":"Li-Yuan Chai"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Activated sludge"},{"word":"Adsorption"},{"word":"Anammox"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"Nitrification"},{"word":"Zinc"}]},"article90":{"pmid":"30377959","title":"Wastewater treatment by slow sand filters using uncoated and iron-coated fine sand: impact of hydraulic loading rate and media depth.","date":"2020-01-22","abs":"Two lab-scale slow sand filters (SSFs), packed with uncoated fine sand (SSF","authors":[{"name":"Srishti Verma"},{"name":"Achlesh Daverey"},{"name":"Archana Sharma"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Coated fine sand"},{"word":"Hydraulic loading rate"},{"word":"Intermittent mode"},{"word":"Medium depth"},{"word":"Slow sand filtration"}]},"article91":{"pmid":"30377646","title":"Microarray based transcriptome profile data of ∆lon and ∆lon rpoB12 strains of Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The data presented in this article shows the microarray based transcriptome profiles of ∆lon and ∆lon rpoB12 strains of Escherichia coli.

To address these knowledge gaps, we worked with citizen scientists to collect showerhead biofilm samples and associated water chemistry data from 656 households located across the United States and Europe. Our cultivation-independent analyses revealed that the genus Mycobacterium was consistently the most abundant genus of bacteria detected in residential showerheads, and yet mycobacterial diversity and abundances were highly variable. Mycobacteria were far more abundant, on average, in showerheads receiving municipal water than in those receiving well water and in U.S. households than in European households, patterns that are likely driven by differences in the use of chlorine disinfectants. Moreover, we found that water source, water chemistry, and household location also influenced the prevalence of specific mycobacterial lineages detected in showerheads. We identified geographic regions within the United States where showerheads have particularly high abundances of potentially pathogenic lineages of mycobacteria, and these hot spots generally overlapped those regions where NTM lung disease is most prevalent. Together, these results emphasize the public health relevance of mycobacteria in showerhead biofilms. They further demonstrate that mycobacterial distributions in showerhead biofilms are often predictable from household location and water chemistry, knowledge that advances our understanding of NTM transmission dynamics and the development of strategies to reduce exposures to these emerging pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew J Gebert"},{"name":"Manuel Delgado-Baquerizo"},{"name":"Angela M Oliverio"},{"name":"Tara M Webster"},{"name":"Lauren M Nichols"},{"name":"Jennifer R Honda"},{"name":"Edward D Chan"},{"name":"Jennifer Adjemian"},{"name":"Robert R Dunn"},{"name":"Noah Fierer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium"},{"word":"NTM lung disease"},{"word":"nontuberculous mycobacterial infection"},{"word":"plumbing biofilms"}]},"article95":{"pmid":"30377275","title":"Genome-Wide Characterization of the Fur Regulatory Network Reveals a Link between Catechol Degradation and Bacillibactin Metabolism in Bacillus subtilis.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is the global iron biosensor in many bacteria. Fur functions as an iron-dependent transcriptional repressor for most of its regulated genes. There are a few examples where holo-Fur activates transcription, either directly or indirectly. Recent studies suggest that apo-Fur might also act as a positive regulator and that, besides iron metabolism, the Fur regulon might encompass other biological processes such as DNA synthesis, energy metabolism, and biofilm formation. Here, we obtained a genomic view of the Fur regulatory network in Bacillus subtilis using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Besides the known Fur target sites, 70 putative DNA binding sites were identified, and the vast majority had higher occupancy under iron-sufficient conditions. Among the new sites detected, a Fur binding site in the promoter region of the catDE operon is of particular interest. This operon, encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, is critical for catechol degradation and is under negative regulation of CatR and YodB. These three repressors (Fur, CatR, and YodB) function cooperatively to regulate the transcription of catDE, with Fur functioning as a sensor of iron limitation and CatR as the major sensor of catechol stress. Genetic analysis suggests that CatDE is involved in metabolism of the catecholate siderophore bacillibactin, particularly when bacillibactin is constitutively produced and accumulates intracellularly, potentially generating endogenous toxic catechol derivatives. This study documents a role for catechol degradation in bacillibactin metabolism and provides evidence that catechol 2,3-dioxygenase can detoxify endogenously produced catechol substrates in addition to its more widely studied role in biodegradation of environmental aromatic compounds and pollutants.","authors":[{"name":"Hualiang Pi"},{"name":"John D Helmann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ChIP-seq"},{"word":"Fur regulon"},{"word":"bacillibactin degradation"},{"word":"bacillibactin metabolism"},{"word":"catechol degradation"}]},"article97":{"pmid":"30377031","title":"Unveiling the early events of Pseudomonas aeruginosa adaptation in cystic fibrosis airway environment using a long-term in vitro maintenance.","date":"2019-07-05","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic infections are the major cause of high morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients due to the use of sophisticated mechanisms of adaptation, including clonal diversification into specialized CF-adapted phenotypes. In contrast to chronic infections, very little is known about what occurs after CF lungs colonization and at early infection stages. This study aims to investigate the early events of P. aeruginosa adaptation to CF environment, in particular, to inspect the occurrence of clonal diversification at early stages of infection development and its impact on antibiotherapy effectiveness. To mimic CF early infections, three P. aeruginosa strains were long-term grown in artificial sputum (ASM) over 10 days and phenotypic diversity verified through colony morphology characterization. Biofilm sub- and inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin were applied to non- and diversified populations to evaluate antibiotic effectiveness on P. aeruginosa eradication. Our results demonstrated that clonal diversification might occur after ASM colonization and growth. However, this phenotypic diversification did not compromise ciprofloxacin efficacy in P. aeruginosa eradication since a biofilm minimal inhibitory dosage would be applied. The expected absence of mutators in P. aeruginosa populations led us to speculate that clonal diversification in the absence of ciprofloxacin treatments could be driven by niche specialization. Yet, biofilm sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin seemed to overlap niche specialization as fitter variants emerged, such as mucoid, small colony and pinpoint variants, known to be highly resistant to antibiotics. The pathogenic potential of all emergent colony morphotypes-associated bacteria, distinct from the wild-morphotypes, revealed that P. aeruginosa evolved to a non-swimming phenotype. Impaired swimming motility seemed to be one of the first evolutionary steps of P. aeruginosa in CF lungs that could pave the way for further adaptation steps including biofilm formation and progress to chronic infection. Based on our findings, impaired swimming motility seemed to be a candidate to disease marker of P. aeruginosa infection development. Despite our in vitro CF model represents a step forward towards in vivo scenario simulation and provided valuable insights about the early events, more and distinct P. aeruginosa strains should be studied to strengthen our results.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Margarida Sousa"},{"name":"Rosana Monteiro"},{"name":"Maria Olívia Pereira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"Early infection"},{"word":"Long-term in vitro model"},{"word":"Phenotypic diversification"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}]},"article98":{"pmid":"30376953","title":"Physico-chemistry from initial bacterial adhesion to surface-programmed biofilm growth.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"Biofilm formation is initiated by adhesion of individual bacteria to a surface. However, surface adhesion alone is not sufficient to form the complex community architecture of a biofilm. Surface-sensing creates bacterial awareness of their adhering state on the surface and is essential to initiate the phenotypic and genotypic changes that characterize the transition from initial bacterial adhesion to a biofilm. Physico-chemistry has been frequently applied to explain initial bacterial adhesion phenomena, including bacterial mass transport, role of substratum surface properties in initial adhesion and the transition from reversible to irreversible adhesion. However, also emergent biofilm properties, such as production of extracellular-polymeric-substances (EPS), can be surface-programmed. This review presents a four-step, comprehensive description of the role of physico-chemistry from initial bacterial adhesion to surface-programmed biofilm growth: (1) bacterial mass transport towards a surface, (2) reversible bacterial adhesion and (3) transition to irreversible adhesion and (4) cell wall deformation and associated emergent properties. Bacterial transport mostly occurs from sedimentation or convective-diffusion, while initial bacterial adhesion can be described by surface thermodynamic and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO)-analyses, considering bacteria as smooth, inert colloidal particles. DLVO-analyses however, require precise indication of the bacterial cell surface, which is impossible due to the presence of bacterial surface tethers, creating a multi-scale roughness that impedes proper definition of the interaction distance in DLVO-analyses. Application of surface thermodynamics is also difficult, because initial bacterial adhesion is only an equilibrium phenomenon for a short period of time, when bacteria are attached to a substratum surface through few surface tethers. Physico-chemical bond-strengthening occurs in several minutes leading to irreversible adhesion due to progressive removal of interfacial water, conformational changes in cell surface proteins, re-orientation of bacteria on a surface and the progressive involvement of more tethers in adhesion. After initial bond-strengthening, adhesion forces arising from a substratum surface cause nanoscopic deformation of the bacterial cell wall against the elasticity of the rigid peptidoglycan layer positioned in the cell wall and the intracellular pressure of the cytoplasm. Cell wall deformation not only increases the contact area with a substratum surface, presenting another physico-chemical bond-strengthening mechanism, but is also accompanied by membrane surface tension changes. Membrane-located sensor molecules subsequently react to control emergent phenotypic and genotypic properties in biofilms, most notably adhesion-associated ones like EPS production. Moreover, also bacterial efflux pump systems may be activated or mechano-sensitive channels may be opened upon adhesion-induced cell wall deformation. The physico-chemical properties of the substratum surface thus control the response of initially adhering bacteria and through excretion of autoinducer molecules extend the awareness of their adhering state to other biofilm inhabitants who subsequently respond with similar emergent properties. Herewith, physico-chemistry is not only involved in initial bacterial adhesion to surfaces but also in what we here propose to call surface-programmed biofilm growth. This conclusion is pivotal for the development of new strategies to control biofilm formation on substratum surfaces, that have hitherto been largely confined to the initial bacterial adhesion phenomena.","authors":[{"name":"Vera Carniello"},{"name":"Brandon W Peterson"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Appendages"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"Physico-chemical interactions"},{"word":"Surface-sensing"},{"word":"Tethers"}]},"article99":{"pmid":"30376742","title":"Alpha defensin, leukocyte esterase, C-reactive protein, and leukocyte count in synovial fluid for pre-operative diagnosis of periprosthetic infection.","date":"2019-03-14","abs":"Synovial fluid analysis for diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections has gained increasing interest in the recent past when markers more specific for these infections than the serum ones have been identified.

For example, Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, is able to colonize host small intestines and combat host-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) during infection. To dissect the molecular mechanisms utilized by V. cholerae to overcome ROS in vivo, we performed a whole-genome transposon sequencing analysis (Tn-seq) by comparing gene requirements for colonization using adult mice with and without the treatment of the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine. We found that mutants of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, such as MutS, displayed significant colonization advantages in untreated, ROS-rich mice, but not in NAC-treated mice. Further analyses suggest that the accumulation of both catalase-overproducing mutants and rugose colony variants in NAC- mice was the leading cause of mutS mutant enrichment caused by oxidative stress during infection. We also found that rugose variants could revert back to smooth colonies upon aerobic, in vitro culture. Additionally, the mutation rate of wildtype colonized in NAC- mice was significantly higher than that in NAC+ mice. Taken together, these findings support a paradigm in which V. cholerae employs a temporal adaptive strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes. Moreover, ΔmutS passage and complementation can be used to model hypermuation in diverse pathogens to identify novel stress resistance mechanisms.","authors":[{"name":"Hui Wang"},{"name":"Xiaolin Xing"},{"name":"Jipeng Wang"},{"name":"Bo Pang"},{"name":"Ming Liu"},{"name":"Jessie Larios-Valencia"},{"name":"Tao Liu"},{"name":"Ge Liu"},{"name":"Saijun Xie"},{"name":"Guijuan Hao"},{"name":"Zhi Liu"},{"name":"Biao Kan"},{"name":"Jun Zhu"}],"keywords":[]},"article101":{"pmid":"30376123","title":"Surface coatings with covalently attached anidulafungin and micafungin prevent Candida albicans biofilm formation.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Fungal biofilms caused by Candida spp. are a major contributor to infections originating from infected biomaterial implants.

It allows them to find food and to escape from toxins. Many microorganisms can produce the chemicals to which they respond themselves and use chemotaxis for signaling, which can be seen as a basic form of communication, allowing ensembles of microorganisms to coordinate their behavior, for example, during embryogenesis, biofilm formation, or cellular aggregation. For example, Dictyostelium cells use signaling as a survival strategy: when starving, they produce certain chemicals toward which other cells show taxis. This leads to aggregation of the cells resulting in a multicellular aggregate that can sustain long starvation periods. Remarkably, the past decade has led to the development of synthetic microswimmers, which can self-propel through a solvent, analogously to bacteria and other microorganisms. The mechanism underlying the self-propulsion of synthetic microswimmers like camphor boats, droplet swimmers, and in particular autophoretic Janus colloids involves the production of certain chemicals. As we will discuss in this Account, the same chemicals (phoretic fields) involved in the self-propulsion of a (Janus) microswimmer also act on other ones and bias their swimming direction toward (or away from) the producing microswimmer. Synthetic microswimmers therefore provide a synthetic analogue to motile microorganisms interacting by taxis toward (or away from) self-produced chemical fields. In this Account, we review recent progress in the theoretical description of synthetic chemotaxis mainly based on simulations and field theoretical descriptions. We will begin with single motile particles leaving chemical trails behind with which they interact themselves, leading to effects like self-trapping or self-avoidance. Besides these self-interactions, in ensembles of synthetic motile particles each particle also responds to the chemicals produced by other particles, inducing chemical (or phoretic) cross-interactions. When these interactions are attractive, they commonly lead to clusters, even at low particle density. These clusters may either proceed toward macrophase separation, resembling Dictyostelium aggregation, or, as shown very recently, lead to dynamic clusters of self-limited size (dynamic clustering) as seen in experiments in autophoretic Janus colloids. Besides the classical case where chemical interactions are attractive, this Account discusses, as its main focus, repulsive chemical interactions, which can create a new and less known avenue to pattern formation in active systems leading to a variety of pattern, including clusters which are surrounded by shells of chemicals, traveling waves and more complex continuously reshaping patterns. In all these cases synthetic signalling can crucially determine the collective behavior of synthetic microswimmer ensembles and can be used as a design principle to create patterns in motile active particles.","authors":[{"name":"Benno Liebchen"},{"name":"Hartmut Löwen"}],"keywords":[]},"article103":{"pmid":"30375646","title":"The potential ecological effects of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate in dental caries prevention.","date":"2019-12-02","abs":"Contemporary caries prevention protocols recommend not only effective remineralizing agents but also ecological measures to reverse the dental plaque dysbiosis responsible for the disease pathogenesis.

Mastitis isolates were collected over a 3-years period from a single dairy herd, resulting in two persistent subtypes, the high within-herd prevalent subtype ST9 (CC9)-methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), designated HP/ST9, and the low within-herd prevalent subtype ST504 (CC705)-MSSA, designated LP/ST504. Characterization of the two different coexisting persistent subtypes showed that the following phenotypic traits are particularly associated with high within-herd prevalence: lack of capsular polysaccharide expression, high cellular invasiveness, low cytotoxicity and high biofilm/ poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) production, which may concomitantly contribute to the spreading of HP/ST9 within the herd. By contrast to HP/ST9, LP/ST504 is characterized by the formation of colony dendrites, which may help the bacteria to access deeper tissues as niches for persistence in single animals. Thus, within a single herd, two different types of persistence can be found in parallel, allowing longtime persistence of S. aureus in dairy cattle. Furthermore, this study indicates that ST9 (CC9)-MSSA strains, which are currently thought to have their primary reservoir in swine and humans, can also successfully spread to new hosts and persist in dairy herds for years.","authors":[{"name":"Tom Grunert"},{"name":"Beatrix Stessl"},{"name":"Franz Wolf"},{"name":"Daniel O Sordelli"},{"name":"Fernanda R Buzzola"},{"name":"Monika Ehling-Schulz"}],"keywords":[]},"article116":{"pmid":"32004151","title":"Characterization of clinical extensively drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a Chinese teaching hospital.","date":"2020-02-07","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important opportunistic pathogen, carries multiple virulence factors which contribute to its adaptation and pathogenicity.

We used circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy to show that, unlike the structured TasA, TapA is disordered. In addition, TapA is composed of two weakly interacting domains: a disordered C-terminal domain and a more structured N-terminal domain. These two domains also exhibited different structural changes in response to changes in external conditions, such as increased temperatures and the presence of lipid vesicles. Although the two TapA domains weakly interacted in solution, their cooperative interaction with lipid vesicles prevented disruption of the vesicles.

Many patients may be at particular risk, including critically ill patients in the intensive care unit.

Bacterial contamination and septic transfusion reactions are major sources of morbidity and mortality. Between 1:1000 and 1:2500 platelet units are bacterially contaminated. The skin bacterial microflora is a primary source of contamination, and enteric contaminants are rare but may be clinically devastating, while platelet storage conditions can support bacterial growth. Donor selection, blood diversion, and hemovigilance are effective but have limitations. Biofilm-producing species can adhere to biological and non-biological surfaces and evade detection. Primary bacterial culture testing of apheresis platelets is in routine use in the US. Pathogen reduction/inactivation technologies compatible with platelets use ultraviolet light-based mechanisms to target nucleic acids of contaminating bacteria and other pathogens. These methods have demonstrated safety and efficacy and represent a proactive approach for inactivating contaminants before transfusion to prevent transfusion-transmitted infections. One system, which combines ultraviolet A and amotosalen for broad-spectrum pathogen inactivation, is approved in both the US and Europe. Current US Food and Drug Administration recommendations advocate enhanced bacterial testing or pathogen reduction/inactivation strategies (or both) to further improve platelet safety. Risks of bacterial contamination of platelets and transfusion-transmitted infections have been significantly mitigated, but not eliminated, by improvements in prevention and detection strategies.

The regulatory role of the PDE enzymes in E. amylovora has not been determined. Using a combination of single, double, and triple deletion mutants, we determined the effects of each of the four putative PDE-encoding genes (pdeA, pdeB, pdeC, and edcA) in E. amylovora on cellular processes related to virulence. Our results indicate that pdeA and pdeC are the two phosphodiesterases most active in virulence regulation in E. amylovora Ea1189. The deletion of pdeC resulted in a measurably significant increase in the intracellular pool of c-di-GMP, and the highest intracellular concentrations of c-di-GMP were observed in the Ea1189 ΔpdeAC and Ea1189 ΔpdeABC mutants.

Our results indicate a functional redundancy among the pde genes in E. amylovora for certain traits and indicate that the intracellular degradation of c-di-GMP is mainly regulated by pdeA and pdeC, but they also suggest a role for pdeB in regulating motility and virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Roshni R Kharadi"},{"name":"Luisa F Castiblanco"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"George W Sundin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EAL domain"},{"word":"cyclic di-GMP"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"fire blight"},{"word":"flagellar motility"},{"word":"levan"}]},"article139":{"pmid":"30366993","title":"Siderophore-Mediated Iron Acquisition Enhances Resistance to Oxidative and Aromatic Compound Stress in Cupriavidus necator JMP134.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Many bacteria secrete siderophores to enhance iron uptake under iron-restricted conditions. In this study, we found that Cupriavidus necator JMP134, a well-known aromatic pollutant-degrading bacterium, produces an unknown carboxylate-type siderophore named cupriabactin to overcome iron limitation. Using genome mining, targeted mutagenesis, and biochemical analysis, we discovered an operon containing six open reading frames (cubA-F) in the C. necator JMP134 genome that encodes proteins required for the biosynthesis and uptake of cupriabactin. As the dominant siderophore of C. necator JMP134, cupriabactin promotes the growth of C. necator JMP134 under iron-limited conditions via enhanced ferric iron uptake. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the iron concentration-dependent expression of the cub operon is mediated by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur). Physiological analyses revealed that the cupriabactin-mediated iron acquisition system influences swimming motility, biofilm formation, and resistance to oxidative and aromatic compound stress in C. necator JMP134. In conclusion, we identified a carboxylate-type siderophore named cupriabactin, which plays important roles in iron scavenging, bacterial motility, biofilm formation, and stress resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Changfu Li"},{"name":"Lingfang Zhu"},{"name":"Damin Pan"},{"name":"Shuyu Li"},{"name":"He Xiao"},{"name":"Zhenxing Zhang"},{"name":"Xihui Shen"},{"name":"Yao Wang"},{"name":"Mingxiu Long"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cupriavidus necator"},{"word":"Fur"},{"word":"aromatic compound degradation"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"siderophore"}]},"article140":{"pmid":"30366511","title":"Quorum sensing inhibitors: a patent review (2014-2018).","date":"2019-07-18","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Xin Chen"},{"name":"Likun Zhang"},{"name":"Mingxiang Zhang"},{"name":"Huayu Liu"},{"name":"Panrui Lu"},{"name":"Kejiang Lin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"acyl-homoserine lactones"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"autoinducer peptides"},{"word":"autoinducer-2"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"inhibitor"}]},"article141":{"pmid":"30366231","title":"Bioelectrochemical Nitrogen fixation (e-BNF): Electro-stimulation of enriched biofilm communities drives autotrophic nitrogen and carbon fixation.","date":"2018-12-19","abs":"A new approach to microbial electrosynthesis is proposed, aimed at producing whole biomass from N","authors":[{"name":"Laura Rago"},{"name":"Sarah Zecchin"},{"name":"Federica Villa"},{"name":"Andrea Goglio"},{"name":"Anna Corsini"},{"name":"Lucia Cavalca"},{"name":"Andrea Schievano"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Artificial photosynthesis"},{"word":"Biocathode"},{"word":"Biological nitrogen fixation"},{"word":"Electro-autotrophy"},{"word":"Haber-Bosch process"},{"word":"Microbial electrosynthesis"},{"word":"Soil fertility"}]},"article142":{"pmid":"30366128","title":"Assessment of antibacterial efficacy of a biocompatible nanoparticle PC@AgNPs against Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2019-02-25","abs":"A plant, Priva cordifolia mediated silver nanoparticle was prepared and characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.

CAP is ionized gas that can be generated by applying an electric current to air or a feeding gas. It contains reactive species and emits UV radiation, which have antibacterial activity. Previous data suggests that CAP is effective in microbial inactivation and can decontaminate and sterilize surfaces, but its exact mode of action is still under debate. This study demonstrates the effect of CAP on the whole proteome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms, which is a dominant pathogen in cystic fibrosis and medical device-related infections. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify differentially regulated proteins of whole cell P. aeruginosa extracts. A total of 16 proteins were identified to be affected by plasma treatment compared to the control. Eight of the identified proteins have functions in transcription and translation and their expression changes are likely to be part of a general physiological response instead of a CAP-specific adaptation. However, CAP also affected bacterioferritin (Bfr), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idh), Trigger factor (Tig) and a chemotaxis protein, which may be involved in P. aeruginosa's specific response to CAP. We confirm that bacterioferritin B plays a role in the bacterial response to CAP because ΔbfrB mutants of both PAO1 and PA14 are more susceptible to plasma-induced cell-death than their corresponding wild-type strains. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the effect of plasma on the whole proteome of a pathogenic microorganism. It will help our understanding of the mode of action of CAP-mediated bacterial inactivation and thus support a safe and effective routine use of CAP in clinical and industrial settings.","authors":[{"name":"Ka Pui Sharon Yau"},{"name":"Anthony B Murphy"},{"name":"Ling Zhong"},{"name":"Anne Mai-Prochnow"}],"keywords":[]},"article147":{"pmid":"30364807","title":"Corrigendum: The Intestinal Roundworm Ascaris suum Releases Antimicrobial Factors Which Interfere With Bacterial Growth and Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2018.00271.].","authors":[{"name":"Ankur Midha"},{"name":"Katharina Janek"},{"name":"Agathe Niewienda"},{"name":"Petra Henklein"},{"name":"Sebastian Guenther"},{"name":"Diego O Serra"},{"name":"Josephine Schlosser"},{"name":"Regine Hengge"},{"name":"Susanne Hartmann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"ascariasis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"helminth"},{"word":"intestinal nematode"},{"word":"lectin"},{"word":"microbiota"}]},"article148":{"pmid":"30364185","title":"Interactions of Surface Exopolysaccharides From Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus Within the Intestinal Environment.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are surface carbohydrate polymers present in most bacteria acting as a protective surface layer but also interacting with the surrounding environment. This review discusses the roles of EPS synthesized by strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, many of them with probiotic characteristics, in the intestinal environment. Current knowledge on genetics and biosynthesis pathways of EPS in lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, as well as the development of genetic tools, has created possibilities to elucidate the interplay between EPS and host intestinal mucosa. These include the microbiota that inhabits this ecological niche and the host cells. Several carbohydrate recognition receptors located in the intestinal epithelium could be involved in the interaction with bacterial EPS and modulation of immune response; however, little is known about the receptors recognizing EPS from lactobacilli or bifidobacteria and the triggered response. On the contrary, it has been clearly demonstrated that EPS play a relevant role in the persistence of the producing bacteria in the intestinal tract. Indeed, some authors postulate that some of the beneficial actions of EPS-producing probiotics could be related to the formation of a biofilm layer protecting the host against injury, for example by pathogens or their toxins. Nevertheless, the in vivo formation of biofilms by probiotics has not been proved to date. Finally, EPS produced by probiotic strains are also able to interact with the intestinal microbiota that populates the gut. In fact, some of these polymers can be used as carbohydrate fermentable source by some gut commensals thus being putatively involved in the release of bacterial metabolites that exert positive benefits for the host. In spite of the increasing knowledge about the role that these surface molecules play in the interaction of probiotic bacteria with the gut mucosal actors, both intestinal receptors and microbiota, the challenging issue is to demonstrate the functionality of EPS in vivo, which will open an avenue of opportunities for the application of EPS-producing probiotics to improve health.","authors":[{"name":"Nuria Castro-Bravo"},{"name":"Jerry M Wells"},{"name":"Abelardo Margolles"},{"name":"Patricia Ruas-Madiedo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"innate-immunity"},{"word":"intestinal-receptors"},{"word":"microbiota"}]},"article149":{"pmid":"30364019","title":"Multiple Low Frequency Ultrasound Enhances Bactericidal Activity of Vancomycin against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Biofilms.","date":"2019-01-30","abs":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm infections are difficult to treat due to the high antimicrobial resistance of biofilm.

Broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin (VAN), linezolid (LIN), and levofloxacin (LEV) against three clinical isolated strains, including one methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strain and two MRSA strains. Effects of various influencing factors, such as antimicrobial agents, drug concentrations, ultrasonic intensity, and single (S-LFU, 5 or 15 min) or multiple ultrasound (M-LFU, 5 min every 8 h), on the inhibition of biofilms were investigated. The bactericidal effects of S-LFU or M-LFU on MRSA or MSSA biofilms were determined by colony counts. Right after ultrasound, synergistic effects were observed in groups of S-LFU combined with three antimicrobial agents against MSSA biofilm, but for MRSA biofilm, only S-LFU plus VAN had synergistic effect. At the time point of 24 h, M-LFU plus VAN treatment had synergistic bactericidal effect against MRSA and MSSA biofilms, and the synergy showed that VAN is concentration-dependent, but no synergistic effects were observed in all S-LFU combination groups. In conclusion, combination of M-LFU and antimicrobial agents had a better synergistic effect than S-LFU against MRSA or MSSA biofilm. LFU may be useful in treating biofilm infection in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Jin Wang"},{"name":"Ke Wen"},{"name":"Xu Liu"},{"name":"Chun-Xiao Weng"},{"name":"Rui Wang"},{"name":"Yun Cai"}],"keywords":[]},"article150":{"pmid":"30363861","title":"Green Tea Polyphenols and Padma Hepaten Inhibit Candida albicans Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Candida albicans (C. albicans) is the most prevalent opportunistic human pathogenic fungus and can cause mucosal membrane infections and invade the blood.

In this study, we examined whether the polyphenol rich extractions Polyphenon from green tea (PPFGT) and Padma Hepaten (PH) can inhibit the caries-inducing properties of C. albicans. Biofilms of C. albicans were grown in the presence of PPFGT and PH. Formation of biofilms was tested spectrophotometrically after crystal violet staining. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) secretion was quantified using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). Treated C. albicans morphology was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Expression of virulence-related genes was tested using qRT-PCR. Development of biofilm was also tested on an orthodontic surface (Essix) to assess biofilm inhibition ability on such appliances. Both PPFGT and PH dose-dependently inhibited biofilm formation, with no inhibition on planktonic growth. The strongest inhibition was obtained using the combination of the substances. Crystal violet staining showed a significant reduction of 45% in biofilm formation using a concentration of 2.5mg/ml PPFGT and 0.16mg/ml PH. A concentration of 1.25 mg/ml PPFGT and 0.16 mg/ml PH inhibited candidal growth by 88% and EPS secretion by 74% according to CSLM. A reduction in biofilm formation and in the transition from yeast to hyphal morphotype was observed using SEM. A strong reduction was found in the expression of hwp1, eap1, and als3 virulence associated genes.

These interactions can profoundly affect the virulence properties of the community. In this study we investigated how the production of gingipains, virulence factors from Porphyromonas gingivalis important in periodontal disease, was affected by other commonly found members of the sub-gingival microbiome. To mimic the subgingival microbiome, multispecies consortia (P. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus cristatus, with or without Parvimonas micra) as well as dual species consortia (P. gingivalis with P. micra, S. oralis or F. nucleatum) were constructed and maintained anaerobically in 10% serum for up to seven days. The number of P. gingivalis was determined by plating on Brucella agar and the gingipain specific fluorogenic substrate BikKam-10 was used to investigate gingipain activity. The effect of secreted products from P. micra on gingipain activity was investigated by adding supernatants from P. micra to P. gingivalis cultures. The most prominent secreted proteins in the supernatant were identified using mass spectrometry. P. gingivalis was unable to grow in serum, either alone or in the presence of S. oralis or F. nucleatum. In contrast, with P. micra growth was significantly enhanced and this was associated with an increase in gingipain activity. In the multi-species consortia, the presence of P. micra caused a 13-fold increase in gingipain activity. Exposure of P. gingivalis to supernatants from P. micra for 24 h caused a 3-fold increase in gingipain activity. This effect was reduced by 43% after heat-treatment of the supernatant. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that several of the most prominent proteins in the P. micra supernatant were glycolytic enzymes. The results from this study suggests that gingipains are produced in response to a P. micra derived signalling molecule that is most likely a protein.

Systemic diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) increase susceptibility to destructive periodontal diseases. In human studies and in animal models, these diseases have been shown to enhance inflammation in the periodontium and increase the risk or severity of periodontitis. All 3 systemic diseases are linked to a decrease in bacterial taxa associated with health and an increase in taxa associated with disease. Although there is controversy regarding the specific oral bacterial changes associated with each disease, it has been reported that diabetes increases the levels of Capnocytophaga, Porphyromonas, and Pseudomonas, while Prevotella and Selenomonas are increased in RA and Selenomonas, Leptotrichia, and Prevotella in SLE. In an animal model, diabetes increased the pathogenicity of the oral microbiome, as shown by increased inflammation, osteoclastogenesis, and periodontal bone loss when transferred to normal germ-free hosts. Moreover, in diabetic animals, the increased pathogenicity could be substantially reversed by inhibition of IL-17, indicating that host inflammation altered the microbial pathogenicity. Increased IL-17 has also been shown in SLE, RA, and leukocyte adhesion deficiency and may contribute to oral microbial changes in these diseases. Successful RA treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs partially reverses the oral microbial dysbiosis. Together, these data demonstrate that systemic diseases characterized by enhanced inflammation disturb the oral microbiota and point to IL-17 as key mediator in this process.","authors":[{"name":"D T Graves"},{"name":"J D Corrêa"},{"name":"T A Silva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dysbiosis"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"periodontitis"},{"word":"periodontium"}]},"article170":{"pmid":"30358522","title":"Overview of a Disease Outbreak and Introduction of a Step-by-Step Protocol for the Eradication of Mycobacterium haemophilum in a Zebrafish System.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"In 2017, the zebrafish unit at University of Glasgow experienced a detrimental outbreak of pathogenic bacterium, Mycobacterium haemophilum.

The graphene-silver (rGOAg) nanocomposite was synthesized by microwave reduction, and subsequently functionalized with an antimicrobial poly-cationic peptide through covalent bonding. The results demonstrated that GAPP effectively killed the planktonic cells and biofilms of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa depending upon the concentration and duration of the interaction. The complete eradication of preformed biofilm was achieved when treated with 10 μg mL-1 of GAPP for 5 h. The GAPP exerted bactericidal and biofilm inhibition activity through a contact-kill-release mode of action, wherein the electrostatic interaction of GAPP with the bacterial cells induced physical disruption accompanied by ROS-mediated biochemical changes. The internalization of GAPP into the cytoplasm through the damaged membrane led to metabolic imbalance in the cells. The peptide functionalization further prevented the dissolution of Ag+ ions, thus minimizing the cytotoxicity of GAPP to adult zebrafish. More importantly, the poly-cationic peptide functionalization enhanced the bioavailability, biofilm inhibition and disruption activities of GAPP, while minimizing its toxicological impact.

The numbers of non-germinated and germinated conidia adhered to poly-L-lysine-covered slides was higher than on glass after 4 h of fungi-surface contact. Additionally, after 72 h of interaction a typical biofilm structure had formed. Mature biofilms were also observed after 72 h on a nasogastric catheter (made from polyvinyl chloride), a late bladder catheter (siliconized latex), and a nasoenteric catheter (polyurethane). Interestingly, biofilm biomass increased considerably when the catheters had previously been incubated with serum.

Desiccation of BSAs alters the biofilm morphology and thus the physical characteristics of porous media, such as the binding matrix within BSA and internal pore geometry. Observing BSAs in their naturally hydrated form is essential but hampered due to the lack of techniques for imaging and discerning hydrated materials. Generally, imagery techniques (scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and focused ion beam nanotomography (FIB-nt)) involve the desiccation of BSAs (freeze-drying or acetone dehydration) or prevent differentiation between BSA components such as inorganic particles and pore water (confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM)). Here, we propose a novel methodology that simultaneously achieves the 3D visualization and quantification of BSAs and their components in their hydrated form at a submicron resolution using X-ray microcomputed tomography (μ-CT). It enables the high-resolution detection of comparable morphology of multiphase components within a hydrated aggregate: each single inorganic particle and the hydrated biofilm matrix. This allows the estimation of aggregate density and the illustration of biofilm-sediment binding matrix.

Little is known about how water quality conditions affect water-main biofilms because of the inherent limitations in experimenting with drinking water supplies and accessing the water mains for sampling. Bench-scale reactors permit experimentation and ease of biofilm sampling, yet questions remain as to how well biofilms in laboratory reactors represent those on water mains. In this study, the effects of DWDS pipe materials and chloramine residual on biofilms were investigated by cultivating biofilms on cement, polyvinyl chloride, and high density polyethylene coupons in CDC reactors for up to 28 months in the presence of chloraminated or dechlorinated tap water. The bench-scale biofilm microbiomes were then compared with the microbiome on a water main from the full-scale system that supplied the water to the reactors. The presence of a chloramine residual (1.74 ± 0.21 mg/L) suppressed biofilm accumulation and selected for Mycobacterium-like and Sphingopyxis-like operational taxonomic units (OTUs) while the destruction of the chloramine residual resulted in a significant increase in biomass quantity and a shift toward a more diverse community dominated by Nitrospira-like OTUs, which, our results suggest, may be complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox). Coupon material, however, had a relatively minor effect on the abundance and community composition of the biofilm bacteria. Although biofilm communities from the chloraminated water reactor and the water mains shared some dominant populations (namely, Mycobacterium- and Nitrosomonas-like OTUs), the communities were significantly different. This manuscript provides novel insights into the effects of dechlorination and pipe material on biofilm community composition. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first study to compare biofilm in a tap water-fed, bench-scale simulated distribution system to biofilm on water mains from the full-scale system supplying the tap water.","authors":[{"name":"Srijan Aggarwal"},{"name":"C Kimloi Gomez-Smith"},{"name":"Youchul Jeon"},{"name":"Timothy M LaPara"},{"name":"Michael B Waak"},{"name":"Raymond M Hozalski"}],"keywords":[]},"article195":{"pmid":"30350807","title":"Detection of bla","date":"2019-10-31","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is commonly found as an agent of nosocomial infections and demonstrates a high antibiotic resistance due to its carbapenemase production.

Fucosylated HMOs in particular are well-known for their roles as both decoy receptors and prebiotics. Recently, we discovered that HMOs possess antimicrobial activity against Group B Streptococcus (GBS) by increasing cellular permeability. HMO extracts from a single donor can contain over 100 different structures; however, studies using heterogeneous HMO mixtures do not provide insight into the specific structural requirements needed to achieve antimicrobial activity. In this study, we address this void by completing a structure activity study on the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of six neutral, fucosylated and five neutral, nonfucosylated HMOs against GBS. We determined that while the presence of fucose alone does not correlate to antimicrobial activity, the location and degree of fucosylation does play a key role in the antimicrobial activity of HMOs. Moreover, the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of single HMOs were found to be strain-specific.

A better understanding of the role of microbes in this degradation and the source of these microbes is required to improve the prediction and mitigation of the costly failures occurring due to ALWC. The microbial communities present in a sediment sample and on an ALWC tubercle on adjacent steel sheet piling from a tidal estuary were studied using culture-based isolation and metabarcoding. A total of 43 pure cultures were isolated from the sediment using a variety of culture conditions. Phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA genes placed them in the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria). 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding of the sediment and tubercle revealed similar microbial groups at varying relative abundances. No Deltaproteobacteria were isolated from the sediment but they were present in both samples according to metabarcoding and their high abundance (49.3%) in the tubercle could indicate an important functional role. Although some sediment isolates and operational taxonomic units from the metabarcoding have previously been associated with surface colonisation or biofilm formation in MIC, there was no strong evidence for the notion that the sediment adjacent to ALWC was the source of tubercle microbes.

Furthermore, gallium treatment to block iron uptake inhibited bacterial growth on water dropwort and also hampered biofilm formation.

Its increased prevalence is associated with its ability to rapidly develop antifungal drug resistance, particularly to azoles. In order to unravel new molecular mechanisms behind azole resistance, a transcriptomics analysis of the evolution of a C. glabrata clinical isolate (isolate 044) from azole susceptibility to posaconazole resistance (21st day), clotrimazole resistance (31st day), and fluconazole and voriconazole resistance (45th day), induced by longstanding incubation with fluconazole, was carried out. All the evolved strains were found to accumulate lower concentrations of azole drugs than the parental strain, while the ergosterol concentration remained mostly constant. However, only the population displaying resistance to all azoles was found to have a gain-of-function mutation in the C. glabrataPDR1 gene, leading to the upregulation of genes encoding multidrug resistance transporters. Intermediate strains, exhibiting posaconazole/clotrimazole resistance and increased fluconazole/voriconazole MIC levels, were found to display alternative ways to resist azole drugs. Particularly, posaconazole/clotrimazole resistance after 31 days was correlated with increased expression of adhesin genes. This finding led us to identify the Epa3 adhesin as a new determinant of azole resistance. Besides being required for biofilm formation, Epa3 expression was found to decrease the intracellular accumulation of azole antifungal drugs.

These studies showed heterogeneity in terms of analytical methods and strains explored. However, all studies used multispecies biofilm models for analysis of the antimicrobial activity. Unanimously, studies reported on more pronounced antimicrobial effects when applying the combination of amoxicillin + metronidazole, compared to azithromycin.

At present, there is a dearth of studies specifically evaluating the oral microbiome and periodontitis in older adults. We used high-throughput untargeted sequencing methods and functional metagenomic analyses to assess and compare the subgingival biofilm of postmenopausal women (mean age 71 years) according to periodontitis status. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 15 postmenopausal women with no periodontitis, and from 15 women with severe periodontitis, determined by probing measures. The 16S rRNA gene (V1⁻V3 region) was sequenced on the 454 FLX platform. The PICRUSt technique was used to provide information on what the potential functional characteristics of microbiota might be in healthy, compared with diseased, periodontium. The subgingival microbiome associated with periodontitis showed clear differences to that associated with health. Of the 464 species identified, 22.8% had elevated abundance in disease, while only 6.3% had elevated abundance in health. Among the 12 most prevalent organisms in periodontitis, one-half have previously been recognized as periodontal pathogens by other investigators. The subgingival microbiome in periodontitis contained genes that could code for specific activities, including microbial mobility, synthesis of endotoxin, and proteolytic degradation. The healthy microbiome included genes that could code for sustaining microbial life, including encoding for transporters, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the Krebs cycle, and protein kinases. In the present study on postmenopausal women, aged 60 and older, the subgingival microbiome differed in composition and potential function between those with and without periodontitis. Studies of functional gene expression, such as transcriptomics, are needed to definitively identify the molecules carrying out functions associated with pathogenic subgingival complexes. This, in turn, could lead to identification of targets for enhanced management of periodontitis and, possibly, other diseases, in later life.","authors":[{"name":"Michael J LaMonte"},{"name":"Robert J Genco"},{"name":"Wei Zheng"},{"name":"Daniel I McSkimming"},{"name":"Christopher A Andrews"},{"name":"Kathleen M Hovey"},{"name":"Lu Li"},{"name":"Yijun Sun"},{"name":"Michael J Buck"},{"name":"Amy E Millen"},{"name":"Karen L Falkner"},{"name":"Jean Wactawski-Wende"}],"keywords":[{"word":"aging"},{"word":"menopause"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"periodontal disease"},{"word":"women"}]},"article215":{"pmid":"30347401","title":"Biofilm-Leukocyte Cross-Talk: Impact on Immune Polarization and Immunometabolism.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Biofilms are bacterial communities contained within an extracellular matrix, which can colonize both native tissues and artificial surfaces.

Biofilm infections are particularly challenging to treat, since they are not readily cleared by antibiotics, require invasive procedures to eradicate, and are prone to recurrence. It has been demonstrated that biofilm-derived products can actively suppress proinflammatory immune responses, as evident by the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophage (MФ) polarization towards an anti-inflammatory state. Recent studies have shown that alterations in leukocyte metabolism shape their inflammatory phenotype and function. For example, anti-inflammatory MФs are biased towards oxidative phosphorylation whereas proinflammatory MФs favor aerobic glycolysis.

A novel strategy to prevent biofilm formation is based on the interference with the bacterial cell-cell communication, a process known as quorum sensing (QS) and mediated by the RNA-III-activating peptide (RAP) and its target protein TRAP (Target of RAP). The RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP) is able to inhibit S. aureus pathogenesis by disrupting QS mechanism competing with RAP, thus inhibiting the phosphorylation of TRAP. This alteration leads to a reduced adhesion and to the inhibition of RNAIII synthesis, with the subsequent suppression of toxins synthesis. The present paper will provide an overview on the activity and potential applications of RIP as biofilm inhibiting compound, useful in the management of S. aureus biofilm infections.

The most widely accepted theory explaining the ability of hormones to affect the outcome of an infection involves the suppression of the immune system.

One way to increase the efficiency of antibiotics is to use them in combination with bacteria-specific parasitic viruses, phages, which have been shown to exert additive or synergistic effects in controlling bacteria. However, it is still unclear to what extent these combinatory effects are limited by rapid evolution of resistance, especially when the pathogen grows as biofilm on surfaces typical for many persistent and chronic infections. To study this, we used a microcosm system, where genetically isogenic populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 bacterial pathogen were exposed to a phage 14/1, gentamycin or a combination of them both in a spatially structured environment. We found that even though antibiotic and phage-antibiotic treatments were equally effective at controlling bacteria in the beginning of the experiment, combination treatment rapidly lost its efficacy in both planktonic and biofilm populations. In a mechanistic manner, this was due to rapid resistance evolution: While both antibiotic and phage selected for increased resistance on their own, phage selection correlated positively with increase in antibiotic resistance, while biofilm growth, which provided generalized resistance mechanism, was favoured most in the combination treatment. Only relatively small cost of resistance and weak evidence for coevolutionary dynamics were observed. Together, these results suggest that spatial heterogeneity can promote rapid evolution of generalized resistance mechanisms without corresponding increase in phage infectivity, which could potentially limit the effectiveness of phage-antibiotic treatments in the evolutionary timescale.","authors":[{"name":"Claire E Moulton-Brown"},{"name":"Ville-Petri Friman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"coevolution"},{"word":"phages"},{"word":"phage–antibiotic synergy"},{"word":"resistance"}]},"article228":{"pmid":"30344513","title":"Bactericidal Property of Oregano Oil Against Multidrug-Resistant Clinical Isolates.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Development of non-antibiotic alternatives to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) microbes represents one of the top priorities in healthcare and community settings, especially in the care of combat trauma-associated wound infections.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of GH12 on a cariogenic multispecies biofilm and to preliminarily explain the mechanism. In this biofilm model, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 70061 was the representative of cariogenic bacteria, while Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 35105 and Streptococcus sanguinis JCM 5708 were selected as healthy microbiota. The results showed that GH12 was more effective in suppressing S. mutans than the other two species, with lower MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values among diverse type strains and clinical isolated strains. Therefore, GH12, at no more than 8 mg/liter, was used to selectively suppress S. mutans in the multispecies biofilm. GH12 at 4 mg/liter and 8 mg/liter reduced the cariogenic properties of the multispecies biofilm in biofilm formation, glucan synthesis, and lactic acid production. In addition, GH12 suppressed S. mutans within the multispecies biofilm and changed the bacterial composition. Furthermore, 8 mg/liter GH12 showed a selective bactericidal impact on S. mutans, and GH12 promoted hydrogen peroxide production in S. sanguinis and S. gordonii, which improved their ecological advantages.

Their impact is of particular relevance to wastewater disposal and re-use in agricultural settings due to CEC uptake and accumulation in food crops and consequent diffusion into the food-chain. This is the reason why the chemical CEC discussed in this review have been selected considering, besides recalcitrance, frequency of detection and entity of potential hazards, their relevance for crop uptake. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been included as microbial CEC because of the potential of secondary wastewater treatment to offer conditions favourable to the survival and proliferation of ARB, and dissemination of ARGs. Given the adverse effects of chemical and microbial CEC, their removal is being considered as an additional design criterion, which highlights the necessity of upgrading conventional WWTPs with more effective technologies. In this review, the performance of currently applied biological treatment methods for secondary treatment is analysed. To this end, technological solutions including conventional activated sludge (CAS), membrane bioreactors (MBRs), moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs), and nature-based solutions such as constructed wetlands (CWs) are compared for the achievable removal efficiencies of the selected CEC and their potential of acting as reservoirs of ARB&ARGs.

Nevertheless, characteristic and discriminatory taxa of significantly different biofilm communities were identified, indicating their specificity to a given substrate.","authors":[{"name":"Inga V Kirstein"},{"name":"Antje Wichels"},{"name":"Georg Krohne"},{"name":"Gunnar Gerdts"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Community composition"},{"word":"Fungi"},{"word":"Multivariate analysis"},{"word":"Plastics"},{"word":"Plastisphere"},{"word":"Substrate specificity"},{"word":"Synthetic polymer"}]},"article256":{"pmid":"30336679","title":"Paracoccus seriniphilus adhered on surfaces: Resistance of a seawater bacterium against shear forces under the influence of roughness, surface energy, and zeta potential of the surfaces.","date":"2019-03-20","abs":"Bacteria in flowing media are exposed to shear forces exerted by the fluid. Before a biofilm can be formed, the bacteria have to attach to a solid surface and have to resist these shear forces. Here, the authors determined dislodgement forces of single Paracoccus seriniphilus bacteria by means of lateral force microscopy. The first measurement set was performed on very flat glass and titanium (both as very hydrophilic samples with water contact angles below 20°) as well as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and steel surfaces (both as more hydrophobic surfaces in the context of biological interaction with water contact angles above 50°). The different surfaces also show different zeta potentials in the range between -18 and -108 mV at the measurement pH of 7. The second set comprised titanium with different RMS (root mean square) roughness values from a few nanometers up to 22 nm. Lateral forces between 0.5 and 3 nN were applied. For Paracoccus seriniphilus, the authors found as a general trend that the surface energy of the substrate at comparable roughness determines the detachment process. The surface energy is inversely proportional to the initial adhesion forces of the bacterium with the surface. The higher the surface energy (and the lower the initial adhesion force) is, the easier the dislodgement of the bacteria happens. In contrast, electrostatics play only a secondary role in the lateral dislodgement of the bacteria and may come only into play if surface energies are the same. Furthermore, the surface chemistry (glass, titanium, and steel as oxidic surfaces and HOPG as a nonoxidic surface) seems to play an important role because HOPG does not completely follow the above mentioned general trend found for the oxide covered surfaces. In addition, the roughness of the substrates (made of the same material) is limiting the lateral dislodgement of the bacteria. All examined structures with RMS roughness of about 8-22 nm on titanium prevent the bacteria from the lateral dislodgement compared to polished titanium with an RMS roughness of about 3 nm.","authors":[{"name":"Katharina Huttenlochner"},{"name":"Neda Davoudi"},{"name":"Christin Schlegel"},{"name":"Martin Bohley"},{"name":"Christine Müller-Renno"},{"name":"Jan C Aurich"},{"name":"Roland Ulber"},{"name":"Christiane Ziegler"}],"keywords":[]},"article257":{"pmid":"30336603","title":"Spatial and Temporal Variability in the Development and Potential Toxicity of Phormidium Biofilms in the Tarn River, France.","date":"2019-09-09","abs":"Proliferation of Phormidium biofilms in rivers is becoming a worldwide sanitation problem for humans and animals, due to the ability of these bacteria to produce anatoxins.

This approach protects steel from corrosion in seawater via the formation of a biofilm followed by the formation of an organic-inorganic hybrid film. The hybrid film is composed of multiple layers of calcite and bacterial extracellular polymeric substances, exhibiting high and stable barrier protection efficiency and further providing an in situ self-healing activity. The process involving the key transition from biofilm to biomineralized film is essential for its lasting anticorrosion activity, which overcomes the instability of biofilm protection on corrosion.

Moreover, this subpopulation is defined as a nongrowing, phenotypic variant of wild-type cells that can survive high doses of antifungals. There are high degrees of heterogeneity and plasticity associated with biofilm formation, resulting in a strong variation in the amount of persister cells. The fraction of these cells in fungal biofilms also appear to be dependent on the type of substrate. The cells can be observed immediately after their adhesion to that substrate, which makes up the initial step of biofilm formation. Thus far, persister cells have primarily been studied in Candida spp. These fungi are the fourth most common cause of nosocomial systemic infections in the United States, with C. albicans being the most prevalent species. Remarkably, persisters exhibit characteristics of a dormant state similar to what is observed in cells deprived of glucose. This dormant state, together with attachment to a substrate, appears to provide the cells with characteristics that help them overcome the challenges with fungicidal drugs such as amphotericin B (AmB). AmB is known to induce apoptosis, and persister cells are able to cope with the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating stress response pathways and the accumulation of high amounts of glycogen and trehalose-two known stress-protecting molecules. In this review, we discuss the molecular pathways that are involved in persister cell formation in fungal species and highlight that the eradication of persister cells could lead to a strong reduction of treatment failure in a clinical setting.","authors":[{"name":"Jurgen Wuyts"},{"name":"Patrick Van Dijck"},{"name":"Michelle Holtappels"}],"keywords":[]},"article265":{"pmid":"30335643","title":"Efficacy of a Surfactant-Based Wound Dressing in the Prevention of Biofilms.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"To assess the biofilm prevention action of two wound dressings, a concentrated surfactant gel preserved with antimicrobials and a concentrated surfactant gel with 1% silver sulfadiazine.","authors":[{"name":"Anne-Marie Salisbury"},{"name":"Steven L Percival"}],"keywords":[]},"article266":{"pmid":"30335377","title":"Identification of Glycoproteins Isolated from Extracellular Polymeric Substances of Full-Scale Anammox Granular Sludge.","date":"2019-12-28","abs":"ANaerobic AMMonium OXidation (anammox) is an established process for efficient nitrogen removal from wastewater, relying on anammox bacteria to form stable biofilms or granules.

Significant risk predictors were used to develop a simplified risk prediction model. The performance of this model in predicting dental caries incidence was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis, to determine its applicability to the management of caries.

It has recently been shown that B. burgdorferi develops dormant persisters in stationary phase cultures that are not killed by the current Lyme antibiotics, and there is interest in identifying novel drug candidates that more effectively kill such forms. We previously identified some highly active essential oils with excellent activity against biofilm and stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Here, we screened another 35 essential oils and found 10 essential oils (Allium sativum L. bulbs, Pimenta officinalis Lindl. berries, Cuminum cyminum L. seeds, Cymbopogon martini var. motia Bruno grass, Commiphora myrrha (T. Nees) Engl. resin, Hedychium spicatum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm. flowers, Amyris balsamifera L. wood, Thymus vulgaris L. leaves, Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers. fruits, Eucalyptus citriodora Hook. leaves) and the active component of cinnamon bark cinnamaldehyde (CA) at a low concentration of 0.1% have strong activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. At a lower concentration of 0.05%, essential oils of Allium sativum L. bulbs, Pimenta officinalis Lindl. berries, Cymbopogon martini var. motia Bruno grass and CA still exhibited strong activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi. CA also showed strong activity against replicating B. burgdorferi, with a MIC of 0.02% (or 0.2 μg/mL). In subculture studies, the top five essential oil hits Allium sativum L. bulbs, Pimenta officinalis Lindl. berries, Commiphora myrrha (T. Nees) Engl. resin, Hedychium spicatum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm. flowers, and Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers. fruits completely eradicated all B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells at 0.1%, while Cymbopogon martini var. motia Bruno grass, Eucalyptus citriodora Hook. leaves, Amyris balsamifera L. wood, Cuminum cyminum L. seeds, and Thymus vulgaris L. leaves failed to do so as shown by visible spirochetal growth after 21-day subculture. At concentration of 0.05%, only Allium sativum L. bulbs essential oil and CA sterilized the B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture, as shown by no regrowth during subculture, while Pimenta officinalis Lindl. berries, Commiphora myrrha (T. Nees) Engl. resin, Hedychium spicatum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm. flowers and Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers. fruits essential oils all had visible growth during subculture. Future studies are needed to determine if these highly active essential oils could eradicate persistent B. burgdorferi infection in vivo.","authors":[{"name":"Jie Feng"},{"name":"Wanliang Shi"},{"name":"Judith Miklossy"},{"name":"Genevieve M Tauxe"},{"name":"Conor J McMeniman"},{"name":"Ying Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Borrelia burgdorferi"},{"word":"antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"essential oils"},{"word":"persisters"}]},"article279":{"pmid":"30332359","title":"Effect of a surfactant-based gel on patient quality of life.","date":"2019-09-16","abs":"The characteristic clinical signs of chronic wounds, which remain in a state of prolonged inflammation, include increased production of devitalised tissue and exudate, pain and malodour.

Initially, S. gordonii was shown to coaggregate strongly with F. nucleatum in buffer or human saliva. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, cells of different species were shown to be evenly distributed throughout the coaggregate and were closely associated with one another. This distribution was confirmed by serial block face sectioning scanning electron microscopy, which provided high resolution three-dimensional images of coaggregates. Cell-cell sensing responses were analysed 30 minutes after inducing coaggregation in human saliva. By comparison with monocultures, 16 genes were regulated following coaggregation in F. nucleatum whereas 119 genes were regulated in S. gordonii. In both species, genes involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism were strongly affected by coaggregation. In particular, one 8-gene operon in F. nucleatum encoding sialic acid uptake and catabolism was up-regulated 2- to 5-fold following coaggregation. In S. gordonii, a gene cluster encoding functions for phosphotransferase system-mediated uptake of lactose and galactose was down-regulated up to 3-fold in response to coaggregation.

The CRISPR-Cas system (ie, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat, with CRISPR-associated proteins) provides sequence-specific protection against foreign genetic materials in archaea and bacteria, and has been widely developed for genomic engineering. The first aim of this study was to test whether components of the CRISPR-Cas9 system from S mutans UA159 is necessary to defend against foreign DNA. The data showed that a suitable PAM site, tracrRNA, Cas9, and RNase III are indispensable elements to perform normal function of S mutans CRISPR-Cas9 system. Based on these results, we designed self-targeting CRISPR arrays (containing spacer sequences identifying with gtfB) and cloned them onto plasmids. Afterward, we transformed the plasmids and editing templates into UA159 (self-targeting) to acquire desired mutants. Our data showed that this technology performed well and was able to successfully edit gtfB or gtfBgtfC genes.

Moreover, to overcome the Illumina HiSeq technology's limitation on sufficient length of reads and improve the quality and accuracy of the result, we combined Illumina HiSeq with single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT-seq) to decode the full-length transcripts.

The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of 15 unigenes was performed to test the data validity. The results were highly consistent with the RNA-seq results.

Probiotics are encapsulated within alginate, a crucial component of pseudomonas biofilms, based on a simple two-step alginate cross-linking procedure. Following exposure to the antibiotic tobramycin, the growth and metabolic activity of encapsulated probiotics are unaffected by tobramycin, and they show a four-log survival advantage over free probiotics. This results from tobramycin sequestration on the periphery of alginate beads which prevents its diffusion into the core but yet allows probiotic byproducts to diffuse outward.

Microscopic analysis of the MCBFs reveal a tightly interleaved structure of bacteria and conductive PEDOT:PSS up to 80 µm thick. Electrochemical experiments indicate S. oneidensis in MCBFs can perform both direct and riboflavin-mediated electron transfer to PEDOT:PSS. When used in bioelectrochemical reactors, the MCBFs produce 20 times more steady-state current than native biofilms grown on unmodified carbon felt.

To address this problem, a chelate-and-rinse extrafibrillar dentin demineralization strategy has been developed that keeps intrafibrillar minerals within collagen fibrils intact to prevent activation of endogenous proteases that are responsible for collagen degradation within hybrid layers. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential of using chitosan >40 kDa as an antimicrobial extrafibrillar dentin-chelating agent to enhance bond durability. Transmission electron microscopy provided evidence for retention of intrafibrillar minerals and smear plugs in dentin conditioned with 1 wt% chitosan. Analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, Dunn's statistic, and separate Mann-Whitney tests, tensile bond strengths to wet- and dry-bonded dentin indicated that chelating dentin with chitosan for 60 s prior to bonding did not result in a significant decline in resin-dentin bond strength when compared with that of phosphoric acid etching ( P > 0.05). Gelatinolytic activity within the hybrid layers was examined via in situ zymography after 24-h storage or after thermomechanical cycling and analyzed with 3-factor analysis of variance. After 24 h, enzymatic activity was detected only within completely demineralized phosphoric acid-etched dentin, with values derived from dry bonding significantly higher than those derived from wet bonding ( P < 0.05). Negligible fluorescence was detected within hybrid layers when dentin was conditioned with chitosan, even after thermomechanical cycling, as compared with the controls. Reduction in water permeability in chitosan-conditioned dentin, attributed to smear plug retention, also fostered long-term bond stability. Antibacterial testing performed with live/dead staining indicated that the acetic acid-solubilized chitosan possessed antibacterial activities against 3 single-species biofilms: Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Enterococcus faecalis. Taken together, the new chitosan-based extrafibrillar demineralization strategy retains intrafibrillar minerals, reduces endogenous protease-initiated collagen degradation, prevents water permeation within hybrid layers, and kills bacteria on dentin surfaces, which are crucial factors for enhancing resin-dentin bond durability.","authors":[{"name":"L S Gu"},{"name":"X Cai"},{"name":"J M Guo"},{"name":"D H Pashley"},{"name":"L Breschi"},{"name":"H H K Xu"},{"name":"X Y Wang"},{"name":"F R Tay"},{"name":"L N Niu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"chelation"},{"word":"collagen"},{"word":"durability"},{"word":"matrix metalloproteinases"},{"word":"permeability"}]},"article294":{"pmid":"30326724","title":"Effects of bacterial physiological states and bacterial species on host-microbe interactions.","date":"2019-06-27","abs":"This study investigated how the physiological states of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Streptococcus mitis affect their intracellular invasion capabilities and the resulting host cell responses.

In terms of biofilm formation, eDNA in solution has been shown to be very important in increasing attachment; however, very little is known about the role played by surface immobilized eDNA in initiating bacterial attachment and whether the nature of a DNA layer (physically adsorbed or covalently attached, and molecular weight) influences biofilm formation. In this study, the authors shed light on the role that surface attached DNA plays in the early biofilm formation by using Si wafers (Si) and allylamine plasma polymer (AAMpp) coated Si wafers to adsorb and covalently immobilize salmon sperm DNA of three different molecular weights. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was chosen to study the bacterial interactions with these DNA functionalized surfaces. Characterization of surface chemistry and imaging of attached bacteria were performed via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy, and epi-fluorescence microscopy. XPS results confirmed the successful grafting of DNA on the AAMpp and Si surfaces, and surprisingly the results showed that the surface attached DNA actually reduced initial bacterial attachment, which was contrary to the initial hypothesis. This adds speculation about the specific role played by DNA in the dynamics of how it influences biofilm formation, with the possibility that it could actually be used to make bacterial resistant surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Hitesh Pingle"},{"name":"Peng-Yuan Wang"},{"name":"Rosalia Cavaliere"},{"name":"Cynthia B Whitchurch"},{"name":"Helmut Thissen"},{"name":"Peter Kingshott"}],"keywords":[]},"article296":{"pmid":"30326137","title":"Tolerance of Biofilms to Antimicrobials and Significance to Antibiotic Resistance in Wounds.","date":"2019-03-28","abs":"A biofilm is a community of microorganisms that adhere to each other and to surfaces and secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) encasing themselves in a matrix. Biofilms are a major healthcare concern, as they can form on medical devices leading to infection. Additionally, there is growing evidence to show their ability to form in chronic wounds, which leads to delayed wound healing and inflammation. Due to a number of reasons, such as formation of the EPS resulting in sub-inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials reaching the bacterial cells, slow growth rate of bacterial cells rendering some antibiotics ineffective, and the presence of persister cells, biofilms show increased tolerance to many antimicrobials and antibiotics. Additionally, studies have started to emerge showing a link between resistance to antimicrobials and antibiotics. Cross-resistance can be attributed to a number of factors, for example, increased expression of multidrug efflux pumps that efflux a wide range of substrates and horizontal gene transfer of genetic material encoding multiple resistance genes between different species within the polymicrobial biofilm. Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat caused by multiple factors including cross-resistance, and it is a global health concern. This review focuses on current research on antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance and cross-resistance found between antimicrobials and antibiotics commonly used in woundcare to evaluate the significance of this acquired antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the review discusses the significance of antimicrobial tolerance and the role biofilms play in enhancing antibiotic resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Anne-Marie Salisbury"},{"name":"Kevin Woo"},{"name":"Sandip Sarkar"},{"name":"Greg Schultz"},{"name":"Matthew Malone"},{"name":"Dieter O Mayer"},{"name":"Steven L Percival"}],"keywords":[]},"article297":{"pmid":"30325949","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa glutathione biosynthesis genes play multiple roles in stress protection, bacterial virulence and biofilm formation.","date":"2019-04-03","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 contains gshA and gshB genes, which encode enzymes involved in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis.

Biofilm formation is a factor that can contribute to pathogen survival on produce surface. The goal of our current research was to investigate the survival of five S. enterica strains representing different serotypes (i.e., Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Daytona, Poona, and Newport) on whole mini cucumbers stored at refrigeration (4°C) and room temperature (22°C). We also determined the strains survival on glass slides and in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 and 22°C, as well as the ability to form biofilms on a solid-liquid interphase. A rapid decrease in cell density (>4-log reduction over 8 days) of all five tested strains was observed on glass slides, while a slower die-off (<1-log reduction in 8 days) was observed in PBS. No significant difference in the die-off rate was observed among the five strains at 4 or 22°C. The die-off rate on the surface of mini cucumbers at 4°C was significantly slower ( P < 0.02) for Salmonella Enteritidis LMFS-S-JF-005 compared with the remaining four strains. At 22°C, Salmonella Poona S306 was able to grow by more than 1.5 log units on whole mini cucumbers over a period of 8 days, while the cell density of the other four strains remained at the same level compared with day 0. At this temperature, Salmonella Poona S306 was also able to form significantly stronger biofilms on a solid-liquid interphase ( P < 0.01) and was the only strain that presented a red, dry, and rough morphotype on Congo red agar plates, indicating the formation of both curli fimbriae and cellulose. These results revealed that the fate of Salmonella on mini cucumbers is strain specific, which highlighted the need for tailored mitigation strategies, such as the effective control of temperature and moisture for limiting the survival or growth of high-risk Salmonella strains between harvest and consumption of fresh produce.","authors":[{"name":"Aljosa Trmcic"},{"name":"Huihui Chen"},{"name":"Monika Trząskowska"},{"name":"Sandeep Tamber"},{"name":"Siyun Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cucumber"},{"word":"Produce"},{"word":"Salmonella"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"30324699","title":"Isolation and characterization of kurstakin and surfactin isoforms produced by Enterobacter cloacae C3 strain.","date":"2019-07-25","abs":"In this work, the extraction, structural analysis, and identification as well as antimicrobial, anti-adhesive, and antibiofilm activities of lipopeptides produced by Enterobacter cloacae C3 strain were studied.

Its environmental versatility is reflected in its ability to survive and grow within a broad temperature range as well as its capability to colonize and infect a wide range of hosts, including protozoa and humans.

Carrion, for example, is highly susceptible to microbial decomposers, but is kept palatable several days after an animal's death by carrion-feeding insects. Here we show that the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides preserves carrion by preventing the microbial succession associated with carrion decomposition, thus ensuring a high-quality resource for their developing larvae. Beetle-tended carcasses showed no signs of degradation and hosted a microbial community containing the beetles' gut microbiota, including the yeast Yarrowia In contrast, untended carcasses showed visual and olfactory signs of putrefaction, and their microbial community consisted of endogenous and soil-originating microbial decomposers. This regulation of the carcass' bacterial and fungal community and transcriptomic profile was associated with lower concentrations of putrescine and cadaverine (toxic polyamines associated with carcass putrefaction) and altered levels of proteases, lipases, and free amino acids. Beetle-tended carcasses develop a biofilm-like matrix housing the yeast, which, when experimentally removed, leads to reduced larval growth. Thus, tended carcasses hosted a mutualistic microbial community that promotes optimal larval development, likely through symbiont-mediated extraintestinal digestion and detoxification of carrion nutrients. The adaptive preservation of carrion coordinated by the beetles and their symbionts demonstrates a specialized resource-management strategy through which insects modify their habitats to enhance fitness.","authors":[{"name":"Shantanu P Shukla"},{"name":"Camila Plata"},{"name":"Michael Reichelt"},{"name":"Sandra Steiger"},{"name":"David G Heckel"},{"name":"Martin Kaltenpoth"},{"name":"Andreas Vilcinskas"},{"name":"Heiko Vogel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"fungus"},{"word":"gut microbiota"},{"word":"insect nutrition"},{"word":"resource competition"},{"word":"symbiosis"}]},"article311":{"pmid":"30322852","title":"Streptococcus mutans yidC1 and yidC2 Impact Cell Envelope Biogenesis, the Biofilm Matrix, and Biofilm Biophysical Properties.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Proper envelope biogenesis of Streptococcus mutans, a biofilm-forming and dental caries-causing oral pathogen, requires two paralogs (yidC1 and yidC2) of the universally conserved YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family of membrane integral chaperones and insertases.

Here, we determined whether the deletion of yidC affects cell surface properties, extracellular glucan production, and/or the structural organization of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix and biophysical properties of S. mutans biofilm. Compared to the wild type, the ΔyidC2 mutant lacked staining with fluorescent vancomycin at the division septum, while the ΔyidC1 mutant resembled the wild type. Additionally, the deletion of either yidC1 or yidC2 resulted in less insoluble glucan synthesis but produced more soluble glucans, especially at early and mid-exponential-growth phases. Alteration of glucan synthesis by both mutants yielded biofilms with less dry weight and insoluble EPS. In particular, the deletion of yidC2 resulted in a significant reduction in biofilm biomass and pronounced defects in the spatial organization of the EPS matrix, thus modifying the three-dimensional (3D) biofilm architecture. The defective biofilm harbored smaller bacterial clusters with high cell density and less surrounding EPS than those of the wild type, which was stiffer in compression yet more susceptible to removal by shear. Together, our results indicate that the elimination of either yidC paralog results in changes to the cell envelope and glucan production that ultimately disrupts biofilm development and EPS matrix structure/composition, thereby altering the physical properties of the biofilms and facilitating their removal.

A transconjugant of CPAC 15-QS with partial inactivation of N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) was obtained and several parameters were evaluated; in vitro, CPAC 15 and the transconjugant differed in growth, but not in biofilm formation, and no differences were observed in the symbiotic performance in vivo. The genome of CPAC 15 carries functional luxI and luxR genes and low amounts of three AHL molecules were detected: 3-OH-C12-AHL, 3-OH-C14-AHL, and 3-oxo-C14-AHL. Multiple copies of luxR-like genes, but not of luxI are present in the genomes of Ab-V5 and Ab-V6, and differences in gene expression were observed when the strains were co-cultured with B. japonicum; we may infer that the luxR-genes of A. brasilense may perceive the AHL molecules of B. japonicum.

In our previous study, Thr1 was identified as a CaCdc4‑associated protein using affinity purification. THR1 encodes a homoserine kinase, which is involved in the threonine biosynthesis pathway. The present study generated a strain with repressible CaCDC4 expression and continuous THR1 expression. Colony and cell morphology analyses, as well as immunoblotting, revealed that the Thr1 protein was detectable under conditions in which the expression of CaCDC4 was repressed and that the filaments resulting from the repressed expression of CaCDC4 were suppressed by the constitutive expression of THR1 in C. albicans. Additionally, by using the CaSAT1‑flipper method, the present study produced null mutants of THR1, GCN4, and CaCDC4. The phenotypic consequences were evaluated by growth curves, spotting assays, microscopic analysis, reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction and XTT‑based biofilm formation ability. The results revealed that fewer cells lacking THR1 entered the stationary phase but had no apparent morphological alteration. It was observed that the expression of THR1 was upregulated concurrently with GCN4 during nutrient depletion and that cells lacking GCN4 rescued the lethality of cells in the absence of THR1 in conditions accumulating homoserine in the threonine biosynthesis pathway. Of note, it was found that cells with either CaCDC4 or THR1 loss were sensitive to oxidative stress and osmotic stress, with those with THR1 loss being more sensitive. In addition, it was observed that cells with loss of either CaCDC4 or THR1 exhibited the ability to increase biofilm formation, with those lacking CaCDC4 exhibiting a greater extent of enhancement.

This study demonstrates the use of squaraine (SQ) dye as the photosensitive material, activated in the near-infrared tissue-transparent therapeutic window. The dye has been covalently attached to the ZnO nanoparticle surface, forming ZnO-SQ nanohybrids. The formation of the nanohybrids is confirmed using Fourier transform infrared and other optical spectroscopic methods. The photoinduced interfacial electron transfer process (as confirmed using the time-resolved fluorescence technique) from the excited state of SQ to the conduction band of ZnO is responsible for the greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation ability of the nanohybrid. The production of photoactivated ROS (especially singlet oxygen species) by ZnO-SQ provides remarkable antimicrobial action against clinically significant Staphylococcus aureus. Detailed investigations suggest synergistic involvement of cell membrane disruption and nanoparticle internalization followed by photoinduced intracellular ROS generation, which result in an unprecedented 95% bacterial killing activity by the nanohybrid. Moreover, the efficacy of the nanohybrid for disruption of bacterial biofilms has been examined. The electron microscopic images suggest significant bacterial cell death following structural alteration and reduced adherence property of the biofilms. Nanodimension-driven greater internalization of ZnO-SQ followed by an improved dissolution of ZnO in an acidic environment of the biofilm as well as red-light-driven interfacial charge separation and ROS generation improves the efficacy of the material for biofilm destruction. An artificial medical implant mimicking titanium sheets coated with ZnO-SQ depicts light-triggered disruption in the adherence property of matured biofilms. The cytotoxicity and hemolysis assays show inherent biocompatibility of the photoactive nanohybrid.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that c-di-AMP was degraded to phosphoadenylyl adenosine (pApA) by truncated recombinant GdpP, and pApA was cleaved by recombinant DhhP to yield AMP. In-frame deletion mutants lacking the dhhP gene (ΔdhhP) and both the gdpP and dhhP genes (ΔgdpPΔdhhP) displayed significantly more biofilm formation than the wild-type and a mutant strain lacking the gdpP gene (ΔgdpP; p < 0.01). Furthermore, biofilm formation was restored to the level of the wild type strain upon complementation with dhhP. Optical and electron microscopy observations revealed that ΔdhhP and ΔgdpPΔdhhP mutants self-aggregated into large cell clumps, correlated with increased biofilm formation, but cell clumps were not observed in cultures of wild-type, ΔgdpP, or strains complemented with gdpP and dhhP. Thus, deletion of dhhP presumably leads to the formation of bacterial cell aggregates and a subsequent increase in biofilm production.","authors":[{"name":"Hiroyasu Konno"},{"name":"Yasuo Yoshida"},{"name":"Keiji Nagano"},{"name":"Jun Takebe"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Hasegawa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cyclic di-AMP"},{"word":"pApA"},{"word":"phosphodiesterase"}]},"article327":{"pmid":"30319565","title":"Flor Yeast Diversity and Dynamics in Biologically Aged Wines.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Wine biological aging is characterized by the development of yeast strains that form a biofilm on the wine surface after alcoholic fermentation.

Our results highlight that different strains of Saccharomyces are present in these velums. Unexpectedly, in the same velum, flor yeast strain succession occurred during aging, supporting the assumption that environmental changes are responsible for these shifts. Despite numerous sample wine analyses, very few flor yeasts could be isolated from wine following alcoholic fermentation, suggesting that flor yeast development results from the colonization of yeast present in the aging cellar. We analyzed the FLO11 and ICR1 sequence of different S. cerevisiae strains in order to understand how the same strain of S. cerevisiae could form various types of biofilm. Among the strains analyzed, some were heterozygote at the FLO11 locus, while others presented two different alleles of ICR1 (wild type and a 111 bp deletion).

Initial phenotypic characterization of the TM7x-associated XH001 co-culture revealed enhanced biofilm formation in the presence of TM7x compared to XH001 as monoculture. Genomic analysis and previously published transcriptomic profiling of XH001 also revealed the presence of a putative AI-2 quorum sensing (QS) operon, which was highly upregulated upon association of TM7x with XH001. This analysis revealed that the most highly induced gene in XH001 was an lsrB ortholog, which encodes a putative periplasmic binding protein for the auto inducer (AI)-2 QS signaling molecule. Further genomic analyses suggested the lsrB operon in XH001 is a putative hybrid AI-2/ribose transport operon as well as the existence of a luxS ortholog, which encodes the AI-2 synthase. In this study, the potential role of AI-2 QS in the epibiotic-parasitic relationship between XH001 and TM7x in the context of biofilm formation was investigated. A genetic system for XH001 was developed to generate lsrB and luxS gene deletion mutants in XH001. Phenotypic characterization demonstrated that deletion mutations in either lsrB or luxS did not affect XH001's growth dynamic, mono-species biofilm formation capability, nor its ability to associate with TM7x. TM7x association with XH001 induced lsrB gene expression in a luxS-dependent manner. Intriguingly, unlike wild type XH001, which displayed significantly increased biofilm formation upon establishing the epibiotic-parasitic relationship with TM7x, XH001ΔlsrB, and XH001ΔluxS mutants failed to achieve enhanced biofilm formation when associated with TM7x.

Domestic cats with varying degrees of gingivitis naturally were enrolled in this study. Subgroups of animals were treated twice daily for one week with or without ketotifen fumarate (5 mg/kg). Effects of ketotifen fumarate were measured on gingival index, cells accumulation, mediators release, receptor-ligand interaction, oxidative stress, MAPK and NF-κB pathways, epithelial barrier and apoptosis. Ketotifen fumarate attenuated the initiation and progression of gingivitis, inhibited the infiltrations of mast cells, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils as well as the release of IgE, β-hexosaminidase, tryptase, chymase, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-13, influenced endothelial cells, fibroblasts and epithelial cells proliferation and apoptosis, and induced Th2 cells polarization, where ketotifen fumarate also might affect their interactions. Ketotifen fumarate reduced the oxidative stress, and inhibited NF-κB and p38 MAPK related with mast cells and macrophages accumulation. Ketotifen fumarate improved the aberrant expression of ZO-1 and inhibits the following apoptosis. On the other hand, these cells and mediators augmented functional attributes of them involving SCF/c-Kit, α4β7/VCAM-1 and IL-8/IL-8RB interactions, thus creating a positive feedback loop to perpetuate gingivitis, where an inflammation microenvironment was modeled.

The LL-37-inspired lead peptide SAAP-148 was combined with antibiotics of different classes against Staphylococcus aureus, and showed synergy with teicoplanin. Synergy with teicoplanin was also observed with LL-37, the LL-37-inspired SAAP-276 and the TC-1-inspired TC84. Interestingly, no synergy was observed against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Furthermore, teicoplanin combined with SAAP-148 or SAAP-276 showed strong interaction against S. aureus biofilms. The dltABCD operon and the mprF gene in S. aureus conferred resistance to LL-37, but SAAP-148 proved to be indifferently potent against wild-type, ΔdltA and ΔmprF S. aureus strains. When used alone, relatively high concentrations of both LL-37 and teicoplanin (30-120 µM and 4-32 mg/L, respectively) were required to kill S. aureus. Resistance to LL-37 in S. aureus was overcome by combined use of teicoplanin and LL-37.

Bacteria biosynthesize NulOs among which are several related prokaryotic-specific isomers and one of which, N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), is common among all vertebrates. Bacteria display various NulO carbohydrates on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the identities of these molecules tune host-pathogen recognition mechanisms. The opportunistic bacterial pathogen Vibrio vulnificus possesses the genes for NulO biosynthesis; however, the structures and functions of the V. vulnificus NulO glycan are unknown. Using genetic and chemical approaches, we show here that the major NulO produced by a clinical V. vulnificus strain CMCP6 is 5-N-acetyl-7-N-acetyl-d-alanyl-legionaminic acid (Leg5Ac7AcAla). The CMCP6 strain could catabolize modified legionaminic acid, whereas V. vulnificus strain YJ016 produced but did not catabolize a NulO without the N-acetyl-d-alanyl modification. In silico analysis suggested that Leg5Ac7AcAla biosynthesis follows a noncanonical pathway but appears to be present in several bacterial species. Leg5Ac7AcAla contributed to bacterial outer-membrane integrity, as mutant strains unable to produce or incorporate Leg5Ac7AcAla into the LPS have increased membrane permeability, sensitivity to bile salts and antimicrobial peptides, and defects in biofilm formation. Using the crustacean model, Artemia franciscana, we demonstrate that Leg5Ac7AcAla-deficient bacteria have decreased virulence potential compared with WT. Our data indicate that different V. vulnificus strains produce multiple NulOs and that the modified legionaminic acid Leg5Ac7AcAla plays a critical role in the physiology, survivability, and pathogenicity of V. vulnificus CMCP6.","authors":[{"name":"Nathan D McDonald"},{"name":"Kristen E DeMeester"},{"name":"Amanda L Lewis"},{"name":"Catherine Leimkuhler Grimes"},{"name":"E Fidelma Boyd"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio vulnificus"},{"word":"bacterial cell wall"},{"word":"carbohydrate biosynthesis"},{"word":"carbohydrate structure"},{"word":"glycan"},{"word":"glycosylation"},{"word":"legionaminic acid"},{"word":"lipopolysaccharide (LPS)"},{"word":"nonulosonic acid"},{"word":"sialic acid"}]},"article344":{"pmid":"30314500","title":"An update on gastrointestinal endoscopy-associated infections and their contributing factors.","date":"2019-03-14","abs":"During clinical use, gastrointestinal endoscopes are grossly contaminated with patient's native flora.

Microorganisms that are able to produce biofilms are currently recognized as a threat to human health. Areas covered: Many strategies have been employed to eradicate biofilms, but several drawbacks from these methods had subsequently raised concerns on the need for alternative approaches to effectively prevent biofilm formation. One of the main mechanisms that drives a microorganism to transit from a planktonic to a biofilm-sessile state, is oxidative stress. Chemical agents that could target oxidative stress regulators, for instance antioxidants, could therefore be used to treat biofilm-associated infections. Expert commentary: The focus of this review is to summarize the function and limitation of the current anti-biofilm strategies and will propose the use of antioxidants as an alternative method to treat, prevent and eradicate biofilms. Studies have shown that water-soluble and lipid-soluble antioxidants can reduce and prevent biofilm formation, by influencing the expression of genes associated with oxidative stress. Further in vivo work should be conducted to ensure the efficacy of these antioxidants in a biological environment. Nevertheless, antioxidants are promising anti-biofilm agents, and thus is a potential solution for biofilm-associated infections in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Kuan Shion Ong"},{"name":"Christina Injan Mawang"},{"name":"Delhousie Daniel-Jambun"},{"name":"Yau Yan Lim"},{"name":"Sui Mae Lee"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antioxidants"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"hydrogen peroxide"},{"word":"natural products"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"reactive oxygen species"}]},"article367":{"pmid":"30308085","title":"Highly Efficient Synthesis and Assay of Protein-Imprinted Nanogels by Using Magnetic Templates.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"We report an approach integrating the synthesis of protein-imprinted nanogels (plastic antibodies) with a highly sensitive assay employing templates attached to magnetic carriers.

The progression to this pathogenic lifestyle is preceded by asymptomatic colonization of the nasopharynx. This colonization is associated with biofilm formation; the competence pathway influences the structure and stability of biofilms. However, the molecules that link the competence pathway to biofilm formation are unknown. Here, we describe a new competence-induced gene, called briC, and demonstrate that its product promotes biofilm development and stimulates colonization in a murine model. We show that expression of briC is induced by the master regulator of competence, ComE. Whereas briC does not substantially influence early biofilm development on abiotic surfaces, it significantly impacts later stages of biofilm development. Specifically, briC expression leads to increases in biofilm biomass and thickness at 72h. Consistent with the role of biofilms in colonization, briC promotes nasopharyngeal colonization in the murine model. The function of BriC appears to be conserved across pneumococci, as comparative genomics reveal that briC is widespread across isolates. Surprisingly, many isolates, including strains from clinically important PMEN1 and PMEN14 lineages, which are widely associated with colonization, encode a long briC promoter. This long form captures an instance of genomic plasticity and functions as a competence-independent expression enhancer that may serve as a precocious point of entry into this otherwise competence-regulated pathway. Moreover, overexpression of briC by the long promoter fully rescues the comE-deletion induced biofilm defect in vitro, and partially in vivo. These findings indicate that BriC may bypass the influence of competence in biofilm development and that such a pathway may be active in a subset of pneumococcal lineages. In conclusion, BriC is a part of the complex molecular network that connects signaling of the competence pathway to biofilm development and colonization.","authors":[{"name":"Surya D Aggarwal"},{"name":"Rory Eutsey"},{"name":"Jacob West-Roberts"},{"name":"Arnau Domenech"},{"name":"Wenjie Xu"},{"name":"Iman Tajer Abdullah"},{"name":"Aaron P Mitchell"},{"name":"Jan-Willem Veening"},{"name":"Hasan Yesilkaya"},{"name":"N Luisa Hiller"}],"keywords":[]},"article369":{"pmid":"30308037","title":"Effects of the nitric oxide releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel on pulp-dentin regeneration: Pilot study.","date":"2019-06-10","abs":"Successful disinfection alongside complete endodontic tissue regeneration and revascularization are the most desired clinical outcomes of regenerative endodontics.

We show how streambed roughness and related features promote growth-related trait diversity and the recovery of biofilms towards carrying capacity (CC) and spatial resilience. At the scale of streambed landscapes, roughness and exposure to water flow promoted biofilm CC and growth trait diversity. Structural equation modelling identified roughness, post-disturbance biomass and a 'neighbourhood effect' to drive biofilm CC. Our findings suggest that the environment selecting for adaptive capacities prior to disturbance (that is, memory effects) and biofilm connectivity into spatial networks (that is, mobile links) contribute to the spatial resilience of biofilms in streambed landscapes.

Within biofilms of enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella species, the main component of the biofilm is amyloid curli. Other constituents include cellulose, extracellular DNA, O antigen, and various surface proteins, including BapA. Only recently, the roles of these components in the formation of the enteric biofilm individually and in consortium have been evaluated. In addition to enhancing the stability and strength of the matrix, the components of the enteric biofilm influence bacterial virulence and transmission. Most notably, certain components of the matrix are recognized as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Systemic recognition of enteric biofilms leads to the activation of several proinflammatory innate immune receptors, including the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/TLR1/CD14 heterocomplex, TLR9, and NLRP3. In the model of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the immune response to curli is site specific. Although a proinflammatory response is generated upon systemic presentation of curli, oral administration of curli ameliorates the damaged intestinal epithelial barrier and reduces the severity of colitis. Furthermore, curli (and extracellular DNA) of enteric biofilms potentiate the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and promote the fibrillization of the pathogenic amyloid α-synuclein, which is implicated in Parkinson's disease. Homologues of curli-encoding genes are found in four additional bacterial phyla, suggesting that the biomedical implications involved with enteric biofilms are applicable to numerous bacterial species.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah A Tursi"},{"name":"Çagla Tükel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterobacteriaceae"},{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium"},{"word":"Toll-like receptors"},{"word":"amyloid"},{"word":"autoimmunity"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"curli"},{"word":"extracellular DNA"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"neurodegenerative diseases"}]},"article376":{"pmid":"30305150","title":"Evaluation of methods to detect in vitro biofilm formation by staphylococcal clinical isolates.","date":"2018-12-31","abs":"Staphylococcus genus comprising both Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) are widely distributed in nature and can infect diversity of hosts.

Previous studies showed that EPS-degrading enzymes increase staphylococcal biocide susceptibility in vitro and in vivo, and decrease virulence in animal models. In the present study we tested the effect of EPS-degrading enzymes on staphylococcal skin colonization and povidone iodine susceptibility using a novel in vivo pig model that enabled us to colonize and treat 96 isolated areas of skin on a single animal in vivo. To quantitate skin colonization, punch biopsies of colonized areas were homogenized, diluted, and plated on agar for colony forming unit enumeration. Skin was colonized with either Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus. Two EPS-degrading enzymes, DNase I and the PNAG-degrading enzyme dispersin B, were employed. Enzymes were tested for their ability to inhibit skin colonization and detach preattached bacteria. The effect of enzymes on the susceptibility of preattached S. aureus to killing by povidone iodine was also measured. We found that dispersin B significantly inhibited skin colonization by S. epidermidis and detached preattached S. epidermidis cells from skin. A cocktail of dispersin B and DNase I detached preattached S. aureus cells from skin and increased their susceptibility to killing by povidone iodine. These findings suggest that staphylococcal EPS components such as eDNA and PNAG contribute to skin colonization and biocide resistance in vivo. EPS-degrading enzymes may be a useful adjunct to conventional skin antisepsis procedures in order to further reduce skin bioburden.","authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey B Kaplan"},{"name":"Kevin D Mlynek"},{"name":"Hashani Hettiarachchi"},{"name":"Yonas A Alamneh"},{"name":"Lionel Biggemann"},{"name":"Daniel V Zurawski"},{"name":"Chad C Black"},{"name":"Charles E Bane"},{"name":"Robert K Kim"},{"name":"Mark S Granick"}],"keywords":[]},"article385":{"pmid":"30304017","title":"Educational outcomes of a new curriculum on interproximal oral prophylaxis for dental students.","date":"2019-03-19","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a preclinical oral prophylaxis education program by examining the effectiveness of the teaching module on changes to the students' attitudes towards their individual hygiene behaviors with interdental brushes (IDBs).","authors":[{"name":"Denis Bourgeois"},{"name":"Ina Saliasi"},{"name":"Claude Dussart"},{"name":"Juan Carlos Llodra"},{"name":"Delphine Tardivo"},{"name":"Laurent Laforest"},{"name":"Manuel Bravo"},{"name":"Stéphane Viennot"},{"name":"Bruno Foti"},{"name":"Florence Carrouel"}],"keywords":[]},"article386":{"pmid":"30304005","title":"Influence of the use of complete denture adhesives on microbial adhesion and biofilm formation by single- and mixed-species.","date":"2019-03-07","abs":"To verify whether the Ultra Corega Cream and Corega Strip Denture Adhesive adhesives interfere in the microbial adhesion and biofilm formation by Candida albicans and Lactobacillus casei in single- and mixed-species settings, and observe whether synergistic or antagonistic relationships between these species occur.","authors":[{"name":"Norberto Martins de Oliveira Junior"},{"name":"Danny Omar Mendoza Marin"},{"name":"Andressa Rosa Perin Leite"},{"name":"Ana Carolina Pero"},{"name":"Marlise Inêz Klein"},{"name":"Marco Antonio Compagnoni"}],"keywords":[]},"article387":{"pmid":"30303560","title":"Chemical biofilm removal capacity of endodontic irrigants as a function of biofilm structure: optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy and viscoelasticity determination as integrated assessment tools.","date":"2019-10-29","abs":"To investigate the influence of biofilm structure on the biofilm removal capacity of endodontic irrigants and to study changes in the architecture of the remaining biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"F H Busanello"},{"name":"X Petridis"},{"name":"M V R So"},{"name":"R J B Dijkstra"},{"name":"P K Sharma"},{"name":"L W M van der Sluis"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"irrigants"},{"word":"optical coherence tomography"},{"word":"removal"},{"word":"structure"},{"word":"viscoelasticity"}]},"article388":{"pmid":"30302953","title":"Infection Source and Epidemiology of Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Lung Disease.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous organisms that are generally found not only in the natural environment but also in the human engineered environment, including water, soil, and dust. These organisms can form biofilms and can be readily aerosolized because they are hydrophobic owing to the presence of the lipid-rich outer membrane. Aerosolization and subsequent inhalation were the major route of NTM lung disease. Water distribution systems and household plumbing are ideal habit for NTM and the main transmission route from natural water to household. NTM have been isolated from drinking water, faucets, pipelines, and water tanks. Studies that used genotyping have shown that NTM isolates from patients are identical to those in the environment, that is, from shower water, showerheads, tap water, and gardening soil. Humans are likely to be exposed to NTM in their homes through simple and daily activities, such as drinking, showering, or gardening. In addition to environmental factors, host factors play an important role in the development of NTM lung disease. The incidence and prevalence of NTM lung disease are increasing worldwide, and this disease is rapidly becoming a major public health problem. NTM lung disease is associated with substantially impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, and high medical costs. A more comprehensive understanding of the infection source and epidemiology of NTM is essential for the development of new strategies that can prevent and control NTM infection.","authors":[{"name":"Doosoo Jeon"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Epidemiology"},{"word":"Lung Diseases"},{"word":"Nontuberculous Mycobacteria"}]},"article389":{"pmid":"30302271","title":"Rhamnolipids from Pseudomonas aeruginosa disperse the biofilms of sulfate-reducing bacteria.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilm formation is an important problem for many industries. Desulfovibrio vulgaris is the representative sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) which causes metal corrosion in oil wells and drilling equipment, and the corrosion is related to its biofilm formation. Biofilms are extremely difficult to remove since the cells are cemented in a polymer matrix. In an effort to eliminate SRB biofilms, we examined the ability of supernatants from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 to disperse SRB biofilms. We found that the P. aeruginosa supernatants dispersed more than 98% of the biofilm. To determine the biochemical basis of this SRB biofilm dispersal, we examined a series of P. aeruginosa mutants and found that mutants rhlA, rhlB, rhlI, and rhlR, defective in rhamnolipids production, had significantly reduced levels of SRB biofilm dispersal. Corroborating these results, purified rhamnolipids dispersed SRB biofilms, and rhamnolipids were detected in the P. aeruginosa supernatants. Hence, P. aeruginosa supernatants disperse SRB biofilms via rhamnolipids. To determine the genetic basis of how the P. aeruginosa supernatants disperse SRB biofilms, a whole transcriptomic analysis was conducted (RNA-seq); based on this analysis, we identified four proteins (DVUA0018, DVUA0034, DVUA0066, and DVUA0084) of the D. vulgaris megaplasmid that influence biofilm formation, with production of DVUA0066 (a putative phospholipase) reducing biofilm formation 5.6-fold. In addition, the supernatants of P. aeruginosa dispersed the SRB biofilms more readily than protease in M9 glucose minimum medium and were also effective against biofilms of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.","authors":[{"name":"Thammajun L Wood"},{"name":"Ting Gong"},{"name":"Lei Zhu"},{"name":"James Miller"},{"name":"Daniel S Miller"},{"name":"Bei Yin"},{"name":"Thomas K Wood"}],"keywords":[]},"article390":{"pmid":"30302161","title":"Morphology of Helicobacter pylori as a result of peptidoglycan and cytoskeleton rearrangements.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium colonising the gastric mucosa. Normally, this bacterium has a spiral shape, which is crucial for proper colonisation of the stomach and cork-screwing penetration of dense mucin covering this organ. However, H. pylori may also form curved/straight rods, filamentous forms and coccoid forms. This morphological variability affects nutrient transport and respiration processes, as well as motility, the ability to form aggregates/biofilms, and resistance to adverse environmental factors. For this reason, a more accurate understanding of the molecular determinants that control the morphology of H. pylori seems to be crucial in increasing the effectiveness of antibacterial therapies directed against this microorganism. This article focuses on the molecular factors responsible for peptidoglycan and cytoskeleton rearrangements affecting H. pylori morphology and survivability. In addition, the existence of proteins associated with modifications of H. pylori morphology as potential targets in therapies reducing the virulence of this bacterium has been suggested.","authors":[{"name":"Paweł Krzyżek"},{"name":"Grażyna Gościniak"}],"keywords":[{"word":"coccoid form"},{"word":"filamentous form"},{"word":"murein"},{"word":"shape"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"30301945","title":"Decision-making of the benthic diatom Seminavis robusta searching for inorganic nutrients and pheromones.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Microorganisms encounter a diversity of chemical stimuli that trigger individual responses and influence population dynamics.

Benthic marine diatoms that react to sexual attractants as well as to nutrient gradients face such multiple constraints. Here, we document and model behavioral complexity and context-sensitive responses of these motile unicellular algae to sex pheromones and the nutrient silicate. Throughout the life cycle of the model diatom Seminavis robusta nutrient-starved cells localize sources of silicate by combined chemokinetic and chemotactic motility. However, with an increasing need for sex to restore the initial cell size, a change in behavior favoring the attraction-pheromone-guided search for a mating partner takes place. When sex becomes inevitable to prevent cell death, safeguard mechanisms are abandoned, and cells prioritize the search for mating partners. Such selection processes help to explain biofilm organization and to understand species interactions in complex communities.","authors":[{"name":"Karen Grace V Bondoc"},{"name":"Christine Lembke"},{"name":"Stefan N Lang"},{"name":"Sebastian Germerodt"},{"name":"Stefan Schuster"},{"name":"Wim Vyverman"},{"name":"Georg Pohnert"}],"keywords":[]},"article392":{"pmid":"30301629","title":"Bacterial Deoxyribonucleic Acid Is Often Present in Failed Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructions.","date":"2019-10-07","abs":"To determine whether bacterial DNA will be detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in torn graft tissue at the time of revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).","authors":[{"name":"Joshua S Everhart"},{"name":"Alex C DiBartola"},{"name":"Devendra H Dusane"},{"name":"Robert A Magnussen"},{"name":"Christopher C Kaeding"},{"name":"Paul Stoodley"},{"name":"David C Flanigan"}],"keywords":[]},"article393":{"pmid":"30301180","title":"Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Activity and Mode of Action of Magainin 2 against Drug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.","date":"2019-01-28","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising therapeutic agents for treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

The SSIs are the leading cause of health-care-associated infection (HAI) in industrialized Western nations. Patients in whom an SSI develops require longer hospitalization, incur significantly greater treatment costs and reduction in quality of life, and after selective surgical procedures experience higher mortality rates. Effective infection prevention and control requires the concept of the SSI care bundle, which is composed of a defined number of evidence-based interventional strategies, because of the many risk factors that can contribute to the development of an SSI. Intra-operative irrigation has been a mainstay of surgical practice for well over 100 years, but lacks standardization and compelling evidence-based data to validate its efficacy. In an era of antibiotic stewardship, with a widespread prevalence of bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotic agents, there has emerged an interest in using intra-operative antiseptic irrigation to reduce microbial contamination in the surgical site before closure and possibly reduce the need for antibiotic agents. This approach has gained added appeal in an era of biomedical device implantation, especially with the recognition that most, if not all, device-related infections are associated with biofilm formation.
