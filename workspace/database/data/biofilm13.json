Methane has been proposed as a promising electron donor to remove perchlorate from contaminated water, yet it is unclear whether and how microbial methane oxidation couples with perchlorate reduction, in particular under anoxic conditions. Here, the feasibility and performance of perchlorate reduction driven by methane in the presence and absence of oxygen were investigated and compared in a lab-scale methane-based membrane biofilm reactor. Long-term operational performance suggested that perchlorate was reduced to chloride, with 4 mg Cl/L/d of perchlorate removal rate under anoxic conditions. Differently, perchlorate removal rate increased to 16 mg Cl/L/d, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were produced from methane partial oxidation when a limited oxygen (10 mg/L/d) was externally supplied. Regardless of oxygen conditions, microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane might be mediated through synergistic interactions by a microbial consortium, but with different key microbial members under both oxygen regimes. Under anoxic conditions, aerobic methanotrophs (likely Methylocystaceae and Methylococcaceae) might micro-aerobically oxidize methane by utilizing internal oxygen from microbial perchlorate reduction, which might be mediated by Rhodocyclaceae. In contrast, under oxygen-limiting conditions, methanogens (e.g., Methanosarcina) and fermenters (e.g., Veillonellaceae) likely jointly converted methane into VFAs, then dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria (e.g., Rhodocyclaceae) utilized the produced VFAs to reduce perchlorate to chloride. Our findings provide evidence to link methane oxidation with perchlorate reduction under both oxygen regimes, which could be facilitated to design a process to remove perchlorate from groundwater.","authors":[{"name":"Mengxiong Wu"},{"name":"Jing-Huan Luo"},{"name":"Shihu Hu"},{"name":"Zhiguo Yuan"},{"name":"Jianhua Guo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Membrane biofilm reactor"},{"word":"Methane oxidation"},{"word":"Perchlorate reduction"},{"word":"Volatile fatty acids"}]},"article7":{"pmid":"30995521","title":"The photo-activated and photo-thermal effect of the 445/970 nm diode laser on the mixed biofilm inside root canals of human teeth in vitro: A pilot study.","date":"2020-01-15","abs":"1) Evaluation of the photo-thermal (PT) and photo-activated (PAD) antibacterial effect of the 445/970 nm diode laser on E. faecalis, S. aureus and C. albicans mixed biofilms grown together inside root canals of human teeth. 2) Defining a potentially efficient clinical protocol for safe and predictable usage in endodontic procedures.","authors":[{"name":"Ivan Katalinić"},{"name":"Ana Budimir"},{"name":"Zrinka Bošnjak"},{"name":"Suzana Jakovljević"},{"name":"Ivica Anić"}],"keywords":[{"word":"445 nm"},{"word":"970 nm"},{"word":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"Diode laser"},{"word":"Endodontics"},{"word":"PAD"}]},"article8":{"pmid":"30995049","title":"Extracellular DNA Provides Structural Integrity to a Micrococcus luteus Biofilm.","date":"2020-03-18","abs":"Force spectroscopy was used to show that extracellular DNA (eDNA) has a pre-eminent structural role in a biofilm.

To explore the mechanisms of sludge acidification deeply and provide a theoretical basis for practical application, sewage sludge was repeatedly treated by acidification conditioning. The sludge pH was continuously adjusted from 7.0 to 3.0, then back to 7.0, and to 3.0 again in this study. When the sludge pH returned to a neutral condition, the sludge dewaterability was further deteriorated. However, after the second acidification conditioning, the sludge dewaterability was improved to the same level as that at the first conditioning. These experimental facts were due to two acidification effects. One was that acidification can efficiently destroy the structure of sludge flocs, thereby causing the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) and release of trapped water. Furthermore, some internal EPSs were released into the outer layer. The other was protonation effect, which can effectively compress the released EPSs, especially protein-like matters (PN) therein. These two combined effects caused a good sludge dewaterability. However, the former was irreversible, whereas the latter was reversible. When the pH of acidified sludge was readjusted to 7.0, the protonation effect weakened, thereby the original compressed EPS released into the outer layer of sludge and the PN content in soluble EPS fraction increased near five times, resulting in considerable deterioration of sludge dewaterability. The negative effects of released organic matters by acidification were often concealed and neglected due to protonation, thereby causing the reversal of dewatering performance in practice when the sludge pH was fluctuated.","authors":[{"name":"Hua Wei"},{"name":"Yunong Tang"},{"name":"Aimin Li"},{"name":"Hu Yang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acidification"},{"word":"Dewatering mechanism"},{"word":"Dewatering of sludge"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"Protonation effect"},{"word":"pH repeated adjustment"}]},"article19":{"pmid":"30991199","title":"Mechanism analysis to improve sludge dewaterability during anaerobic digestion based on moisture distribution.","date":"2019-07-10","abs":"Previous studies have demonstrated that anaerobic digestion (AD) enhances sludge dewaterability.

In this study, moisture distribution and bond energy were used to evaluate the influence of AD on sludge dewaterability. The change from free moisture (FM) to mechanically bound moisture (MBM) was analysed, along with degradation of organic fractions in extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) of the sludge during AD. Results indicated that the AD process, with a 41.9% reduction in volatile solids (VS) and cumulative methane production of 283.2 mL/g VS, improved sludge dewaterability by disintegrating macro-molecular organic matter into micro-molecular matter. MBM reduction reached 7% in 40 days. Correlations between FM/MBM and extracellular protein (extra-PN) were significant (R = -0.861, p < 0.01; R = 0.869, p < 0.01). Therefore, it can be concluded that the degradation of protein in the extra-microcolony polymer (EMPS) layer results in the destruction of the bond between organic fractions and moisture. As a result, the release of mechanically bound moisture is accelerated. In addition, the moisture content, as well as the extra-PN, continued to vary when AD entered the stabilisation stage, that is, the destruction of protein in EMPS stimulated mechanically bound moisture release during AD.

It has been suggested that the mediators of inflammation and leukocyte cells participate in the destruction of native and prosthetic tissues due to an IE pathogens inaccessibility for immunocompetent cells.","authors":[{"name":"V V Rogolevich"},{"name":"T V Glushkova"},{"name":"A V Ponasenko"},{"name":"E A Ovcharenko"}],"keywords":[]},"article24":{"pmid":"30989957","title":"[Mechanism of butyl alcohol extract of Baitouweng Decoction (BAEB) on Candida albicans biofilms based on pH signal pathway].","date":"2019-08-05","abs":"This study aimed to investigate the effect of butyl alcohol extract of Baitouweng Decoction( BAEB) on Candida albicans biofilms based on pH signal pathway. The morphology of biofilms of the pH mutants was observed by scanning electron microscope. The biofilm thickness of the pH mutants was measured by CLSM. The biofilm activity of the pH mutants was analyzed by microplate reader.The biofilm damage of the pH mutants was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of pH mutant biofilm-related genes was detected by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the deletion of PHR1 gene resulted in the defect of biofilm,but there were more substrates for PHR1 complementation. BAEB had no significant effect on the two strains. RIM101 gene deletion or complementation did not cause significant structural damage,but after BAEB treatment,the biofilms of both strains were significantly inhibited. For the biofilm thickness,PHR1 deletion or complementation caused the thickness to decrease,after BAEB treatment,the thickness of the two strains did not change significantly. However,RIM101 gene deletion or complementation had little effect on the thickness,and the thickness of the two strains became thinner after adding BAEB. For biofilm activity,PHR1 deletion or complementation and RIM101 deletion resulted in decreased activity,RIM101 complementation did not change significantly; BAEB significantly inhibited biofilm activity of PHR1 deletion,PHR1 complemetation,RIM101 deletion and RIM101 complemetation strains. For the biofilm damage,PHR1 gene deletion or complementation,RIM101 gene deletion or complementation all showed different degrees of damage; after adding BAEB,the damage rate of PHR1 deletion or complementation was not significantly different,but the damage rate of RIM101 deletion or complementation was significantly increased. Except to the up-regulation of HSP90 gene expression,ALS3,SUN41,HWP1,UME6 and PGA10 genes of PHR1 deletion,PHR1 complementation,RIM101 deletion,and RIM101 complementation strains showed a downward expression trend.

For that purpose, Sprague Dawley rats were administered the QBM, the Wu Wei Xiao Du Wan drink (WXD) and cefoperazone (Cef) prior to drug isolation from serum. Vibrio harveyi BB170 was employed as a reporter strain to detect the AI-2 signaling pathway in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The level of inflammation was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biofilm formation and the number of macrophages were detected by immunofluorescence. The results revealed that the QBM could reduce the concentration of AI-2 derived from Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and markedly increase the levels of HIF-1α, HIF-2α and VEGF in chronic and refractory wounds. The QBM strongly inhibited the formation of bacterial biofilms and the number of macrophages, therefore promoting wound healing. In conclusion, the QBM could inhibit the biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa through decreasing the levels of AI-2 while upregulating the expression of HIF-1α, HIF-2α and HIF-3α, which increased the levels of VEGF, thereby promoting angiogenesis and wound healing in chronic and refractory wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Wei Shan"},{"name":"Yunfei Wang"},{"name":"Zhen Zhang"},{"name":"Jie Xing"},{"name":"Jienan Xu"},{"name":"Wen Xiao"},{"name":"Yiting Shen"},{"name":"Shuyu Guo"},{"name":"Huafa Que"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Qingre Baidu mixture"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"autoinducer-2"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article28":{"pmid":"30988505","title":"Engineered toxin-intein antimicrobials can selectively target and kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria in mixed populations.","date":"2019-11-06","abs":"Targeted killing of pathogenic bacteria without harming beneficial members of host microbiota holds promise as a strategy to cure disease and limit both antimicrobial-related dysbiosis and development of antimicrobial resistance.

Genome sequencing and analysis identified 4608 coding sequences along with several elements of horizontal gene transfer, insertion sequences, transposases and integrated phages, which add to its genetic diversity. Many genes coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes, including the enzymes responsible for woody biomass hydrolysis in termite gut, were identified in P. polymyxa A18 genome.

To further identify genomic regions unique to this strain, a BLAST-based comparative analysis with the sequenced genomes of 47 members belonging to genus Paenibacillus was carried out. Unique regions coding for nucleic acid modifying enzymes like CRISPR/Cas and Type I Restriction-Modification enzymes were identified in P. polymyxa A18 genome suggesting the presence of defense mechanism to combat viral infections in the gut. In addition, genes responsible for the formation of biofilms, such as Type IV pili and adhesins, which might be assisting P. polymyxa A18 in colonizing the gut were also identified in its genome.

A previous study showed that S. flexneri forms biofilms in the presence of bile salts, through an unknown mechanism. Here, we investigated the potential role of adhesin-like autotransporter proteins in S. flexneri biofilm formation. BLAST search analysis revealed that the S. flexneri 2457T genome harbors 4 genes, S1242, S1289, S2406, and icsA, encoding adhesin-like autotransporter proteins.

Phenotypic analysis of the mutant strains revealed that disruption of icsA abolished bile salt-induced biofilm formation. IcsA is an outer membrane protein secreted at the bacterial pole that is required for S. flexneri actin-based motility during intracellular infection. In extracellular biofilms, IcsA was also secreted at the bacterial pole and mediated bacterial cell-cell contacts and aggregative growth in the presence of bile salts. Dissecting individual roles of bile salts showed that deoxycholate is a robust biofilm inducer compared to cholate. The release of the extracellular domain of IcsA through IcsP-mediated cleavage was greater in the presence of cholate, suggesting that the robustness of biofilm formation was inversely correlated with IcsA processing.

While much is known about the process of dispersion cue perception and the subsequent modulation of the c-di-GMP pool, little is known about subsequent events resulting in the release of cells from the biofilm. Given that dispersion coincides with void formation and an overall erosion of the biofilm structure, we asked whether dispersion involves degradation of the biofilm matrix. Here, we focused on extracellular genomic DNA (eDNA) due to its almost universal presence in the matrix of biofilm-forming species. We identified two probable nucleases, endA and eddB, and eddA encoding a phosphatase that were significantly increased in transcript abundance in dispersed cells. However, only inactivation of endA but not eddA or eddB impaired dispersion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in response to glutamate and nitric oxide (NO). Heterologously produced EndA was found to be secreted and active in degrading genomic DNA. While endA inactivation had little effect on biofilm formation and the presence of eDNA in biofilms, eDNA degradation upon induction of dispersion was impaired. In contrast, induction of endA expression coincided with eDNA degradation and resulted in biofilm dispersion. Thus, released cells demonstrated a hyperattaching phenotype but remained as resistant to tobramycin as biofilm cells from which they egress, indicating EndA-dispersed cells adopted some but not all of the phenotypes associated with dispersed cells. Our findings indicate for the first time a role of DNase EndA in dispersion and suggest weakening of the biofilm matrix is a requisite for biofilm dispersion.","authors":[{"name":"Kathryn E Cherny"},{"name":"Karin Sauer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNA-specific endonuclease I"},{"word":"EddB"},{"word":"EndA"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dispersion"},{"word":"endonuclease"},{"word":"nuclease"}]},"article33":{"pmid":"30987581","title":"Occurrence and characterisation of biofilms in drinking water systems of broiler houses.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Water quality in the drinking water system (DWS) plays an important role in the general health and performance of broiler chickens.

Although Candida albicans is considered one of the most important causes of nosocomial infections, there is a recent shift to non-albicans Candida species as the most frequently isolated yeasts in particular risk groups. Diutina rugosa (formerly Candida rugosa) is a complex that includes four species: D. rugosa sensu stricto, D. neorugosa, D. pseudorugosa, and D. mesorugosa, and they are estimated to represent 0.2% of all Candida clinical isolates. In this study, we analyze nine clinical isolates of D. mesorugosa with focus on the virulence determinants and pathogenicity of the species by means of a Galleria mellonella survival model. Overall, we detected very strong aspartyl-protease and esterase activities. In contrast, both DNase and hemolysin activities were evident in only two of the isolates. None of the isolates was positive for phospholipase activity. All isolates studied were able to form biofilm after 72 h of incubation in a robust manner when compared with the C. albicans strain used as control.

However, insights and tools are currently lacking to characterize, understand and explain the effects of signal disruption on complex microbial communities. Here, we produced silica capsules containing an engineered lactonase that exhibits quorum quenching activity.

The growth of a complex microbial community in the bioreactor, in the presence or absence of lactonase, was monitored over a 3-week period. Dynamic population analysis revealed that signal disruption using a quorum quenching lactonase can effectively reduce biofilm formation in the recirculating bioreactor system and that biofilm inhibition is concomitant to drastic changes in the composition, diversity and abundance of soil bacterial communities within these biofilms. Effects of the quorum quenching lactonase on the suspension community also affected the microbial composition, suggesting that effects of signal disruption are not limited to biofilm populations.

Stress has been identified as part of the factors causing an outbreak of infections in the aquaculture industry. The most studied neuroendocrine hormonal family from a microbial endocrinology perspective is the catecholamine comprising of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. It is of importance that catecholamine affects the growth and virulence of bacteria. The influence of stress on bacterial infections is attributed to the ability of catecholamines to suppress the immune system as the mode of action for increased bacterial growth. Catecholamines have increased the growth of bacteria, virulence-associated factors, adhesions, and biofilm formation and consequently influence the outcome of infections by these bacteria in many hosts. The siderophores and the ferric iron transport system plays a vital role in the mechanism by which catecholamines stimulates growth and exposure of genes to stress hormones enhances the expression of genes involved in bacterial virulence. In recent years, it has been discovered that intestinal microflora takes part in bidirectional communication between the gut and brain.

Below 1 mm, for smaller AGS, higher flux and lower fouling appeared, because less extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) formed and adhered onto AGS foulants. In the critical size, membrane fouling was serious to the most extent, on account of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of EPS.

Moreover, at the physiological level, biofilms contain a very heterogeneous cell population including metabolically inactive organisms and persisters, which are highly tolerant to antibiotics. The majority of human infectious diseases are caused by biofilm-forming microorganisms which are responsible for pathologies such as cystic fibrosis, infective endocarditis, pneumonia, wound infections, dental caries, infections of indwelling devices, etc. AMPs are well suited to combat biofilms because of their potent bactericidal activity of broad spectrum (including resting cells and persisters) and their ability to first penetrate and then to disorganize these structures. In addition, AMPs frequently synergize with antimicrobial compounds and were recently reported to repress the molecular pathways leading to biofilm formation. Finally, there is a very active research to develop AMP-containing coatings that can prevent biofilm formation by killing microbial cells on contact or by locally releasing their active principle. In this chapter we will describe these strategies and discuss the perspectives of the use of AMPs as anti-biofilm agents for human therapy and prophylaxis.","authors":[{"name":"Hawraa Shahrour"},{"name":"Raquel Ferrer-Espada"},{"name":"Israa Dandache"},{"name":"Sergio Bárcena-Varela"},{"name":"Susana Sánchez-Gómez"},{"name":"Ali Chokr"},{"name":"Guillermo Martinez-de-Tejada"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic lock therapy"},{"word":"Antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Host-defense peptide"},{"word":"Medical implant"}]},"article65":{"pmid":"30980356","title":"Synthetic Anti-lipopolysaccharide Peptides (SALPs) as Effective Inhibitors of Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs).","date":"2019-08-01","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are in the focus of scientific research since the 1990s. In most cases, the main aim was laid on the design of AMP to kill bacteria effectively, with particular emphasis on broadband action and independency on antibiotic resistance. However, so far no approved drug on the basis of AMP has entered the market.Our approach of constructing AMP, called synthetic anti-lipopolysaccharide peptides (SALPs), on the basis of inhibiting the inflammatory action of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) from Gram-negative bacteria was focused on the neutralization of the decisive toxins. These are, beside LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, the lipoproteins (LP) from Gram-positive origin. Although some of the SALPs have an antibacterial action, the most important property is the high-affinity binding to LPS and LP, whether as constituent of the bacteria or in free form which prevents the damaging inflammation, that could otherwise lead to life-threatening septic shock. Most importantly, the SALP may inhibit inflammation independently of the resistance status of the bacteria, and so far the repeated use of the peptides apparently does not cause resistance of the attacking pathogens.In this chapter, an overview is given over the variety of possible applications in the field of fighting against severe bacterial infections, from the use in systemic infection/inflammation up to various topical applications such as anti-biofilm action and severe skin and soft tissue infections.","authors":[{"name":"Wilmar Correa"},{"name":"Lena Heinbockel"},{"name":"Guillermo Martinez-de-Tejada"},{"name":"Susana Sánchez"},{"name":"Patrick Garidel"},{"name":"Tobias Schürholz"},{"name":"Walter Mier"},{"name":"Aline Dupont"},{"name":"Mathias Hornef"},{"name":"Thomas Gutsmann"},{"name":"Karl Mauss"},{"name":"Günther Weindl"},{"name":"Klaus Brandenburg"}],"keywords":[]},"article66":{"pmid":"30980074","title":"Make and break the alarmone: regulation of (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase enzymes in bacteria.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Bacteria use dedicated mechanisms to respond adequately to fluctuating environments and to optimize their chances of survival in harsh conditions.

As a central regulator of bacterial stress response, the alarmone is also involved in biofilm formation, virulence, antibiotics tolerance and resistance in many pathogenic bacteria. Intracellular concentrations of (p)ppGpp are determined by a highly conserved and widely distributed family of proteins called RelA-SpoT Homologs (RSH).

Laboratory incubations confirmed the ability of Halanaerobium congolense strain WG8 to grow under pressures representative of deep shale formations (21 to 48 MPa). Under these conditions, broad metabolic and physiological shifts were identified, including higher abundances of proteins associated with the production of extracellular polymeric substances. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production was associated with greater cell aggregation when biomass was cultured at high pressure. Changes in Halanaerobium central carbon metabolism under the same conditions were inferred from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography measurements, revealing large per-cell increases in production of ethanol, acetate, and propanol and cessation of hydrogen production. These metabolic shifts were associated with carbon flux through 1,2-propanediol in response to slower fluxes of carbon through stage 3 of glycolysis.

We have investigated the peptide interaction with supported lipid model membranes using a combination of complementary surface sensitive techniques: neutron reflectometry (NR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The data are compared with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results obtained with lipid vesicle/peptide solutions. The peptide membrane interaction is shown to be significantly concentration dependent. At low concentrations, the peptide inserts at the outer leaflet in the interface between the headgroup and tail core. Insertion of the peptide results in a slight decrease in the lipid packing order of the bilayer, although not sufficient to cause membrane thinning. By increasing the indolicidin concentration well above the physiologically relevant conditions, a deeper penetration of the peptide into the bilayer and subsequent lipid removal take place, resulting in a slight membrane thinning. The results suggest that indolicidin induces lipid removal and that mixed indolicidin-lipid patches form on top of the supported lipid bilayers.

A significant number of two-component systems (TCSs) exist in these pathogens, which are involved in regulation of gene expression in response to environmental signals such as antibiotic exposure. While the development of antimicrobial resistance is a complex phenomenon, it has been shown that TCSs are involved in sensing antibiotics and regulating genes associated with antibiotic resistance.

This study investigated the effect of exposure of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates to sub lethal concentrations of BAC on their antibiotic resistance, growth process and biofilm formation. The collected 43 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were daily subjected to increasing sub lethal concentrations of BAC. The effect of adaptation on antibiotic resistance, growth process, cell surface hydrophobicity and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa isolates were examined.

Recently, we reported three TonB systems in the Aeromonas hydrophila Chinese epidemic strain NJ-35, but the functions of these systems have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, we investigated the role of these TonB systems in A. hydrophila iron utilization and virulence. We found that tonB1 and tonB2 were preferentially transcribed in iron-chelated conditions, where gene expression levels were approximately 8- and 68-fold higher compared with iron-rich conditions, respectively; tonB3 was consistently transcribed at a low level under iron-repleted and iron-depleted conditions. Only the TonB2 system was required to utilize iron-binding proteins. The tonB123 mutant showed increased susceptibility to erythromycin and roxithromycin. In addition, all three tonB genes were involved in A. hydrophila virulence in zebrafish, and various phenotypes associated with environmental survival were changed with varying degrees in each tonB mutant. TonB2 plays a relatively major role in adhesion, motility, and biofilm formation, while TonB3 is more involved in the anti-phagocytosis of A. hydrophila. In each observed phenotype, no significant difference was found between the single- and double-deletion mutants, whereas the triple-deletion mutant exhibited the most serious defects, indicating that all three TonB systems of A. hydrophila coordinately complement one another.

Based on colony counts and quantitative analysis of the biomass, sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) (1024, 512 or 256 μg/mL) of baicalin clearly decreased the number of bacterial colonies and biomass in vitro.

Moreover, baicalin disrupted biofilms and exhibited synergistic effects with levofloxacin. Virulence factors were assessed by western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, confirming that staphylococcal enterotoxin A, α-haemolysin and coagulase production decreased after baicalin treatment.

MRCoNS isolates were identified by microbiological and molecular tests. MLST-based phylogenetic analysis was performed in Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using phenotypic and molecular methods. SCCmec type and the presence of biofilm-related ica locus was PCR-tested. Isolates suspected for MRCoNS IT cases were subjected to SmaI-PFGE analysis and individuals from positive households were followed-up for 1 year for carriage dynamics (every 3 months, T0-T4). Nineteen MRCoNS isolates from owners (27.9%) and 12 from pets (16.7%) were detected, coming from 20 households (46.5%). S. epidermidis was predominant (90 and 67% of human and animal strains, respectively), showing high phylogenetic diversity (16 STs among 24 strains). Methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) strains belonged to CC5 (75%), CC11 (12.5%), singleton S556 (8.3%), and S560 (4.17%). Significant host-associated differences were observed for resistance to aminoglycosides, co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol (higher in animal isolates) and tetracycline (higher among human strains). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was common (68.4%) and associated with human strains. Great diversity of ccr and mec complexes were detected, most strains being non-typeable, followed by SCCmecIV and V. Over one third of isolates (most from owners), carried the ica locus, all MRSE CC5. Two sporadic IT cases (T0) were identified in owners and dogs from two households (4.7%), with diverse interspecies-exchanged clones detected along the sampling year, especially in dogs. A comparative analysis of all MRCoNS, with all nasal coagulase positive staphylococci (CoPS) recovered from the same individuals at T0, revealed that CoPS alone was predominant in owners and pets, followed by co-carriage of CoPS and MRCoNS in owners but single MRCoNS in pets. Statistical analyses revealed that owners are more prone to co-carriage and that co-existence of IT cases and co-carriage are positively interrelated. MRCoNS from healthy owners and their pets are genetically heterogeneous MDR strains that are spread in the community. Therefore, pets also contribute to the dissemination of successful human clones. Owner-pet inhabitancy increases the risk for staphylococcal temporal concomitance with its subsequent risk for bacterial infection and genetic exchange.","authors":[{"name":"Elena Gómez-Sanz"},{"name":"Sara Ceballos"},{"name":"Laura Ruiz-Ripa"},{"name":"Myriam Zarazaga"},{"name":"Carmen Torres"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"carriage dynamics"},{"word":"co-carriage"},{"word":"interspecies transmission"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci"},{"word":"multidrug resistance"},{"word":"owner"},{"word":"pet"}]},"article103":{"pmid":"30971309","title":"Prospective cohort of adult oral health in Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"To describe the methodological aspects of a Prospective Cohort Study of adult oral health in Piracicaba, Brazil.","authors":[{"name":"Manoelito Ferreira Silva-Junior"},{"name":"Maria da Luz Rosário de Sousa"},{"name":"Marília Jesus Batista"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adult"},{"word":"Epidemiology"},{"word":"Health literacy"},{"word":"Oral health"},{"word":"Tooth loss"}]},"article104":{"pmid":"30971289","title":"Evidence that the stress hormone cortisol regulates biofilm formation differently among Flavobacterium columnare isolates.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The impact of cortisol on Flavobacterium columnare biofilm formation was explored.

However, the application of anammox to treat domestic wastewater has been hindered mainly by unsatisfactory effluent quality with nitrogen removal efficiency below 80%.

The objective of this study was to investigate how two antimicrobials, ciprofloxacin and climbazole, impact detrital biofilm metabolism in urban and rural streams. To establish baseline conditions, the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of red maple (Acer rubrum) biofilms was measured in one urban and one rural stream.

The presence of ciprofloxacin and climbazole did not affect BOD compared to the controls at the urban site, although significant differences were identified for select treatments at the rural site. In addition, the BOD of mixed-leaf biofilms was not significantly different from that of single species litter after exposure. Overall, exposure to 10 μg/L of the antimicrobials did not significantly impact community-level carbon processing by the leaf biofilms, and leaf mixtures did not result in increased biofilm BOD compared to single species leaves.

Bacteria were enumerated and scanning electron microscopy was carried out. The results indicated that both C. jejuni strains isolated from poultry attached better to Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on abiotic surfaces than to the surfaces alone under the different conditions tested. This suggests that biofilms of other bacterial species may passively protect C. jejuni against shear forces and potentially oxygen stress which then contribute to their persistence in environments which are detrimental to them. By contrast the C. jejuni ATCC 33291 strain did not attach differentially to P. aeruginosa biofilms, suggesting that different C. jejuni strains may have alternative strategies for persistence in the environment.

Despite these dynamic changes, the microbial communities in the replicate reactors were similar. The second successional phase occurred when the settling time was rapidly decreased to selectively retain granules in the reactors. The influence of stochasticity on succession increased and new niches were created as granules emerged, resulting in temporarily increased α-diversity. The third successional phase occurred when the settling time was kept stable and granules dominated the biomass. Turnover was low, and selection resulted in the same abundant taxa in the reactors, but drift, which mostly affected low-abundant community members, caused the community in one reactor to diverge from the other two.

Conversely, much less attention has been given to the directly related problem of resistance toward antiseptics and biocides. While bacterial resistances toward triclosan or quaternary ammonium compounds have been considered in this context, the bis-biguanide chlorhexidine (CHX) has been put into focus only very recently when its use was associated with emergence of stable resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin. The antimicrobial effect of CHX is based on damaging the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and subsequent leakage of cytoplasmic material. Consequently, mechanisms conferring resistance toward CHX include multidrug efflux pumps and cell membrane changes. For instance, in staphylococci it has been shown that plasmid-borne qac (quaternary ammonium compound) genes encode Qac efflux proteins that recognize cationic antiseptics as substrates. In Pseudomonas stutzeri, changes in the outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles have been implicated in CHX resistance. However, little is known about the risk of resistance toward CHX in oral bacteria and potential mechanisms conferring this resistance or even cross-resistances toward antibiotics. Interestingly, there is also little awareness about the risk of CHX resistance in the dental community even though CHX has been widely used in dental practice as the gold-standard antiseptic for more than 40 years and is also included in a wide range of oral care consumer products. This review provides an overview of general resistance mechanisms toward CHX and the evidence for CHX resistance in oral bacteria. Furthermore, this work aims to raise awareness among the dental community about the risk of resistance toward CHX and accompanying cross-resistance to antibiotics. We propose new research directions related to the effects of CHX on bacteria in oral biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Fabian Cieplik"},{"name":"Nicholas S Jakubovics"},{"name":"Wolfgang Buchalla"},{"name":"Tim Maisch"},{"name":"Elmar Hellwig"},{"name":"Ali Al-Ahmad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CHX"},{"word":"adaptation"},{"word":"antiseptic"},{"word":"chlorhexidine"},{"word":"efflux pump"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"resistance"},{"word":"tolerance"}]},"article116":{"pmid":"30967851","title":"Social Behavior of Antibiotic Resistant Mutants Within Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Communities.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The complex spatial structure and the heterogeneity within biofilms lead to the emergence of specific social behaviors. However, the impact of resistant mutants within bacterial communities is still mostly unknown. Thus, we determined whether antibiotic resistant mutants display selfish or altruistic behaviors in mixed Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms exposed to antibiotics. ECFP-tagged P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 and its EYFP-tagged derivatives hyperproducing the β-lactamase AmpC or the efflux pump MexAB-OprM were used to develop single or mixed biofilms. Mature biofilms were challenged with different concentrations of β-lactams to monitor biofilm structural dynamics, using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and population dynamics, through enumeration of viable cells. While exposure of single wild-type PAO1 biofilms to β-lactams lead to a major reduction in bacterial load, it had little effect on biofilms formed by the resistant mutants. However, the most reveling finding was that bacterial load of wild-type PAO1 was significantly increased when growing in mixed biofilms compared to single biofilms. In agreement with CFU enumeration data, CLSM images revealed the amplification of the resistant mutants and their protection of susceptible populations. These findings show that mutants expressing diverse resistance mechanisms, including β-lactamases, but also, as evidenced for the first time, efflux pumps, protect the whole biofilm community, preserving susceptible populations from the effect of antibiotics. Thus, these results are a step forward to understanding antibiotic resistance dynamics in biofilms, as well as the population biology of bacterial pathogens in chronic infections, where the coexistence of susceptible and resistant variants is a hallmark.","authors":[{"name":"Estrella Rojo-Molinero"},{"name":"María D Macià"},{"name":"Antonio Oliver"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"bacterial communities"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"resistance mutants"},{"word":"β-lactam antibiotics"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"30967458","title":"Antibacterial Properties and Efficacy of a Novel SPLUNC1-Derived Antimicrobial Peptide, α4-Short, in a Murine Model of Respiratory Infection.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Multidrug resistance (MDR) by bacterial pathogens constitutes a global health crisis, and resistance to treatment displayed by biofilm-associated infections (e.g., cystic fibrosis, surgical sites, and medical implants) only exacerbates a problem that is already difficult to overcome.

Therefore, they are ubiquitous and can be found in a wide range of different applications such as paints and varnishes, pressure-sensitive adhesives, textiles, construction materials, paper coatings and inks. However, they also have weaknesses and their surfactant content is among them. Surfactants are often needed to stabilize polymer particles in the aqueous latex dispersions. These surfactants also form part of the coatings formed from these dispersions, and it is well-known that they can lower their performance. This work further explores this aspect and focuses on the role that embedded surfactant domains play in the response of latex coatings to humid environments. For this purpose, we made use of several experimental techniques where humidity control was implemented: quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, atomic force microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. By means of this multimethodological approach, we report that surfactants embedded in latex coatings can undergo humidity-induced transitions towards more hydrated and softer phases, and that this results in a drastic decrease of the mechanical and water barrier properties of the whole coatings. Subsequently, this work highlights the potential of taking into account the phase behavior of surfactants when choosing which ones to use in the synthesis of latex dispersions as this would help in predicting their performance under different environmental conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Juan F Gonzalez-Martinez"},{"name":"Yana Znamenskaya Falk"},{"name":"Sebastian Björklund"},{"name":"Stefan Erkselius"},{"name":"Nicola Rehnberg"},{"name":"Javier Sotres"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AFM"},{"word":"QCM-D"},{"word":"coating"},{"word":"latex"},{"word":"relative humidity"},{"word":"surfactant"}]},"article122":{"pmid":"30965610","title":"Characterization and Transcriptome Studies of Autoinducer Synthase Gene from Multidrug Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Strain 863.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell communication system that uses autoinducers as signaling molecules to enable inter-species and intra-species interactions in response to external stimuli according to the population density.

A criterion for a prophage to be considered a phage-RS is the inability to lyse host cells. MW2 grown under phage-inducing conditions did not release infectious phage particles by plaque assay or transmission electron microscopy, indicating that ϕSa3mw does not carry out a productive lytic cycle.

In the course of a previous study using a chronic carriage mouse model, a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate was recovered from a mouse gallstone that exhibited a 2-fold increase in biofilm formation over the wild type. In order to identify the gene(s) responsible for the phenotype, the genomic sequences of this isolate and others were determined and compared. These sequences identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes. Mutations in the most promising candidates, envZ and rcsB, were created, but neither showed increased biofilm-forming ability separately or in combination. The hyperbiofilm isolate did, however, present variations in cellular appendages observable using different techniques and a preferential binding to cholesterol. The isolate was also examined for systemic virulence and the ability to colonize the gallbladder/gallstones in a mouse model of chronic infection, demonstrating a systemic virulence defect and decreased gallbladder/gallstone colonization. Finally, to determine if the appearance of hyperbiofilm isolates could be replicated in vitro and if this was a common event, wild-type Salmonella spp. were grown long term in vitro under gallbladder-mimicking conditions, resulting in a high proportion of isolates that replicated the hyperbiofilm phenotype of the original isolate.

NBs are stable spherical packages of gas within liquid and are operationally defined as having diameters less than 1000 nm, though they are typically in the range of 100 nm in one dimension. While theories still lack the ability to explain empirical evidence for formation of stable NBs in water, numerous NB applications have emerged in different fields, including water and wastewater purification where NBs offer the potential to replace or improve efficiency of current treatment processes. The United Nations identifies access to safe drinking water as a human right, and municipal and industrial wastewaters require purification before they enter water bodies. These protections require treatment technologies to remove naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic, chromium, fluoride, manganese, radionuclides, salts, selenium, natural organic matter, algal toxins), or anthropogenic (e.g., nitrate, phosphate, solvents, fuel additives, pharmaceuticals) chemicals and particles (e.g., virus, bacteria, oocysts, clays) that cause toxicity or aesthetic problems to make rivers, lakes, seawater, groundwater, or wastewater suitable for beneficial use or reuse in complex and evolving urban and rural water systems. NBs raise opportunities to improve current or enable new technologies for producing fewer byproducts and achieving safer water. This account explores the potential to exploit the unique properties of NBs for improving water treatment by answering key questions and proposing research opportunities regarding (1) observational versus theoretical existence of NBs, (2) ability of NBs to improve gas transfer into water or influence gas trapped on particle surfaces, (3) ability to produce quasi-stable reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the surface of NBs to oxidize pollutants and pathogens in water, (4) ability to improve particle aggregation through intraparticle NB bridging, and (5) ability to mitigate fouling on surfaces. We conclude with key insights and knowledge gaps requiring research to advance the use of NBs for water purification. Among the highest priorities is to develop techniques that measure NB size and surface properties in complex drinking and wastewater chemistries, which contain salts, organics, and a wide variety of inorganic and organic colloids. In the authors' opinion, ROS production by NB may hold the greatest promise for usage in water treatment because it allows movement away from chemical-based oxidants (chlorine, ozone) that are costly, dangerous to handle, and produce harmful byproducts while helping achieve important treatment goals (e.g., destruction of organic pollutants, pathogens, biofilms). Because of the low chemical requirements to form NBs, NB technologies could be distributed throughout rapidly changing and increasingly decentralized water treatment systems in both developed and developing countries.","authors":[{"name":"Ariel J Atkinson"},{"name":"Onur G Apul"},{"name":"Orren Schneider"},{"name":"Sergi Garcia-Segura"},{"name":"Paul Westerhoff"}],"keywords":[]},"article153":{"pmid":"30958158","title":"Eggshell spheres protect brown widow spider ( Latrodectus geometricus) eggs from bacterial infection.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Eggs provide a rich source of nutrients for the developing embryo, making them a favoured food source for other organisms as well.

Antibacterial activity was shown by inhibition of bacterial growth on agar plate, liquid culture and retarded biofilm formation. The defence strategy against bacterial invasion was demonstrated in the whole egg, whole egg extract, egg surface extract, eggshell and eggshell extract.

Over decades, a variety of antibacterial polymeric nanosystems have exhibited great promise for the eradication of multidrug-resistant bacteria and persistent biofilms by enhancing bacterial recognition and binding capabilities. In this Review, the state-of-the-art biodegradable antibacterial polymeric nanosystems, which could respond to bacteria environments (e.g., acidity or bacterial enzymes) for controlled antibiotic release or multimodal antibacterial treatment, are summarized. The current antibacterial polymeric nanosystems can be categorized into antibiotic-containing and intrinsic antibacterial nanosystems. The antibiotic-containing polymeric nanosystems include antibiotic-encapsulated nanocarriers (e.g., polymeric micelles, vesicles, nanogels) and antibiotic-conjugated polymer nanosystems for the delivery of antibiotic drugs. On the other hand, the intrinsic antibacterial polymer nanosystems containing bactericidal moieties such as quaternary ammonium groups, phosphonium groups, polycations, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and their synthetic mimics, are also described. The biodegradability of the nanosystems can be rendered by the incorporation of labile chemical linkages, such as carbonate, ester, amide, and phosphoester bonds. The design and synthesis of the degradable polymeric building blocks and their fabrications into nanosystems are also explicated, together with their plausible action mechanisms and potential biomedical applications. The perspectives of the current research in this field are also described.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaokang Ding"},{"name":"Anzhi Wang"},{"name":"Wei Tong"},{"name":"Fu-Jian Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antibiotic"},{"word":"biodegradable"},{"word":"multidrug-resistance"},{"word":"polymeric nanoparticles"}]},"article156":{"pmid":"30957585","title":"Bioburden and transmission of pathogenic bacteria through elevator channel during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: application of multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis for characterization of clonal strains.","date":"2019-06-24","abs":"Endogenous and exogenous infection of the biliary tract could occur during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.","authors":[{"name":"Masoumeh Azimirad"},{"name":"Masoud Alebouyeh"},{"name":"Amir Sadeghi"},{"name":"Elham Khodamoradi"},{"name":"Hamid Asadzadeh Aghdaei"},{"name":"Amir Houshang Mohammad Alizadeh"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Zali"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MLVA typing"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bioburden"},{"word":"cross-contamination"},{"word":"endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography"}]},"article157":{"pmid":"30956871","title":"Efficacy of chemical sanitizers against Bacillus cereus on food contact surfaces with scratch and biofilm.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"This study was performed to investigate the efficacy of chemical sanitizers (viz., chlorine, chlorine dioxide, alcohol, and quaternary ammonium compound) against Bacillus cereus on five food contact materials under different conditions (smooth vs. scratched and with vs. without biofilms).

We revealed enhanced p-fluoronitrobenzene (p-FNB) degradation in a BES by observing a defluorination efficiency that was three times higher than that in biodegradation or electrochemical processes. Such an improvement was achieved by the collaborative roles of electrode biofilms and planktonic microbes, as their individual contributions to p-FNB degradation were found to be similarly stimulated by electricity. However, no bioelectrochemical activity was found in either the electrode biofilms or the planktonic microbes during stimulated p-FNB degradation; because no biocatalytically reductive or oxidative turnovers were observed on cyclic voltammetry curves. The non-involvement of EMs was further proven by the similar microbial community evolution for biofilms and planktonic microbes.

In liquid, cells rotate their corkscrew-shaped flagella to swim, but in surface attached biofilms cells instead use grappling hook-like appendages called pili to pull themselves along. In both forms of motility, cells selectively alternate between relatively straight 'runs' and sharp reorientations to generate biased random walks up chemoattractant gradients. However, recent experiments suggest that swimming and biofilm cells employ fundamentally different strategies to generate chemotaxis: swimming cells typically suppress reorientations when moving up a chemoattractant gradient, whereas biofilm cells increase reorientations when moving down a chemoattractant gradient. The reason for this difference remains unknown. Here we develop a mathematical framework to understand how these different chemotactic strategies affect the distribution of cells at the population level. Current continuum models typically assume a weak bias in the reorientation rate and are not able to distinguish between these two strategies, so we derive a model for strong chemotaxis that resolves how both the drift and diffusive components depend on the underlying chemotactic strategy. We then test predictions from our continuum model against individual-based simulations and identify further refinements that allow our continuum model to resolve boundary effects. Our analyses reveal that the strategy employed by swimming cells yields a larger chemotactic drift, but the strategy used by biofilm cells allows them to more tightly aggregate where the chemoattractant is most abundant. This new modelling framework provides new quantitative insights into how the different chemical landscapes experienced by swimming and biofilm cells might select for divergent ways of generating chemotaxis.","authors":[{"name":"R N Bearon"},{"name":"W M Durham"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PDEs"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chemotaxis"},{"word":"stochastic simulations"}]},"article195":{"pmid":"30950296","title":"Antimicrobial activity of nitrochalcone and pentyl caffeate against hospital pathogens results in decreased microbial adhesion and biofilm formation.","date":"2019-09-26","abs":"The present study investigated the antimicrobial, anti-adhesion and anti-biofilm activity of the modified synthetic molecules nitrochalcone (NC-E05) and pentyl caffeate (C5) against microorganisms which have a high incidence in hospital-acquired infections.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol, a major polyphenol found in grapes and wine, on the growth and virulence properties of P. gingivalis as well as on gingival keratinocyte tight junction integrity and the host inflammatory response. Resveratrol exhibited antibacterial activity that may result from damage to the bacterial cell membrane. Resveratrol also killed a pre-formed P. gingivalis biofilm and reduced bacterial adherence to matrix proteins. In addition, resveratrol had a protective effect on the integrity of the keratinocyte tight junctions by inhibiting its breakdown by P. gingivalis. This may be related to the ability of resveratrol to inhibit the protease activities of P. gingivalis. Lastly, resveratrol reduced P. gingivalis-mediated activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and attenuated TREM-1 gene expression as well as soluble TREM-1 secretion in monocytes. The effect on NF-κB activation likely results from the ability of resveratrol to act as a PPAR-γ agonist.

However, the available evidence supporting this recommendation is scanty, and only includes small, short-term, observational studies (most of them single-arm), with different definitions of CRBSI cure and variable follow-up periods. Furthermore, the ability of an antibiotic to eradicate a biofilm is not predicted by its inherent spectrum of antibacterial activity, since sessile microorganisms in their biofilm display other mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics than their planktonic counter-parts.

In the present study, biofilms of six P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis and wound patients, and one laboratory strain was treated singly and with combinations of anti-Pseudomonas phage PEV20 and ciprofloxacin. Of these strains, three were highly susceptible to the phage, while one was partially resistant and one was completely resistant. Combination treatment with PEV20 and ciprofloxacin enhanced biofilm eradication compared with single treatment. Phage and ciprofloxacin synergy was found to depend on phage-resistance profile of the target bacteria.

However, the characteristics and relevant mechanisms of biofilm formation in oxacillin-sensitive MRSA (OS-MRSA) are poorly understood. This study was designed to characterize biofilm formation in OS-MRSA BWSA15 in response to ceftazidime (TZ) by comparing the methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) strain BWSA23 and the oxacillin-resistant MRSA (OR-MRSA) strain BWSA11. The biofilms and biofilm-forming cells were observed by electron microscopy. Biofilms grown on microtiter plates were chemically decomposed and analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The transcriptional regulation of genes associated with methicillin resistance, surface adhesion, fatty acid biosynthesis, and global regulation (sigma B) was investigated. A significant increase in biofilm formation ability (10.21-fold) and aggregation ability (2.56-fold) was observed in BWSA15 upon the treatment with TZ (16 μg/ml). The TZ-induced biofilm formation in BWSA15 was characterized by a disappearance of polysaccharide-like extracellular substances and an appearance of a large number of intercellular MVs from extracellular matrix. Few MVs were identified in the biofilms formed by BWSA11 and BWSA23. There was a significant upregulation of mecA, sigB, and fatty acid biosynthesis-associated genes and downregulation of icaA, icaD, clfA, clfB, and fnaA in BWSA15 upon the treatment with TZ. The formation of intracellular junctions of MVs in the biofilms of BWSA15 was mediated by a significant increase in the proportion of proteins as well as by an increase in the proportion of non-ionized carboxyl groups in fatty acids. This study demonstrated that beta-lactam antibiotics can induce biofilm formation in OS-MRSA, and the biofilm induction in OS-MRSA can mainly be attributed to exposed MVs with increased hydrophobicity rather than polysaccharide intercellular adhesins, cell wall-anchored surface proteins, and extracellular DNA.","authors":[{"name":"Xinlong He"},{"name":"Shuang Li"},{"name":"Yi Yin"},{"name":"Jiahui Xu"},{"name":"Weijuan Gong"},{"name":"Guocai Li"},{"name":"Li Qian"},{"name":"Yinyan Yin"},{"name":"Xiaoqin He"},{"name":"Tingting Guo"},{"name":"Yuzheng Huang"},{"name":"Feng Lu"},{"name":"Jun Cao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"membrane vesicle"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"}]},"article209":{"pmid":"30949147","title":"The Eukaryotic Life on Microplastics in Brackish Ecosystems.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Microplastics (MP) constitute a widespread contaminant all over the globe.

While reporting on prokaryotic and fungal communities from the same set-up previously, we focus here on the entire eukaryotic communities. Using high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the eukaryotes colonizing on two types of MP, polyethylene and polystyrene, and compared them to the ones in the surrounding water and on a natural surface (wood). More than 500 different taxa across almost all kingdoms of the eukaryotic tree of life were identified on MP, dominated by Alveolata, Metazoa, and Chloroplastida. The eukaryotic community composition on MP was significantly distinct from wood and the surrounding water, with overall lower diversity and the potentially harmful dinoflagellate Pfiesteria being enriched on MP. Co-occurrence networks, which include prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa, hint at possibilities for dynamic microbial interactions on MP.

In 29 selected samples, 16S rRNA amplicon Illumina sequencing was performed. The results of all methods were compared. In 338 positive samples, from which 86.1% were polybacterial, 1,295 representatives of 153 unique OTUs were detected.

In this article, the current evidence for the role of oral pre- and probiotics in caries prevention and caries management is discussed. Prebiotics are defined as substrates that are selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit. With regard to caries, this would include alkali-generating substances such as urea and arginine, which are metabolized by some oral bacteria, resulting in ammonia production and increase in pH. While there is no evidence that urea added to chewing gums or mouth rinses significantly contributes to caries inhibition, multiple studies have shown that arginine in consumer products can exert an inhibitory effect on the caries process. Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administrated in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Clinical trials have suggested that school-based programs with milk supplemented with probiotics and probiotic lozenges can reduce caries development in preschool children and in schoolchildren with high caries risk. Due to issues with research ethics (prebiotics) and risk of bias (prebiotics, probiotics), the confidence in the effect estimate is however limited. Further long-term clinical studies are needed with orally derived probiotic candidates, including the health-economic perspectives. In particular, the development and evaluation of oral synbiotic products, containing both prebiotics and a probiotic, would be of interest in the future management of dental caries.","authors":[{"name":"Egija Zaura"},{"name":"Svante Twetman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Arginine"},{"word":"Bifidobacteria"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Lactobacilli"},{"word":"Oral microbiome"},{"word":"Urea"}]},"article221":{"pmid":"30946803","title":"Stationary phase persister/biofilm microcolony of Borrelia burgdorferi causes more severe disease in a mouse model of Lyme arthritis: implications for understanding persistence, Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS), and treatment failure.","date":"2020-01-02","abs":"Although most patients with Lyme disease can be cured with a 2-4 week antibiotic therapy, about 10-20% of patients continue to suffer prolonged persistent symptoms, a condition called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). The cause for PTLDS is unclear and hotly debated. Borrelia burgdorferi develops morphological variants under stress conditions but their significance is not clear. Here we isolated the biofilm-like microcolony (MC) and planktonic (spirochetal form and round body) (SP) variant forms from the stationary phase culture of B. burgdorferi and showed that the MC and SP variant forms were not only more tolerant to the current Lyme antibiotics but also caused more severe arthritis in mice than the log phase spirochete form (LOG). We propose to divide the persistent Lyme disease into two categories: (1) early development of persistent disease from inoculation with persister/biofilm at the beginning of infection introduced by tick bites, or Type I persistent disease (i.e., PTLDS); and (2) late development of persistent disease due to initial infection not being diagnosed or treated in time such that the infection develops into late persistent disease, or Type II persistent disease. Importantly, we show that the murine infection caused by LOG could be eradicated by ceftriaxone whereas the persistent infection established with MC could not be eradicated by doxycycline (Doxy), ceftriaxone (CefT), or vancomycin (Van), or Doxy+CefT or Van+CefT, but could only be eradicated by the persister drug combination daptomycin+doxycycline+ceftriaxone. We conclude that varying levels of persistence and pathologies of Borrelia infection and the corresponding different treatment responses are mostly dictated by the heterogeneous B. burgdorferi variant forms inoculated at the time of tick bites. These findings may have broad implications for understanding pathogenesis and treatment of not only persistent Lyme disease but also other persistent infections in general and call for studies to evaluate if treatment of persistent infections with persister drug combination regimens is more effective than the current mostly single-antibiotic monotherapy.","authors":[{"name":"Jie Feng"},{"name":"Tingting Li"},{"name":"Rebecca Yee"},{"name":"Yuting Yuan"},{"name":"Chunxiang Bai"},{"name":"Menghua Cai"},{"name":"Wanliang Shi"},{"name":"Monica Embers"},{"name":"Cory Brayton"},{"name":"Harumi Saeki"},{"name":"Kathleen Gabrielson"},{"name":"Ying Zhang"}],"keywords":[]},"article222":{"pmid":"30944810","title":"Quorum sensing inimical activity of Tribulus terrestris against gram negative bacterial pathogens by signalling interference.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Bacterial virulence is controlled by a cascade of genes influenced by quorum sensing alias bacterial signalling.The present study was intended to develop an effective module that could constrain bacterial communication without harming the host.

The main advantage of synergy over monotherapy lies in reducing or even completely preventing the induction of resistance of fungal cells.

Therefore, we have focused on the influence of derivative H on the gene expression of the main C. albicans adhesin (ALS3), which is important for the tissue colonization during the infection process. Our results show that the newly synthesized derivative H had an impact on biofilm eradication.

Exposure of C. tropicalis PMB to probiotic filtrate reduced biofilm matrix, decreased thickness, and inhibited hyphal formation.

Organization of these components lends spatial organization to the biofilm community such that biofilm residents can benefit from the production of common goods while being protected from exogenous insults. Spatial organization is driven by the presence of chemical gradients, such as oxygen. Here we show that two quinol oxidases found in Escherichia coli and other bacteria organize along the biofilm oxygen gradient and that this spatially coordinated expression controls architectural integrity. Cytochrome bd, a high-affinity quinol oxidase required for aerobic respiration under hypoxic conditions, is the most abundantly expressed respiratory complex in the biofilm community. Depletion of the cytochrome bd-expressing subpopulation compromises biofilm complexity by reducing the abundance of secreted extracellular matrix as well as increasing cellular sensitivity to exogenous stresses. Interrogation of the distribution of quinol oxidases in the planktonic state revealed that ∼15% of the population expresses cytochrome bd at atmospheric oxygen concentration, and this population dominates during acute urinary tract infection. These data point toward a bet-hedging mechanism in which heterogeneous expression of respiratory complexes ensures respiratory plasticity of E. coli across diverse host niches.","authors":[{"name":"Connor J Beebout"},{"name":"Allison R Eberly"},{"name":"Sabrina H Werby"},{"name":"Seth A Reasoner"},{"name":"John R Brannon"},{"name":"Shuvro De"},{"name":"Madison J Fitzgerald"},{"name":"Marissa M Huggins"},{"name":"Douglass B Clayton"},{"name":"Lynette Cegelski"},{"name":"Maria Hadjifrangiskou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"heterogeneity"},{"word":"oxygen gradients"},{"word":"respiration"},{"word":"urinary tract infection"}]},"article243":{"pmid":"30940608","title":"Role of NOD1/NOD2 receptors in Fusobacterium nucleatum mediated NETosis.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are indispensable in fighting infectious microbes by adopting various antimicrobial strategies including phagocytosis and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).

In the present study, we sought to determine the role of periodontal pathogen on NET formation by utilizing Fusobacterium nucleatum. Our data demonstrates that F. nucleatum activates neutrophils and induces robust NETosis in a time-dependent manner via the upregulation of the Nucleotide oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 receptors. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of HL-60 cells and the use of ligands/inhibitors confirmed the involvement of NOD1 and NOD2 receptors in F. nucleatum-mediated NET formation. When treated with NOD1 and NOD2 inhibitors, we observed a significant downregulation of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) activity. In addition, neutrophils showed a significant increase and decrease of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE) when treated with NOD1/NOD2 ligands and inhibitors, respectively. Taken together, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of NOD1/NOD2 HL-60 cells and inhibitors of NOD signaling confirmed the role of NLRs in F. nucleatum-mediated NETosis.

However, little is known about the diversity of L. monocytogenes present on fresh produce and their potential pathogenicity. In this work, fifteen Listeria monocytogenes isolates from the UK fresh produce supply chain were characterised using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Additionally, isolates were characterised based on their ability to form biofilm. Whole genome sequencing data was used to determine the sequence type of isolates based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), construct a core single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) phylogeny and determine the presence of virulence and resistance associated genes. MLST revealed 9 distinct sequence types (STs) spanning 2 lineages (I & II) with one isolate belonging to the ST6 subtype, strains from which have been recently implicated in two large, food-associated L. monocytogenes outbreaks in South Africa and across Europe. Although most of the 15 isolates were different, comparison of core genome SNPs showed 4 pairs of 'indistinguishable' strains (<5 SNPs difference). Virulence profiling revealed that some isolates completely lacked the Listeria pathogenicity island-3 (LIPI-3) amongst other virulence factors. Investigation of the inlA gene showed that no strains in this study contained a premature stop codon (PMSC), an indicator of attenuated virulence. Assessment of biofilm production showed that isolates found in the fresh produce supply chain differ in their ability to form biofilm. This trait is considered important for L. monocytogenes to persist in environments associated with food production and processing. Overall the work indicates that a genetically diverse range of L. monocytogenes strains is present in the UK fresh produce supply chain and the virulence profiles found suggests that at least some of the strains are capable of causing human illness. Interestingly, the presence of some genetically indistinguishable isolates within the 15 isolates examined suggests that cross-contamination in the fresh produce environment does occur. These findings have useful implications in terms of food safety and for informing microbial surveillance programmes in the UK fresh produce supply chain.","authors":[{"name":"Alva Smith"},{"name":"Jack Hearn"},{"name":"Clare Taylor"},{"name":"Nick Wheelhouse"},{"name":"Maciej Kaczmarek"},{"name":"Edwin Moorhouse"},{"name":"Ian Singleton"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Contamination"},{"word":"Food microbiology"},{"word":"Fresh produce"},{"word":"Listeria"},{"word":"Virulence"},{"word":"Whole genome sequencing"}]},"article248":{"pmid":"30939351","title":"Anti-PqsR compounds as next-generation antibacterial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa: A review.","date":"2019-06-17","abs":"Nowadays, due to spreading antibiotic resistance among clinically relevant pathogens, the requirement of novel therapeutic approaches is felt more than ever.

S Typhi is a human-restricted pathogen; therefore, asymptomatic carriers represent a critical reservoir for further spread of disease. To examine the dynamics of the Salmonella biofilm during chronic carriage, the human gallstone (GS) environment was simulated by growing biofilms on cholesterol-coated surfaces in the presence of bile, and the transcriptional profile was determined. Some of the most highly activated genes corresponded to the curli fimbria operon, with the major structural component csgA upregulated >80-fold. The curli protein polymer is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in Salmonella biofilms. The upregulation of curli fimbriae by human bile was validated through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), microscopy, and Western blotting. Interestingly, this activation appears human specific, as qRT-PCR showed repression of csgA in biofilms grown in mouse or ox bile. Comparative transcriptional studies of the two divergent csg operons suggest an early activation of both operons in minimal medium complemented with glucose that quickly diminishes as the biofilm matures. However, in the presence of human bile, there is a modest activation of both operons that steadily increases as the biofilm matures.

Unlike those in other Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes, DacA in S. pyogenes was not essential for growth in rich media. The DacA null mutant presented a growth defect that manifested through an increased lag time, produced no detectable biofilm, and displayed increased susceptibility toward environmental stressors such as high salt, low pH, reactive oxygen radicals, and cell wall-targeting antibiotics, suggesting that c-di-AMP plays significant roles in crucial cellular processes involved in stress management.

Asymptomatic carriage of S. aureus on the skin and in the anterior nares is common and recognized as a predisposing factor to invasive infection. Transition of S. aureus from the carriage state to that of invasive infection is often accompanied by a temperature upshift from approximately 33°C to 37°C. Such a temperature shift is known in other pathogens to influence gene expression, often resulting in increased production of factors that promote survival or virulence within the host. One mechanism by which bacteria modulate gene expression in response to temperature is by the regulatory activity of RNA-based thermosensors, cis-acting riboregulators that control translation efficiency. This study was designed to identify and characterize RNA-based thermosensors in S. aureus. Initially predicted by in silico analyses of the S. aureus USA300 genome, reporter-based gene expression analyses and site-specific mutagenesis were performed to demonstrate the presence of a functional thermosensor within the 5' UTR of cidA, a gene implicated in biofilm formation and survival of the pathogen. The nucleic sequence composing the identified thermosensor are sufficient to confer temperature-dependent post-transcriptional regulation, and activity is predictably altered by the introduction of site-specific mutations designed to stabilize or destabilize the structure within the identified thermosensor. The identified regulator is functional in both the native bacterial host S. aureus and in the distally related species Escherichia coli, suggesting that its regulatory activity is independent of host-specific factors. Interestingly, unlike the majority of bacterial RNA-based thermosensors characterized to date, the cidA thermosensor facilitates increased target gene expression at lower temperatures. In addition to the characterization of the first RNA-based thermosensor in the significant pathogen S. aureus, it highlights the diversity of function within this important class of ribo-regulators.","authors":[{"name":"Hebaallaha Hussein"},{"name":"Megan E Fris"},{"name":"Ahmed H Salem"},{"name":"Richard E Wiemels"},{"name":"Raeven A Bastock"},{"name":"Francesco Righetti"},{"name":"Caleb A Burke"},{"name":"Franz Narberhaus"},{"name":"Ronan K Carroll"},{"name":"Nahla S Hassan"},{"name":"Saleh A Mohamed"},{"name":"Afaf S Fahmy"},{"name":"Erin R Murphy"}],"keywords":[]},"article273":{"pmid":"30933902","title":"Candida species in intact in vivo biofilm from carious lesions.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and spatial localization of Candida species in intact in vivo biofilm from caries lesions in root and occlusal surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"I Dige"},{"name":"B Nyvad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Candida.

We fabricated patches with self-dissolvable microneedles and needle tips loaded with chloramphenicol (CAM)-bearing and gelatinase-sensitive gelatin nanoparticles (CAM@GNPs). During the microneedle patch-mediated treatment, arrays of 225 microneedles simultaneously penetrate the biofilm matrix. Once inside, the microneedles dissolve and uniformly release CAM@GNPs into the surrounding area. In response to the gelatinase produced by the active bacterial community, the CAM@GNPs disassemble and release CAM into these active regions of the biofilm. Moreover, CAM@GNPs exhibited minimal off-target toxicity compared to direct CAM administration, which in turn favors wound healing. Importantly, we found that our microneedle-mediated treatment is more effective in treating Vibrio vulnificus biofilms than drug in free solution.

While to date most microplastic studies used virgin microplastics at unrealistic environmental concentrations here we exposed Salpa fusiformis to fractured and UV exposed polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics possessing a biofilm. It was found that when exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations, reported for the Mediterranean and the South Pacific Gyre, only few faecal pellets had microplastics incorporated within them.

Aquatic primary production contributed substantially to the biomass of invertebrates in these headwater streams, especially for scrapers and collector-gatherers (25-75%). However, the contribution of algae to food webs decreased as forest management intensity (road density and associated sediments, water cations/carbon, and dissolved organic matter humification) increased, and as canopy openness decreased. This trend was probably due to an increase in the delivery of organic and inorganic terrestrial materials (dissolved and in suspension) in areas of greater harvesting intensity and road density, which resulted in more heterotrophic biofilms. Overall, results suggest that, despite the presence of riparian buffers, forest management can affect stream food web structure via changes in energy flows, and that increased protection should be directed at minimizing ground disturbance in areas with direct hydrological connection to streams and at reducing dissolved and particulate matter inputs from roads and stream crossings in catchments with high degrees of management activity.","authors":[{"name":"Maitane Erdozain"},{"name":"Karen Kidd"},{"name":"David Kreutzweiser"},{"name":"Paul Sibley"}],"keywords":[{"word":"algae"},{"word":"allochthony"},{"word":"benthic macroinvertebrate"},{"word":"forest harvesting"},{"word":"road"},{"word":"stable isotope analysis"}]},"article283":{"pmid":"30929272","title":"Rhenium and yttrium ions as antimicrobial agents against multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms.","date":"2019-10-25","abs":"Antimicrobial resistance presents major global concerns to patient health.

Biofilms are organized bacterial communities formed on abiotic surfaces, such as implanted or inserted medical devices, or on biological surfaces, such as epithelial linings and mucosal surfaces. Biofilm growth is advantageous for the bacterial organism as it protects the bacteria from antimicrobial host factors and allows the bacteria to reside in the host without causing excessive inflammation. Like many other opportunistic pathogens of the respiratory tract, Streptococcus pneumoniae forms biofilms during asymptomatic carriage, which promotes, among other things, persistence in the niche, intraspecies and interspecies communication, and spread of bacterial DNA. Changes within the colonizing environment resulting from host assaults, such as virus infection, can induce biofilm dispersion where bacteria leave the biofilm and disseminate to other sites with ensuing infection. In this chapter, we present methodology to form complex biofilms in the nasopharynx of mice and to evaluate the biofilm structure and function in this environment. Furthermore, we present methods that recapitulate this biofilm phenotype in vitro by incorporating crucial factors associated with the host environment and describe how these models can be used to study biofilm function, transformation, and dispersion.","authors":[{"name":"Yashuan Chao"},{"name":"Caroline Bergenfelz"},{"name":"Anders P Hakansson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Carriage"},{"word":"Colonization"},{"word":"Competence"},{"word":"Dispersion"},{"word":"Epithelium"},{"word":"Mucosa"},{"word":"Nasopharynx"},{"word":"Respiratory tract"},{"word":"Streptococcus pneumoniae"},{"word":"Transformation"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article286":{"pmid":"30929212","title":"In Vitro Adhesion, Invasion, and Transcytosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae with Host Cells.","date":"2019-08-05","abs":"Physical interactions of bacteria with host cells are often a principal aspect of bacterial pathogenesis. In the case of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), which does not produce a secreted toxin, adhesion to and/or invasion of host cells is necessary for colonization of the nasopharynx and subsequently to cause opportunistic disease in its human host. Knowledge of how pneumococci interact with host cells thereby helps to explain its biology and may identify potential targets for intervention. One of the simplest, yet powerful, assays that can be leveraged to dissect the molecular basis of this vital host-pathogen interaction is the in vitro adhesion and invasion assay. Among many key results, this assay has been used to discover the bacterial and host determinants involved in bacterial attachment, identify host signaling networks required for uptake of the bacteria into an endosome, and the characterization of the intracellular trafficking machinery that is subverted by Spn during development of bacteremia and meningitis. These assays have also been used to characterize the epithelial, endothelial, and/or immune cell response to these bacteria, and to learn how pneumococci disperse from an established biofilm to a planktonic phenotype to colonize another niche and/or transmit. Herein, we will review this protocol, highlighting how simple changes in the bacterial strain or host cell line can elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms for Spn virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Terry Brissac"},{"name":"Carlos J Orihuela"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adhesion"},{"word":"Gentamycin protection assay"},{"word":"Invasion"},{"word":"Translocation"}]},"article287":{"pmid":"30929087","title":"A tooth-binding antimicrobial peptide to prevent the formation of dental biofilm.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Dental caries is primarily caused by pathogenic bacteria infection, and Streptococcus mutans is considered a major cariogenic pathogen.

An antimicrobial peptide of polyphemusin I (PI) was modified by grafting a tooth-binding domain of diphosphoserine (Ser(p)-Ser(p)-) to create the peptide of Ser(p)-Ser(p)-polyphemusin I (DPS-PI). PI and DPS-PI were synthesized by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. The minimum inhibitory concentration of PI and DPS-PI against S. mutans were tested. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to observe the growth of S. mutans on PI and DPS-PI treated enamel surfaces. The growth of S. mutans was evaluated by optical density (OD) at 590 nm. Inhibition of dental plaque biofilm development in vivo were investigated. The cytocompatibility to bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) was tested. The MIC of PI and DPS-PI were 40 and 80 μg/ml, respectively. SEM images showed that S. mutans were sparsely distributed on the DPS-PI treated enamel surface. OD findings indicated that DPS-PI maintained its inhibition effect on S. mutans growth after 24 h. The incisor surfaces of rabbits treated with DPS-PI developed significantly less dental plaque biofilm than that on PI treated surfaces. The DPS-PI had good biocompatibility with the cells.

The results showed that while all compounds were stable in wastewater only (i.e. without biofilm), cortisol and androstenedione degraded quickly in sewers with the presence of sewer biofilms. The degradation followed first-order kinetics similar to that of creatinine. In contrast, 5-HIAA was relatively stable in sewer reactors. This study also recognised the impact of wastewater pH on the detectability of 5-HIAA using a LC-MS/MS direct injection method. In samples acidified to pH 2, the method did not allow routine detection/quantification of 5-HIAA whereas in non-acidified samples the method was sufficiently sensitive for routine quantification of 5-HIAA.

Biofilm formation was observed in almost every isolate, which may contribute to their capacity of exchanging antimicrobial resistance genes in addition to acting as a physical barrier to the access of drugs.

The models presented in this paper predict that distinct metabolic niches for the two cell types could be established by supplying electron donors and acceptors at opposite ends of the biofilm and that acetate consumption by the secondary cell type could increase total biomass accumulation and the synthesis of valuable biochemicals, such as isobutanol, by the primary cell type. System tunability is enhanced when each cell type is supplied with a unique terminal electron acceptor at opposite ends of the biofilm rather than competing for a common electron acceptor.

'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus', an uncultivated α-proteobacteria, is the most widely spread causal agent of HLB and is transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri. 'Ca. L. asiaticus' attachment to the psyllid midgut is believed to be critical to further infect other organs, including the salivary gland. In this study, the type IVc tight adherence (Tad) pilus locus encoded by 'Ca. L. asiaticus' was characterized. The Tad loci are conserved among members of Rhizobiaceae, including 'Ca. L. asiaticus' and Agrobacterium spp. Ectopic expression of the 'Ca. L. asiaticus' cpaF gene, an ATPase essential for the biogenesis and secretion of the Tad pilus, restored the adherence phenotype in cpaF mutant of A. tumefaciens, indicating CpaF of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' was functional and critical for bacterial adherence mediated by Tad pilus. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that 'Ca. L. asiaticus' Tad pilus-encoding genes and 'Ca. L. asiaticus' pilin gene flp3 were upregulated in psyllids compared with in planta. A bacterial one-hybrid assay showed that 'Ca.

Negative regulation of the flp3 promoter by both VisN and VisR was demonstrated using a shuttle strategy, with analysis of the phenotypes and immunoblotting together with quantification of the expression of the flp3 promoter fused to the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Comparative expression analysis confirmed that 'Ca. L. asiaticus' visNR was less expressed in the psyllid than in the plant host. Further, motility and biofilm phenotypes of the visNR mutant of A. tumefaciens were fully complemented by expressing 'Ca. L. asiaticus' visNR together. The physical interaction between VisN and VisR was confirmed by pull-down and stability assays. The interaction of the flp3 promoter with VisR was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

The success of microbes in biofilms results from properties that are inherent in the biofilm, including enhanced interaction, protection, and biodiversity. Given the diversity of microbes that live in biofilms in harsh environments on the Earth, it is logical to hypothesize that, if microbes inhabit other bodies in the Universe, there are also biofilms on those bodies. The Biofilm Organisms Surfing Space experiment was conducted as part of the EXPOSE-R2 mission on the International Space Station. The experiment was an international collaboration designed to perform a comparative study regarding the survival of biofilms versus planktonic cells of various microorganisms, exposed to space and Mars-like conditions. The objective was to determine whether there are lifestyle-dependent differences to cope with the unique mixture of stress factors, including desiccation, temperature oscillations, vacuum, or a Mars-like gas atmosphere and pressure in combination with extraterrestrial or Mars-like ultraviolet (UV) radiation residing during the long-term space mission. In this study, the outcome of the flight and mission ground reference analysis of Deinococcus geothermalis is presented. Cultural tests demonstrated that D. geothermalis remained viable in the desiccated state, being able to survive space and Mars-like conditions and tolerating high extraterrestrial UV radiation for more than 2 years. Culturability decreased, but was better preserved, in the biofilm consortium than in planktonic cells. These results are correlated to differences in genomic integrity after exposure, as visualized by random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, cultivation-independent viability markers such as membrane integrity, ATP content, and intracellular esterase activity remained nearly unaffected, indicating that subpopulations of the cells had survived in a viable but nonculturable state. These findings support the hypothesis of long-term survival of microorganisms under the harsh environmental conditions in space and on Mars to a higher degree if exposed as biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Corinna Panitz"},{"name":"Jan Frösler"},{"name":"Jost Wingender"},{"name":"Hans-Curt Flemming"},{"name":"Petra Rettberg"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Desiccation"},{"word":"EXPOSE-R2"},{"word":"Extraterrestrial UV radiation"},{"word":"ISS"},{"word":"Mars"},{"word":"Planktonic cells"},{"word":"Space"}]},"article313":{"pmid":"30925037","title":"Going Viral: Emerging Opportunities for Phage-Based Bacterial Control in Water Treatment and Reuse.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"Water security to protect human lives and support sustainable development is one of the greatest global challenges of this century. While a myriad of water pollutants can impact public health, the greatest threat arises from pathogenic bacteria that can be harbored in different components of water treatment, distribution, and reuse systems. Bacterial biofilms can also promote water infrastructure corrosion and biofouling, which substantially increase the cost and complexity of many critical operations. Conventional disinfection and microbial control approaches are often insufficient to keep up with the increasing complexity and renewed relevance of this pressing challenge. For example, common disinfectants cannot easily penetrate and eradicate biofilms, and are also relatively ineffective against resistant microorganisms. The use of chemical disinfectants is also curtailed by regulations aimed at minimizing the formation of harmful disinfection byproducts. Furthermore, disinfectants cannot be used to kill problematic bacteria in biological treatment processes without upsetting system performance. This underscores the need for novel, more precise, and more sustainable microbial control technologies. Bacteriophages (phages), which are viruses that exclusively infect bacteria, are the most abundant (and perhaps the most underutilized) biological resource on Earth, and hold great promise for targeting problematic bacteria. Although phages should not replace broad-spectrum disinfectants in drinking water treatment, they offer great potential for applications where selective targeting of problematic bacteria is warranted and antimicrobial chemicals are either relatively ineffective or their use would result in unintended detrimental consequences. Promising applications for phage-based biocontrol include selectively suppressing bulking and foaming bacteria that hinder activated sludge clarification, mitigating proliferation of antibiotic resistant strains in biological wastewater treatment systems where broad-spectrum antimicrobials would impair pollutant biodegradation, and complementing biofilm eradication efforts to delay corrosion and biofouling. Phages could also mitigate harmful cyanobacteria blooms that produce toxins in source waters, and could also serve as substitutes for the prophylactic use of antibiotics and biocides in animal agriculture to reduce their discharge to source waters and the associated selective pressure for resistant bacteria. Here, we consider the phage life cycle and its implications for bacterial control, and elaborate on the biochemical basis of such potential application niches in the water supply and reuse cycle. We also discuss potential technological barriers for phage-based bacterial control and suggest strategies and research needs to overcome them.","authors":[{"name":"Jacques Mathieu"},{"name":"Pingfeng Yu"},{"name":"Pengxiao Zuo"},{"name":"Marcio L B Da Silva"},{"name":"Pedro J J Alvarez"}],"keywords":[]},"article314":{"pmid":"30924807","title":"Evaluation of biocidal efficacy of Chloramine T trihydrate on planktonic and sessile bacteria in a model cooling tower water system.","date":"2019-05-29","abs":"A model cooling tower system was experimentally seeded with Legionella pneumophila and real industrial cooling tower (CT) water has been run at the closest to full-scale system operating conditions.

TAAs, are modular homotrimeric virulence factors, containing a signal peptide, complex stalk, and conserved membrane anchoring domain. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying the evolvement of these adhesins are not clear. Here, we showed that TAA genes were laterally acquired and underwent gene duplication and recombination. The heterogeneity of TAA nucleotide sequences, GC content, codon usage, and the probability of recombination and duplication events were assessed by MEGA7. Given the heterogeneity of sequences, we used all-against-all BLAST for clustering the TAAs. The pattern of distribution of TAAs are highly scattered; GC content and codon usage for these genes are variable. Multiple events of lateral gene transfer from the early history of Acinetobacter and the occurrence of gene duplication, gene loss, and recombination after acquiring the alien genes may explain the scattered pattern of distribution of TAAs. Additionally, this gene is not present in many clinical isolates of A. baumannii, thus is not a single virulence factor attributing to the infection. The advantage of harboring such genes might be adopting to different environments by developing the biofilm communities.

While central to many biological phenomena, the factors which govern microbial surface attachment are still not fully understood. This lack of understanding is a direct consequence of the complex nature of cell-surface interactions, which can involve both specific and non-specific interactions. For applications involving micro- and nano-structured surfaces, developing an understanding of such phenomenon is further complicated by the diverse nature of surface architectures, surface chemistry, variation in cellular physiology, and the intended technological output. These factors are extremely important to understand in the emerging field of antibacterial nanostructured surfaces. The aim of this perspective is to re-frame the discussion surrounding the mechanism of nanostructured-microbial surface interactions. Broadly, the article reviews our current understanding of these phenomena, while highlighting the knowledge gaps surrounding the adhesive forces which govern bacterial-nanostructure interactions and the role of cell membrane rigidity in modulating surface activity. The roles of surface charge, cell rigidity, and cell-surface adhesion force in bacterial-surface adsorption are discussed in detail.

Plant exudates are essential in the dialogue between microbes and their host plant and, in particular, amino acids can play an important role in the chemotactic response of bacteria. Histidine, arginine, and aspartate, which are the three most abundant amino acids present in S. rostrata seed exudates, behave as chemoattractants toward A. caulinodans. A position-specific-iterated BLAST analysis of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) (chemoreceptors) in the genome of A. caulinodans was performed. Among the 43 MCP homologs, two MCPs harboring a dCache domain were selected as possible cognate amino acid MCPs. After analysis of relative gene expression levels and construction of a gene-deleted mutant strain, one of them, AZC_0821 designed as TlpH, was confirmed to be responsible for the chemotactic response to the three amino acids. In addition, it was found that these three amino acids can also influence chemotaxis of A. caulinodans independently of the chemosensory receptors, by being involved in the increase of the expression level of several che and fla genes involved in the chemotaxis pathway and flagella synthesis. Thus, the contribution of amino acids present in seed exudates is directly related to the role as chemoattractants and indirectly related to the role in the regulation of expression of key genes involved in chemotaxis and motility.

From a clinical perspective, bacteria from surgical specimens are cultured in a planktonic state to determine antibiotic sensitivity. However, S. aureus exists primarily as established biofilms in PJI. To address this dichotomy, we developed a prospective registry of total knee and hip arthroplasty PJI S. aureus isolates to quantify the activity of clinically important antibiotics against isolates grown as biofilms. S. aureus planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were assessed using clinical laboratory standard index assays for 10 antibiotics (cefazolin, clindamycin, vancomycin, rifampin, linezolid, nafcillin, gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and daptomycin). Mature biofilms of each strain were grown in vitro, after which biofilm MIC (MBIC) and biofilm MBC (MBBC) were determined. Overall, isolates grown as biofilms displayed larger variations in antibiotic MICs as compared to planktonic MIC values. Only rifampin, doxycycline, and daptomycin had measurable biofilm MIC values across all S. aureus isolates tested. Biofilm MBC observations complemented biofilm MIC observations; rifampin, doxycycline, and daptomycin were the only antibiotics with measurable biofilm MBC values. 90% of S. aureus biofilms could be killed by rifampin, 50% by doxycycline, and only 15% by daptomycin. Biofilm formation increased bacterial antibiotic tolerance nonspecifically across all antibiotics, in both MSSA and MRSA samples. Rifampin and doxycycline were the most effective antibiotics at killing established S. aureus biofilms. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We show that CB-origami directs curli subunit CsgA monomers to form oligomers and then accelerates fibril formation by increasing the proliferation rate of primary pathways. Fibrils grow either out from (departure mode) or towards the nucleators (arrival mode), implying two distinct roles of CsgB: as nucleation sites and as trap sites to capture growing nanofibrils in vicinity. Curli polymerization follows typical stop-and-go dynamics but exhibits a higher instantaneous elongation rate compared with independent fibril growth. This origami nucleator thus provides an in vitro platform for mechanistically probing molecular nucleation and controlling directional fibril polymerization for bionanotechnology.","authors":[{"name":"Xiuhai Mao"},{"name":"Ke Li"},{"name":"Mengmeng Liu"},{"name":"Xinyu Wang"},{"name":"Tianxin Zhao"},{"name":"Bolin An"},{"name":"Mengkui Cui"},{"name":"Yingfeng Li"},{"name":"Jiahua Pu"},{"name":"Jiang Li"},{"name":"Lihua Wang"},{"name":"Timothy K Lu"},{"name":"Chunhai Fan"},{"name":"Chao Zhong"}],"keywords":[]},"article332":{"pmid":"30918210","title":"Effect of water temperature during ultrasonic denture cleaning.","date":"2019-08-13","abs":"Denture plaque is a biofilm composed of various microorganisms aggregated with saliva.

Zinc pyrithione is classified as a metal biocide with bactericidal, algicidal, and fungicidal actions. It has been formulated in antifouling paints, which prevent the formation of biofilms in submerged structures, and has also been used for dermocosmetic purposes, in shampoos for the treatment of dandruff and seborrhea.

Pneumocin production is controlled by a quorum sensing system encoded by the blp locus. Although the locus is found in all pneumococci, there is significant variability in the repertoire of pneumocins and associated immunity proteins encoded in the Bacteriocin Immunity Region (BIR) and in the presence or absence of a functional Blp transporter. Strains without an active Blp transporter are inactive in plate overlay assays and rely on a homologous transporter that is only produced during brief periods of competence to stimulate the blp locus and secrete pneumocins. The variability of the locus suggests that selective pressure is influencing the content to promote the optimal competitive environment. Much of the variability in the blp locus has been described at the genome level; the phenotypic activity attributable to the various BIR genes has not been fully described. To examine the role of the predicted pneumocin peptides in competition, 454 isolates were screened for competence independent blp pheromone secretion using plate assays. Active strains were characterized for inhibition, BIR content, BlpC pherotype and serotype. Deletion analysis on inhibitory strains demonstrated that BlpI and BlpJ peptides function as a two-peptide bacteriocin and that BlpIJ immunity is encoded by the co-transcribed blpU4/5 genes. BlpIJ secretion promotes inhibitory activity against the majority of pneumococcal isolates when expressed in a Blp transporter intact background. Intermediate levels of competition in biofilms were noted when BlpIJ containing strains carried the non-functional Blp transporter. Based on genome data, the combination of BlpIJ in a Blp transporter intact strain is surprisingly rare, despite clear advantages during colonization and biofilm growth. In contrast, we show that the blpK/pncF operon encoding the single-peptide pneumocin BlpK and its immunity protein is found in the majority of isolates.

Our antimicrobial urinary catheter (AUC) impregnated with rifampicin, triclosan, and sparfloxacin has demonstrated long-term protective activity against major uropathogens. This study aimed to firstly assess the ability of the AUC to resist mineral encrustation in the presence and absence of bacteria. Secondly, it aimed to investigate the AUC's anti-biofilm activity against multi-drug resistant organisms. There was no difference in surface roughness between AUC and control segments. In a static and a perfusion model, phosphate deposition was significantly reduced on AUCs challenged with P. mirabilis. Furthermore, none of the AUCs blocked during the 28 day test period, unlike controls. The AUC prevented colonisation by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli, and carbapenemase-producing E. coli for 12 consecutive weekly challenges. All three drugs impregnated into the catheter continued to exert protective activity throughout 12 weeks of constant perfusion. The drugs appear to migrate into the crystalline biofilm to continually protect against bacteria not it direct contact with the catheter surface. In conclusion, the AUC reduces mineral encrustation and may increase time to blockage in the presence of P. mirabilis, and does not predispose to mineral deposition under other conditions. It also offers 12 weeks of protection against multi-drug resistant bacteria. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Infection and associated mineral encrustation of urinary catheters are two serious complications of indwelling urinary catheters. Others have attempted to address this through various technologies such as coatings, dips, and surface modifications to prevent infection and/or encrustation. However, all current 'anti-infective' urinary catheter technologies are limited to short-term use. Some patients with spinal injuries, multiple sclerosis, stroke survivors and others use long-term catheters for 4-12 weeks at a time with multiple catheterisation possibly throughout the rest of their life. We present a urinary catheter for long-term use that is impregnated with three antimicrobials by a patient-protected process to prevent infection and encrustation for up to 12 weeks, the maximum lifetime of a long-term catheter before it is changed.","authors":[{"name":"Katherine Belfield"},{"name":"Xinyong Chen"},{"name":"Emily F Smith"},{"name":"Waheed Ashraf"},{"name":"Roger Bayston"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-infective agents"},{"word":"Atomic force"},{"word":"Catheter obstruction"},{"word":"Catheter-related infection"},{"word":"Catheters"},{"word":"Indwelling"},{"word":"Microscopy"},{"word":"Struvite"},{"word":"Urinary catheters"}]},"article349":{"pmid":"30913919","title":"Enhanced antibacterial properties and the cellular response of stainless steel through friction stir processing.","date":"2019-09-26","abs":"Biofilm related bacterial infection is one of the primary causes of implant failure.

The processed stainless steel demonstrated improved antibacterial properties for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, significantly impeding biofilm formation during the in vitro study. Also, the processed stainless steel showed better compatibility with human fibroblasts manifested through apparent cell spreading and proliferation. The substantial antibacterial properties of the processed steel are explained in terms of the favorable electronic characteristics of the metal-oxide and by using classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) and the extended DLVO (XDLVO) approach at the cell-substrate interface.","authors":[{"name":"Gopinath Perumal"},{"name":"Amrita Chakrabarti"},{"name":"Harpreet S Grewal"},{"name":"Soumya Pati"},{"name":"Shailja Singh"},{"name":"Harpreet S Arora"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Submerged friction stir processing"},{"word":"antimicrobial surface"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"surface wettability"}]},"article350":{"pmid":"30913545","title":"From molecules to multispecies ecosystems: the roles of structure in bacterial biofilms.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"Biofilms are communities of sessile microbes that are bound to each other by a matrix made of biopolymers and proteins. Spatial structure is present in biofilms on many lengthscales. These range from the nanometer scale of molecular motifs to the hundred-micron scale of multicellular aggregates. Spatial structure is a physical property that impacts the biology of biofilms in many ways. The molecular structure of matrix components controls their interaction with each other (thereby impacting biofilm mechanics) and with diffusing molecules such as antibiotics and immune factors (thereby impacting antibiotic tolerance and evasion of the immune system). The size and structure of multicellular aggregates, combined with microbial consumption of growth substrate, give rise to differentiated microenvironments with different patterns of metabolism and gene expression. Spatial association of more than one species can benefit one or both species, while distances between species can both determine and result from the transport of diffusible factors between species. Thus, a widespread theme in the biological importance of spatial structure in biofilms is the effect of structure on transport. We survey what is known about this and other effects of spatial structure in biofilms, from molecules up to multispecies ecosystems. We conclude with an overview of what experimental approaches have been developed to control spatial structure in biofilms and how these and other experiments can be complemented with computational work.","authors":[{"name":"Vernita Gordon"},{"name":"Layla Bakhtiari"},{"name":"Kristin Kovach"}],"keywords":[]},"article351":{"pmid":"30913464","title":"Inhibition of biofilm formation, quorum sensing activity and molecular docking study of isolated 3, 5, 7-Trihydroxyflavone from Alstonia scholaris leaf against P.aeruginosa.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The current study is to evaluate the inhibition of biofilm formation and quorum sensing activity of isolated 3, 5, 7-Trihydroxyflavone (TF) from A.scholaris leaf extract against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

It is known that the space environment affects microbial behavior, including growth rate, biofilm formation, virulence, drug resistance, and metabolism. However, the mechanisms of these alternations have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, it is beneficial to monitor microorganisms for preventing infections among astronauts in a space environment. Salmonella enteritidis is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that commonly causes acute gastroenteritis in humans. In this study, to better understand the effects of the space environment on S. enteritidis, a S. enteritidis strain was taken into space by the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft from 17 October 2016 to 18 November 2016, and a ground simulation with similar temperature conditions was simultaneously performed as a control. It was found that the flight strain displayed an increased growth rate, enhanced amikacin resistance, and some metabolism alterations compared with the ground strain. Enrichment analysis of proteome revealed that the increased growth rate might be associated with differentially expressed proteins involved in transmembrane transport and energy production and conversion assembly. A combined transcriptome and proteome analysis showed that the amikacin resistance was due to the downregulation of the oppA gene and oligopeptide transporter protein OppA.

Cooperative biofilm formation by Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis was documented in vitro using growth models and scanning electron microscopy. Analysis of growth rates by species-specific 16s rRNA probes revealed distinct, early advantages to consortium growth for S. gordonii and F. nucleatum with P. gingivalis, while P. gingivalis upregulated its short mfa1 fimbriae, leading to increased invasion of DCs. F. nucleatum was only taken up by DCs when in consortium with P. gingivalis. Mature consortium regressed DC maturation upon uptake, as determined by flow cytometry. Analysis of dental plaques of PD and healthy subjects by 16s rRNA confirmed oral colonization with consortium members, but DC hematogenous spread was limited to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. Expression of P. gingivalis mfa1 fimbriae was increased in dental plaques and hematogenous DCs of PD patients.

Here, we designed an experimental system in a wastewater treatment plant whereby nitrifying biofilms with different thicknesses (50 or 400 µm) were grown in a single reactor, and thus subjected to identical external conditions. The 50 and 400 µm biofilm communities were significantly different. This beta-diversity between biofilms of different thickness was primarily caused by deterministic factors. Turnover (species replacement) contributed more than nestedness (species loss) to the beta-diversity, i.e. the 50 µm communities were not simply a subset of the 400 µm communities. Moreover, the two communities differed in the composition of nitrogen-transforming bacteria and in nitrogen transformation rates.

Despite several studies examining the epa operon, many gene products of this operon remain annotated as hypothetical proteins.

Mutants with disruptions of epaQ were more susceptible to daptomycin relative to the wild type, suggesting its importance in biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the ΔepaQ mutant exhibited an altered biofilm architectural arrangement and formed small aggregates in liquid cultures. Our cumulative data show that epa mutations result in altered polysaccharide content, increased cell surface hydrophobicity, and decreased membrane potential.

Cytotoxicity of the extract to lung epithelial cells was also investigated. It was found that POE has bacteriostatic effects at MIC 1⁻2 mg/mL, recognized as of limited efficacy, but at MIC/subMICs it targeted virulence not viability. It usually decreased S. aureus adhesion and less frequently inhibited biofilm formation on native and protein-conditioned surfaces.

If the environment also contains a gradient of some inhibitor (e.g. a toxic drug), a tradeoff exists: the nutrient-rich tip is more exposed to the inhibitor, while the nutrient-starved region behind the front is less exposed. Here we show that this can lead to complex dynamics when the organism's response to the inhibitory substance is coupled to nutrient availability. We model a bacterial population which expands in a spatial gradient of antibiotic, under conditions where either fast-growing bacteria at the wave's tip, or slow-growing, resource-limited bacteria behind the front are more susceptible to the antibiotic. We find that growth-rate dependent susceptibility can have strong effects on the dynamics of the expanding population. If slow-growing bacteria are more susceptible, the population wave advances far into the inhibitory zone, leaving a trail of dead bacteria in its wake. In contrast, if fast-growing bacteria are more susceptible, the wave is blocked at a much lower concentration of antibiotic, but a large population of live bacteria remains behind the front. Our results may contribute to understanding the efficacy of different antimicrobials for spatially structured microbial populations such as biofilms, as well as the dynamics of ecological population expansions more generally.","authors":[{"name":"Patrick Sinclair"},{"name":"Martín Carballo-Pacheco"},{"name":"Rosalind J Allen"}],"keywords":[]},"article371":{"pmid":"30909130","title":"Marine vs freshwater microalgae exopolymers as biosolutions to microplastics pollution.","date":"2019-07-23","abs":"Microalgae can excrete exopolymer substances (EPS) with a potential to form hetero-aggregates with microplastic particles.

In this study, the influence of the microplastic particles type, size and density in the production of EPS and hetero-aggregates potential was studied. Most microalgae contaminated with microplastics displayed a cell abundance decrease (of up to 42%) in the cultures. The results showed that the formed aggregates were composed of microalgae and EPS (homo-aggregates) or a combination of microalgae, EPS and microplastics (hetero-aggregates). The hetero-aggregation was dependent on the size and yield production of EPS, which was species specific. Microcystis panniformis and Scenedesmus sp. exhibited small EPS, with a higher propension to disaggregate, and consequently lower capabilities to aggregate microplastics. Tetraselmis sp. displayed a higher ability to aggregate both low and high-density microplastics, being partially limited by the size of the microplastics. Gloeocapsa sp. had an outstanding EPS production and presented excellent microplastic aggregation capabilities (adhered onto the surface and also incorporated into the EPS). The results highlight the potential of microalgae to produce EPS and flocculate microplastics, contributing to their vertical transport and consequent deposition. Thus, this work shows the potential of microalgae as biocompatible solutions to water microplastics treatment.","authors":[{"name":"César Cunha"},{"name":"Marisa Faria"},{"name":"Natacha Nogueira"},{"name":"Artur Ferreira"},{"name":"Nereida Cordeiro"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biosolution"},{"word":"Exopolymers (EPS)"},{"word":"Hetero-aggregates"},{"word":"Microalgae"},{"word":"Microplastics"}]},"article372":{"pmid":"30909125","title":"Synergic degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in microbial fuel cells with intimately coupled photocatalytic-electrogenic anode.","date":"2019-10-31","abs":"A microbial fuel cell system with intimately coupled photocatalytic-electrogenic anode (photocatalytic-MFC) was proposed for the synergetic degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) which has a structure of three chlorine groups connecting to a phenol ring and is well recognized as a recalcitrant pollutant for its high toxicity, bioaccumulation and persistence.

The effect of enzymes was also evaluated on a subset of these strains in 20 times diluted TSB (1/20 TSB) at 25°C. The working concentrations of five enzymes were 1 U/100 μL for α-amylase, amyloglucosidase, cellulase, and DNase and 1 milli-Anson unit/100 μL for proteinase K. In addition, 24-h mature Salmonella Typhimurium biofilm on a stainless steel coupon was treated with proteinase K for 1 h at 25°C followed by 20 ppm of chlorine for 1 min at 25°C. The results showed that certain enzymes inhibited biofilm formation by the kitchen-originated bacteria; however, the enzymatic effect was diminished on the mature biofilms. Biofilm formation of V. parahaemolyticus was suppressed by all tested enzymes, whereas the mature biofilm was degraded by α-amylase, DNase I, and proteinase K. Proteinase K was effective in controlling Salmonella biofilms, whereas a strain-dependent variation was observed in S. aureus biofilms. In 1/20 TSB, Enterobacter cancerogenus and Kocuria varians were more susceptible to certain enzymes during biofilm formation than those in TSB, whereas the enzymatic effect was much decreased on 24-h mature biofilms, regardless of nutrient conditions. Furthermore, synergistic inactivation of Salmonella Typhimurium in biofilms was observed in the combined treatment of proteinase K followed by chlorine. Live/Dead assays also revealed a decrease in density and loss of membrane integrity in Salmonella Typhimurium biofilms exposed to the combined treatment.

The MgO nano-flowers powder was further characterized in this study by the X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In addition, bacteriological tests indicated that MgO nano-flowers significantly inhibited bacterial growth, biofilm formation, and motility of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which is the causal agent of bacterial blight disease in rice. The electronic microscopic observation showed that bacterial cell death may be mainly due to destroy of cell integrity, resulting in leakage of intracellular content.

Recently, biofilms of rod-shaped bacteria were observed at single-cell resolution and shown to develop from a disordered, two-dimensional layer of founder cells into a three-dimensional structure with a vertically-aligned core. Here, we elucidate the physical mechanism underpinning this transition using a combination of agent-based and continuum modeling. We find that verticalization proceeds through a series of localized mechanical instabilities on the cellular scale. For short cells, these instabilities are primarily triggered by cell division, whereas long cells are more likely to be peeled off the surface by nearby vertical cells, creating an inverse domino effect. The interplay between cell growth and cell verticalization gives rise to an exotic mechanical state in which the effective surface pressure becomes constant throughout the growing core of the biofilm surface layer. This dynamical isobaricity determines the expansion speed of a biofilm cluster and thereby governs how cells access the third dimension. In particular, theory predicts that a longer average cell length yields more rapidly expanding, flatter biofilms.

In addition, in seven rooms of the haemato-oncological ward, the effect of 24 h of stagnation on the antibiotic concentrations and MDR (multi-drug-resistant) bacteria in biofilms was evaluated. Whereas no antibiotic residues were found in the psychosomatic ward, potential selective concentrations of piperacillin, meropenem and ciprofloxacin were detected at a rehabilitation ward and ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim were present at a haemato-oncology ward. Antibiotic resistant bacteria were isolated from the siphons of all wards, however in the psychosomatic ward, only one MDR strain with resistance to piperacillin, third generation cephalosporins and quinolones (3MRGN) was detected. In contrast, the other two wards yielded 11 carbapenemase producing MDR isolates and 15 3MRGN strains. The isolates from the haemato-oncological ward belonged mostly to two specific rare sequence types (ST) (P. aeruginosa ST823 and Enterobacter cloacae complex ST167).

The processes of the re-equilibrium of Cd after a supplement of Cd and after an adjustment of solution pH were also investigated. The results showed both the migration of Cd from water to the solid materials, and the accumulation of Cd in the solid materials. (Modified) pseudo-second-order kinetic model can be used to simulate such processes. However, Cd content in biofilms and sediments varied in different ways: Cd in biofilms increased rapidly at first, then decreased, and finally approached constancy, while Cd in sediments increased slowly and continuously. The more the Cd was added in the water, the higher the Cd contents in solid phases, and the quicker the Cd accumulation and decrease process would be. The decrease of solution pH promoted the release of adsorbed Cd from the solid phases, especially from biofilms, while the increase of pH stimulated the migration of Cd to the solids. Therefore, as an indicator and temporary reservoir of trace metals in water, which respond rapidly to the variation of trace metal concentration in water, biofilms play a role in indicating and buffering the variation of trace metals in water. Although the response of sediments to the variation of metal concentration in water is very slow, most trace metals migrate to sediments eventually, thus sediments play a role as a more stable and massive reservoir for trace metals in water.","authors":[{"name":"Xiuyi Hua"},{"name":"Xiaomeng Huang"},{"name":"Jiaqing Tian"},{"name":"Deming Dong"},{"name":"Dapeng Liang"},{"name":"Zhiyong Guo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Dynamic process"},{"word":"Microcosm"},{"word":"Multi-phase"},{"word":"Sediments"},{"word":"Trace metals"}]},"article385":{"pmid":"30903911","title":"On-line monitoring of heavy metals-related toxicity with a microbial fuel cell biosensor.","date":"2019-07-24","abs":"This study describes an environmental biosensor for real time toxicity monitoring, which exploits high sensitivity of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) to variations in concentrations of electron donors and acceptors.

Traditional flocculation processes have the disadvantages of high chemical dosing and solid increase, thus affecting subsequent land application. Therefore, it is desirable to develop low-cost, biodegradable, nontoxic and environmentally friendly sludge conditioners. In this work, the chitosan (CTS) was chemically modified by incorporating functional groups (amino group and the carboxyl group) to improve its water solubility and flocculation efficiency, and the anaerobically digested sludge conditioning effectiveness of different chitosan based flocculants were comparatively investigated. Results indicated that aminated chitosan (CTS-DMDAAC) and CTS performed well in sludge dewatering improvement in terms of specific resistance to filtration (SRF) and Capillary suction time (CST), which decreased to a minimum when the concentration of conditioner reached to 35 mg/g TSS. Flocs conditioned by CTS-DMDAAC were more compact and aggregated more efficiently than that flocculated with CTS and C-CTS (carboxylated chitosan). CTS-DMDAAC and CTS interacted with extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) by charge neutralization and complexation adsorption, which caused the densification of gel-like structure and enhancement of floc strength of sludge. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis showed that after CTS-DMDAAC treatment, there were plentiful large pores distributed on floc surface, which provided channels for water release under pressure filtration. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed that protein-like substances were agglomerated under flocculation conditioning, which was responsible for the promotion of sludge dewatering performance.

Saccharides were identified to be the major driver of bacterial growth, although no single metabolite could be correlated with growth kinetics. The highest level of in planta colonization occurred on alfalfa sprouts, though internalization was 10 times more prevalent in the leafy vegetables than in sprouted seeds. Marked differences in in planta growth meant that the growth potential of STEC could be inferred only for sprouted seeds. In contrast, biofilm formation in extracts related to spinach colonization. Overall, the capacity of E. coli to colonize, grow, and be internalized within plants or plant-derived matrices was influenced by the isolate type, plant species, plant tissue type, and temperature, complicating any straightforward relationship between in vitro and in planta behaviors.","authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Merget"},{"name":"Ken J Forbes"},{"name":"Fiona Brennan"},{"name":"Sean McAteer"},{"name":"Tom Shepherd"},{"name":"Norval J C Strachan"},{"name":"Nicola J Holden"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EHEC"},{"word":"Escherichia coli O157:H7"},{"word":"alfalfa"},{"word":"fenugreek"},{"word":"lettuce"},{"word":"spinach"}]},"article394":{"pmid":"30902852","title":"An Osmoregulatory Mechanism Operating through OmpR and LrhA Controls the Motile-Sessile Switch in the Plant Growth-Promoting Bacterium Pantoea alhagi.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Adaptation to osmotic stress is crucial for bacterial growth and survival in changing environments. Although a large number of osmotic stress response genes have been identified in various bacterial species, how osmotic changes affect bacterial motility, biofilm formation, and colonization of host niches remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that the LrhA regulator is an osmoregulated transcription factor that directly binds to the promoters of the flhDC, eps, and opgGH operons and differentially regulates their expression, thus inhibiting motility and promoting exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, synthesis of osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs), biofilm formation, and root colonization of the plant growth-promoting bacterium Pantoea alhagi LTYR-11Z. Further, we observed that the LrhA-regulated OPGs control RcsCD-RcsB activation in a concentration-dependent manner, and a high concentration of OPGs induced by increased medium osmolarity is maintained to achieve the high level of activation of the Rcs phosphorelay, which results in enhanced EPS synthesis and decreased motility in P. alhagi Moreover, we showed that the osmosensing regulator OmpR directly binds to the promoter of lrhA and promotes its expression, while lrhA expression is feedback inhibited by the activated Rcs phosphorelay system. Overall, our data support a model whereby P. alhagi senses environmental osmolarity changes through the EnvZ-OmpR two-component system and LrhA to regulate the synthesis of OPGs, EPS production, and flagellum-dependent motility, thereby employing a hierarchical signaling cascade to control the transition between a motile lifestyle and a biofilm lifestyle.","authors":[{"name":"Shuyu Li"},{"name":"Hong Liang"},{"name":"Zhiyan Wei"},{"name":"Haonan Bai"},{"name":"Mengyun Li"},{"name":"Qiqi Li"},{"name":"Meng Qu"},{"name":"Xihui Shen"},{"name":"Yao Wang"},{"name":"Lei Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"LrhA"},{"word":"OPGs"},{"word":"OmpR"},{"word":"Rcs phosphorelay"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"osmosensing"}]},"article395":{"pmid":"30901676","title":"Rhamnolipid inspired lipopeptides effective in preventing adhesion and biofilm formation of Candida albicans.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Rhamnolipids are biodegradable low toxic biosurfactants which exert antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties. They have attracted much attention recently due to potential applications in areas of bioremediation, therapeutics, cosmetics and agriculture, however, the full potential of these versatile molecules is yet to be explored. Based on the facts that many naturally occurring lipopeptides are potent antimicrobials, our study aimed to explore the potential of replacing rhamnose in rhamnolipids with amino acids thus creating lipopeptides that would mimic or enhance properties of the parent molecule. This would allow not only for more economical and greener production but also, due to the availability of structurally different amino acids, facile manipulation of physico-chemical and biological properties. Our synthetic efforts produced a library of 43 lipopeptides revealing biologically more potent molecules. The structural changes significantly increased, in particular, anti-biofilm properties against Candida albicans, although surface activity of the parent molecule was almost completely abolished. Our findings show that the most active compounds are leucine derivatives of 3-hydroxy acids containing benzylic ester functionality. The SAR study demonstrated a further increase in activity with aliphatic chain elongation. The most promising lipopeptides 15, 23 and 36 at 12.5 µg/mL concentration allowed only 14.3%, 5.1% and 11.2% of biofilm formation, respectively after 24 h. These compounds inhibit biofilm formation by preventing adhesion of C. albicans to abiotic and biotic surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Milos Jovanovic"},{"name":"Jelena Radivojevic"},{"name":"Kevin O'Connor"},{"name":"Stevan Blagojevic"},{"name":"Biljana Begovic"},{"name":"Vera Lukic"},{"name":"Jasmina Nikodinovic-Runic"},{"name":"Vladimir Savic"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adhesion"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Lipopeptides"},{"word":"Rhamnolipids"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"30901585","title":"Reduced graphene oxide and biofilms as cathode catalysts to enhance energy and metal recovery in microbial fuel cell.","date":"2019-09-04","abs":"In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was developed and employed as cathode catalyst in a membrane-less microbial fuel cell (MFC) to improve energy and metal (copper) recovery in combined with biofilms.

The emergence of novel MDR strains and insufficient development of new antimicrobial agents are the major reasons that limit the choice of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infection. Thus, preserving the clinical value of current antibiotics could be one of the effective approaches to resolve this problem. Here we identified numerous novel small RNAs that were downregulated in the MDR clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeru), and we demonstrated that overexpression of one of these small RNAs (sRNAs), AS1974, was able to transform the MDR clinical strain to drug hypersusceptibility. AS1974 is the master regulator to moderate the expression of several drug resistance pathways, including membrane transporters and biofilm-associated antibiotic-resistant genes, and its expression is regulated by the methylation sites located at the 5' UTR of the gene. Our findings unravel the sRNA that regulates the MDR pathways in clinical isolates of P. aeru. Moreover, transforming bacterial drug resistance to hypersusceptibility using sRNA could be the potential approach for tackling MDR bacteria in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Carmen Oi Kwan Law"},{"name":"Chuan Huang"},{"name":"Qing Pan"},{"name":"Joseph Lee"},{"name":"Qin Hao"},{"name":"Ting-Fung Chan"},{"name":"Norman Wai Sing Lo"},{"name":"Irene Ling Ang"},{"name":"Alex Koon"},{"name":"Margaret Ip"},{"name":"Edwin Chan"},{"name":"Terrence Chi Kong Lau"}],"keywords":[]},"article398":{"pmid":"30901573","title":"Enhancing the hydrolysis of saline waste sludge with thermophilic bacteria pretreatment: New insights through the evolution of extracellular polymeric substances and dissolved organic matters transformation.","date":"2019-05-03","abs":"Recently, the treatment and utilization of saline waste sludge has drawn growing attention because large amounts of saline waste sludge were generated with the increase of saline wastewater discharge. In this study, thermophilic bacteria (TB) pretreatment was applied to accelerate the hydrolysis of saline waste sludge and the efficiency of hydrolysis at different salinities was evaluated. Compared with the group without salinity, the releasing of carbohydrate (up to a 67.0% decrease) in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was inhibited at the salinity ranging from 1.0% to 2.5%, and the releasing of protein (up to a 17.6% decrease) was inhibited under salinity conditions. Excess salinity (4.0%) caused the cell lysis, and the content of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), soluble carbohydrate and protein in dissolved organic matter (DOM) increased by 44.9%, 38.8% and 20.8% than that obtained without salinity, respectively. According to the excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy, the biodegradability of sludge was improved at 2.0% salinity. At 2.0% salinity, the maximum fluorescence intensity of soluble microbial byproduct substances (76,358.9 (au)) and the minimum fluorescence intensity of humic acid-like substances (173,424 (au)) were obtained. The increased salinity was beneficial for the sludge stabilization and was disadvantageous for the sludge reduction.","authors":[{"name":"Pengtao Gao"},{"name":"Liang Guo"},{"name":"Jian Sun"},{"name":"Yi Wang"},{"name":"Zonglian She"},{"name":"Mengchun Gao"},{"name":"Yangguo Zhao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salinity"},{"word":"Sludge hydrolysis"},{"word":"Sludge reduction"},{"word":"Thermophilic bacteria (TB)"}]},"article399":{"pmid":"30900762","title":"Trichoderma-Azotobacter biofilm inoculation improves soil nutrient availability and plant growth in wheat and cotton.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Microbial biofilms are gaining importance in agriculture, due to their multifaceted agronomic benefits and resilience to environmental fluctuations. This study focuses on comparing the influence of single inoculation-Azotobacter chroococcum (Az) or Trichoderma viride (Tv) and their biofilm (Tv-Az), on soil and plant metabolic activities in wheat and cotton grown under Phytotron conditions. Tv-Az proved superior to all the other treatments in terms of better colonisation, plant growth attributes and 10-40% enhanced availability of macronutrients and micronutrients in the soil, over control. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy showed that the cells attached to the root tips initially, followed by their proliferation along the surface of the roots. Soil polysaccharides, proteins and dehydrogenase activity showed several fold enhancement in Tv-Az biofilm inoculated samples. Time course studies revealed that the population of Az and Tv in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere was significantly higher with a 0.14-0.31 log colony-forming unit (CFU) increase in the biofilm-inoculated treatment in both crops. Enhancement in soil biological activities was facilitated by the improved colonisation of the biofilm, due to the synergistic association between Tv and Az. This demonstrates the utility of Tv-Az biofilm as a multifunctional plant growth promoting and soil fertility enhancing option in agriculture.","authors":[{"name":"Kulandaivelu Velmourougane"},{"name":"Radha Prasanna"},{"name":"Gautam Chawla"},{"name":"Lata Nain"},{"name":"Arun Kumar"},{"name":"Anil Kumar Saxena"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PEP carboxylase"},{"word":"macro- and micronutrients"},{"word":"microbial biofilms"},{"word":"polysaccharides"},{"word":"rhizosphere"}]}}
