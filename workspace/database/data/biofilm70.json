In order to more accurately identify the genes and pathways involved in the initiation of this multicellular developmental program in M. xanthus, we adapted a method of growing vegetative populations within a constant controllable environment by using flow cell bioreactors, or flow cells.

This approach allows for greater sensitivity in investigating communal environmental responses, such as nutrient sensing. To demonstrate the versatility of our growth environment, we carried out time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy to visualize M. xanthus biofilm growth and fruiting body development, as well as fluorescence staining of exopolysaccharides deposited by biofilms. We also employed the flow cells in a nutrient titration to determine the minimum concentration required to sustain vegetative growth.

Pyrosequencing was used to examine microbial communities in the columns and in soil from a soil aquifer treatment (SAT; a method of water treatment prior to reuse) site. Laboratory columns were supplied with different concentrations (0.25, 10, 100, or 1,000 μg liter(-1)) of each of 15 PPCPs. Five PPCPs (4-isopropyl-3-methylphenol [biosol], p-chloro-m-xylenol, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, and phenytoin) were not removed at any tested concentrations. Two PPCPs (naproxen and triclosan) exhibited removals independent of PPCP concentration. PPCP removal efficiencies were dependent on initial concentrations for biphenylol, p-chloro-m-cresol, chlorophene, diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, ibuprofen, and valproic acid, showing that PPCP concentration can affect biotransformation. Biofilms from sand samples collected from the 0.25- and 10-μg liter(-1) PPCP columns were pyrosequenced along with SAT soil samples collected on three consecutive days of a wetting and drying cycle to enable comparison of these two communities exposed to PPCPs. SAT communities were similar to column communities in taxonomy and phylotype composition, and both were found to contain close relatives of known PPCP degraders. The efficiency of biological removal of PPCPs was found to be dependent on the concentration at which the contamination occurs for some, but not all, PPCPs.","authors":[{"name":"Kathryn M Onesios-Barry"},{"name":"David Berry"},{"name":"Jody B Proescher"},{"name":"I K Ashok Sivakumar"},{"name":"Edward J Bouwer"}],"keywords":[]},"article7":{"pmid":"24509822","title":"Formation and release behavior of iron corrosion products under the influence of bacterial communities in a simulated water distribution system.","date":"2014-02-27","abs":"To understand the formation and release behavior of iron corrosion products in a drinking water distribution system, annular reactors (ARs) were used to investigate the development processes of corrosion products and biofilm community as well as the concomitant iron release behavior.

The presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB, e.g. Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum), sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB, e.g. Sulfuricella), and iron-oxidizing bacteria (IOB, e.g. Acidovorax, Gallionella, Leptothrix, and Sphaerotilus) in biofilms could speed up iron corrosion; however, iron-reducing bacteria (IRB, e.g. Bacillus, Clostridium, and Pseudomonas) could inhibit iron corrosion and iron release. Corrosion scales on iron coupons could develop into a two-layered structure (top layer and inner layer) with time. The relatively stable constituents such as goethite (α-FeOOH) and magnetite (Fe3O4) mainly existed in the top layers, while green rust (Fe6(OH)12CO3) mainly existed in the inner layers. The IOB (especially Acidovorax) contributed to the formation of α-FeOOH, while IRB and the anaerobic conditions could facilitate the formation of Fe3O4. Compared with the AR test without biofilms, the iron corrosion rate with biofilms was relatively higher (p < 0.05) during the whole experimental period, but the iron release with biofilms was obviously lower both at the initial stage and after 3 months.

Deletion of single or multiple genes in the operons bfrKRT and cemAKR did not affect cell morphology, growth or the sensitivity to various stressors. However, gene disruption affected biofilm formation; this effect was dependent on the carbon source. Deletion of bfrK or cemA increased sucrose-dependent biofilm formation in vitro.

Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive spore-forming anaerobic pathogen. This organism survives antibiotic treatment through the formation of biofilms or spores, but the environmental and regulatory factors involved in the biofilm formation remain unclear. Here, we observed that temperature regulates C. perfringens biofilm morphology. At 37°C, C. perfringens adhered to the substrate surface and formed a flat, thin biofilm, herein referred to as adhered biofilm. However, at 25°C, this bacterium did not adhere and produced a threadlike extracellular matrix, forming a viscous, thick biofilm, herein referred to as pellicle biofilm. Pellicle biofilm formation requires the sporulation master regulator, Spo0A, and the toxin regulator, CtrAB, and is enhanced in the absence of the global repressor, AbrB. These transcriptional regulator genes are regulated by each other and temperature. Adhered-biofilm formation requires AbrB and pilA2, which encodes a component of type IV pili (TFP). TFP expression was activated at 37°C and regulated through Spo0A, AbrB, and CtrAB. These results indicate that the morphology of C. perfringens biofilm is dependent on temperature through the differential production of extracellular matrix and the activity of TFP. Moreover, pellicle biofilm formation is involved in sporulation and toxin production. Here, we demonstrated that clostridial biofilm formation is closely associated with sporulation and that the morphological change of the biofilms could play an important role in the pathogenesis of this organism.

MIC values were determined through the guidelines of CLSI M100-S18 and M27-A3 protocols. BioTimer method was used to determine the MBIC values. The value of colony forming unit (CFU)/glass beads was calculated using the graphics drawn by plotting the time of color change for phenol red or resazurin against log10CFU. All experiments were done with four media at different pH values namely pH: 7, pH: 6.5, pH: 6 and pH: 5.5.

Treatment options are very limited for infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) A.baumannii strains. Until recently, the majority of studies related to A.baumannii have focused on antibiotic resistance, treatment protocols and epidemiological data, however, there have been few studies addressing the virulence factors of this organism. The features such as biofilm formation, serum resistance, motility, efflux pumps and iron acquisition mechanisms help the bacterium to survive in adverse environmental conditions and facilitate the development of an infection. The aim of the present study was to investigate the basic characteristics that contribute to the virulence of clinically important MDR A.baumannii isolates. Sixty-five ciprofloxacin-imipenem-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant A.baumannii strains isolated from various clinical specimens between December 2011 and March 2012 at Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology were included in the study. The clonal relationship of the isolates was analyzed by PCR using Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-2 primer. Biofilm formation, serum resistance, twitching and swarming motility, efflux pump and siderophore production were sought in representatives of each clone. Investigated MDR A.baumannii isolates were classified into seven main clusters, and the largest cluster included 86% of the strains. The virulence-associated features were investigated in 16 representative strains, including sub-groups. Twelve, three and one of the examined strains were determined to be strong, intermediate and weak biofilm producers, respectively. Siderophore production was not encountered in any of the isolates. Of the sixteen strains, two, one and thirteen isolates were found to be resistant, moderately susceptible and susceptible to bactericidal effect of serum, respectively. In our study, swarming motility was observed in seven strains while twitching motility was observed in only one strain. Swarming was simultaneously detected with twitching in one isolate. The presence of an efflux pump was investigated with ciprofloxacin in 16 representative strains but none of them were positive. However, eflux pump was determined in two of the five doxycycline resistant strains. Biofilm production was the most commonly observed characteristic among the examined strains. In addition, serum resistance, swarming and an efflux pump which has a spectrum including tetracyclines, were also determined among features associated with virulence. While the biofilm production was encountered at the members of all clones, serum resistance was found only in the representatives of the most dominant clone. Motility and the presence of an efflux pump were not associated with a particular clone. MDR A.baumannii strains are among the most important agents of nosocomial infections in our hospital and all over the world. Revealing the characteristics that play a role in the pathogenesis of these isolates, will contribute to infection control measures and to the investigation of new treatment options.

Biofilm formation is the primary cause of several persistent infections found in humans. We derive a mathematical model of biofilm and surrounding fluid dynamics to investigate the effect of a periodic dose of antibiotic on elimination of microbial population from biofilm. The growth rate of bacteria in biofilm is taken as Monod type for the limiting nutrient. The pharmacodynamics function is taken to be dependent both on limiting nutrient and antibiotic concentration. Assuming that flow rate of fluid compartment is large enough, we reduce the six dimensional model to a three dimensional model. Mathematically rigorous results are derived providing sufficient conditions for treatment success. Persistence theory is used to derive conditions under which the periodic solution for treatment failure is obtained. We also discuss the phenomenon of bi-stability where both infection-free state and infection state are locally stable when antibiotic dosing is marginal. In addition, we derive the optimal antibiotic application protocols for different scenarios using control theory and show that such treatments ensure bacteria elimination for a wide variety of cases.

Finally, we examine factors which if changed can result in treatment success of the previously treatment failure cases for the non-optimal technique.

AI-2 is produced by the methylthioadenosine/S-adenosyl-homocysteine nucleosidase LuxS. In the present study, we characterise the function of bifidobacterial LuxS proteins to address the question whether these economically important bacteria are able to perform QS communication. All publically available genome sequences of bifidobacteria harbour putative luxS genes. The deduced amino acid sequences are well conserved in the genus and show good homology to the LuxS protein of the prototypical AI-2 producer Vibrio harveyi. The luxS genes of three bifidobacterial strains were successfully expressed in AI-2-negative Escherichia coli DH5α. Supernatants of these recombinant E. coli strains contained significant AI-2 activity. In initial experiments, we failed to detect AI-2 activity in supernatants of bifidobacteria grown in MRSc. High concentration of glucose as well as acidic pH had strong inhibitory effects on AI-2 activity. AI-2 activity could be detected when lower volumes of supernatants were used in the assay. Homologous overexpression of luxS in Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 increased AI-2 levels in the supernatant. Furthermore, over-expression of luxS or supplementation with AI-2-containing supernatants enhanced biofilm formation of B. longum NCC2705. Collectively, these results suggest that bifidobacteria indeed harbour functional luxS genes that are involved in the production of AI-2-like molecules. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report on AI-2 activity produced by bifidobacteria. Self-produced AI-2 activity as well as AI-2-like molecules of other bacteria of the intestinal tract may have a regulatory function in biofilm formation and host colonization by bifidobacteria.

During the past 15 years, particularly aggressive strains transmitted among CF patients have been identified, initially in Europe and more recently in Canada. The aim of this study was to generate high-quality genome sequences for 7 isolates of the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) from the United Kingdom and Canada representing different virulence characteristics in order to: (1) associate comparative genomics results with virulence factor variability and (2) identify genomic and/or phenotypic divergence between the two geographical locations. We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine, pyocyanin, motility, biofilm formation, and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40-50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages, which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms, of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level, isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility, while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable. Most regulatory mutations were isolate-specific and 29% of them were predicted to have high functional impact. Therefore, polymorphism in regulatory genes is likely to be an important basis for phenotypic diversity among LES isolates, which in turn might contribute to this strain's adaptability to varying conditions in the CF lung.

To accomplish this goal, we used an in vitro model where magnesium allowed modulation of the proportion of dormant bacteria within S. epidermidis biofilms. Significant differences were found in the expression of 147 genes. A detailed analysis of the results was performed based on direct and functional gene interactions. Biological processes among the differentially expressed genes were mainly related to oxidation-reduction processes and acetyl-CoA metabolic processes. Gene set enrichment revealed that the translation process is related to the proportion of dormant bacteria. Transcription of mRNAs involved in oxidation-reduction processes was associated with higher proportions of dormant bacteria within S. epidermidis biofilm. Moreover, the pH of the culture medium did not change after the addition of magnesium, and genes related to magnesium transport did not seem to impact entrance of bacterial cells into dormancy.

Despite the development of more effective new antifungal agents, fluconazole (FLC) is still widely used in the clinic because of its efficacy and low toxicity. However, as the number of patients treated with FLC has increased, FLC-resistant Candida albicans isolates emerge more frequently. In addition, biofilm-associated infections are commonly encountered and their resistance poses a great challenge to antifungal treatment. Various approaches have been proposed to increase the susceptibility of C. albicans to FLC in order to cope with treatment failures, among which is the combination of FLC with different classes of non-antifungal agents such as antibacterials, calcineurin inhibitors, heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, calcium homeostasis regulators and traditional Chinese medicine drugs. Interestingly, many of these combinations showed synergistic effects against C. albicans, especially resistant strains. The main mechanisms of these synergistic effects appear to be increasing the permeability of the membrane, reducing the efflux of antifungal drugs, interfering with intracellular ion homeostasis, inhibiting the activity of proteins and enzymes required for fungal survival, and inhibiting biofilm formation. These modes of action and the antifungal mechanisms of various compounds referenced in this paper highlight the idea that the reversal of fungal resistance can be achieved through various mechanisms. Studies examining drug interactions will hopefully provide new approaches against antifungal drug resistance as well as insight into antifungal agent discovery.

First, the quality of hot-dip galvanized (HDG) coatings was studied. Their microstructure, defects, and common types of corrosion were observed. It was shown that many manufactured tubes do not reach European standard (NBN EN 10240), which is the cause of several corrosion problems. The average thickness of zinc layer was found at 41μm against 55μm prescribed by the European standard. However, lack of quality, together with the usual corrosion types known for HDG steel tubes was not sufficient to explain the high corrosion rate (reaching 20μm per year versus 10μm/y for common corrosion types). Electrochemical tests were also performed to understand the corrosion behaviours occurring in galvanized steel tubes. Results have shown that the limiting step was oxygen diffusion, favouring the growth of anaerobic bacteria in steel tubes. EDS analysis was carried out on corroded coatings and has shown the presence of sulphur inside deposits, suggesting the likely bacterial activity. Therefore biocorrosion effects have been investigated. Actually sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) can reduce sulphate contained in water to hydrogen sulphide (H2S), causing the formation of metal sulphides. Although microbial corrosion is well-known in sea water, it is less investigated in supply water. Thus, an experimental water main was kept in operation for 6months.

We found that biofilms readily formed in all strains analyzed, and that spores were abundant within about 6 days. We also found that extracellular DNA (eDNA), polysaccharide and protein was readily detected in the matrix of all strains, including the major toxins A and/or B, in toxigenic strains. All the strains we analyzed formed spores. Apart from strains 630 and VPI10463, which sporulated in the biofilm at relatively low frequencies, the frequencies of biofilm sporulation varied between 46 and 65%, suggesting that variations in sporulation levels among strains is unlikely to be a major factor in variation in the severity of disease. Spores in biofilms also had reduced germination efficiency compared to spores obtained by a conventional sporulation protocol. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that in 3 day-old biofilms, the outermost structure of the spore is a lightly staining coat. However, after 6 days, material that resembles cell debris in the matrix surrounds the spore, and darkly staining granules are closely associated with the spores surface. In 14 day-old biofilms, relatively few spores are surrounded by the apparent cell debris, and the surface-associated granules are present at higher density at the coat surface. Finally, we showed that biofilm cells possess 100-fold greater resistance to the antibiotic metronidazole then do cells cultured in liquid media.

Transcriptional fusion assays, Western blots and hemolysis assays confirmed that SinR controls Hbl expression, together with PlcR, the main virulence regulator in B. thuringiensis. We show that Hbl is expressed in a sustained way in a small subpopulation of the biofilm, whereas almost all the planktonic population transiently expresses Hbl. The gene coding for SinI, an antagonist of SinR, is expressed in the same biofilm subpopulation as hbl, suggesting that hbl transcription heterogeneity is SinI-dependent. B. thuringiensis and B. cereus are enteric bacteria which possibly form biofilms lining the host intestinal epithelium. Toxins produced in biofilms could therefore be delivered directly to the target tissue.

In this study, the role of oxidative stress resistance in biofilm formation was investigated using mutants defective in catalase (KatA), superoxide dismutase (SodB), and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC). Biofilm formation was substantially increased in an ahpC mutant compared to the wild type, and katA and sodB mutants. In contrast to the augmented biofilm formation of the ahpC mutant, a strain overexpressing ahpC exhibited reduced biofilm formation. A perR mutant and a CosR-overexpression strain, both of which upregulate ahpC, also displayed decreased biofilms. However, the introduction of the ahpC mutation to the perR mutant and the CosR-overexpression strain substantially enhanced biofilm formation. The ahpC mutant accumulated more total reactive oxygen species and lipid hydroperoxides than the wild type, and the treatment of the ahpC mutant with antioxidants reduced biofilm formation to the wild-type level. Confocal microscopy analysis showed more microcolonies were developed in the ahpC mutant than the wild type. These results successfully demonstrate that AhpC plays an important role in the biofilm formation of C. jejuni.

Here we report that BswR, a xenobiotic response element-type transcriptional regulator, plays a critical role in regulation of bacterial motility and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses showed that BswR counteracts the repressor activity of MvaT, controls the transcription of small RNA rsmZ and regulates the biogenesis of bacterial flagella. The crystal structure of BswR was determined at 2.3 Å resolution; the monomer comprises a DNA-binding domain with a helix-turn-helix motif in the N terminus and two helices (α6 and α7) with a V-shaped arrangement in the C-terminus. In addition to the contacts between the parallel helices α5 of two monomers, the two helical extensions (α6 and α7) intertwine together to form a homodimer, which is the biological function unit. Based on the result of DNase I protection assay together with structural analysis of BswR homodimer, we proposed a BswR-DNA model, which suggests a molecular mechanism with which BswR could interact with DNA.

In CF, such isolates can become mucoid through mutation of one of the genes (mucA, mucB, mucC, or mucD) that produce regulatory factors that sequester AlgU, required for increased expression of alginate genes. Mutation of the muc genes in the nonmucoid PAO1, PA14, PAKS-1, and Ps388 strains led to increased levels of extracellular alginate and an obvious mucoid phenotype, but only under iron-limiting growth conditions (≤5 µM), not under iron-replete conditions (≥10 µM). In contrast, >50% of P. aeruginosa isolates from chronic CF pulmonary infections expressed increased levels of alginate and mucoidy both under iron-limiting and iron-replete conditions (i.e., iron-constitutive phenotype). No single iron regulatory factor (e.g., Fur, PvdS) was associated with this loss of iron-regulated alginate expression and mucoidy in these CF isolates. However, the loss of only pyoverdine production, or its uptake, abrogated the ability of P. aeruginosa to produce a robust biofilm that represents the Psl-type of biofilm. In contrast, we show that mutation of the pyoverdine and pyochelin biosynthesis genes and the pyoverdine receptor (FpvA) lead to iron-constitutive expression of the key alginate biosynthesis gene, algD, and an explicitly mucoid phenotype in both iron-limiting and iron-replete conditions. These data indicate that alginate production and mucoidy, in contrast to other types of biofilms produced by P. aeruginosa, are substantially enhanced under iron limitation. These results also have compelling implications in relation to the use of iron chelators in the treatment of P. aeruginosa CF infections.","authors":[{"name":"Jacinta R Wiens"},{"name":"Adriana I Vasil"},{"name":"Michael J Schurr"},{"name":"Michael L Vasil"}],"keywords":[]},"article49":{"pmid":"24496713","title":"Biofilm growth: a multi-scale and coupled fluid-structure interaction and mass transport approach.","date":"2014-06-03","abs":"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for modelling biofilm growth. It is based on a finite element method and includes both fluid-structure interaction (FSI) as well as scalar transport effects. Due to the different time-scales of the involved phenomena, the growth of the biofilm structure is coupled with the FSI and mass transport through a multi-scale approach in time. In each hydrodynamic time step, first the non-linear FSI problem is solved followed by the scalar transport equations, using the information on velocities and deformations obtained in the FSI step. After a steady state solution is reached, information on mass fluxes and stresses are passed to the growth model. At this point, the growth is calculated for a biological time step larger than the hydrodynamic one and based on the mass flux through the interface and on normal and shear stresses on it. This type of approach can significantly contribute to the understanding of biofilm development in fluid flows, since the influence of hydrodynamic conditions and availability of nutrients is well known to have effects on biofilm development. Therefore, for the purpose of understanding biofilm macro-scale dynamics, it is essential to adopt a modeling approach, which takes into account all the relevant aspects, like fluid flow, structure deformation, mass transport and their effect on biofilm growth and erosion.

In this study, 454 pyrosequencing of the V1 to V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a shift in community composition with increasing pCO(2).

The first two genes of the 15-gene operon for extracellular polysaccharide synthesis, epsA and epsB, encode a putative transmembrane modulator protein and a putative protein tyrosine kinase, respectively, with similarity to the TkmA/PtkA modulator/kinase couple.

Pyocins are bacteriocins produced by P. aeruginosa that are usually released through lysis of the producer strains. Expression of pyocin genes is negatively regulated by PrtR, which gets cleaved under SOS response, leading to upregulation of pyocin synthetic genes. Previously, we demonstrated that PrtR is required for the expression of type III secretion system (T3SS), which is an important virulence component of P. aeruginosa. In this study, we demonstrate that mutation in prtR results in reduced bacterial colonization in a mouse acute pneumonia model. Examination of bacterial and host cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from infected mice revealed that expression of PrtR is induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) released by neutrophils. We further demonstrate that treatment with hydrogen peroxide or ciprofloxacin, known to induce the SOS response and pyocin production, resulted in an elevated PrtR mRNA level. Overexpression of PrtR by a tac promoter repressed the endogenous prtR promoter activity, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that PrtR binds to its own promoter, suggesting an autorepressive mechanism of regulation. A high level of PrtR expressed from a plasmid resulted in increased T3SS gene expression during infection and higher resistance against ciprofloxacin. Overall, our results suggest that the autorepression of PrtR contributes to the maintenance of a relatively stable level of PrtR, which is permissive to T3SS gene expression in the presence of ROS while increasing bacterial tolerance to stresses, such as ciprofloxacin, by limiting pyocin production.

In the present study we took a reductionist approach and identified a considerably conserved metabolic gene, spxB to be encoded by a majority of oral streptococci using the HOMD metagenome information. spxB encodes the pyruvate oxidase responsible for the production of growth inhibiting amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and has previously been shown as important in the interspecies competition in the oral biofilm. Here we demonstrate a strong correlation of H2O2 production and the presence of the spxB gene in dental plaque. Using Real-Time RT PCR we show that spxB is expressed in freshly isolated human plaque samples from several donors and that the expression is relative constant when followed over time in one individual. This is the first demonstration of an oral community encoded gene expressed in vivo suggesting a functional role of spxB in oral biofilm physiology. This also demonstrates a possible strategy to connect the microbial potential of the metagenome to its functionality in future studies by identifying similar highly conserved genes in the oral microbial community.

To better understand the genetic determinants that affect biomaterial attachment, we performed a transposon mutagenesis analysis of abiotic surface-colonization using A. baumannii strain 98-37-09. Disruption of an RNase T2 family gene was found to limit the organism's ability to colonize polystyrene, polypropylene, glass, and stainless steel surfaces. DNA microarray analyses revealed that in comparison to wild type and complemented cells, the RNase T2 family mutant exhibited reduced expression of 29 genes, 15 of which are predicted to be associated with bacterial attachment and surface-associated motility. Motility assays confirmed that RNase T2 mutant displays a severe motility defect. Taken together, our results indicate that the RNase T2 family protein identified in this study is a positive regulator of A. baumannii's ability to colonize inanimate surfaces and motility. Moreover, the enzyme may be an effective target for the intervention of biomaterial colonization, and consequently limit the organism's transmission within the hospital setting.

Methods. Biofilm production was carried out on polystyrene tissue culture plates. Five L. monocytogenes isolates were tested for biofilm formation after being exposed to acidic and osmotic stress conditions. Results. Significant differences (P < 0.01) between clinical and food isolates were observed.

We report that RydC reduces expression of curli-specific gene D transcription factor required for adhesion and biofilm production in enterobacteria. During curli formation, csgD messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis increases when endogenous levels of RydC are lacking. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, stimulation of RydC expression also reduces biofilm formation by impairing curli synthesis. Inducing RydC early on in growth lowers CsgA, -B and -D protein and mRNA levels. RydC's 5'-domain interacts with csgD mRNA translation initiation signals to prevent initiation. Translation inhibition occurs by an antisense mechanism, blocking the translation initiation signals through pairing, and that mechanism is facilitated by Hfq. Although Hfq represses csgD mRNA translation without a small RNA (sRNA), it forms a ternary complex with RydC and facilitates pseudoknot unfolding to interact with the csgD mRNA translation initiation signals. RydC action implies Hfq-assisted unfolding and mRNA rearrangements, but once the pseudoknot is disrupted, Hfq is unnecessary for regulation. RydC is the sixth sRNA that negatively controls CsgD synthesis. Hfq induces structural changes in the mRNA domains targeted by these six sRNAs. What we describe is an ingenious process whereby pseudoknot opening is orchestrated by a chaperone to allow RNA control of gene expression.

In this study, we investigated the roles of TapA sequences from the C-terminal and N-terminal ends and TapA cysteine residues in its ability to promote the assembly of TasA amyloid-like fibers. We found that the cysteine residues are not essential for the formation of TasA fibers, as their replacement by alanine residues resulted in only minor defects in biofilm formation. Mutating sequences in the C-terminal half had no effect on biofilm formation. However, we identified a sequence of 8 amino acids in the N terminus that is key for TasA fiber formation. Strains expressing TapA lacking these 8 residues were completely defective in biofilm formation. In addition, this TapA mutant protein exhibited a dominant negative effect on TasA fiber formation. Even in the presence of wild-type TapA, the mutant protein inhibited fiber assembly in vitro and delayed biofilm formation in vivo. We propose that this 8-residue sequence is crucial for the formation of amyloid-like fibers on the cell surface, perhaps by mediating the interaction between TapA or TapA and TasA molecules.

Current evidence favors a sequential model in which LapA is first required for the initial adhesion of individual bacteria to a surface, while LapF participates in later stages of biofilm development. In agreement with this model, lapF transcription was previously shown to take place at late times of growth and to respond to the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. We have now analyzed the transcription pattern of lapA and other regulatory elements that influence expression of both genes. The lapA promoter shows a transient peak of activation early during growth, with a second increase in stationary phase that is independent of RpoS. The same pattern is observed in biofilms although expression is not uniform in the population. Both lapA and lapF are under the control of the two-component regulatory system GacS/GacA, and their transcription also responds to the intracellular levels of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), although in surprisingly reverse ways. Whereas expression from the lapA promoter increases with high levels of c-di-GMP, the opposite is true for lapF. The transcriptional regulator FleQ is required for the modulation of lapA expression by c-di-GMP but has a minor influence on lapF.

Biofilm formation rates (BFR) at 10 μg C liter(-1) per substrate were ranked as follows, from lowest to highest: blank or amylopectin (≤6 pg ATP cm(-2) day(-1)), gelatin or caseinate, laminarin, maltose, acetate alone or acetate plus amylopectin, and maltose plus amylopectin (980 pg ATP cm(-2) day(-1)). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses revealed that the predominant maltose-utilizing bacteria also dominated subsequent amylopectin utilization, indicating catabolic repression and (extracellular) enzyme induction. The accelerated BFR with amylopectin in the presence of maltose probably resulted from efficient amylopectin binding to and hydrolysis by inductive enzymes attached to the bacterial cells. Cytophagia, Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Sphingobacteriia grew during polysaccharide addition, and Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, Cytophagia, Flavobacteriia, and Sphingobacteriia grew during protein addition. The succession of bacterial populations in the biofilms coincided with the decrease in the specific growth rate during biofilm formation. Biopolymers can clearly promote biofilm formation at microgram-per-liter levels in drinking water distribution systems and, depending on their concentrations, might impair the biological stability of distributed drinking water.","authors":[{"name":"Eveline L W Sack"},{"name":"Paul W J J van der Wielen"},{"name":"Dick van der Kooij"}],"keywords":[]},"article84":{"pmid":"24487536","title":"Acidic pH strongly enhances in vitro biofilm formation by a subset of hypervirulent ST-17 Streptococcus agalactiae strains.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a primary colonizer of the anogenital mucosa of up to 40% of healthy women and an important cause of invasive neonatal infections worldwide.

In recent years, the ability of GBS to form biofilm attracted attention for its possible role in fitness and virulence. Here, a new in vitro biofilm formation protocol was developed to guarantee more stringent conditions, to better discriminate between strong-, low-, and non-biofilm-forming strains, and to facilitate interpretation of data. This protocol was used to screen the biofilm-forming abilities of 366 GBS clinical isolates from pregnant women and from neonatal infections of different serotypes in relation to medium composition and pH. The results identified a subset of isolates of serotypes III and V that formed strong biofilms under acidic conditions. Importantly, the best biofilm formers belonged to serotype III hypervirulent clone ST-17. Moreover, the abilities of proteinase K to strongly inhibit biofilm formation and to disaggregate mature biofilms suggested that proteins play an essential role in promoting GBS biofilm initiation and contribute to biofilm structural stability.

However, little to nothing is known about a role of fungi in establishing and maintaining a healthy oral ecology. In a healthy ecology, balance is maintained by the combined positive and negative influences between and among its members. Interactions between fungi and bacteria occur primarily at a physical and chemical level. Physical interactions are represented by (co-)adhesion and repulsion (exclusion), while chemical interactions include metabolic dependencies, quorum-sensing, and the production of antimicrobial agents. Information obtained from oral model systems and also from studies on the role of fungi in gastro-intestinal ecology indicates that fungi influence bacterial behavior through these different interactions. This review describes our current knowledge of the interactions between fungi and bacteria and aims to illustrate that further research is required to establish the role of fungi in maintaining a healthy oral cavity.

In this study, we compared three protein extraction methods commonly used in the analyses of environmental samples [guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), B-PER, sequential citrate-phenol (SCP)] using nano-LC-MS/MS and an environmental marine biofilm to determine the unique biases introduced by each method and their effect on the interpretation of the derived metaproteomes.

Each extraction method enriched for different protein families (GuHCl--photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism; B-PER--membrane transport, oxidative stress; SCP--calcium binding, structural) while 23.7-45.4% of the identified proteins lacked SwissProt annotations. Taken together, the results demonstrated that even the most basic interpretations of this complex microbial assemblage (species composition, ratio of prokaryotic to eukaryotic proteins, predominant functions) varied with little overlap based on the protein extraction method employed. These findings demonstrate the heavy influence of protein extraction on biofilm metaproteomics and provide caveats for the interpretation of such data sets when utilizing single protein extraction methods for the description of complex microbial assemblages.","authors":[{"name":"Dagmar Hajkova Leary"},{"name":"W Judson Hervey"},{"name":"Jeffrey R Deschamps"},{"name":"Anne W Kusterbeck"},{"name":"Gary J Vora"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biological mass spectrometry"},{"word":"Community proteomics"},{"word":"Environmental proteomics"},{"word":"LC-MS/MS"},{"word":"Metaproteomics"}]},"article88":{"pmid":"24485734","title":"Antimicrobial effect of Melaleuca alternifolia dental gel in orthodontic patients.","date":"2016-11-25","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect and sensorial analysis of the gel developed with the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia.

Detailed studies to determine the mode of action of this pathogen for survival under stress conditions are important to control Lm in food. It has been shown that genes encoding for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are induced in Lm in food, in particular under stress conditions. Previous studies showed that these genes are involved in sensitivity to nisin, acids, and salt. The aim of this study was to determine the involvement of some ABC transporters in biofilm formation. Therefore, deletion mutants of ABC transporter genes (LMOf2365_1875 and LMOf2365_1877) were created in Lm F2365, and then were compared to the wild type for their capacity to form biofilms. Lm strain F2365 was chosen as reference since the genome is fully sequenced and furthermore this strain is particularly involved in food-borne outbreaks of listeriosis. Our results showed that ΔLMOf2365_1875 had an increased capacity to form biofilms compared to the wild type, indicating that LMOf2365_1875 negatively regulates biofilm formation.

This is also true for mycobacteria, where whole-genome sequences are now available for pathogens and nonpathogens alike. Genomes within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) bear the hallmarks of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Conjugation is the form of HGT with the highest potential capacity and evolutionary influence. Donor and recipient strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis actively conjugate upon coculturing in biofilms and on solid media. Whole-genome sequencing of the transconjugant progeny demonstrated the incredible scale and range of genomic variation that conjugation generates. Transconjugant genomes are complex mosaics of the parental strains. Some transconjugant genomes are up to one-quarter donor-derived, distributed over 30 segments. Transferred segments range from ∼50 bp to ∼225,000 bp in length and are exchanged with their recipient orthologs all around the genome. This unpredictable genome-wide infusion of DNA sequences is called distributive conjugal transfer (DCT), to distinguish it from traditional oriT-based conjugation. The mosaicism generated in a single transfer event resembles that seen from meiotic recombination in sexually reproducing organisms and contrasts with traditional models of HGT. This similarity allowed the application of a genome-wide association study approach to map the donor genes that confer a donor mating identity phenotype. The mating identity genes map to the esx1 locus, expanding the central role of ESX-1 function in conjugation. The potential for DCT to instantaneously blend genomes will affect how we view mycobacterial evolution and provide new tools for the facile manipulation of mycobacterial genomes.

For some PDO cheeses, the use of wooden tools is mandatory. Many cheesemakers believe that wooden tools improve the organoleptic and typical characteristics of their final products. Wood is a natural and sustainable material which has been used for centuries in traditional cheese production in a wide variety of forms (vats, shelves, and packaging). Wood is important in the cheesemaking process, interacting with the milk in vats or with the cheeses placed on shelves for ripening. Wood is viable due to its ability to exchange water but, above all, because it is covered by a rich microbial biofilm. As wood is porous and difficult to clean, the European Commission regularly highlights the question of its safety when in contact with food and calls for deeper scientific investigation. In this review, knowledge about the multiple technological roles of wood in dairy technology is discussed. The crucial role of wood as a reservoir of microbial biodiversity for traditional cheeses is reviewed, along with results of safety assessments. As a conclusion, the numerous questions remaining about this natural inoculating system are discussed.

In proteobacteria, QS is largely mediated by signaling molecules known as N-acylated L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) and their associated intracellular LuxR-type receptors. The design of non-native small molecules capable of inhibiting LuxR-type receptors (and thereby QS) in proteobacteria is an active area of research, and numerous lead compounds are AHL derivatives that mimic native AHL molecules. Much of this previous work has focused on the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which controls an arsenal of virulence factors and biofilm formation through QS. The MexAB-OprM efflux pump has been shown to play a role in the secretion of the major AHL signal in P. aeruginosa, N-(3-oxododecanoyl) L-homoserine lactone. In the current study, we show that a variety of non-native AHLs and related derivatives capable of inhibiting LuxR-type receptors in P. aeruginosa display significantly higher potency in a P. aeruginosa Δ(mexAB-oprM) mutant, suggesting that MexAB-OprM also recognizes these compounds as substrates. We also demonstrate that the potency of 5,6-dimethyl-2-aminobenzimidazole, recently shown to be a QS and biofilm inhibitor in P. aeruginosa, is not affected by the presence/absence of the MexAB-OprM pump. These results have implications for the use of non-native AHLs and related derivatives as QS modulators in P. aeruginosa and other bacteria, and provide a potential design strategy for the development of new QS modulators that are resistant to active efflux.","authors":[{"name":"Joseph D Moore"},{"name":"Joseph P Gerdt"},{"name":"Nora R Eibergen"},{"name":"Helen E Blackwell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MexAB-OprM"},{"word":"antiproliferation"},{"word":"efflux pumps"},{"word":"homoserine lactones"},{"word":"inhibitors"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article112":{"pmid":"24478124","title":"Minimum information about a biofilm experiment (MIABiE): standards for reporting experiments and data on sessile microbial communities living at interfaces.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The minimum information about a biofilm experiment (MIABiE) initiative has arisen from the need to find an adequate and scientifically sound way to control the quality of the documentation accompanying the public deposition of biofilm-related data, particularly those obtained using high-throughput devices and techniques.

The capsular polysaccharide (capsule) is a critical virulence factor required for both asymptomatic colonization and invasive disease, yet the expression level is different in each anatomical site. During colonization, reduced levels of capsule promote binding to the host epithelium and biofilm formation, while during systemic infection, increased capsule is required to evade opsonophagocytosis. How this regulation of capsule expression occurs is incompletely understood. To investigate the contribution of transcriptional regulation on capsule level in the serotype 4 strain TIGR4, we constructed two mutants harboring a constitutive promoter that was either comparably weaker (Pcat) or stronger (PtRNAGlu) than the wild-type (WT) capsule promoter, Pcps. Mild reductions in cpsA and cpsE transcript levels in the Pcat promoter mutant resulted in a 2-fold reduction in total amounts of capsule and in avirulence in murine models of lung and blood infection. Additionally, the PtRNAGlu mutant revealed that, despite expressing enhanced levels of cpsA and cpsE and possessing levels of capsule comparable to those of WT TIGR4, it was still significantly attenuated in all tested in vivo niches. Further analysis using chimeric promoter mutants revealed that the WT -10 and -35 boxes are required for optimal nasopharyngeal colonization and virulence. These data support the hypothesis that dynamic transcriptional regulation of the capsule operon is required and that the core promoter region plays a central role in fine-tuning levels of capsule to promote colonization and invasive disease.

The E. coli MG1655 envZ gene encodes a histidine kinase that is a member of the envZ-ompR two-component signal transduction system, which regulates outer membrane protein profiles. In the present investigation, the envZP41L gene was transferred from the intestinally selected E. coli MG1655 mutant to E. coli Nissle 1917, a human probiotic strain used to treat gastrointestinal infections. Both the E. coli MG1655 and E. coli Nissle 1917 strains containing envZP41L produced more phosphorylated OmpR than their parents.

We constructed an in-frame deletion mutation in rpoN (VP2670) in V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633, a clinical serogroup O3:K6 isolate, and examined the effects in vivo using a streptomycin-treated mouse model of colonization. We confirmed that deletion of rpoN rendered V. parahaemolyticus nonmotile, and it caused reduced biofilm formation and an apparent defect in glutamine synthetase production. In in vivo competition assays between the rpoN mutant and a wild-type RIMD2210633 strain marked with the β-galactosidase gene lacZ (WBWlacZ), the mutant colonized significantly more proficiently. Intestinal persistence competition assays also demonstrated that the rpoN mutant had enhanced fitness and outcompeted WBWlacZ. Mutants defective in the polar flagellum biosynthesis FliAP sigma factor also outcompeted WBWlacZ but not to the same level as the rpoN mutant, which suggested that lack of motility is not the sole cause of the fitness effect. In an in vitro growth competition assay in mouse intestinal mucus, the rpoN mutant also outcompeted the wild type and exhibited faster doubling times when grown in mucus and on individual components of mucus. Genes in the pathways for the catabolism of mucus sugars also had significantly higher expression levels in a ΔrpoN mutant than in the wild type.

Here we combined pyrosequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes with in vivo stable isotope probing (Pyro-SIP) to unmask metabolically active bacteria in the gut of cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis), a polyphagous insect herbivore that consumes large amounts of plant material in a short time, liberating abundant glucose in the alimentary canal as a most important carbon and energy source for both host and active gut bacteria. With (13)C glucose as the trophic link, Pyro-SIP revealed that a relatively simple but distinctive gut microbiota co-developed with the host, both metabolic activity and composition shifting throughout larval stages. Pantoea, Citrobacter and Clostridium were particularly active in early-instar, likely the core functional populations linked to nutritional upgrading. Enterococcus was the single predominant genus in the community, and it was essentially stable and metabolically active in the larval lifespan. Based on that Enterococci formed biofilm-like layers on the gut epithelium and that the isolated strains showed antimicrobial properties, Enterococcus may be able to establish a colonization resistance effect in the gut against potentially harmful microbes from outside. Not only does this establish the first in-depth inventory of the gut microbiota of a model organism from the mostly phytophagous Lepidoptera, but this pilot study shows that Pyro-SIP can rapidly gain insight into the gut microbiota's metabolic activity with high resolution and high precision.

The results showed that the sequential addition of H2SO4 and CH3COONa solutions could accelerate the exfoliation of the fouled periphyton biofilm, while the addition of EDTA solution could regenerate the periphyton biofilm.

Characterized by clearly defined ripple structures, Kinneyia are generally found in areas that were formally littoral habitats and covered by microbial mats. To date, there has been no conclusive explanation of the processes involved in the formation of these fossils. Microbial mats behave like viscoelastic fluids. We propose that the key mechanism involved in the formation of Kinneyia is a Kelvin-Helmholtz-type instability induced in a viscoelastic film under flowing water. A ripple corrugation is spontaneously induced in the film and grows in amplitude over time. Theoretical predictions show that the ripple instability has a wavelength proportional to the thickness of the film. Experiments carried out using viscoelastic films confirm this prediction. The ripple pattern that forms has a wavelength roughly three times the thickness of the film. This behaviour is independent of the viscosity of the film and the flow conditions. Laboratory-analogue Kinneyia were formed via the sedimentation of glass beads, which preferentially deposit in the troughs of the ripples. Well-ordered patterns form, with both honeycomb-like and parallel ridges being observed, depending on the flow speed. These patterns correspond well with those found in Kinneyia, with similar morphologies, wavelengths and amplitudes being observed.","authors":[{"name":"Katherine Thomas"},{"name":"Stephan Herminghaus"},{"name":"Hubertus Porada"},{"name":"Lucas Goehring"}],"keywords":[]},"article134":{"pmid":"24470471","title":"Elucidating the genetic basis of crystalline biofilm formation in Proteus mirabilis.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Proteus mirabilis forms extensive crystalline biofilms on urethral catheters that occlude urine flow and frequently complicate the management of long-term-catheterized patients. Here, using random transposon mutagenesis in conjunction with in vitro models of the catheterized urinary tract, we elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the formation of crystalline biofilms by P. mirabilis. Mutants identified as defective in blockage of urethral catheters had disruptions in genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and efflux systems but were unaffected in general growth, survival in bladder model systems, or the ability to elevate urinary pH. Imaging of biofilms directly on catheter surfaces, along with quantification of levels of encrustation and biomass, confirmed that the mutants were attenuated specifically in the ability to form crystalline biofilms compared with that of the wild type. However, the biofilm-deficient phenotype of these mutants was not due to deficiencies in attachment to catheter biomaterials, and defects in later stages of biofilm development were indicated. For one blocking-deficient mutant, the disrupted gene (encoding a putative multidrug efflux pump) was also found to be associated with susceptibility to fosfomycin, and loss of this system or general inhibition of efflux pumps increased sensitivity to this antibiotic. Furthermore, homologues of this system were found to be widely distributed among other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. Overall, our findings provide fundamental new insight into crystalline biofilm formation by P. mirabilis, including the link between biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance in this organism, and indicate a potential role for efflux pump inhibitors in the treatment or prevention of P. mirabilis crystalline biofilms.

The extent of biofilm formation by S. aureus was positively correlated to the levels of the 2-alkyl-4-(1H)-quinolones (AQs) Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxy quinoline N-oxide (HQNO) produced by the P. aeruginosa isolates.

Fully elucidating the virulence and zoonotic potential of APEC is key for designing successful strategies against their infections and their transmission.

A PCR-based ecpA survey of a collection of 167 APEC strains has shown that 76% (127/167) were ecpA+.

The Candida albicans Agglutinin-like sequence (Als) adhesins are exemplars for this phenomenon, and have amyloid forming sequences that are conserved between family members. The Als5p amyloid sequence mediates amyloid fibril formation and is critical for cell adhesion and biofilm formation, and is also present in the related adhesins Als1p and Als3p. We have developed a fluorescent peptide probe containing the conserved Als amyloid-forming sequence. This peptide bound specifically to yeast expressing Als5p, but not to cells lacking the adhesin. The probe bound to both yeast and hyphal forms of C. albicans. Δals1/Δals3 single and double deletion strains exhibited reduced fluorescence, indicating that probe binding required expression of these proteins. Additionally, the Als peptide specifically stained fungal cells in abscesses in autopsy sections. Counterstaining with calcofluor white showed colocalization with the amyloid peptide. In addition, fungi in autopsy sections derived from the gastrointestinal tract showed colocalization of the amyloid-specific dye thioflavin T and the fluorescent peptide.

Moreover, the number of available antifungals is limited, and antifungal-resistant Candida strains are emerging. New and effective antifungals are therefore urgently needed. Here, we discovered a small molecule with activity against Candida spp. both in vitro and in vivo. We screened a library of 50,240 small molecules for inhibitors of yeast-to-hypha transition, a major virulence attribute of Candida albicans. This screening identified 20 active compounds. Further examination of the in vitro antifungal and anti-biofilm properties of these compounds, using a range of Candida spp., led to the discovery of SM21, a highly potent antifungal molecule (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 0.2-1.6 µg/ml). In vitro, SM21 was toxic to fungi but not to various human cell lines or bacterial species and was active against Candida isolates that are resistant to existing antifungal agents. Moreover, SM21 was relatively more effective against biofilms of Candida spp. than the current antifungal agents. In vivo, SM21 prevented the death of mice in a systemic candidiasis model and was also more effective than the common antifungal nystatin at reducing the extent of tongue lesions in a mouse model of oral candidiasis. Propidium iodide uptake assay showed that SM21 affected the integrity of the cell membrane. Taken together, our results indicate that SM21 has the potential to be developed as a novel antifungal agent for clinical use.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah Sze Wah Wong"},{"name":"Richard Yi Tsun Kao"},{"name":"Kwok Yong Yuen"},{"name":"Yu Wang"},{"name":"Dan Yang"},{"name":"Lakshman Perera Samaranayake"},{"name":"Chaminda Jayampath Seneviratne"}],"keywords":[]},"article148":{"pmid":"24465697","title":"Fructooligosacharides reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 pathogenicity through distinct mechanisms.","date":"2018-12-03","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ubiquitously present in the environment and acts as an opportunistic pathogen on humans, animals and plants. We report here the effects of the prebiotic polysaccharide inulin and its hydrolysed form FOS on this bacterium. FOS was found to inhibit bacterial growth of strain PAO1, while inulin did not affect growth rate or yield in a significant manner. Inulin stimulated biofilm formation, whereas a dramatic reduction of the biofilm formation was observed in the presence of FOS. Similar opposing effects were observed for bacterial motility, where FOS inhibited the swarming and twitching behaviour whereas inulin caused its stimulation. In co-cultures with eukaryotic cells (macrophages) FOS and, to a lesser extent, inulin reduced the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α. Western blot experiments indicated that the effects mediated by FOS in macrophages are associated with a decreased activation of the NF-κB pathway. Since FOS and inulin stimulate pathway activation in the absence of bacteria, the FOS mediated effect is likely to be of indirect nature, such as via a reduction of bacterial virulence. Further, this modulatory effect is observed also with the highly virulent ptxS mutated strain. Co-culture experiments of P. aeruginosa with IEC18 eukaryotic cells showed that FOS reduces the concentration of the major virulence factor, exotoxin A, suggesting that this is a possible mechanism for the reduction of pathogenicity. The potential of these compounds as components of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory cocktails is discussed.

Numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) surround the biofilms and create local anoxia by consuming the majority of O2 for production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesized that P. aeruginosa acquires energy for growth in anaerobic endobronchial mucus by denitrification, which can be demonstrated by production of nitrous oxide (N2O), an intermediate in the denitrification pathway. We measured N2O and O2 with electrochemical microsensors in 8 freshly expectorated sputum samples from 7 CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection. The concentrations of NO3(-) and NO2(-) in sputum were estimated by the Griess reagent. We found a maximum median concentration of 41.8 µM N2O (range 1.4-157.9 µM N2O). The concentration of N2O in the sputum was higher below the oxygenated layers. In 4 samples the N2O concentration increased during the initial 6 h of measurements before decreasing for approximately 6 h. Concomitantly, the concentration of NO3(-) decreased in sputum during 24 hours of incubation. We demonstrate for the first time production of N2O in clinical material from infected human airways indicating pathogenic metabolism based on denitrification. Therefore, P. aeruginosa may acquire energy for growth by denitrification in anoxic endobronchial mucus in CF patients. Such ability for anaerobic growth may be a hitherto ignored key aspect of chronic P. aeruginosa infections that can inform new strategies for treatment and prevention.","authors":[{"name":"Mette Kolpen"},{"name":"Michael Kühl"},{"name":"Thomas Bjarnsholt"},{"name":"Claus Moser"},{"name":"Christine Rønne Hansen"},{"name":"Lars Liengaard"},{"name":"Arsalan Kharazmi"},{"name":"Tanja Pressler"},{"name":"Niels Høiby"},{"name":"Peter Østrup Jensen"}],"keywords":[]},"article150":{"pmid":"24465123","title":"Inhibitory effect of N-ethyl-3-amino-5-oxo-4-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide on Haemophilus spp. planktonic or biofilm-forming cells.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"During this study, we have investigated in vitro activity of N-substituted-3-amino-5-oxo-4-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide derivatives with N-ethyl, N-(4-metoxyphenyl) and N-cyclohexyl substituents against Gram-negative Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae bacteria.

These adaptations include changes in the expression of cell surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS), biofilm development, and the production of a protective extracellular exopolysaccharide matrix. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have been identified as an important component of the extracellular matrix of P. aeruginosa biofilms and are thought to contribute to the development and fitness of these bacterial communities. The goal of this study was to examine the relationships between changes in the cell surface expression of LPS O polysaccharides, biofilm development, and OMV biogenesis in P. aeruginosa. We compared wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 with three chromosomal knockouts. These knockouts have deletions in the rmd, wbpM, and wbpL genes that produce changes in the expression of common polysaccharide antigen (CPA), O-specific antigen (OSA), or both. Our results demonstrate that changes in O polysaccharide expression do not significantly influence OMV production but do affect the size and protein content of OMVs derived from both CPA(-) and OSA(-) cells; these mutant cells also exhibited different physical properties from wild-type cells. We further examined biofilm growth of the mutants and determined that CPA(-) cells could not develop into robust biofilms and exhibit changes in cell morphology and biofilm matrix production. Together these results demonstrate the importance of O polysaccharide expression on P. aeruginosa OMV composition and highlight the significance of CPA expression in biofilm development.

While there are multiple copies of cathelicidin genes in horses, cattle, pigs, and sheep, only one cathelicidin gene is found in humans. Interestingly, this single cathelicidin gene can be processed into different forms of antimicrobial peptides. LL-37, the most commonly studied form, is not only antimicrobial but also possesses other functional roles such as chemotaxis, apoptosis, wound healing, immune modulation, and cancer metastasis. This article reviews recent advances made in structural and biophysical studies of human LL-37 and its fragments, which serve as a basis to understand their antibacterial, anti-biofilm and antiviral activities. High-quality structures were made possible by using improved 2D NMR methods for peptide fragments and 3D NMR spectroscopy for intact LL-37. The two hydrophobic domains in the long amphipathic helix (residues 2-31) of LL-37 separated by a hydrophilic residue serine 9 explain its cooperative binding to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Both aromatic rings (F5, F6, F17, and F27) and interfacial basic amino acids of LL-37 directly interact with anionic phosphatidylglycerols (PG). Although the peptide sequences reported in the literature vary slightly, there is a consensus that the central helix of LL-37 is essential for disrupting superbugs (e.g., MRSA), bacterial biofilms, and viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In the central helix, the central arginine R23 is of particular importance in binding to bacterial membranes or DNA. Mapping the functional roles of the cationic amino acids of the major antimicrobial region of LL-37 provides a basis for designing antimicrobial peptides with desired properties.

The antibiotic ciprofloxacine (CF) was used as an inhibitor of E. coli biofilm formation in the positive control. NO donors regulating Fe-S cluster assembly in E. coli have been shown to control plankton growth of the cultures and the process of mature biofilm formation; toxic doses of NO caused a dramatic (3- to 4-fold) stimulation of cell entry into biofilms as a response to nitrosative stress; NO donors CisA and GSNO in physiological concentrations suppressed the formation of mature biofilms, and the activity of these compounds was comparable to that of CE Regulation of both Fe-S cluster assembly in iron-sulfur proteins and biofilm formation by NO is indicative of the connection between these processes in E. coli.","authors":[{"name":"S V Vasil'eva"},{"name":"D A Streltsova"},{"name":"I A Starostina"},{"name":"N A Sanina"}],"keywords":[]},"article168":{"pmid":"24459841","title":"Cellulase inhibits Burkholderia cepacia biofilms on diverse prosthetic materials.","date":"2016-10-21","abs":"Burkholderia cepacia is an opportunistic pathogen causing infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.

There is growing evidence that the production of extracellular polymeric substances at the cell-substrate interface plays a key role in strengthening bacterial adhesion. Yet, because these adhesive polymers are available in small amounts and are localized at interfaces, they are difficult to study using traditional techniques. Here, we use single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) to functionally analyze the biophysical properties (distribution, adhesion, and extension) of bacterial footprints, that is, adhesive macromolecules left on substrate surfaces after removal of the attached cells. We focus on the large adhesin protein LapA from Pseudomonas fluorescens, which mediates cell attachment to a wide diversity of surfaces. Using AFM tips functionalized with specific antibodies, we demonstrate that adhesion of bacteria to hydrophobic substrates leads to the active accumulation of the LapA protein at the cell-substrate interface. We show that single LapA proteins left on the substrate after cell detachment localize into microscale domains corresponding to the bacterial size and exhibit multiple adhesion peaks reflecting the adhesion and extension of adsorbed LapA proteins. The mechanical behavior of LapA-based footprints makes them ideally suited to function as multipurpose bridging polymers, enabling P. fluorescens to attach to various surfaces. Our experiments show that single-molecule AFM offers promising prospects for characterizing the biophysics and dynamics of the cell-substrate interface in the context of bacterial adhesion, on a scale that was not accessible before.

Here, we show that Hfq is critical for the uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis to effectively colonize the bladder and kidneys in a murine urinary tract infection (UTI) model and to establish burned wound infection of the rats. In this regard, we found the hfq mutant induced higher IL-8 and MIF levels of uroepithelial cells and displayed reduced intra-macrophage survival. The loss of hfq affected bacterial abilities to handle H2O2 and osmotic pressures and to grow at 50 °C. Relative to wild-type, the hfq mutant had reduced motility, fewer flagella and less hemolysin expression and was less prone to form biofilm and to adhere to and invade uroepithelial cells. The MR/P fimbrial operon was almost switched to the off phase in the hfq mutant. In addition, we found the hfq mutant exhibited an altered outer membrane profile and had higher RpoE expression, which indicates the hfq mutant may encounter increased envelope stress. With the notion of envelope disturbance in the hfq mutant, we found increased membrane permeability and antibiotic susceptibilities in the hfq mutant. Finally, we showed that Hfq positively regulated the RpoS level and tolerance to H2O2 in the stationary phase seemed largely mediated through the Hfq-dependent RpoS expression. Together, our data indicate that Hfq plays a critical role in P. mirabilis to establish UTIs by modulating stress responses, surface structures and virulence factors.

Isolates from chronic infections differ from laboratory and environmental strains in a range of traits and this is widely interpreted as the result of adaptation to the lung environment. Typically, chronic strains carry mutations in global regulation factors that could effect reduced expression of social traits, raising the possibility that competitive dynamics between cooperative and selfish, cheating strains could also drive changes in P. aeruginosa infections. We compared the expression of cooperative traits - biofilm formation, secretion of exo-products and quorum sensing (QS) - in P. aeruginosa isolates that were estimated to have spent different lengths of time in the lung based on clinical information. All three exo-products involved in nutrient acquisition were produced in significantly smaller quantities with increased duration of infection, and patterns across four QS signal molecules were consistent with accumulation over time of mutations in lasR, which are known to disrupt the ability of cells to respond to QS signal. Pyocyanin production, and the proportion of cells in biofilm relative to motile, free-living cells in liquid culture, did not change. Overall, our results confirm that the loss of social behaviour is a consistent trend with time spent in the lung and suggest that social dynamics are potentially relevant to understanding the behaviour of P. aeruginosa in lung infections.

We infected guinea pigs with the virulent H37Rv strain of MTB for 60 days at which point we collected blood. To identify antigenic proteins, membrane protein extracts of MTB H37Ra pellicles and shaken cultures grown for 3, 5, or 7 weeks were probed with the infected animals' sera after the proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE). Antigenic proteins were then identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry peptide mass fingerprinting. Antigenic pellicle proteins were compared across the three timepoints to identify those that were produced consistently during pellicle growth. They were also compared to those membrane proteins identified from harvested shaken cultures to determine pellicle-specific vs. universally expressed proteins. Using this technique, we identified 44 distinct antigenic proteins, nine of which were pellicle-specific.

The antigenic pellicle-specific protein Rv0097 was found to have very high sequence conservation within the MTB complex but not with related mycobacteria, while FabG4 was highly conserved in all mycobacteria analyzed. These conserved pellicle-specific proteins represent targets for the development of future diagnostic tests and vaccines.","authors":[{"name":"Patrick W Kerns"},{"name":"David F Ackhart"},{"name":"Randall J Basaraba"},{"name":"Jeff G Leid"},{"name":"Mark E Shirtliff"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"humoral"},{"word":"pellicle"},{"word":"proteomics"},{"word":"tuberculosis"}]},"article192":{"pmid":"24453168","title":"Anti-biofilm agents: recent breakthrough against multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2014-04-11","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that causes potentially life-threatening nosocomial- and community-acquired infections, such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis.

Biofilm-forming capacity is now recognized as an important virulence determinant in the development of staphylococcal device-related infections. In light of the projected increase in the numbers of elderly patients who will require semi-permanent indwelling medical devices such as artificial knees and hips, we can anticipate an expanded need for new agents and treatment options to manage biofilm-associated infections in an expanding at-risk population.

The main aim of this work was to investigate the formation and survival of L. monocytogenes biofilms on stainless steel (SS) coupons in TW at 4, 22, 30 and 37 °C. For that, coupons with biofilm were visualised in situ while other coupons were scraped to quantify total cells by SYTO 9, cultivable numbers by plating onto brain heart infusion agar and viable numbers by the direct viable count method. Results showed that L. monocytogenes can form biofilms on SS surfaces in TW at any temperature, including at 4 °C. The number of total cells was similar for all the conditions tested while cultivable numbers varied between the level of detection (<8.3 CFU cm(-2)) and 3.5 × 10(5) CFU cm(-2), meaning between 7.0 × 10(4) and 1.1 × 10(7) cells cm(-2) have entered the viable but non-cultivable (VBNC) state. This work clearly demonstrates that L. monocytogenes can form biofilms in TW and that sessile cells can remain viable and cultivable in some conditions for at least the 48 h investigated. On the other hand, VBNC adaptation suggests that the pathogen can remain undetectable using traditional culture recovery techniques, which may give a false indication of processing surface hygiene status, leading to potential cross-contamination of food products.","authors":[{"name":"Maria S Gião"},{"name":"Charles W Keevil"}],"keywords":[]},"article194":{"pmid":"24452688","title":"Incorporation of phosphorylcholine into the lipooligosaccharide of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae does not correlate with the level of biofilm formation in vitro.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an opportunistic pathogen that causes otitis media in children and community-acquired pneumonia or exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults.

The objective of this report was to determine the relationship between the presence of phosphorylcholine in the lipooligosaccharide of NTHi and the level of biofilm formation. The study was performed on 111 NTHi clinical isolates collected from oropharyngeal samples of healthy children, middle ear fluid of children with otitis media, and sputum samples of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or community-acquired pneumonia. NTHi clinical isolates presented a large variation in the level of biofilm formation in a static assay and phosphorylcholine content. Isolates collected from the oropharynx and middle ear fluid of children tended to have more phosphorylcholine and made denser biofilms than isolates collected from sputum samples of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or community-acquired pneumonia. No correlation was observed between biofilm formation and the presence of phosphorylcholine in the lipooligosaccharide for either planktonic or biofilm growth. This lack of correlation was confirmed by abrogating phosphorylcholine incorporation into lipooligosaccharide through licA gene deletion, which had strain-specific effects on biofilm formation. Altogether, we present strong evidence to conclude that there is no correlation between biofilm formation in a static assay and the presence of phosphorylcholine in lipooligosaccharide in a large collection of clinical NTHi isolates collected from different groups of patients.

We demonstrate that an increased SOS stress response within mature biofilms induces SOS-dependent colicin R expression.

However, due to the presence of a multitude of pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses, worms, protozoa) in secondary effluents, disinfection procedures are indispensable. In decentralized wastewater treatment, UV irradiation represents one of the most common disinfection methods in addition to membrane processes and to a certain extent electrochemical procedures. However, the usage of UV disinfected secondary effluents for domestic (sanitary) or irrigation purposes bears a potential health risk due to the possible photo and dark repair of reversibly damaged bacteria. Against this background, the application of the UV/electrolysis hybrid technology for disinfection and prevention of bacterial reactivation in biologically treated wastewater was investigated in view of relevant influence factors and operating limits. Furthermore, the influence of electrochemically generated total oxidants on the formation of biofilms on quartz glass surfaces was examined, since its preventive avoidance contributes to an enhanced operational safety of the hybrid reactor. It was found that reactivation of bacteria in UV irradiated, biologically treated wastewater can be prevented by electrochemically produced total oxidants. In this regard, the influence of the initial concentration of the microbiological indicator organism Escherichia coli (E. coli) (9.3*10(2)-2.2*10(5) per 100 mL) and the influence of total suspended solids (TSS) in the range of 11-75 mg L(-1) was examined. The concentration of total oxidants necessary for prevention of bacterial regrowth increases linearly with the initial E. coli and TSS concentration. At an initial concentration of 933 E. coli per 100 mL, a total oxidants concentration of 0.4 mg L(-1) is necessary to avoid photo reactivation (at 4200 Lux), whereas 0.67 mg L(-1) is required if the E. coli concentration is enhanced by 2.4 log levels (cTSS = constant = 13 mg L(-1)). The prevention of dark repair is ensured with 25-50% lower concentration of total oxidants. An increase of the TSS concentration from 11 mg L(-1) to 75 mg L(-1) leads to a triplication of the need of total oxidants from 0.6 mg L(-1) to 1.8 mg L(-1) (3*10(5)E. coli per 100 mL). The energy consumption of the hybrid reactor varies from 0.17 kWh m(-3) to 0.94 kWh m(-3) depending on the TSS concentration (11-75 mg L(-1)). Furthermore, biofilm formation on quartz glass surfaces, of which the sleeves of UV lamps consist, can be suppressed by electrochemically produced total oxidants at a concentration of at least 1 mg L(-1) which ensures high operational safety of the hybrid reactor combined with large maintenance intervals.

Several PSMs are key virulence determinants, particularly in highly virulent Staphylococcus aureus strains. PSMα peptides of S. aureus facilitate neutrophil lysis after phagocytosis, and are key contributors to several infection types, including skin infection and bacteremia. Furthermore, all PSMs contribute to biofilm structuring and the dissemination of biofilm-associated infection. Cytolytic PSMs as produced by S. aureus appear to have evolved from original functions in the non-infectious lifestyle of staphylococci. The surfactant properties of PSMs, which they all share, are believed to facilitate growth on epithelial surfaces. The basic role of PSMs in staphylococcal physiology is underscored, for example, by their exceptionally strict and direct control by quorum-sensing and the presence of a dedicated secretion system. Targeting PSMs for anti-staphylococcal drug development may be a promising approach to overcome the problems associated with widespread antibiotic resistance in staphylococci.

For this reason, we have developed a platform that uses automated image analysis and pattern recognition to quantify phenotypic signatures of yeast colonies. Our strategy enables quantitative analysis of individual colonies, measured at a single time point or over a series of time-lapse images, as well as the classification of distinct colony shapes based on image-derived features. Phenotypic changes in colony morphology can be expressed as changes in feature space trajectories over time, thereby enabling the visualization and quantitative analysis of morphological development. To facilitate data exploration, results are plotted dynamically through an interactive Yeast Image Analysis web application (YIMAA; http://yimaa.cs.tut.fi) that integrates the raw and processed images across all time points, allowing exploration of the image-based features and principal components associated with morphological development.

In WT MEF C12 rapidly triggered (minutes to 2 h): activation of caspases 3/7 and 8, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψmito ), release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol, blebbing of plasma membranes, shrinkage/condensation of cells and nuclei and, subsequently, cell killing. A DKO MEF line that was relatively unaffected by the Bak/Bax-dependent proapoptotic stimulants staurosporine and etoposide responded to C12 similarly to WT MEF: activation of caspase 3/7, depolarization of Δψmito and release of cytochrome C and cell death. Re-expression of Bax or Bak in DKO MEF did not alter the WT-like responses to C12 in DKO MEF. These data showed that C12 triggers novel, rapid proapoptotic Bak/Bax-independent responses that include events commonly associated with activation of both the intrinsic pathway (depolarization of Δψmito and release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol) and the extrinsic pathway (activation of caspase 8).

Here, we show that iron-replete conditions enhance resistance of P. aeruginosa nonbiofilm growth against tobramycin and tigecycline. Interestingly, the mechanism of iron-enhanced resistance to each of these antibiotics is distinct. Whereas pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake is important for optimal resistance to tigecycline, it does not enhance tobramycin resistance. In contrast, heme supplementation results in increased tobramycin resistance, while having no significant effect on tigecycline resistance. Thus, nonsiderophore bound iron plays an important role in resistance to tobramycin, while pyoverdine increases the ability of P. aeruginosa to resist tigecycline treatment. Lastly, we show that iron increases the minimal concentration of tobramycin, but not tigecycline, required to eradicate P. aeruginosa biofilms. Moreover, iron depletion blocks the previous observed induction of biofilm formation by subinhibitory concentrations of tobramycin, suggesting iron and tobramycin signal through overlapping regulatory pathways to affect biofilm formation. These data further support the role of iron in P. aeruginosa antibiotic resistance, providing yet another compelling case for targeting iron acquisition for future antimicrobial drug development.","authors":[{"name":"Amanda G Oglesby-Sherrouse"},{"name":"Louise Djapgne"},{"name":"Angela T Nguyen"},{"name":"Adriana I Vasil"},{"name":"Michael L Vasil"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"iron"},{"word":"tigecyclin"},{"word":"tobramycin"}]},"article233":{"pmid":"24436128","title":"In silico and in vitro studies of cinnamaldehyde and their derivatives against LuxS in Streptococcus pyogenes: effects on biofilm and virulence genes.","date":"2015-11-19","abs":"The LuxS-based signalling pathway has an important role in physiological and pathogenic functions that are capable of causing different infections.

In this study, we investigate the link between resistance to a clinically important antibiotic, imipenem, and biofilm formation. First, we observed that the laboratory strain P. aeruginosa PAO1 carrying a mutation in the oprD gene, which confers resistance to imipenem, showed a modest reduction in biofilm formation. We also observed an inverse relationship between imipenem resistance and biofilm formation for imipenem-resistant strains selected in vitro, as well as for clinical isolates. We identified two clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients that formed robust biofilms, but were sensitive to imipenem (MIC ≤ 2 μg/ml). To test the hypothesis that there is a general link between imipenem resistance and biofilm formation, we performed transposon mutagenesis of these two clinical strains to identify mutants defective in biofilm formation, and then tested these mutants for imipenem resistance. Analysis of the transposon mutants revealed a role for previously described biofilm factors in these clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, including mutations in the pilY1, pilX, pilW, algC, and pslI genes, but none of the biofilm-deficient mutants became imipenem resistant (MIC ≥ 8 μg/ml), arguing against a general link between biofilm formation and resistance to imipenem. Thus, assessing biofilm formation capabilities of environmental isolates is unlikely to serve as a good predictor of imipenem resistance. We also discuss our findings in light of the limited literature addressing planktonic antibiotic resistance factors that impact biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Hadeel K Musafer"},{"name":"Sherry L Kuchma"},{"name":"Amanda A Naimie"},{"name":"Joseph D Schwartzman"},{"name":"Harith J Fahad Al-Mathkhury"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"}],"keywords":[]},"article238":{"pmid":"24434989","title":"Modelling ammonium-oxidizing population shifts in a biofilm reactor.","date":"2014-01-17","abs":"The dynamic reactor behaviour of a nitrifying inverse turbulent bed reactor, operated at varying loading rate, was described with a one-dimensional two-step nitrification biofilm model.

Previously gathered experimental evidence showed that different loading rates in the reactor resulted in a change in the composition of the AOB community, besides a different nitrifying performance.

The toxins are liberated from association with the cognate antitoxins by certain physiological triggers to impair vital cellular functions. TAs also are implicated in antibiotic persistence, biofilm formation, and bacteriophage resistance. Among the ever increasing number of TA modules that have been identified, the most numerous are complexes in which both toxin and antitoxin are proteins. Transcriptional autoregulation of the operons encoding these complexes is key to ensuring balanced TA production and to prevent inadvertent toxin release. Control typically is exerted by binding of the antitoxin to regulatory sequences upstream of the operons. The toxin protein commonly works as a transcriptional corepressor that remodels and stabilizes the antitoxin. However, there are notable exceptions to this paradigm. Moreover, it is becoming clear that TA complexes often form one strand in an interconnected web of stress responses suggesting that their transcriptional regulation may prove to be more intricate than currently understood. Furthermore, interference with TA gene transcriptional autoregulation holds considerable promise as a novel antibacterial strategy: artificial release of the toxin factor using designer drugs is a potential approach to induce bacterial suicide from within.

In order to optimize the efficacy of the plasma, different carrier gases (argon, argon admixed with 1% oxygen, and argon with increased humidity up to approx. 80%) were tested and compared against 0.1% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG) exposure for 600 s. The antimicrobial efficacy was determined by calculating the difference between the numbers of colony-forming units (CFU) of treated and untreated biofilms. Living bacteria were distinguished from dead by fluorescent staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Both SBD plasmas and CHG showed significant antimicrobial effects compared to the untreated control. However, plasma treatment led to a higher antimicrobial reduction (argon plasma 4.9 log10 CFU/cm(2), argon with admixed oxygen 3 log10 CFU/cm(2), and with increased gas humidity 2.7 log10 CFU/cm(2) after 300 s) compared to CHG. In conclusion, SBD plasma is suitable as an alternative to CHG for inactivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa embedded in biofilm. Further development of SBD plasma sources and research on the role of carrier gases and humidity may allow their clinical application for wound management in the future.","authors":[{"name":"R Matthes"},{"name":"N-O Hübner"},{"name":"C Bender"},{"name":"I Koban"},{"name":"S Horn"},{"name":"S Bekeschus"},{"name":"K-D Weltmann"},{"name":"T Kocher"},{"name":"A Kramer"},{"name":"O Assadian"}],"keywords":[]},"article243":{"pmid":"24434696","title":"A stable synergistic microbial consortium for simultaneous azo dye removal and bioelectricity generation.","date":"2014-04-21","abs":"Microbial species coexist in natural or engineered settings, where they encounter extensive competition and cooperation.

Here, we performed a long-term bioreactor ecology study to address the links between QS, organization and composition of complex microbial communities. The conversion of floccular biomass to highly structured granules was found to be non-random, but strongly and positively correlated with N-acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL)-mediated QS. Specific AHLs were elevated up to 100-fold and were strongly associated with the initiation of granulation. Similarly, the levels of particular AHLs decreased markedly during the granular disintegration phase. Metadata analysis indicated that granulation was accompanied by changes in extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production and AHL add-back studies also resulted in increased EPS synthesis. In contrast to the commonly reported nanomolar to micromolar signal concentrations in pure culture laboratory systems, QS signalling in the granulation ecosystem occurred at picomolar to nanomolar concentrations of AHLs.

To gain novel mechanistic insights into this, we used OMICs tools to profile microbial populations coexisting in a single pyrite gallery AMD (pH ∼2) in three distinct compartments: two from a stratified streamer (uppermost oxic and lowermost anoxic sediment-attached strata) and one from a submerged anoxic non-stratified mat biofilm. The communities colonising pyrite and those in the mature formations appear to be populated by the greatest diversity of bacteria and archaea (including 'ARMAN' (archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nano-organisms)-related), as compared with the known AMD, with ∼44.9% unclassified sequences. We propose that the thick polymeric matrix may provide a safety shield against the prevailing extreme condition and also a massive carbon source, enabling non-typical acidophiles to develop more easily. Only 1 of 39 species were shared, suggesting a high metabolic heterogeneity in local microenvironments, defined by the O2 concentration, spatial location and biofilm architecture. The suboxic mats, compositionally most similar to each other, are more diverse and active for S, CO2, CH4, fatty acid and lipopolysaccharide metabolism. The oxic stratum of the streamer, displaying a higher diversity of the so-called 'ARMAN'-related Euryarchaeota, shows a higher expression level of proteins involved in signal transduction, cell growth and N, H2, Fe, aromatic amino acids, sphingolipid and peptidoglycan metabolism. Our study is the first to highlight profound taxonomic and functional shifts in single AMD formations, as well as new microbial species and the importance of H2 in acidic suboxic macroscopic growths.

Among the 156 isolates, 58 (37.2%) were biofilm producers. The bacterial species (P<0.001), together with patient's gender (P = 0.022), were the factors with the highest influence for biofilm production. There was also a strong correlation of catheterization with biofilm formation, despite being less significant (P = 0.070) than species or gender. In fact, some of the bacteria isolated were biofilm producers in all cases. With regard to resistance profile among bacterial isolates, β-lactam antibiotics presented the highest number of cases/percentages--ampicillin (32/55.2%), cephalothin (30/51.7%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (22/37.9%)--although the carbapenem group still represented a good therapeutic option (2/3.4%). Quinolones (nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors) also showed high resistance percentages. Furthermore, biofilm production clearly increases bacterial resistance. Almost half of the biofilm-producing bacteria showed resistance against at least three different groups of antibiotics. Bacterial resistance is often associated with catheterization. Accordingly, intrinsic (age and gender) and extrinsic (hospital unit, bacterial isolate and catheterization) factors were used to build a predictive model, by evaluating the contribution of each factor to biofilm production. In this way, it is possible to anticipate biofilm occurrence immediately after bacterial identification, allowing selection of a more effective antibiotic (among the susceptibility options suggested by the antibiogram) against biofilm-producing bacteria. This approach reduces the putative bacterial resistance during treatment, and the consequent need to adjust antibiotherapy.","authors":[{"name":"Maria José Alves"},{"name":"João C M Barreira"},{"name":"Inês Carvalho"},{"name":"Luis Trinta"},{"name":"Liliana Perreira"},{"name":"Isabel C F R Ferreira"},{"name":"Manuela Pintado"}],"keywords":[]},"article265":{"pmid":"24430206","title":"Effect of growth temperature, surface type and incubation time on the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms to disinfectants.","date":"2014-02-27","abs":"The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of the environmental conditions such as the temperature change, incubation time and surface type on the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms to disinfectants.

The involvement of the biofilm matrix and the bacterial membrane fluidity in the resistance of sessile cells were investigated. Our results show that the efficiency of disinfectants was dependent on the growth temperature, the surface type and the disinfectant product. The increase of growth temperature from 20 °C to 37 °C, with an incubation time of 24 h, increased the resistance of biofilms to cationic antimicrobials. This change of growth temperature did not affect the major content of the biofilm matrix, but it decreased the membrane fluidity of sessile cells through the increase of the anteiso-C19 relative amount. The increase of the biofilm resistance to disinfectants, with the rise of the incubation time, was dependent on both growth temperature and disinfectant product.

River biofilms, which respond quickly to changes of environmental parameters, are good candidates to acquire knowledge on the response of aquatic organisms to diffuse chemical contamination in the field. The study was designed as an attempt to link biofilm metal tolerance and metallic contamination in a field survey covering 13 different sampling sites in the Seine river basin (north of France) with low contamination levels. Cd and Zn tolerance of heterotrophic communities was assessed using a short-term toxicity test based on β-glucosidase activity. Metal tolerance levels varied between sites but there was no obvious correlation between tolerance and corresponding water contamination levels for Cd and Zn. Indeed, metallic contamination at the sampling sites remained subtle when compared to water quality standards (only two sampling sites had either Zn or both Cu and Zn concentrations exceeding the Environmental Quality Standards set by the EU Water Framework Directive). Yet, multivariate analysis of the data using Partial Least Squares Regression revealed that both metallic and environmental parameters were important variables explaining the variability of metal tolerance levels. Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) was also performed on both bacterial and eukaryotic biofilm communities from the 13 sampling sites. Multivariate analysis of ARISA fingerprints revealed that biofilms with similar tolerance levels have similar ARISA profiles.

A novel air bubble sample delivery approach was developed to dramatically enhance the BFR's biodegradation efficiency and extend analytical linear range. Because the air bubble sample delivery invalidates the BOD quantification via the determination of oxygen consumption using dissolved oxygen probe, the PeCOD technique was innovatively utilized to resolve the BOD quantification issue under air bubble sample delivery conditions. The BFR was employed to effectively and efficiently biodegrade organic pollutants under oxygen-rich environment provided by the air bubbles. The BOD quantification was achieved by measuring the COD change (Δ[COD]) of the original sample and the effluent from BFR using PeCOD technique. The measured Δ[COD] was found to be directly proportional to the BOD5 values of the original sample with a slope independent of types and concentrations of organics. The slope was used to convert Δ[COD] to BOD5. The demonstrated analytical performance by BFR-PeCOD system surpasses all reported systems in many aspects. It has demonstrated ability to near real-time, online determining the organic pollution levels of wide range wastewaters without the need for dilution and ongoing calibration. The system possesses the widest analytical liner range (up to 800 mg O2 L(-1)) for BOD analysis, superior long-term stability, high accuracy, reliability, and simplicity.

Under a strict maternal transmission model, symbiont and host mitochondrial genomes pass through the same individuals leading to congruent host-symbiont phylogenies. In contrast, horizontally transmitted symbionts are environmentally acquired, leading to incongruent host-symbiont phylogenies. Each of these transmission strategies is predicted to have different consequences for symbiont ecology and genome evolution. Deep-sea mussels (Bathymodiolinae) are globally distributed at deep-sea hydrothermal vents, depend upon chemoautotrophic symbionts for their survival, and are hypothesized to transmit their symbionts horizontally. This study explored bathymodioline symbiont ecology through quantification of symbionts at two hydrothermal vent sites and symbiont evolution using functional gene phylogenies. These phylogenies revealed a dramatically more complex evolutionary history than 16S ribosomal RNA phylogenies, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer may have played an important role in symbiont gene evolution. Tests of the strict maternal transmission hypothesis found that host-symbiont lineages were significantly decoupled across multiple genes. These findings expand our understanding of symbiont ecology and evolution, and provide the strongest evidence yet for horizontal transmission of bathymodioline symbionts.

In glacier-fed streams microorganisms can attach to stones or sediments to form benthic biofilms. We used 454-pyrosequencing to explore the bulk (16S rDNA) and putatively active (16S rRNA) microbial communities of stone and sediment biofilms across 26 glacier-fed streams. We found differences in community composition between bulk and active communities among streams and a stronger congruence between biofilm types. Relative abundances of rRNA and rDNA were positively correlated across different taxa and taxonomic levels, but at lower taxonomic levels, the higher abundance in either the active or the bulk communities became more apparent. Here, environmental variables played a minor role in structuring active communities. However, we found a large number of rare taxa with higher relative abundances in rRNA compared with rDNA. This suggests that rare taxa contribute disproportionately to microbial community dynamics in glacier-fed streams. Our findings propose that high community turnover, where taxa repeatedly enter and leave the 'seed bank', contributes to the maintenance of microbial biodiversity in harsh ecosystems with continuous environmental perturbations, such as glacier-fed streams.

Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain PM5(T) belonged to the class Ktedonobacteria, and was related most closely to Thermogemmatispora onikobensis ONI-1(T) (97.7 % similarity) and Thermogemmatispora foliorum ONI-5(T) (96.1 %). Morphological features and fatty acid profiles (major fatty acids: iso-C17 : 0, iso-C19 : 0 and 12,17-dimethyl C18 : 0) supported the affiliation of strain PM5(T) to the genus Thermogemmatispora. Strain PM5(T) oxidized carbon monoxide [CO; 10±1 nmol h(-1) (mg protein)(-1)], but did not grow with CO as a sole carbon and energy source. Results from analyses of related strains indicated that the capacity for CO uptake occurred commonly among the members of the class Ktedonobacteria; 13 of 14 strains tested consumed CO or harboured coxL genes that potentially enabled CO oxidation. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological and biochemical tests allowed the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain PM5(T) from the two recognized species of the genus Thermogemmatispora. Strain PM5(T) differed from Thermogemmatispora onikobensis ONI-1(T) in its production of orange pigment, lower temperature optimum, hydrolysis of casein and starch, inability to grow with mannitol, xylose or rhamnose as sole carbon sources, and utilization of organic acids and amino acids. Strain PM5(T) is therefore considered to represent a novel species, for which the name Thermogemmatispora carboxidivorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is PM5(T) ( = DSM 45816(T) = ATCC BAA-2534(T)).

Viable count method, CLSM and SEM analysis confirmed that mature, uniform and viable biofilms can be formed on the polycarbonate membranes by this method. The three-dimensional heterogeneity of biofilm was confirmed on the basis of results of CLSM, which is an important characteristics of in vivo biofilm system.

Amikacin at a concentration of 40 μg ml⁻¹ was effective against younger biofilm whereas ineffective against older biofilm that showed sparsely populated dead cells using the BacLight viability staining kit. Role of altered morphological characteristics toward increased antibiotic susceptibility was also studied for different phases of K. pneumoniae biofilm by CLSM and light microscopy.

Microcolonies of spiroplasma embedded in biofilm bound to clay are the likely mechanism of lateral transmission of scrapie in sheep and chronic wasting disease in deer via soil ingestion. Spiroplasma in biofilm bound to the stainless steel of surgical instruments may also cause iatrogenic transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Sessile spiroplasma in biofilm attach to the surface by curli-like fibrils, a functional amyloid that is important for spiroplasma entering cells. Curli fibers have been shown to interact with host proteins and initiate formation of a potentially toxic amyloid that multiplies by self-assembly. In TSE, this mechanism may explain how spiroplasma trigger the formation of prion amyloid. This possibility is supported by experiments that show spiroplasma produce α-synuclein in mammalian tissue cultures. The data linking spiroplasma to neurodegenerative diseases provide a rationale for developing diagnostic tests for TSE based on the presence of spiroplasma-specific proteins or nucleic acid.

It has been used since ancient times for treating wide range of illnesses. Bacterial cells adheres to surfaces and develop structures known as biofilms. These structures are natural survival strategy of the bacteria to invade the host. They are more tolerant to commonly used antimicrobial agents, thus being more difficult to be controlled. This leads to increase in severity of infection. In this study, we have investigated the effect of silver nanoparticles in the formation of biofilm in multidrug resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Observation showed that biofilm formation occurred at bacterial concentration of 10(6) cfu/ml for the sensitive strain of P. aeruginosa while in the resistant strain, the biofilm was evident at bacterial concentration of about 10(3) cfu/ml. The biofilm were then tested against various concentrations of silver nanoparticles to determine the inhibitory effect of the silver nanoparticles. In the sensitive strain, 20 μg/ml of silver nanoparticles inhibited the growth optimally at bacterial concentration of 10(4) cfu/ml with an inhibition rate of 67%. Similarly, silver nanoparticles inhibited the formation of biofilm in the resistant strain at an optimal bacterial concentration of 10(5) cfu/ml with an inhibition rate of 56%.

In addition, once contaminated, pathogens may internalize into produce and be protected from disinfectants during the postharvest processing step. The objective of the current study was to determine the potential internalization of Escherichia coli O157:H7 into spinach roots and subsequent transfer to the edible parts. Because curli are involved in biofilm formation, we investigated whether their presence influence the internalization of E. coli O157:H7 into spinach. Further, the effect of the spinach cultivar on E. coli O157:H7 internalization was evaluated. Spinach plants were grown in contaminated soil as well as hydroponically to prevent mechanical wounding of the roots and inadvertent transfer of pathogens from the contamination source to the non-exposed plant surfaces. Results showed that E. coli O157:H7 could internalize into hydroponically grown intact spinach plants through the root system and move to the stem and leaf level. The incidence of internalization was significantly higher in hydroponically grown plants when roots were exposed to 7 log CFU/mL compared to those exposed to 5 log CFU/mL. The effect of cultivar on E. coli O157:H7 internalization was not significant (P>0.05) for the analyzed spinach varieties, internalization incidences showing almost equal distribution between Space and Waitiki, 49.06% and 50.94% respectively. Wounding of the root system in hydroponically grown spinach increased the incidence of E. coli O157:H7 internalization and translocation to the edible portions of the plant. Experimental contamination of the plants grown in soil resulted in a greater number of internalization events then in those grown hydroponically, suggesting that E. coli O157:H7 internalization is dependent on root damage, which is more likely to occur when plants are grown in soil. Curli expression by E. coli O157:H7 had no significant effect on its root uptake by spinach plants.","authors":[{"name":"Dumitru Macarisin"},{"name":"Jitendra Patel"},{"name":"Vijay K Sharma"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Escherichia coli O157:H7"},{"word":"Internalization"},{"word":"Produce contamination"},{"word":"Spinach"}]},"article304":{"pmid":"24412479","title":"Structure and composition of biofilm communities in a moving bed biofilm reactor for nitritation-anammox at low temperatures.","date":"2014-01-22","abs":"It is a challenge to apply anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) for nitrogen removal from wastewater at low temperatures.

The culture-impaired phenotype is caused by mutations that alter the outer-membrane lipopolysaccharide structure.

However, outside the protected biofilm environment, the mutations sensitize the variants to killing by a self-produced antimicrobial agent. Thus, a biofilm-mediated adaptation produces a stark fitness trade-off that compromises bacterial survival in culture. Trade-offs like this could limit the ability of bacteria to transition between biofilm growth and the free-living state and produce bacterial populations that escape detection by culture-based sampling.

This organism can be exposed to a wide range of concentrations of antimicrobials during treatment; learning more about the responses of P. aeruginosa to antimicrobials is therefore important. We review here responses of the bacterium P. aeruginosa upon exposure to antimicrobials at levels below the inhibitory concentration. Carbapenems (e.g., imipenem) have been shown to induce the formation of thicker and more robust biofilms, while fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) and aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin) have been shown to induce biofilm formation. Ciprofloxacin also has been demonstrated to enhance the frequency of mutation to carbapenem resistance. Conversely, although macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) typically are not effective against P. aeruginosa because of the pseudomonal outer-membrane impermeability and efflux, macrolides do lead to a reduction in virulence factor production. Similarly, tetracycline is not very effective against this organism, but is known to induce the type-III secretion system and consequently enhance cytotoxicity of P. aeruginosa in vivo. Of special note are the effects of antibacterials and disinfectants on pseudomonal efflux systems. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of protein synthesis inhibitors (aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, etc.) induce the MexXY multidrug efflux system. This response is known to be mediated by interference with the translation of the leader peptide PA5471.1, with consequent effects on expression of the PA5471 gene product. Additionally, induction of the MexCD-OprJ multidrug efflux system is observed upon exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of disinfectants such as chlorhexidine and benzalkonium. This response is known to be dependent upon the AlgU stress response factor. Altogether, these biological responses of P. aeruginosa provide useful clues for the improvement and optimization of chemotherapy in order to appropriately treat pseudomonal infections while minimizing the emergence of resistance.

L. monocytogenes persistence in other food-associated environments (e.g., farms and retail establishments) may also contribute to food contamination and transmission of the pathogen to humans. Although L. monocytogenes persistence is typically identified through isolation of a specific molecular subtype from samples collected in a given environment over time, formal (statistical) criteria for identification of persistence are undefined. Environmental factors (e.g., facilities and equipment that are difficult to clean) have been identified as key contributors to persistence; however, the mechanisms are less well understood. Although some researchers have reported that persistent strains possess specific characteristics that may facilitate persistence (e.g., biofilm formation and better adaptation to stress conditions), other researchers have not found significant differences between persistent and nonpersistent strains in the phenotypic characteristics that might facilitate persistence. This review includes a discussion of our current knowledge concerning some key issues associated with the persistence of L. monocytogenes, with special focus on (i) persistence in food processing plants and other food-associated environments, (ii) persistence in the general environment, (iii) phenotypic and genetic characteristics of persistent strains, (iv) niches, and (v) public health and economic implications of persistence. Although the available data clearly indicate that L. monocytogenes persistence at various stages of the food chain contributes to contamination of finished products, continued efforts to quantitatively integrate data on L. monocytogenes persistence (e.g., meta-analysis or quantitative microbial risk assessment) will be needed to advance our understanding of persistence of this pathogen and its economic and public health impacts.

Strains that were of serotype 1/2b and were assigned to the same genotype by multi-virulence-locus sequence typing analysis were isolated on repeated occasions from December 1997 to June 1998 and thus were defined as persistent strains. In the present study, biofilm formation by the persistent strains was evaluated using microplates at 30 and 37°C. The biofilm-forming capability was measured after cells attaching to the microplate well were stained with crystal violet. Comparison of biofilm formation at 30°C among the persistent strains showed that a significantly higher amount of the stain was obtained from the persistent strains isolated from December to March than from those isolated from April to June. However, no significant difference in biofilm formation at 30°C was observed between persistent and nonpersistent groups of L. monocytogenes strains. In contrast, biofilm formation at 37°C was consistent among the persistent strains, and they produced significantly more biofilm at 37°C than did the nonpersistent strains. The persistent strains were also found to change their biofilm-forming ability in a temperature-dependent manner, which may suggest that the persistent strains alter their biofilm formation in response to changing environmental factors.

This precursor of the cofactors flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide is a bioactive molecule that has a beneficial effect on plant growth. The ribBA gene of S. meliloti codes for a putative bifunctional enzyme with dihydroxybutanone phosphate synthase and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase II activities, catalyzing the initial steps of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. We show here that an in-frame deletion of ribBA does not cause riboflavin auxotrophy or affect the ability of S. meliloti to establish an effective symbiosis with the host plant but does affect the ability of the bacteria to secrete flavins, colonize host-plant roots, and compete for nodulation. A strain missing the RibBA protein retains considerable GTP cyclohydrolase II activity. Based on these results, we hypothesize that S. meliloti has two partly interchangeable modules for biosynthesis of riboflavin, one fulfilling the internal need for flavins in bacterial metabolism and the other producing riboflavin for secretion. Our data also indicate that bacteria-derived flavins play a role in communication between rhizobia and the legume host and that the RibBA protein is important in this communication process even though it is not essential for riboflavin biosynthesis and symbiosis.

Understanding the fundamental microbial adhesion mechanisms and biofilm development is crucial for developing strategies to prevent such infections.

This study aimed (i) to modify the previously described constant-depth film fermenter for the reproducible cultivation of biofilms at non-depth-restricted, constant and low shear conditions and (ii) to use this system to elucidate bacterial adhesion kinetics on different biomaterials, focusing on biomaterials surface nanoroughness and hydrophobicity. Chemostat-grown Escherichia coli were used for biofilm cultivation on titanium oxide and investigating bacterial adhesion over time on titanium oxide, poly(styrene), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and glass. Using chemostat-grown microbial cells (single-species continuous culture) minimized variations between the biofilms cultivated during different experimental runs. Bacterial adhesion on biomaterials comprised an initial lag-phase I followed by a fast adhesion phase II and a phase of saturation III. With increasing biomaterials surface nanoroughness and increasing hydrophobicity, adhesion rates increased during phases I and II. The influence of materials surface hydrophobicity seemed to exceed that of nanoroughness during the lag-phase I, whereas it was vice versa during adhesion phase II. This study introduces the non-constant-depth film fermenter in combination with a chemostat culture to allow for a controlled approach to reproducibly cultivate biofilms and to investigate bacterial adhesion kinetics at constant and low shear conditions. The findings will support developing and adequate testing of biomaterials surface modifications eventually preventing biomaterial-associated infections.

Just how electrons are transported through such a biofilm from cells to the underlying anode surface over distances that can exceed 20 microns remains unresolved. Current evidence suggests it may occur by electron hopping through a proposed network of redox cofactors composed of immobile outer membrane and/or extracellular multi-heme c-type cytochromes. In the present work, we perform a spatially resolved confocal resonant Raman (CRR) microscopic analysis to investigate anode-grown Geobacter biofilms. The results confirm the presence of an intra-biofilm redox gradient whereby the probability that a heme is in the reduced state increases with increasing distance from the anode surface. Such a gradient is required to drive electron transport toward the anode surface by electron hopping via cytochromes. The results also indicate that at open circuit, when electrons are expected to accumulate in redox cofactors involved in electron transport due to the inability of the anode to accept electrons, nearly all c-type cytochrome hemes detected in the biofilm are oxidized. The same outcome occurs when a comparable potential to that measured at open circuit (-0.30 V vs. SHE) is applied to the anode, whereas nearly all hemes are reduced when an exceedingly negative potential (-0.50 V vs. SHE) is applied to the anode. These results suggest that nearly all c-type cytochrome hemes detected in the biofilm can be electrochemically accessed by the electrode, but most have oxidation potentials too negative to transport electrons originating from acetate metabolism. The results also reveal a lateral heterogeneity (x-y dimensions) in the type of c-type cytochromes within the biofilm that may affect electron transport to the electrode.

Phenotypic assays were compared between ES (E. scolopes) and ET (E. tasmanica) V. fischeri wild isolates to determine if convergent evolution was apparent between E. tasmanica evolved lines and ET V. fischeri. Ecological diversification was observed in utilization of most carbon sources examined. Convergent evolution was evident in motility, biofilm formation, and select carbon sources displaying hyperpolymorphic usage in V. fischeri. Convergence in bioluminescence (a 2.5-fold increase in brightness) was collectively evident in the derived lines relative to the ancestor. However, dramatic changes in other properties--time points and cell densities of first light emission and maximal light output and emergence of a lag phase in growth curves of derived lines--suggest that increased light intensity per se was not the only important factor. Convergent evolution implies that gnotobiotic squid light organs subject colonizing V. fischeri to similar selection pressures. Adaptation to novel hosts appears to involve flexible microbial metabolism, establishment of biofilm and swarmer V. fischeri ecotypes, and complex changes in bioluminescence. Our data demonstrate that numerous alternate fitness optima or peaks are available to V. fischeri in host adaptive landscapes, where novel host squids serve as habitat islands. Thus, V. fischeri founder flushes occur during the initiation of light organ colonization that ultimately trigger founder effect diversification.","authors":[{"name":"William Soto"},{"name":"Ferdinand M Rivera"},{"name":"Michele K Nishiguchi"}],"keywords":[]},"article333":{"pmid":"24402362","title":"Molecular techniques revealed highly diverse microbial communities in natural marine biofilms on polystyrene dishes for invertebrate larval settlement.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Biofilm microbial communities play an important role in the larval settlement response of marine invertebrates. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be resolved, mainly because of the uncertainties in characterizing members in the communities using traditional 16S rRNA gene-based molecular methods and in identifying the chemical signals involved. In this study, pyrosequencing was used to characterize the bacterial communities in intertidal and subtidal marine biofilms developed during two seasons. We revealed highly diverse biofilm bacterial communities that varied with season and tidal level. Over 3,000 operational taxonomic units with estimates of up to 8,000 species were recovered in a biofilm sample, which is by far the highest number recorded in subtropical marine biofilms. Nineteen phyla were found, of which Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most dominant one in the intertidal and subtidal biofilms, respectively. Apart from these, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes were the major groups recovered in both intertidal and subtidal biofilms, although their relative abundance varied among samples. Full-length 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed for the four biofilm samples and showed similar bacterial compositions at the phylum level to those revealed by pyrosequencing. Laboratory assays confirmed that cyrids of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite preferred to settle on the intertidal rather than subtidal biofilms. This preference was independent of the biofilm bacterial density or biomass but was probably related to the biofilm community structure, particularly, the Proteobacterial and Cyanobacterial groups.

The objectives of this study were to identify and characterize marine bacteria isolated from biofilms developed on inert surfaces immersed in the Mediterranean Sea and to evaluate their capacity to form a biofilm in vitro. Here, 13 marine bacterial strains have been isolated from different supports immersed in seawater in the Bay of Toulon (France). Phylogenetic analysis and different biological and physico-chemical properties have been investigated. Among the 13 strains recovered, 8 different genera and 12 different species were identified including 2 isolates of a novel bacterial species that we named Persicivirga mediterranea and whose genus had never been isolated from the Mediterranean Sea. Shewanella sp. and Pseudoalteromonas sp. were the most preponderant genera recovered in our conditions. The phenotypical characterization revealed that one isolate belonging to the Polaribacter genus differed from all the other ones by its hydrophobic properties and poor ability to form biofilms in vitro. Identifying and characterizing species isolated from seawater including from Mediterranean ecosystems could be helpful for example, to understand some aspects of bacterial biodiversity and to further study the mechanisms of biofilm (and biofouling) development in conditions approaching those of the marine environment.

Here, we show with in vitro experiments that, compared with glucose, common fermentation products from co-habitant bacteria significantly increase virulence factor production, antimicrobial activity and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. The maximum stimulating effect was produced with the fermentation product 2,3-butanediol, which is a substrate for P. aeruginosa, resulting in a metabolic relationship between fermenters and this pathogen. The global transcription regulator LasI LasR, which controls quorum sensing, was upregulated threefold with 2,3-butanediol, resulting in higher phenazine and exotoxin concentrations and improved biofilm formation. This indicates that the success of P. aeruginosa in CF airway microbiomes could be governed by the location within the food web with fermenting bacteria. Our findings suggest that interbacterial metabolite transfer in polymicrobial infections stimulates virulence of P. aeruginosa and could have a considerable impact on disease progression.

Effects of disinfectant (chloramines, chlorine), water age (2.3 days, 5.7 days), and pipe material (cement, iron, PVC) were compared in parallel triplicate simulated water distribution systems. Pyrosequencing was employed to characterize bacteria and terminal restriction fragment polymorphism was used to profile both bacteria and eukaryotes inhabiting pipe biofilms.

Pipe material only influenced the bacterial community structure (ANOSIM test, P < 0.05). Interactive effects of disinfectant, pipe material, and water age on both bacteria and eukaryotes were noted. Disinfectant concentration had the strongest effect on bacteria, while dissolved oxygen appeared to be a major driver for eukaryotes (BEST test).

Using the developed nanoporous microfluidic device to precisely modulate the cellular environment, we exposed the individual Listeria cells to acetic acid and, in real time and with high resolution, observed how the cells reacted to the change in their surroundings.

This drop in motility has numerous effects on the cell; its main effects being the obstruction of the cell's ability to properly form biofilms and a reduction in the overall infectivity of the cells.

As the polymer passages through the periplasm, 22-44% of the mannuronate residues are converted to α-L-guluronate by the C5-epimerase AlgG to produce a polymer of alternating β-D-mannuronate and α-L-guluronate blocks and stretches of polymannuronate.

Electrostatic surface potential and residue conservation analyses in conjunction with activity and substrate docking studies suggest that a conserved electropositive groove facilitates polymannuronate binding and contains at least nine substrate binding subsites. These subsites likely align the polymer in the correct register for catalysis to occur. The presence of multiple subsites, the electropositive groove, and the non-random distribution of guluronate in the alginate polymer suggest that AlgG is a processive enzyme.

Recognition of coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (RPS) on strains of Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus oralis by Actinomyces spp. type 2 fimbriae is the principal mechanism of these interactions. Previous studies of genetic loci for synthesis of RPS (rps) and RPS precursors (rml, galE1 and galE2) in S. gordonii 38 and S. oralis 34 revealed differences between these strains. To determine whether these differences are strain-specific or species-specific, we identified and compared loci for polysaccharide biosynthesis in additional strains of these species and in several strains of the previously unstudied species, S. sanguinis. Genes for synthesis of RPS precursors distinguished the rps loci of different streptococci. Hence, rml genes for synthesis of TDP-L-Rha were in rps loci of S. oralis strains but at other loci in S. gordonii and S. sanguinis. Genes for two distinct galactose epimerases were also distributed differently. Hence, galE1 for epimerization of UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal was in galactose operons of S. gordonii and S. sanguinis strains but surprisingly, this gene was not present in S. oralis. Moreover, galE2 for epimerization of both UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc was at a different locus in each species, including rps operons of S. sanguinis. The findings provide insight into cell surface properties that distinguish different RPS-producing streptococci and open an approach for identifying these bacteria based on the arrangement of genes for synthesis of polysaccharide precursors.

This biofilm, which can form in as little as 48 hours depending on water temperature, increases drag on watercraft, which greatly reduces their fuel efficiency. In addition, biofouling can lead to microbially induced corrosion (MIC) due to H2S formed by the bacteria, especially sulfate-reducing bacteria. When the International Maritime Organization (IMO) international convention banned the use of effective but environmentally damaging coatings containing tributyl tin in 2008, the development of clean and effective antifouling systems became more important than ever. New nonbiocidal coatings are now in high demand. Scientists have developed new polymers, materials, and biocides, including new elastomeric coatings that they have obtained by improving the original silicone (polydimethylsiloxane) formulation patented in 1975. However, the high cost of silicones, especially of fluoropolymer-modified silicones, has generally prevented their large-scale diffusion. In 2009, traditional antifouling coatings using cuprous oxide formulated in copolymer paints still represented 95% of the global market volume of anti-fouling paints. The sol-gel nanochemistry approach to functional materials has emerged as an attractive candidate for creating low fouling surfaces due to the unique structure and properties of silica-based coatings and of hybrid inorganic-organic silicas in particular. Sol-gel formulations easily bind to all types of surfaces, such as steel, fiberglass, aluminum, and wood. In addition, they can cure at room temperature and form thin glassy coatings that are markedly different from thick silicone elastomeric foul-releasing coatings. Good to excellent performance against biofouling, low cure temperatures, enhanced and prolonged chemical and physical stability, ease of application, and the waterborne nature of sol-gel coatings all support the diffusion of these paints to efficiently reduce the accumulation of fouling layers on valued surfaces immersed in marine or fluvial waters. Furthermore, sol-gel glassy coatings are transparent and can be effectively applied to optical devices, windows, and solar panels used in lake, fluvial, or marine environments. Sol-gel technology is eminently versatile, and the first generation sol-gel paints have already shown good performance. Even so, vast opportunities still exist for chemists to develop novel sol-gel derived coatings to both prevent biofouling and enhance the hydrodynamic properties of boat and ship hulls. Moreover, researchers have prepared and applied multifunctional sol-gel coatings providing protection against both biofouling and corrosion. They have tested these in the marine environment with good preliminary results. In this Account, we discuss some of our new strategies for the controlled functionalization of surfaces for the development of efficient antifouling and foul-releasing systems and summarize the main achievements with biocidal and nonbiocidal sol-gel coatings. We conclude by giving insight into the marine coatings and sol-gel products markets, providing arguments to justify our conclusion that the sol-gel coatings technology is now a mature platform for the development of economically viable and environmentally friendly antifouling and foul-release formulations of enhanced performance.

A PG dl-carboxypeptidase Pgp1 essential for maintenance of C. jejuni helical shape was recently identified. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the CJJ81176_0915 gene product as co-occurring with Pgp1 in several organisms. Deletion of cjj81176_0915 (renamed pgp2) resulted in straight morphology, representing the second C. jejuni gene affecting cell shape. The PG structure of a Δpgp2 mutant showed an increase in tetrapeptide-containing muropeptides and a complete absence of tripeptides, consistent with ld-carboxypeptidase activity, which was confirmed biochemically. PG analysis of a Δpgp1Δpgp2 double mutant demonstrated that Pgp2 activity is required to generate the tripeptide substrate for Pgp1. Loss of pgp2 affected several pathogenic properties; the deletion strain was defective for motility in semisolid agar, biofilm formation, and fluorescence on calcofluor white. Δpgp2 PG also caused decreased stimulation of the human nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1) proinflammatory mediator in comparison with wild type, as expected from the reduction in muropeptide tripeptides (the primary Nod1 agonist) in the mutant; however, these changes did not alter the ability of the Δpgp2 mutant strain to survive within human epithelial cells or to elicit secretion of IL-8 from epithelial cells after infection. The pgp2 mutant also showed significantly reduced fitness in a chick colonization model. Collectively, these analyses enhance our understanding of C. jejuni PG maturation and help to clarify how PG structure and cell shape impact pathogenic attributes.

This review provides a summary of the recent occurrence of micropollutants in the aquatic environment including sewage, surface water, groundwater and drinking water. The discharge of treated effluent from WWTPs is a major pathway for the introduction of micropollutants to surface water. WWTPs act as primary barriers against the spread of micropollutants. WWTP removal efficiency of the selected micropollutants in 14 countries/regions depicts compound-specific variation in removal, ranging from 12.5 to 100%. Advanced treatment processes, such as activated carbon adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and membrane bioreactors can achieve higher and more consistent micropollutant removal. However, regardless of what technology is employed, the removal of micropollutants depends on physico-chemical properties of micropollutants and treatment conditions. The evaluation of micropollutant removal from municipal wastewater should cover a series of aspects from sources to end uses. After the release of micropollutants, a better understanding and modeling of their fate in surface water is essential for effectively predicting their impacts on the receiving environment.

This study was performed on four photosystem II inhibitor herbicides (atrazine, terbutryn, diuron, and isoproturon) and 14 diatom species representative of Lake Geneva biofilm diversity. Using recent statistical tools provided by phylogenetics, we observed a strong phylogenetic signal for diatom sensitivity to herbicides. There was a major division in sensitivity to herbicides within the phylogenetic tree. The most sensitive species were mainly centrics and araphid diatoms (in this study, Thalassiosirales and Fragilariales), whereas the most resistant species were mainly pennates (in this study, Cymbellales, Naviculales, and Bacillariales). However, there was considerable variability in diatom sensitivity within the raphid clade, which could be explained by differences in trophic preferences (autotrophy or heterotrophy). These traits appeared to be complementary in explaining the differences in sensitivity observed at a refined phylogenetic level. Using phylogeny together with complementary traits, as trophic preferences, may help to predict the sensitivity of communities with a view to protecting their ecosystem.

In this study, we investigated the effect of two quorum-sensing inhibitors for preventing in vitro biofilm formation in wild-type E. coli O103:H2.

Oxygenal 6© was the most efficacious in preventing the growth of yeasts in tap water. However, in the presence of FLA, Oxygenal 6© displayed a reduced antimicrobial activity against sessile C. albicans. In conclusion, none of the tested disinfectants could eradicate yeasts or FLA.

The pathogenesis of S. epidermidis is thought to be based on its capacity to form biofilms on the surface of medical devices, where bacterial cells may persist, protected from host defence and antimicrobial agents. Rifampin has been shown to be one of the most active antimicrobial agents in the eradication of the staphylococcal biofilm. However, this antibiotic should not be used in monotherapy. Therefore, one of the objectives of our research was to study the efficacy of the tigecycline/rifampin combination against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis embedded in biofilms. Of the 80 clinically significant S. epidermidis isolates, 75 strains possess the ability to form a biofilm. These bacteria formed the biofilm via ica-dependent mechanisms. However, other biofilm-associated genes, including aap (encoding accumulation-associated protein) and bhp (coding cell wall-associated protein), were present in 85 and 29 % of isolates, respectively. The biofilm structures of S. epidermidis strains were also analyzed in confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and the obtained image demonstrated differences in their architecture. In vitro studies showed that the MIC value for tigecycline against S. epidermidis growing in the biofilm ranged from 0.125 to 2 μg/mL. Tigecycline in combination with rifampin demonstrated higher activity against bacteria embedded in biofilms than tigecycline alone.","authors":[{"name":"Ewa Szczuka"},{"name":"Adam Kaznowski"}],"keywords":[]},"article374":{"pmid":"24390015","title":"Cariogenicity of Streptococcus mutans glucan-binding protein deletion mutants.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Streptococcus mutans is a principal etiologic agent in the development of dental caries due to its exceptional aciduric and acidogenic properties, and its ability to adhere and accumulate in large numbers on tooth surfaces in the presence of sucrose. Sucrose-dependent adherence is mediated by glucans, polymers of glucose synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferase (Gtf) enzymes. S. mutans makes several proteins that have the property of binding glucans. We hypothesized that three of these glucan-binding proteins (Gbps), Gbps A, C and D, contribute to the cariogenicity of S. mutans. A specific pathogen-free rat model was used to compare the cariogenicity of S. mutans UA130 and a panel of mutants with individual or multiple gbp gene deletions. The mutants were also evaluated in vitro for properties related to cariogenicity, such as acidogenicity, aciduricity, and adhesion to glucan. Only a subset of Gbp mutants were attenuated for cariogenicity, with the combined loss of Gbps A and C most affecting smooth surface caries. The attenuation of Gbp mutant strains was unlikely due to differences in acid-related properties since the mutants were at least as acidogenic and acid-tolerant as the parental strain. Additionally, loss of Gbps did not reduce adhesion to a pre-formed biofilm of S. sanguinis. Analyses of the caries data with in vitro biofilm properties previously determined for the mutant panel found correlations between cariogenicity and biofilm depth and substratum coverage. It is concluded that Gbps contribute to the cariogenicity of S. mutans through a mechanism that may involve alteration of biofilm architecture.","authors":[{"name":"David J Lynch"},{"name":"Suzanne M Michalek"},{"name":"Min Zhu"},{"name":"David Drake"},{"name":"Fang Qian"},{"name":"Jeffrey A Banas"}],"keywords":[]},"article375":{"pmid":"24389279","title":"Arachidonic acid affects biofilm formation and PGE2 level in Candida albicans and non-albicans species in presence of subinhibitory concentration of fluconazole and terbinafine.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Candida albicans utilizes arachidonic acid (AA) released during the course of infection (Candidiasis) from phospholipids of infected host cell membranes and synthesizes extracellular prostaglandin(s) which play an important role in hyphae formation and host cell damage.

Pre-formed biofilms of S. epidermidis RP62A were challenged with linezolid and vancomycin at different concentrations as well as at their clinically relevant target concentration (15 mg/L) over time. Expression of icaA, atlE, aap, rnaIII, luxS, sarA, rsbU and icaR genes following 2h of exposure to these antibiotics was determined by quantitative PCR. Vancomycin did not significantly affect the biofilm under the tested conditions. However, linezolid affected the biofilm structure at concentrations of ≥ 2 mg/L (P<0.05); moreover, the exposure time to this antibiotic was a determinant for biofilm eradication. The level of transcription of icaA, aap and atlE increased by 5.18-, 2.58- and 3.06-fold, respectively, in biofilms exposed to linezolid, but no changes were observed for vancomycin. The other genes were not affected by these antibiotics. This study demonstrated that linezolid was effective in eradicating biofilms formed by S. epidermidis RP62A. Under the conditions tested, linezolid upregulated biofilm-associated genes probably due to the stress caused by low-dose antibiotic stimulation.

Exposure to PE induced changes in diatom assemblages for the biofilm originating from the reference field site with higher relative abundance of Eolimna minima and Nitzschia palea with PE exposure. Initial tolerance of phototrophic communities to PE was 8-fold higher for the biofilm originating from the chronically contaminated site compared to the reference field site.

Twenty-two CPFs with three different silver applications (non, only outside and both sides) were compared in a long-term loading experiment with Escherichia coli (K12 and WR1) and MS2 bacteriophages in natural challenge water under highly controlled laboratory circumstances. No significant difference in Log Removal Values were found between the filters with different silver applications.

The hypothesis that the absence of silver would enhance the virus removal, due to biofilm formation on the ceramic filter element, could not be confirmed. The removal effectiveness for viruses is still of major concern for the CPF.

Aerobic biodegradation of NA in properly designed bioreactors has been investigated in our earlier works. In the present work, anoxic biodegradation of trans-4-methyl-1-cyclohexane carboxylic acid (trans-4MCHCA) coupled to denitrification was investigated as a potential ex situ approach for the treatment of oil sand process waters in bioreactors whereby excessive aeration cost could be eliminated, or as an in situ alternative for the treatment of these waters in anoxic stabilization ponds amended with nitrate. Using batch and continuous reactors (CSTR and biofilm), effects of NA concentration (100-750mgL(-1)), NA loading rate (up to 2607.9mgL(-1)h(-1)) and temperature (10-35°C) on biodegradation and denitrification processes were evaluated. In the batch system biodegradation of trans-4MCHCA coupled to denitrification occurred even at the highest concentration of 750mgL(-1). Consistent with the patterns reported for aerobic biodegradation, increase in initial concentration of NA led to higher biodegradation and denitrification rates and the optimum temperature was determined as 23-24°C. In the CSTR, NA removal and nitrate reduction rates passed through a maximum due to increases in NA loading rate. NA loading rate of 157.8mgL(-1)h(-1) at which maximum anoxic NA and nitrate removal rates (105.3mgL(-1)h(-1) and 144.5mgL(-1)h(-1), respectively) occurred was much higher than those reported for the aerobic alternative (NA loading and removal rates: 14.2 and 9.6mgL(-1)h(-1), respectively). In the anoxic biofilm reactor removal rates of NA and nitrate were dependent on NA loading rate in a linear fashion for the entire range of applied loading rates. The highest loading and removal rates for NA were 2607.9 and 2028.1mgL(-1)h(-1), respectively which were at least twofold higher than the values reported for the aerobic biofilm reactor.

It was previously shown that prophage insertions in mlrA and heterogeneous mutations in rpoS constituted major obstacles limiting biofilm formation and the expression of extracellular curli fibers in strains of Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7. The purpose of this study was to test strains from other important serotypes of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) (O26, O45, O103, O111, O113, O121, and O145) for similar regulatory restrictions. In a small but diverse collection of biofilm-forming and non-forming strains, mlrA prophage insertions were identified in only 4 of the 19 strains (serotypes O103, O113, and O145). Only the STEC O103 and O113 strains could be complemented by a trans-copy of mlrA to restore curli production and Congo red (CR) dye affinity. RpoS mutations were found in 5 strains (4 serotypes), each with low CR affinity, and the defects were moderately restored by a wild-type copy of rpoS in 2 of the 3 strains attempted. Fourteen strains in this study showed no or weak biofilm formation, of which 9 could be explained by prophage insertions or rpoS mutations. However, each of the remaining five biofilm-deficient strains, as well as the two O145 strains that could not be complemented by mlrA, showed complete or nearly complete lack of motility. This study indicates that mlrA prophage insertions and rpoS mutations do limit biofilm and curli expression in the non-serotype O157:H7 STEC but prophage insertions may not be as common as in serotype O157:H7 strains. The results also suggest that lack of motility provides a third major factor limiting biofilm formation in the non-O157:H7 STEC.

We utilized our established model of CNS catheter-associated infection, similar to CSF shunt infections seen in humans, to compare the kinetics of bacterial titers, cytokine production and inflammatory cell influx elicited by wild type S. aureus versus an isogenic sarA mutant. The sarA mutant was more rapidly cleared from infected catheters compared to its isogenic wild type strain. Consistent with this finding, several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-17, CXCL1, and IL-1β were significantly increased in the brain following infection with the sarA mutant versus wild type S. aureus, in agreement with the fact that the sarA mutant displayed impaired biofilm growth and favored a planktonic state. Neutrophil influx into the infected hemisphere was also increased in the animals infected with the sarA mutant compared to wild type bacteria. These changes were not attributable to extracellular protease activity, which is increased in the context of SarA mutation, since similar responses were observed between sarA and a sarA/protease mutant. Overall, these results demonstrate that sarA plays an important role in attenuating the inflammatory response during staphylococcal biofilm infection in the CNS via a mechanism that remains to be determined.

Infections are a significant cause of mortality for endangered southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis), but the transmission mechanism is poorly understood. Otter exposure to T. gondii has been linked to the consumption of marine turban snails in kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forests. It is unknown how turban snails acquire oocysts, as snails scrape food particles attached to surfaces, whereas T. gondii oocysts enter kelp beds as suspended particles via runoff. We hypothesized that waterborne T. gondii oocysts attach to kelp surfaces when encountering exopolymer substances (EPS) forming the sticky matrix of biofilms on kelp, and thus become available to snails. Results of a dietary composition analysis of field-collected snails and of kelp biofilm indicate that snails graze the dense kelp-biofilm assemblage composed of pennate diatoms and bacteria inserted within the EPS gel-like matrix. To test whether oocysts attach to kelp blades via EPS, we designed a laboratory experiment simulating the kelp forest canopy in tanks spiked with T. gondii surrogate microspheres and controlled for EPS and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP - the particulate form of EPS). On average, 19% and 31% of surrogates were detected attached to kelp surfaces covered with EPS in unfiltered and filtered seawater treatments, respectively. The presence of TEP in the seawater did not increase surrogate attachment. These findings support a novel transport mechanism of T. gondii oocysts: as oocysts enter the kelp forest canopy, a portion adheres to the sticky kelp biofilms. Snails grazing this biofilm encounter oocysts as 'bycatch' and thereby deliver the parasite to sea otters that prey upon snails. This novel mechanism can have health implications beyond T. gondii and otters, as a similar route of pathogen transmission may be implicated with other waterborne pathogens to marine wildlife and humans consuming biofilm-feeding invertebrates.

The goal of this study was to characterize the ecological processes that mediate host-specificity of the vertebrate gut symbiont Lactobacillus reuteri, and to systematically identify the bacterial factors that are involved. Experiments with monoassociated mice revealed that the ability of L. reuteri to form epithelial biofilms in the mouse forestomach is strictly dependent on the strain's host origin. To unravel the molecular basis for this host-specific biofilm formation, we applied a combination of transcriptome analysis and comparative genomics and identified eleven genes of L. reuteri 100-23 that were predicted to play a role. We then determined expression and importance of these genes during in vivo biofilm formation in monoassociated mice. This analysis revealed that six of the genes were upregulated in vivo, and that genes encoding for proteins involved in epithelial adherence, specialized protein transport, cell aggregation, environmental sensing, and cell lysis contributed to biofilm formation. Inactivation of a serine-rich surface adhesin with a devoted transport system (the SecA2-SecY2 pathway) completely abrogated biofilm formation, indicating that initial adhesion represented the most significant step in biofilm formation, likely conferring host specificity. In summary, this study established that the epithelial selection of bacterial symbionts in the vertebrate gut can be both specific and highly efficient, resulting in biofilms that are exclusively formed by the coevolved strains, and it allowed insight into the bacterial effectors of this process.

The differences between Escherichia coli strains causing UTI among hospitalised children and adults remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we examined the genetic relatedness and virulence gene (VG) profiles of a collection of E. coli causing UTI among hospitalised children and adults. Genetic relatedness among the strains was investigated using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and the strains were characterised using a combination of phylogenetic grouping, the ability to form biofilm and the presence of antigen 43 (Ag43) and its five known alleles, as well 20 VGs associated with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC). RAPD analysis resolved six major clusters, with two clusters (A and B) consisting almost exclusively of E. coli isolated from children. Isolates from children had a higher prevalence of alpha-haemolysin (hlyA, p < 0.05) and group II capsular polysaccharide synthesis genes (kpsMT II, p < 0.01) than adults. In contrast, E. coli strains from adults had a higher prevalence of invasive ibeA (p < 0.05) and Ag43 (agn43) (p < 0.05) genes, and produced significantly (p < 0.001) more biofilm than E. coli from children. Adult isolates also carried significantly (p < 0.05) more agn43 allele RS218 compared to isolates from children, which carried significantly (p < 0.05) more of the agn43 allele bCFT073. Our results suggest that bacterial virulence factors play an important role in UTI among hospitalised children; however, further research will determine whether these findings apply to a larger cohort and other clinical settings for UTI in children and adults.

These transitions to multicellularity have occurred independently several times for various ecological reasons, resulting in a broad range of phenotypes. In this Review, we discuss the strategies that are used by bacteria to form and grow in multicellular structures that have hallmark features of multicellularity, including morphological differentiation, programmed cell death and patterning. In addition, we examine the evolutionary and ecological factors that lead to the wide range of coordinated multicellular behaviours that are observed in bacteria.

A reticular structure of extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM) with filamentous bacteria as the skeleton was observed on the basal layer through SEM-EDS test. Among the four commercial proteases and amylases from Genencor®, proteases were shown to have better performances than amylases either on the removal of MLSS and PN/MLSS or on DOC (i.e., dissolved organic carbon)/MLSS raising of biofilm pellets. Difference of dynamic fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matters after treated by the two proteases indicated distinguishing mechanisms of the treating process.

Much remains to be learned about posttraumatic arthritis, and there are few circumstances in which a definitive arthroplasty should be performed in an acutely injured and open joint. Although the last decade has seen tremendous advances in the treatment of combat upper extremity injuries, many questions remain unanswered, and continued research focusing on improving reconstruction of large segmental defects remains critical. Discussion of infection centered on the need for novel methods to reduce the bacterial load following the initial débridement procedures. Novel methods of delivering antimicrobial therapy and anti-inflammatory medications directly to the wound were discussed as well as the need for near real-time assessment of bacterial and fungal burden and further means of prevention and treatment of biofilm formation and the importance of animal models to test therapies discussed. Moderators and lecturers of focus groups noted the continuing need for improved prehospital care in the management of junctional injuries, identified optimal strategies for both surgical repair and/or reconstruction of the ligaments in multiligamentous injuries, and noted the need to mitigate bone mineral density loss following amputation and/or limb salvage as well as the necessity of developing better methods of anticipating and managing heterotopic ossification.

Wrinkle structures and related sedimentary structures in the rock record are commonly interpreted to represent the stabilizing influence of cyanobacteria on sediments because cyanobacteria are known to produce similar textures and structures in modern tidal flat settings. However, other extant bacteria such as filamentous representatives of the family Beggiatoaceae can also interact with sediments to produce sedimentary features that morphologically resemble many of those associated with cyanobacteria-dominated mats. While Beggiatoa spp. and cyanobacteria are metabolically and phylogenetically distant, genomic analyses show that the two groups share hundreds of homologous genes, likely as the result of horizontal gene transfer. The comparative genomics results described here suggest that some horizontally transferred genes may code for phenotypic traits such as filament formation, chemotaxis, and the production of extracellular polymeric substances that potentially underlie the similar biostabilizing influences of these organisms on sediments. We suggest that the ecological utility of certain basic life modes such as the construction of mats and biofilms, coupled with the lateral mobility of genes in the microbial world, introduces an element of uncertainty into the inference of specific phylogenetic origins from gross morphological features preserved in the ancient rock record.
