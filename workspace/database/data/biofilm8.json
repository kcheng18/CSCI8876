A significant perturbation of the lipid thickness and order parameter of the lipid membrane was observed upon treatment with this class of compounds. Encouraged by these results, the ability of the most active compound (NCK-10) to interact with aggregates of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) was studied. In vitro experiments showed that NCK-10 was able to prevent the LPS-induced stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. The compound could also disrupt the biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro and bring down the bacterial burden by more than 99% in a mice model of burn infections caused by the biofilms of P. aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Chandradhish Ghosh"},{"name":"Nicole Harmouche"},{"name":"Burkhard Bechinger"},{"name":"Jayanta Haldar"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"31459007","title":"Ink-Jet Printing-Assisted Modification on Polyethersulfone Membranes Using a UV-Reactive Antimicrobial Peptide for Fouling-Resistant Surfaces.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising candidates for surface coatings to control biofilm growth on water treatment membranes because of their broad activity and the low tendency of bacteria to develop resistance to AMPs.

Here, we show a method for covalently attaching AMPs on porous ultrafiltration membranes using ink-jet printing and provide insight into the mode of action for the covalently tethered peptide RWRWRWA-(Bpa) (Bpa, 4-benzophenylalanine) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AMP-coated ultrafiltration membranes showed surface antibacterial activity and reduced biofilm growth. Fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that the modified surfaces could cause cell membrane disruption, which was seen by live uptake of propidium iodide stain, and scanning electron microscopy images showed compromised cell membranes of attached bacteria. This study indicated that the mode of action of covalently tethered AMPs was similar to that of freely soluble AMPs. The deeper understanding of the mode of action of AMPs covalently attached to surfaces could lead to a more rational approach for designing surfaces with antibacterial activity.","authors":[{"name":"Gunasekaran Mohanraj"},{"name":"Canwei Mao"},{"name":"Asatryan Armine"},{"name":"Roni Kasher"},{"name":"Christopher J Arnusch"}],"keywords":[]},"article2":{"pmid":"31458325","title":"Hydroxylamine Derivatives as a New Paradigm in the Search of Antibacterial Agents.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Serious infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics have become a major global healthcare problem in the 21st century. Multidrug-resistant bacteria causing severe infections mainly grow in complex bacterial communities known as biofilms, in which bacterial resistance to antibacterial agents and to the host immune system is strengthened. As drug resistance is becoming a threatening problem, it is necessary to develop new antimicrobial agents with novel mechanisms of action. Here, we designed and synthesized a small library of N-substituted hydroxylamine (N-HA) compounds with antibacterial activity. These compounds, acting as radical scavengers, inhibit the bacterial ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme. RNR enzyme is essential for bacterial proliferation during infection, as it provides the building blocks for DNA synthesis and repair. We demonstrate the broad antimicrobial effect of several drug candidates against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, together with low toxicity toward eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, the most promising compounds can reduce the biomass of an established biofilm on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. This study settles the starting point to develop new N-hydroxylamine compounds as potential effective antibacterial agents to fight against drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Laia Miret-Casals"},{"name":"Aida Baelo"},{"name":"Esther Julián"},{"name":"Josep Astola"},{"name":"Ariadna Lobo-Ruiz"},{"name":"Fernando Albericio"},{"name":"Eduard Torrents"}],"keywords":[]},"article3":{"pmid":"31457975","title":"Eliminating the Need for Biocidal Agents in Anti-Biofouling Polymers by Applying Grafted Nanosilica Instead.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"A nondestructive one-step approach was applied for grafting biocide-free monodispersed silica nanoparticles (SNPs) with a diameter of 30 ± 10 nm on polystyrene, polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride surfaces.

The modified polymers were found to maintain their original mechanical and physical properties, while their nanoroughness on the other hand had risen by 1.6-2.7 times because of SNP grafting. The SNP-grafted surfaces displayed anti-biofouling properties, resulting in a significant reduction in the attached Gram-positive Bacillus licheniformis or Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria compared to their nongrafted counterparts. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies have confirmed that bacterial cells could not successfully adhere onto the SNP-grafted polymer films regardless of the polymer type, and their biofilm formation was therefore damaged. The presented facile and straightforward protocol allows eliminating the need for biocidal agents and resorts to grafted nanosilica instead.

Several studies have shown that C. jejuni can form sanitizer tolerant biofilm leading to product contamination, however, limited research has been conducted to develop effective control strategies against C. jejuni biofilms. This study investigated the efficacy of three generally recognized as safe status phytochemicals namely, trans-cinnamaldehyde (TC), eugenol (EG), or carvacrol (CR) in inhibiting C. jejuni biofilm formation and inactivating mature biofilm on common food contact surfaces at 20 and 37°C. In addition, the effect of phytochemicals on biofilm architecture and expression of genes and proteins essential for biofilm formation was evaluated. For the inhibition study, C. jejuni was allowed to form biofilms either in the presence or absence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of TC (0.75 mM), EG (0.61 mM), or CR (0.13 mM) for 48 h and the biofilm formation was quantified at 24-h interval. For the inactivation study, C. jejuni biofilms developed at 20 or 37°C for 48 h were exposed to the phytochemicals for 1, 5, or 10 min and surviving C. jejuni in the biofilm were enumerated. All phytochemicals reduced C. jejuni biofilm formation as well as inactivated mature biofilm on polystyrene and steel surface at both temperatures (P < 0.05). The highest dose of TC (75.64 mM), EG (60.9 mM) and CR (66.56 mM) inactivated (>7 log reduction) biofilm developed on steel (20°C) within 5 min. The genes encoding for motility systems (flaA, flaB, and flgA) were downregulated by all phytochemicals (P < 0.05). The expression of stress response (cosR, ahpC) and cell surface modifying genes (waaF) was reduced by EG. LC-MS/MS based proteomic analysis revealed that TC, EG, and CR significantly downregulated the expression of NapA protein required for oxidative stress response. The expression of chaperone protein DnaK and bacterioferritin required for biofilm formation was reduced by TC and CR. Scanning electron microscopy revealed disruption of biofilm architecture and loss of extracellular polymeric substances after treatment. Results suggest that TC, EG, and CR could be used as a natural disinfectant for controlling C. jejuni biofilms in processing areas.","authors":[{"name":"Basanta R Wagle"},{"name":"Abhinav Upadhyay"},{"name":"Indu Upadhyaya"},{"name":"Sandip Shrestha"},{"name":"Komala Arsi"},{"name":"Rohana Liyanage"},{"name":"Kumar Venkitanarayanan"},{"name":"Dan J Donoghue"},{"name":"Annie M Donoghue"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. jejuni"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gene/protein expression"},{"word":"inactivation"},{"word":"inhibition"},{"word":"phytochemicals"}]},"article9":{"pmid":"31456768","title":"The Tol-Pal System of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli Is Responsible for Optimal Internalization Into and Aggregation Within Bladder Epithelial Cells, Colonization of the Urinary Tract of Mice, and Bacterial Motility.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Urinary tracts infection (UTI) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is a common infectious disease. With the shortage of new antimicrobial agents, the increase in UPEC resistance to commonly used drugs, such as fluoroquinolones and β-lactams including carbapenems is a critical issue. UPEC invades urinary tract cells, where it aggregates, and subsequently, forms biofilm-like multicellular colonies termed intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). This process allows the bacteria to establish infections and so may be a good potential target for new drugs to treat infections. Here, we show that deletion of the tolB gene, encoding a protein of the Tol-Pal system that was originally characterized as a protein complex for colicin uptake and maintenance of the outer membrane, decreases the level of bacterial internalization into and aggregation within cultured bladder epithelial cells and also inhibits the colonization of mice urinary tracts. The tolB mutant also exhibited defective motility because of impaired flagellum syntheses. The fliC and motA mutants, which are non-motile strains, also exhibited lower levels of bacterial internalization and aggregation than their wild-type parent. Additional deletion of tolB in the fliC mutant did not further decrease these, suggesting that the attenuated virulence of the tolB mutant is a result of defective motility. The tolA, tolQ, tolR, and pal mutants that lack other members of the Tol-Pal system also exhibited lower levels of motility and aggregation within bladder epithelial cells compared to their wild-type parent. These combined results suggest another role of the Tol-Pal system, i.e., that it is responsible for optimal internalization, aggregation followed by IBC formation within urinary tract cells, and bacterial motility.","authors":[{"name":"Hidetada Hirakawa"},{"name":"Kazutomo Suzue"},{"name":"Kumiko Kurabayashi"},{"name":"Haruyoshi Tomita"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"invasion"},{"word":"pyelonephritis"},{"word":"urinary tract infection (UTI)"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article10":{"pmid":"31456762","title":"Typical and Atypical Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli Are Both Virulent in the Galleria mellonella Model.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an emerging pathotype responsible for acute and persistent diarrhea.

In this study the following effects of Chenopodium ambrosioides extract (CAE) were investigated: action against biofilms of Candida albicans, its cytotoxic potential, and changes caused in acrylic resin. The CAE was characterized by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The susceptibility of C. albicans to CAE was investigated by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MIC and MFC) tests. Acrylic resin disks were fabricated, and C. albicans biofilms were developed on these for 48 h. Afterward the disks were immersed for 10 min in: PBS (Negative Control); 1% Sodium Hypochlorite (1% SH, Positive Control) or CAE at MIC or 5xMIC. The biofilms were investigated relative to counts and metabolic activity. The cytotoxic potential in keratinocytes and fibroblasts was verified by MTT test. Change in color and roughness of the acrylic resin was analyzed after 28 days of immersion in CAE. The data were analyzed by the ANOVA considering a 5% level of significance. The main compounds detected by HPLC were kaempferol and quercetin. Both MIC and MFC obtained the value of 0.25 mg/mL. The MIC was sufficient to significantly reduce the counts and activity of the biofilm cells (p < 0.0001), while 5xMIC resulted in almost complete eradication, similar to 1% SH. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts exposed to the MIC and 5xMIC presented cell viability similar to that of the Control Group (p > 0.05). No important changes in acrylic resin color and roughness were detected, even after 28 days.

In this context, intrinsic properties emerging from microbial interactions, such as efficient organization optimizing growth and activities in multispecies biofilms, may become the object of fitness selection. However, little is known on the nature of underlying interspecies interactions during establishment of a predictable spatial organization within multispecies biofilms. We present a comparative metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial strains residing in triple-species and four-species biofilms, aiming at deciphering molecular mechanisms underpinning bacterial interactions responsible of the remarkably enhanced biomass production and associated typical spatial organization they display. Metatranscriptomic profiles concurred with changes in micro-site occupation in response to the addition/removal of a single species, being driven by both cooperation, competition, and facilitation processes. We conclude that the enhanced biomass production of the four-species biofilm is an intrinsic community property emerging from finely tuned space optimization achieved through concerted antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, where each species occupies a defined micro-site favoring its own growth. Our results further illustrate how molecular mechanisms can be better interpreted when supported by visual imaging of actual microscopic spatial organization, and we propose phenotypic adaptation selected by social interactions as molecular mechanisms stabilizing microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Wenzheng Liu"},{"name":"Samuel Jacquiod"},{"name":"Asker Brejnrod"},{"name":"Jakob Russel"},{"name":"Mette Burmølle"},{"name":"Søren J Sørensen"}],"keywords":[]},"article14":{"pmid":"31455648","title":"Evolutionary Perspectives on the Moonlighting Functions of Bacterial Factors That Support Actin-Based Motility.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Various bacterial pathogens display an intracellular lifestyle and spread from cell to cell through actin-based motility (ABM).

The objective of this study was to investigate the metabolic profile of site-specific supragingival plaque in response to the use of arginine (Arg: 1.5% arginine, fluoride-free) or fluoride (F: 1,100 ppm F/NaF) toothpastes. Eighty-three adults of different caries status were recruited and assigned to treatment with Arg or F for 12 wk. Caries lesions were diagnosed using International Caries Detection and Assessment System II, and plaque samples were collected from caries-free and carious tooth surfaces. Taxonomic profiles were obtained by HOMINGS (Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing), and plaque metabolism was assessed by the levels of arginine catabolism via the arginine deiminase pathway (ADS), acidogenicity, and global metabolomics. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis, analysis of variance, and random forest tests were used to distinguish metabolic profiles. Of the 509 active lesions diagnosed at baseline, 70 (14%) were inactive after 12 wk. Generalized linear model showed that enamel lesions were significantly more likely to become inactive compared to dentin lesions (P < 0.0001), but no difference was found when treatment with Arg was compared to F (P = 0.46). Arg significantly increased plaque ADS activity (P = 0.031) and plaque pH values after incubation with glucose (P = 0.001). F reduced plaque lactate production from endogenous sources (P = 0.02). PCA revealed differences between the metabolic profiles of plaque treated with Arg or F. Arg significantly affected the concentrations of 16 metabolites, including phenethylamine, agmatine, and glucosamine-6-phosphate (P < 0.05), while F affected the concentrations of 9 metabolites, including phenethylamine, N-methyl-glutamate, and agmatine (P < 0.05). The anticaries mechanisms of action of arginine and fluoride are distinct. Arginine metabolism promotes biofilm pH homeostasis, whereas fluoride is thought to enhance resistance of tooth minerals to low pH and reduce acid production by supragingival oral biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"M M Nascimento"},{"name":"A J Alvarez"},{"name":"X Huang"},{"name":"C Browngardt"},{"name":"R Jenkins"},{"name":"M C Sinhoreti"},{"name":"A P D Ribeiro"},{"name":"D A Dilbone"},{"name":"V P Richards"},{"name":"T J Garrett"},{"name":"R A Burne"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"metabolite"},{"word":"metabolomics"},{"word":"microbiome"}]},"article25":{"pmid":"31454230","title":"Reactivity and Synthetic Applications of Multicomponent Petasis Reactions.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"The Petasis boron-Mannich reaction, simply referred to as the Petasis reaction, is a powerful multicomponent coupling reaction of a boronic acid, an amine, and a carbonyl derivative.

Although many fungal adhesion proteins have been identified, less is known about the temporal development of cell adhesion and biofilm growth in a flow environment. In this study, we use a flow system with real-time imaging of C. albicans cells as they adhere and grow. Rates of cell attachment and dispersion of C. albicans knockout strains of putative adhesins, transcription factors, and deletions with a hyperfilamentous phenotype were quantified during 18 h of biofilm development. Cell adhesion under flow is a multi-phase process initiated with cell rolling, then an initial firm attachment to the substrate occurs. After attachment, cells enter a growth phase where cells either commit to adherence or disperse. C. albicans Δeap1, Δhwp2, Δhyr1, and Δihd1 cells had significantly reduced initial attachment and subsequent adhesion, while Δals1/Δals3 had no change in initial attachment but reduced adhesion maintenance. WT cells had increased adhesion during the late growth phase when hyphae were more highly expressed. Hyperfilamentous strains had 10-fold higher total biofilm growth, a result of significantly reduced detachment rates, showing that hyphal morphogenesis is important for adhesion maintenance in the developing biofilm. The rate of C. albicans biomass dispersion was most important for determining the density of the mature biomass. Adhesion maintenance was mediated in part by Ywp1, a protein previously thought to regulate dispersion, thus it functions as an adhesion maintenance protein in C. albicans.","authors":[{"name":"Andrew D McCall"},{"name":"Ruvini U Pathirana"},{"name":"Aditi Prabhakar"},{"name":"Paul J Cullen"},{"name":"Mira Edgerton"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Pathogens"}]},"article31":{"pmid":"31452043","title":"Transcriptome analysis to understand the effects of the toxoflavin and tropolone produced by phytopathogenic Burkholderia on Escherichia coli.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The phytopathogenic Burkholderia species B. glumae and B. plantarii are the causal agents of bacterial wilt, grain rot, and seedling blight, which threaten the rice industry globally.

Chemical cues could improve the finding of suitable habitats for settlement. Thus, the effects of leaves of P. oceanica and biofilms of the diatom Cocconeis scutellum parva, seasonally abundant in the leaf epiphytic stratum, were investigated along with the effect of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) extracted from the epiphytic diatom. The physical induction with P. oceanica accelerated larval settlement, stimulating an earlier and faster metamorphosis of larvae. C. scutellum parva produced a weaker effect on settlement; however, diatom's VOCs had evident influence and accelerated metamorphosis and settlement.

The resistance of E. faecalis to several classes of antibiotics and its capacity to form biofilms cause serious therapeutic problems. Here, we report the isolation of several bacteriophages that target E. faecalis strains isolated from the oral cavity of patients suffering root canal infections. All phages isolated were Siphoviridae with similar tail lengths (200 to 250 nm) and icosahedral heads. The genome sequences of three isolated phages were highly conserved with the exception of predicted tail protein genes that diverge in sequence, potentially reflecting the host range. The properties of the phage with the broadest host range (SHEF2) were further characterized. We show that this phage requires interaction with components of the major and variant region enterococcal polysaccharide antigen to engage in lytic infection. Finally, we explored the therapeutic potential of this phage and show that it can eradicate E. faecalis biofilms formed in vitro on a standard polystyrene surface but also on a cross-sectional tooth slice model of endodontic infection.

To test this hypothesis, we designed an iron-chelating glycocluster incorporating a tetrahydroxamic acid and α-l-fucose bearing linker to interfere with both iron uptake and the glycan recognition process involving the LecB lectin. Iron depletion led to increased production of the siderophore pyoverdine by P. aeruginosa to counteract the loss of iron uptake, and strong biofilm inhibition was observed not only with the α-l-fucocluster (72%), but also with its α-d-manno (84%), and α-d-gluco (92%) counterparts used as negative controls.

Twenty-four GAgP patients were selected, and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and subgingival biofilm were collected. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia levels were evaluated by qPCR, and IL-1β and IL-10 concentration by ELISA.

However, naturally occurring AMPs are generally not sufficiently active for use as antibiotics. Optimized synthetic versions incorporating additional design principles are needed. Here, we engineered amino-terminal Cu(II) and Ni(II) (ATCUN) binding motifs, which can enhance biological function, into the native sequence of two AMPs, CM15 and citropin1.1. The incorporation of metal-binding motifs modulated the antimicrobial activity of synthetic peptides against a panel of carbapenem-resistant enterococci (CRE) bacteria, including carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpC+) and Escherichia coli (KpC+). Activity modulation depended on the type of ATCUN variant utilized. Membrane permeability assays revealed that the in silico selected lead template, CM15, and its ATCUN analogs increased bacterial cell death. Mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that coordinating ATCUN derivatives with Cu(II) ions did not increase the helical tendencies of the AMPs. CM15 ATCUN variants, when combined with Meropenem, streptomycin, or chloramphenicol, showed synergistic effects against E. coli (KpC+ 1812446) biofilms. Motif addition also reduced the hemolytic activity of the wild-type AMP and improved the survival rate of mice in a systemic infection model. The dependence of these bioactivities on the particular amino acids of the ATCUN motif highlights the possible use of size, charge, and hydrophobicity to fine-tune AMP biological function. Our data indicate that incorporating metal-binding motifs into peptide sequences leads to synthetic variants with modified biological properties. These principles may be applied to augment the activities of other peptide sequences.","authors":[{"name":"Caleb M Agbale"},{"name":"Justice K Sarfo"},{"name":"Isaac K Galyuon"},{"name":"Samuel A Juliano"},{"name":"Gislaine G O Silva"},{"name":"Danieli F Buccini"},{"name":"Marlon H Cardoso"},{"name":"Marcelo D T Torres"},{"name":"Alfredo M Angeles-Boza"},{"name":"Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez"},{"name":"Octavio L Franco"}],"keywords":[]},"article55":{"pmid":"31448524","title":"Efficacy of oregano and rosemary essential oils to affect morphology and membrane functions of noncultivable sessile cells of Salmonella Enteritidis 86 in biofilms formed on stainless steel.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"This study evaluated the efficacy of essential oil from Origanum vulgare L.

These evidences suggested that improved microbiological surveillance and endoscope design optimization could represent valid tools to improve infection control. At this aim, in this study an example of duodenoscope microbiological surveillance and reprocessing improvement analyzing strains component of bacterial biofilm by phylogenetic analysis has been proposed. From September 2016 to December 2017, duodenoscope instruments were subjected to microbial surveillance by post-reprocessing cultures of liquid collected by internal channels of instruments after injection and aspiration cycles and membrane filtration. During surveillance seventeen Klebsiella pneumoniae, of which 10/17 (58.8%) MDR and KPC strains were collected from duodenoscope instruments plus one MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae strain from the rectal swab performed before ERCP procedure in an inpatient. The surveillance allowed evidencing potential failure of reprocessing procedure and performing consequent reprocessing improvements including the contaminated instruments quarantine until their negativity. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequence of duodenoscope strains plus inpatients MDR strains, showed intermixing between duodenoscopes and inpatients, as evidenced by minimum spanning tree and time-scale Maximum Clade Credibility tree. In minimum spanning tree, three groups have been evidenced. Group I including Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated from inpatients before microbiological surveillance adoption; group II including intermixed Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from inpatients and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from duedonoscopes and group III including Klebsiella pneumoniae strains exclusively from duedonoscope instruments. In the Maximum Credibility Tree, a statistically supported cluster including two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from duedonoscope instruments and one strains isolated from an inpatient was showed. From the first microbiologic surveillance performed on September 2016 and after the reprocessing improvement adoption, none MDR or susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae strain was isolated in the following surveillance periods. In conclusion, these results should encourage hospital board to perform microbiological surveillance of duodenoscopes as well as of patients, by rectal swabs culture, and rapid molecular testing for antimicrobial resistance before any endoscopic invasive procedure.","authors":[{"name":"Massimo Ciccozzi"},{"name":"Eleonora Cella"},{"name":"Alessia Lai"},{"name":"Lucia De Florio"},{"name":"Francesca Antonelli"},{"name":"Marta Fogolari"},{"name":"Francesco Maria Di Matteo"},{"name":"Margherita Pizzicannella"},{"name":"Benedetta Colombo"},{"name":"Giordano Dicuonzo"},{"name":"Silvia Angeletti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"endoscope"},{"word":"infection control"},{"word":"microbiological surveillance"},{"word":"phylogeny"}]},"article59":{"pmid":"31448244","title":"Commensal and Pathogenic Biofilms Alter Toll-Like Receptor Signaling in Reconstructed Human Gingiva.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The balance between the host and microbe is pivotal for oral health. A dysbiotic oral microbiome and the subsequent host inflammatory response are causes for the most common dental problems, such as periodontitis and caries. Classically, toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known to play important roles in host-microbe interactions by recognizing pathogens and activating innate immunity. However, emerging evidence suggests that commensals may also exploit TLRs to induce tolerance to the benefit of the host, especially in oral mucosa which is heavily colonized by abundant microbes. How TLRs and downstream signaling events are affected by different oral microbial communities to regulate host responses is still unknown. To compare such human host-microbe interactions in vitro, we exposed a reconstructed human gingiva (RHG) to commensal or pathogenic (gingivitis, cariogenic) multi-species oral biofilms cultured from human saliva. These biofilms contain in vivo like phylogenic numbers and typical bacterial genera. After 24 h biofilm exposure, TLR protein and gene expression of 84 TLR pathway related genes were investigated. Commensal and pathogenic biofilms differentially regulated TLR protein expression. Commensal biofilm up-regulated the transcription of a large group of key genes, which are involved in TLR signaling, including TLR7, the MyD88-dependent pathway (CD14, MyD88, TIRAP, TRAF6, IRAKs), MyD88-independent pathway (TAB1, TBK1, IRF3), and their downstream signaling pathways (NF-κB and MAPK pathways). In comparison, gingivitis biofilm activated fewer genes (e.g., TLR4) and cariogenic biofilm suppressed CD14, IRAK4, and IRF3 transcription. Fluorescence in situ hybridization staining showed the rRNA of the topically applied and invaded bacteria, and histology showed that the biofilms had no obvious detrimental effect on RHG morphology. These results show an important role of TLR signaling pathways in regulating host-microbe interactions: when a sterile gingival tissue is exposed to commensals, a strong immune activation occurs which may prime the host against potential challenges in order to maintain oral host-microbe homeostasis. In contrast, pathogenic biofilms stimulate a weaker immune response which might facilitate immune evasion thus enabling pathogens to penetrate undetected into the tissues.","authors":[{"name":"Lin Shang"},{"name":"Dongmei Deng"},{"name":"Jeroen Kees Buskermolen"},{"name":"Sanne Roffel"},{"name":"Marleen Marga Janus"},{"name":"Bastiaan Philip Krom"},{"name":"Wim Crielaard"},{"name":"Susan Gibbs"}],"keywords":[{"word":"TLR"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gingiva"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"organotypic 3D culture"}]},"article60":{"pmid":"31448149","title":"Resistance mechanism and proteins in Aspergillus species against antifungal agents.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Aspergillus species contain pathogenic and opportunistic fungal pathogens which have the potential to cause mycosis (invasive aspergillosis) in humans.

To address these issues, a dual biofilm model system with this fungus was prepared by using Pseudomonas alcaliphila 34 as the bacterial partner due to its very fast biofilm-forming ability. The application of the bacterial inoculum to already settled fungal biofilm on a polystyrene surface coated with hydroxyapatite was the most efficient approach to the production of the mixed system the ultrastructure of which was investigated by a multi-microscopy approach. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the adhesion of bacterial cells onto the mycelial cell wall appeared to be mediated by the presence of an abundant layer of extracellular matrix (ECM). Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that ECM filaments of bacterial origin formed initially a reticular structure that assumed a tabular semblance after 72 h, thus overshadowing the underlying mycelial network. Across the thickness of the mixed biofilms, the presence of an extensive network of channels with large aggregates of viable bacteria located on the edges of their lumina was found by confocal laser scanning microscopy; on the outermost biofilm layer, a significant fraction of dead bacterial cells was evident.

C. jejuni is a leading cause of foodborne gastroenteritis, and these infections are sometimes associated with the development of post-infection sequelae such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Flagella are considered a primary virulence factor in C. jejuni, as these organelles are required for pathogenicity-related phenotypes including motility, biofilm formation, host cell interactions, and host colonization. The post-transcriptional regulator CsrA regulates the expression of the major flagellin FlaA by binding to flaA mRNA and repressing its translation. Additionally, CsrA has previously been shown to regulate 120-150 proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. The amino acid sequence of C. jejuni CsrA is significantly different from that of Escherichia coli CsrA, and no previous research has defined the amino acids of C. jejuni CsrA that are critical for RNA binding. In this study, we used in vitro SELEX to identify the consensus RNA sequence mAwGGAs to which C. jejuni CsrA binds with high affinity. We performed saturating site-directed mutagenesis on C. jejuni CsrA and assessed the regulatory activity of these mutant proteins, using a reporter system encoding the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) upstream of flaA linked translationally to the C. jejuni astA gene. These assays allowed us to identify 19 amino acids that were involved in RNA binding by CsrA, with many but not all of these amino acids clustered in predicted beta strands that are involved in RNA binding by E. coli CsrA. Decreased flaA mRNA binding by mutant CsrA proteins L2A and A36V was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The majority of the amino acids implicated in RNA binding were conserved among diverse Campylobacter species.","authors":[{"name":"Faiha M El Abbar"},{"name":"Jiaqi Li"},{"name":"Harry C Owen"},{"name":"C Luke Daugherty"},{"name":"Claudia A Fulmer"},{"name":"Marek Bogacz"},{"name":"Stuart A Thompson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"flagella"},{"word":"flagellin"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"regulation"}]},"article66":{"pmid":"31447791","title":"Spatial Environmental Heterogeneity Determines Young Biofilm Assemblages on Microplastics in Baltic Sea Mesocosms.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Microplastics in aquatic environments provide novel habitats for surface-colonizing microorganisms. Given the continuing debate on whether substrate-specific properties or environmental factors prevail in shaping biofilm assemblages on microplastics, we examined the influence of substrate vs. spatial factors in the development of bacterial assemblages on polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), wood, and seston and in the free-living fraction. Further, the selective colonization of microplastics by potential pathogens was investigated because among the bacterial species found in microplastic-associated biofilms are potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. Due to their persistence and great dispersal potential, microplastics could act as vectors for these potential pathogens and for biofilm assemblages in general. Incubation experiments with these substrates were conducted for 7 days during a summer cruise along the eastern Baltic Sea coastline in waters covering a salinity gradient of 4.5-9 PSU. Bacterial assemblages were analyzed using 16S rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing, distance-based redundancy analyses, and the linear discriminant analysis effect size method to identify taxa that were significantly more abundant on the plastics. The results showed that the sample type was the most important factor structuring bacterial assemblages overall. Surface properties were less significant in differentiating attached biofilms on PE, PS, and wood; instead, environmental factors, mainly salinity, prevailed. A potential role for inorganic-nutrient limitations in surface-specific attachment was identified as well. Alphaproteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae, Devosiaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae) and Gammaproteobacteria (Alteromonadaceae and Pseudomonas) were distinctive for the PE- and PS-associated biofilms. Vibrio was more abundant on the PE and PS biofilms than on seston, but its abundances were highest on wood and positively correlated with salinity. These results corroborate earlier findings that microplastics constitute a habitat for biofilm-forming microorganisms distinct from seston, but less from wood. In contrast to earlier reports of low Vibrio numbers on microplastics, these results also suggest that vibrios are early colonizers of surfaces in general. Spatial as well as temporal dynamics should therefore be considered when assessing the potential of microplastics to serve as vectors for bacterial assemblages and putative pathogens, as these parameters are major drivers of biofilm diversity.","authors":[{"name":"Katharina Kesy"},{"name":"Sonja Oberbeckmann"},{"name":"Bernd Kreikemeyer"},{"name":"Matthias Labrenz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Baltic Sea"},{"word":"Sphingomonadaceae"},{"word":"Vibrio"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"microplastics"},{"word":"salinity gradient"}]},"article67":{"pmid":"31447567","title":"A case of persistent bacteraemia by Ralstonia mannitolilytica and Ralstonia pickettii in an intensive care unit.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The Ralstonia spp. genus is a group of non-fermentative, Gram-negative bacteria often resistant to many antibiotics, which are emerging as opportunistic pathogens frequently associated with infections in hospital settings.

Lack of Legionella risk management plans and control procedures may promote further spread of Legionella in water supply systems. In addition, the high incidence of Legionella-related FLA suggests that traditional monitoring methods may not be sufficient for Legionella control.","authors":[{"name":"Olga Valciņa"},{"name":"Daina Pūle"},{"name":"Artjoms Mališevs"},{"name":"Jūlija Trofimova"},{"name":"Svetlana Makarova"},{"name":"Genadijs Konvisers"},{"name":"Aivars Bērziņš"},{"name":"Angelika Krūmiņa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Legionella"},{"word":"amoeba"},{"word":"co-occurrence"},{"word":"protozoa"},{"word":"water"}]},"article83":{"pmid":"31443115","title":"Bacteriophage delivering hydrogels reduce biofilm formation in vitro and infection in vivo.","date":"2019-11-28","abs":"Implanted orthopedic devices become infected more frequently than any other implanted surgical device.

Bacteriophage retain their bacteriolytic activity after encapsulation and release from the hydrogel, and their rate of release from the hydrogel can be controlled by gel formulation. Bacteriophage-encapsulating hydrogels effectively kill their host bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes in vitro without influencing the metabolic activity of human mesenchymal stromal cells. Bacteriophage-encapsulating hydrogels were used to treat murine radial segmental defects infected with P. aeruginosa. The hydrogels achieved a 4.7-fold reduction in live P. aeruginosa counts at the infection site compared to bacteriophage-free hydrogels at 7 days postimplantation.

To investigate the toxicity of CBZ to aquatic key organisms in a more complex and environmentally relevant scenario, we conducted a 32-day multiple-stress experiment in artificial indoor streams. We exposed the non-biting midge Chironomus riparius, the blackworm Lumbriculus variegatus, and the New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum to 80 and 400 μg CBZ/L in six artificial indoor streams. In addition to hydraulic stress, species' interaction, and low organic content in the sediment, organisms were co-exposed to the herbicide terbutryn (TBY) as a second chemical stressor at a concentration of 6 μg/L. The exposure to CBZ under multiple stress conditions resulted in a 10- to more than 25-fold higher toxicity in C. riparius and P. antipodarum when compared to a previous, standardized laboratory experiment. The co-exposure to TBY enhanced the adverse effects of CBZ on snails (reduced production of embryos). This effect was additive as the single exposure to TBY also reduced the reproduction of snails, most likely through the reduction of biofilm biomass. The emergence of C. riparius declined at a CBZ concentration of 400 μg/L (without the co-exposure to TBY) and at 80 μg/L in combination with TBY. The difference in sensitivity between laboratory and indoor stream experiments is indicative of a potential underestimation of risk when toxicity data are extrapolated to field conditions.

Bacterial aggregation has many biological implications; it can promote biofilm formation, upregulate virulence factors, and lead to quorum sensing. The steady state aggregation behavior of motile bacteria in polymer solutions has been well studied and shows that stronger depletion forces are required to aggregate motile bacteria as compared with their nonmotile analogs. However, no one has studied whether these same trends hold at the initial stages of aggregation. We use experiments and numerical calculations to investigate the polymer-induced depletion aggregation of motile Escherichia coli in polyethylene glycol solutions on short experimental timescales (∼10 min). Our work reveals that in the semi-dilute polymer concentration regime and at short timescales, in contrast to what is found at steady state, bacterial motility actually enhances aggregate formation by increasing the collision rate in viscous environments. These unexpected findings have implications for developing models of active matter, and for understanding bacterial aggregation in dynamic, biological environments, where the system may never reach steady state.","authors":[{"name":"Michael K Porter"},{"name":"Asher Preska Steinberg"},{"name":"Rustem F Ismagilov"}],"keywords":[]},"article92":{"pmid":"31441101","title":"Discovery of a new family of heterocyclic amine linked plastoquinone analogs for antimicrobial evaluation.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"A series of aminobenzoquinones, denoted as PQ analogs (PQ1-13), were synthesized by employing a green methodology approach using water as solvent developed by Tandon et al.

These postulates have been shown not to be correct in some cases including the inability of some microbes to grow in the culture medium, viruses, or anaerobic bacteria. Today, due to some new scientific facts like the social behaviors of bacteria, such as quorum sensing, there are serious problems regarding the definition of whole microbial effects; these include microbiomes and viromes, as well as their interaction with the existing eukaryotics, the complicated relations between bacteria, L-forms, and cell wall-deficient bacteria, and the important role of microbes in the development of non-infectious diseases. So, the application of Koch's postulates to explain the causal relationships between host-microbes could be difficult. Therefore, nowadays, even the molecular Koch's postulates are not accountable. Also, according to the new scientific discoveries, various criteria such as changes in the immune system, pathology, and clinical findings, along with the results of daily laboratory tests, should be used to apply Koch's postulates in the etiologic studies. Otherwise, the possible etiologic relationships between the host-microbes cannot be verified due to numerous complications; certainly, the relationship between the doctor and the lab is ultimately weakened.

What are the implications of such spatial organization for biodiversity? To address this question, we developed and analyzed a model of territorial resource competition. In the model, all species obey trade-offs inspired by biophysical constraints on metabolism; the species occupy nonoverlapping territories, while nutrients diffuse in space. We find that the nutrient diffusion time is an important control parameter for both biodiversity and the timescale of population dynamics. Interestingly, fast nutrient diffusion allows the populations of some species to fluctuate to zero, leading to extinctions. Moreover, territorial competition spontaneously gives rise to both multistability and the Allee effect (in which a minimum population is required for survival), so that small perturbations can have major ecological effects. While the assumption of trade-offs allows for the coexistence of more species than the number of nutrients-thus violating the principle of competitive exclusion-overall biodiversity is curbed by the domination of oligotroph species. Importantly, in contrast to well-mixed models, spatial structure renders diversity robust to inequalities in metabolic trade-offs. Our results suggest that territorial ecosystems can display high biodiversity and rich dynamics simply due to competition for resources in a spatial community.","authors":[{"name":"Benjamin G Weiner"},{"name":"Anna Posfai"},{"name":"Ned S Wingreen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biodiversity"},{"word":"microbial ecology"},{"word":"modeling"},{"word":"spatial ecology"},{"word":"trade-offs"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"31434244","title":"Characterization of Non-O157 Escherichia coli from Cattle Faecal Samples in the North-West Province of South Africa.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Escherichia coli are commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals, but some strains have acquired Shiga-toxins and can cause enterohemorrhagic diarrhoea and kidney failure in humans.

This study investigated nutrient imbalance as the cause of biofouling in lab-scale experiments and carried out a year-long field-testing at a seawater desalination pilot plant. Lab experiments showed that growth medium with excess of organic carbon (C) but with low nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accelerated the formation of bacterial biofilm. Balancing C to N and P ratios by adding N and P to growth medium increased the proliferation of free-living cells but reduced attached form of bacteria as biofilm. The cell excretion of excess C in the form of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) was considered as a strategy for nutrient storage for future use. Cell enzyme activity assays indicated some of the bacteria had enhanced enzyme activities to degrade polysaccharides in the absence of organic C in growth medium, possibly using EPS in the biofilm. A year-long field study indicated that accelerated biofouling of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes was associated with the elevated content of total organic carbon (TOC) in the intake seawater. Adding N and P to the intake seawater to balance the increase of TOC resulted in reduction of membrane biofouling. Microbial community analysis of the biofouling layer using 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated biofouling communities varied with seasonal changes. Dosing of N and P did not induce dramatic changes in the fouling microbial community growing on the membrane surface. The outcome of this work implies that membrane biofouling associated with the elevated concentration of TOC in intake seawater is caused by imbalance of C:N:P in the source seawater which occurs often during algal blooms. Addition of N and P to rebalance the nutrients can prevent accelerated SWRO membrane biofouling.","authors":[{"name":"Siqian Huang"},{"name":"Nikolay Voutchkov"},{"name":"Sunny Jiang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Membrane desalination"},{"word":"Nutrient imbalance"},{"word":"Reverse osmosis"}]},"article119":{"pmid":"31433763","title":"Anti-infective potential of hydroalcoholic extract of Phyllanthus emblica seeds against selected human-pathogenic bacteria.","date":"2019-08-21","abs":"In context of the global threat of antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic bacteria against conventional bactericidal antibiotics, investigation on complementary/ alternative approaches to manage bacterial infections is warranted.

Herein, we report the applications of metal-free quaternized carbon dots (CDs) in imaging and eliminating bacterial biofilms. The CDs prepared by the solvothermal treatment of dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride (abbreviated as Si-QAC) and glycerol possess ultrasmall size (ca. 3.3 ± 0.4 nm) and strong positively charged (zeta potential: ca. +33.1 ± 2.5 mV) surfaces with long alkyl chain-linked quaternary ammonium groups. The small size of the CDs endows them with the penetration ability into the interior of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial biofilms, which enables excellent fluorescence imaging of the biofilms. Due to the different surfaces of the two types of bacteria, the positively charged CDs selectively interact with the more negatively charged Gram-positive bacteria via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, which inactivates the Gram-positive bacteria and ultimately eradicates the Gram-positive bacterial biofilms. In addition, we synthesize a new type of quaternized CDs without long alkyl chains (termed TTPAC CDs), and validate that the long alkyl chains potentiate the hydrophobic adhesion between CDs and Gram-positive bacteria. Meanwhile, the crystal violet staining results reveal that the cationic CDs inhibit the formation of Gram-positive bacterial biofilms.

Here, we demonstrated that this stationary-phase-induced filamentation results from downregulation of most critical cell cycle regulators and a consequent block of DNA replication and cell division while cell growth and metabolism continue. Our data indicate that this response is triggered by a combination of three stresses caused by prolonged growth in complex medium, namely, the depletion of phosphate, alkaline pH, and an excess of ammonium. We found that these conditions are experienced in the summer months during algal blooms near the surface in freshwater lakes, a natural habitat of C. crescentus, suggesting that filamentous growth is a common response of C. crescentus to its environment. Finally, we demonstrate that when grown in a biofilm, the filamentous cells can reach beyond the surface of the biofilm and potentially access nutrients or release progeny.

In Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae), a Gram-negative pathogen responsible for the cholera disease, biofilm-like aggregates are important for the pathogenesis and disease transmission. Biofilm formation is initiated by the attachment of the bacteria to a surface, followed by maturation stages involving the formation of a biofilm matrix. In V. cholerae, flagella are essential for the initial step of biofilm formation, allowing the bacteria to swim and to detect a surface. In this study, we explored the effect of polymyxin B (PmB), a cationic bacterial antimicrobial peptide, on biofilm formation in pathogenic V. cholerae strains belonging to the O1 and O139 serotypes. We found that sub-inhibitory concentration of PmB induces a reduction of the biofilm formation by V. cholerae O1 and O139. Experiment on preformed biofilm demonstrated that the biofilm formation inhibition occurs at the initial step of biofilm formation, where the flagella are essential. We further characterize the effect of PmB on V. cholerae flagellation. Our results demonstrate that the flagellin expression is not reduced in presence of sub-inhibitory concentration of PmB. However, a decrease of the abundance of flagellin associated with the bacterial cells together with an increase in the secretome was observed. Electron microscopy observations also suggest that the abundance of aflagellated bacteria increases upon PmB supplementation. Finally, in agreement with the effect on the flagellation, a reduction of the bacterial motility is observed. Altogether, our results suggest that the PmB affect V. cholerae flagella resulting in a decrease of the motility and a compromised ability to form biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Sean Giacomucci"},{"name":"Candice Danabé-Nieto Cros"},{"name":"Xavier Perron"},{"name":"Annabelle Mathieu-Denoncourt"},{"name":"Marylise Duperthuy"}],"keywords":[]},"article136":{"pmid":"31430298","title":"Trans,trans-farnesol, an antimicrobial natural compound, improves glass ionomer cement properties.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"A series of experiments were conducted to characterize a novel restorative material.

The enzymatic degradation of dPNAG by the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans native β-hexosaminidase enzyme DspB plays a role in biofilm dispersal. To test the role of substrate de-N-acetylation on substrate recognition by DspB, we applied an efficient preactivation-based one-pot glycosylation approach to prepare a panel of dPNAG trisaccharide analogs with defined acetylation patterns. These analogs served as effective DspB substrates, and the rate of hydrolysis was dependent on the specific substrate de-N-acetylation pattern, with glucosamine (GlcN) located +2 from the site of cleavage being preferentially hydrolyzed. The product distributions support a primarily exoglycosidic cleavage activity following a substrate assisted cleavage mechanism, with the exception of substrates containing a nonreducing GlcN that were cleaved endo leading to the exclusive formation of a nonreducing disaccharide product.

Evaluations comprised plasma levels of pro-inflammatory, redox balance, and glycation markers. Pro-inflammatory markers such as erythrosedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, soluble FAS, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha were significantly reduced by EGF therapy. Oxidative capacity, nitrite/nitrate ratio, and pentosidine were also reduced, while soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products significantly increased.

Here, we use a combination of physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic approaches to study the influence of naturally co-existing bacteria, Maribacter sp. and Roseovarius sp., on the sexual reproduction of the biofilm inhabiting marine pennate diatom Seminavis robusta. While Maribacter sp. severely reduces the reproductive success of S. robusta cultures, Roseovarius sp. slightly enhances it. Contrary to our expectation, we demonstrate that the effect of the bacterial exudates is not caused by altered cell-cycle regulation prior to the switch to meiosis. Instead, Maribacter sp. exudates cause a reduced production of diproline, the sexual attraction pheromone of S. robusta. Transcriptomic analyses show that this is likely an indirect consequence of altered intracellular metabolic fluxes in the diatom, especially those related to amino acid biosynthesis, oxidative stress response, and biosynthesis of defense molecules.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that CAPs, as potential broad-spectrum antimicrobials, can effectively clear the frequently encountered polymicrobial infections and can be fine-tuned further for future applications.","authors":[{"name":"Siddhi Gupta"},{"name":"Jyoti Thakur"},{"name":"Sanjay Pal"},{"name":"Ragini Gupta"},{"name":"Deepakkumar Mishra"},{"name":"Sandeep Kumar"},{"name":"Kavita Yadav"},{"name":"Amandeep Saini"},{"name":"Prabhu S Yavvari"},{"name":"Madhukar Vedantham"},{"name":"Archana Singh"},{"name":"Aasheesh Srivastava"},{"name":"Rajendra Prasad"},{"name":"Avinash Bajaj"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"antimicrobials"},{"word":"bile acids"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"membrane targeting"}]},"article154":{"pmid":"31427301","title":"Synergistic Meropenem-Tobramycin Combination Dosage Regimens against Clinical Hypermutable Pseudomonas aeruginosa at Simulated Epithelial Lining Fluid Concentrations in a Dynamic Biofilm Model.","date":"2020-02-18","abs":"Exacerbations of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are a major treatment challenge in cystic fibrosis due to biofilm formation and hypermutation.

Since an acidic pH and osmolarity are two of three known stimuli of the OmpR-EnvZ two-component system in bacteria, we investigated the role and function of this Y. pestis system in fleas. By monitoring the in vivo expression pattern of three OmpR-EnvZ-regulated genes, we concluded that the flea gut environment triggers OmpR-EnvZ. This activation was not, however, correlated with changes in pH and osmolarity but matched the pattern of nutrient depletion (the third known stimulus for OmpR-EnvZ). Lastly, we found that the OmpR-EnvZ and the OmpF porin are needed to produce the biofilm that ultimately obstructs the flea's gut and thus hastens the flea-borne transmission of plague. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that the flea gut is a complex, fluctuating environment in which Y. pestis senses nutrient depletion via OmpR-EnvZ.

L. monocytogenes was detected in samples from the reception (lairage floor, 1/10), slaughtering (drains, 2/20) and cutting room stages (conveyor belts in the final packing stage - 11/20, knife - 1/40, and cutting boards - 1/20). Positive results for conveyor belts were recorded in seven consecutive samplings. L. monocytogenes isolates (n = 87) were characterized as belonging to serogroup IVb and presented positive PCR results for inlA, inlB, inlC, inlJ, hlyA, plcA, actA and iap. Isolates were selected according to the original samples (n = 31) and subjected to Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), demonstrating their high clonal identity (98.4-100%). According to PFGE results and their original samples, isolates were selected (n = 16) and subjected to phenotypic assay to assess their adhesion potential and tested for resistance against 15 antibiotics; all tested isolates presented weak adhesion potential and were resistant to ampicillin. The present study demonstrated the persistence of L. monocytogenes in the pork processing facility, indicating the potential risk for cross-contamination with a potential virulent and resistant clone.","authors":[{"name":"Mallu Jagnow Sereno"},{"name":"Cibeli Viana"},{"name":"Kadigia Pegoraro"},{"name":"Danilo Augusto Lopes da Silva"},{"name":"Ricardo Seiti Yamatogi"},{"name":"Luís Augusto Nero"},{"name":"Luciano Dos Santos Bersot"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Conveyor belt"},{"word":"Cutting room"},{"word":"Disk diffusion"},{"word":"Minimum inhibitory concentration"},{"word":"PFGE"}]},"article177":{"pmid":"31421782","title":"Effective removal of staphylococcal biofilms on various food contact surfaces by Staphylococcus aureus phage endolysin LysCSA13.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"Staphylococcal biofilms are recognized as a significant problem in the food industry because of their high resistance to antibiotics, and the use of bacteriophages or endolysins has been regarded as a promising alternative to antibiotics.

This work is aimed at inhibiting the biofilm formation by S. aureus on solid substrates using a simple surface biofunctionalization strategy. We previously found that surface biofunctionalization with structural perturbed albumin inhibited the initial stage of S. aureus adhesion. The current work extends this strategy with other plasma protein, fibrinogen, which in addition can be bond specifically to the cell wall-anchored proteins of S. aureus. The study of fibrinogen adsorption indicates that the fraction of surface-perturbed molecules is enlarged at long adsorption times and low protein concentration. In these conditions, a significant diminution of ca.60% of alive adhered bacteria were observed after 40 min and the biofilm formation was completely prevented. Thus, it seems that the inhibition of bacterial adhesion on substrates with surface-perturbed proteins represents a general trend even when specific interactions are present. On this basis, we developed a simple strategy to inhibit the formation of S. aureus biofilm, using thermally treated albumin or fibrinogen molecules prior to the substrate biofunctionalization. This strategy shows an excellent performance since the alive adhered bacteria diminishes ca. 90% at short incubation time, followed by the fully inhibition of biofilm formation.

P. species also produce the biosurfactant rhamnolipid (Rhl) and its outer membrane contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Given the possible contacts between FapC, Rhl and LPS, we here investigate how Rhl and LPS affect FapC fibrillation compared with SDS, known to promote fibrillation of proteins at sub-micellar concentrations. Micelles of all three surfactants help FapC bypass the nucleation lag phase, leading to rapid fibrillation, which persists even at high concentrations of micelles and incorporates almost all available FapC monomers. Fibrils formed at high micellar concentrations of Rhl and SDS seed fibrillation at low surfactant concentrations while retaining the original fibril structure. FapC interacts strongly with SDS to form a dense network of narrow fibrils. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses reveal that surfactants reduce the population of intermediates in the fibrillation process and detect a fast aggregation step over the first 2-4 h which precedes the main fibrillation monitored by Thioflavin T. An additional SAXS-detected rearrangement of early aggregates occurs after 4-10 h. At high Rhl concentrations, the micelles are decorated with protein fibrils. SDS induces FapC fibrillation so efficiently that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is unable to inhibit this process. However, EGCG stimulates FapC oligomer formation and inhibits fibrillation both on its own and in the presence of Rhl and LPS. This oligomer could be modelled as a compact core with a flexible shell. This suggests that EGCG can override the natural amyloid-stimulatory properties of these biosurfactants and thus target biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Najarzadeh"},{"name":"Jannik Nedergaard Pedersen"},{"name":"Gunna Christiansen"},{"name":"Seyed Abbas Shojaosadati"},{"name":"Jan Skov Pedersen"},{"name":"Daniel E Otzen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FapC protein"},{"word":"Functional amyloid"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Rhamnolipid"},{"word":"Surfactant"}]},"article186":{"pmid":"31421109","title":"Bronchoscope-Related Superbug Infections.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Several recent cases associating cleaned and high-level disinfected duodenoscopes with outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and related multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) may cause bronchoscopists, pulmonologists, and other stakeholders to inquire about the effectiveness of today's practices for reprocessing flexible bronchoscopes. The primary objectives of this study were to address this question and investigate the risk of bronchoscopes transmitting infections of CRE and related MDROs. The published literature and the US Food and Drug Administration's medical device database of adverse events were searched beginning in 2012, when endoscopy first emerged as a recognized risk factor for transmission of CRE. The Internet was also searched during this same time frame to identify other relevant cases. Several cases associating reprocessed bronchoscopes with infections of CRE or a related MDRO were identified. This study's findings suggest that bronchoscopes may pose an underrecognized potential for transmission of CRE and related MDROs, warranting greater public awareness, enhanced preventive measures, and updated reprocessing guidance. This study's data also suggest that the cleaning and high-level disinfection of bronchoscopes performed in accordance with published guidelines and manufacturer instructions may not always be sufficiently effective to eliminate this risk. Several factors were identified that can adversely affect a bronchoscope's reprocessing and pose a risk of transmission of these multidrug-resistant bacteria, including use of a damaged or inadequately serviced bronchoscope, and formation of an inaccessible biofilm.

Approximately 1/3 of Shewanella isolates harbour a prophage at the tmRNA (ssrA) gene. Here, we discovered a P2-family prophage integrated at the 3'-end of ssrA in the deep-sea bacterium S. putrefaciens. We found that ~0.1% of host cells are lysed to release P2 constitutively during host growth. P2 phage production is induced by a prophage-encoded Rep protein and its excision is induced by the Cox protein. We also found that P2 genome excision leads to the disruption of wobble base pairing of SsrA due to site-specific recombination, thus disrupting the trans-translation function of SsrA. We further demonstrated that P2 excision greatly hinders growth in seawater medium and inhibits biofilm formation. Complementation with a functional SsrA in the P2-excised strain completely restores the growth defects in seawater medium and partially restores biofilm formation. Additionally, we found that products of the P2 genes also increase biofilm formation. Taken together, this study illustrates a symbiotic relationship between P2 and its marine host, thus providing multiple benefits for both sides when a phage is integrated but suffers from reduced fitness when the prophage is excised.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxiao Liu"},{"name":"Kaihao Tang"},{"name":"Dali Zhang"},{"name":"Yangmei Li"},{"name":"Zhe Liu"},{"name":"Jianyun Yao"},{"name":"Thomas K Wood"},{"name":"Xiaoxue Wang"}],"keywords":[]},"article199":{"pmid":"31418679","title":"Microbial epidemiology and carriage studies for the evaluation of vaccines.","date":"2019-10-11","abs":"Respiratory tract infections are responsible for over 2.8 million deaths per year worldwide. Colonization is the first step in the process of microbes occupying the respiratory tract, which may lead to subsequent infection.

The duration of carriage may be affected by host immunity, the composition and interactions between members of the microbial community, and the characteristics of colonizing bacteria, including physiology associated with being present in a bacterial biofilm. Numerous vaccines have been implemented to control infections caused by bacteria that can colonize and be subsequently carried. Such vaccines are often species-specific and may target a limited number of strains thereby creating a vacant niche in the upper respiratory tract. Epidemiological changes of bacteria found in both carriage and disease have therefore been widely reported, since the vacant niche is filled by other strains or species. In this review, we discuss the use of carriage-prevalence studies in vaccine evaluation and argue that such studies are essential for (1) examining the epidemiology of carriage before and after the introduction of new vaccines, (2) understanding the dynamics of the respiratory tract flora and (3) identifying the disease potential of emerging strains.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of various Fusobacterium species on in vitro biofilm formation and structure in three different oral biofilm models namely a supragingival, a supragingival feeding, and a subgingival biofilm model. The standard six-species supragingival and feeding biofilm models employed contained Actinomyces oris, Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Veillonella dispar, and Fusobacterium sp. The subgingival biofilm model contained 10 species (A. oris, Campylobacter rectus, F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus anginosus, S. oralis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and V. dispar). Six different Fusobacterium species or subspecies, respectively, were tested namely F. nucleatum ssp. fusiforme, F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, F. naviforme, and F. periodonticum). Biofilms were grown anaerobically on hydroxyapatite disks in 24-well culture dishes. After 64 h, biofilms were either harvested and quantified by culture analysis or proceeded to fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). All Fusobacterium species tested established well in the biofilms, with CFUs ranging from 1.4E+04 (F. nucleatum ssp. fusiforme) to 5.6E+06 (F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum). The presence of specific Fusobacterium sp./ssp. induced a significant decrease in C. albicans levels in the supragingival model and in V. dispar levels in the feeding supragingival model. In the subgingival model, the counts of A. oris, S. oralis, P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, and C. rectus significantly decreased in the presence of specific Fusobacterium sp./ssp.

Many efforts have been made to realize artificial olfaction systems that reflect the capacity of biological systems. A sophisticated example of an artificial olfaction device is the odor compass which uses chemical sensor data to identify odor source direction. Successful odor compass designs often rely on plume-based detection and mobile robots, where active, mechanical motion of the sensor platform is employed. Passive, diffusion-based odor compasses remain elusive as detection of low analyte concentrations and quantification of small concentration gradients from within the sensor platform are necessary. Further, simultaneously identifying multiple odor sources using an odor compass remains an ongoing challenge, especially for similar analytes. Here, we show that surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors overcome these challenges, and we present the first SERS odor compass. Using a grid array of SERS sensors, machine learning analysis enables reliable identification of multiple odor sources arising from diffusion of analytes from one or two localized sources. Specifically, convolutional neural network and support vector machine classifier models achieve over 90% accuracy for a multiple odor source problem. This system is then used to identify the location of an Escherichia coli biofilm via its complex signature of volatile organic compounds. Thus, the fabricated SERS chemical sensors have the needed limit of detection and quantification for diffusion-based odor compasses. Solving the multiple odor source problem with a passive platform opens a path toward an Internet of things approach to monitor toxic gases and indoor pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"William John Thrift"},{"name":"Antony Cabuslay"},{"name":"Andrew Benjamin Laird"},{"name":"Saba Ranjbar"},{"name":"Allon I Hochbaum"},{"name":"Regina Ragan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"chemical sensing"},{"word":"convolutional neural networks"},{"word":"machine learning"},{"word":"odor compass"},{"word":"self-assembly"},{"word":"statistical spectral analysis"},{"word":"surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"31416036","title":"Bio-electrochemical power generation in petrochemical wastewater fed microbial fuel cell.","date":"2019-11-22","abs":"The petrochemical wastewater (PCW) from acrylic acid plants possesses a very high chemical oxygen demand (COD) due to the presence of acrylic acid along with other organic acids.

The purpose of this study was to investigate and reduce sediment biotransformation on the surface of the semi-hardened lens based on acrylate by bulk-free radical polymerization method. In this respect, the effect of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) with two different molecular weights of 200 and 600 g/mol on the surface roughness, protein absorption, and hydrophilicity of the lenses were studied. The surface hardness of the lenses, on shore D scale, was measured using a durometer hardness test. The presence of higher molecular weight of PEGDA hydrophilic polymeric monomers reduced the hardness of the lenses. The effect of introducing PEGDA, with two molecular weights, into lens fabrication formulations was studied with respect to their water content parameters and hydrophilicity. The presence of a crosslinker such as poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylates, at two different molecular weights, increased the water content and hydrophilicity of the produced lenses. Surface roughness is associated with the formation of bio-film and accumulation of microorganisms on the surface. Due to the roughness of the lens surface developed in this research, the lenses containing PEGDA 600 exhibited less roughness compared to that of PEGDA 200, which could also affect the absorption of protein. Therefore, according to the results of protein absorption test, the PEGDA 600 lenses showed lower protein absorption, which could be due to their high degree of water absorption and hydrophilicity.","authors":[{"name":"Fahimeh Askari"},{"name":"Mojgan Zandi"},{"name":"Parvin Shokrolahi"},{"name":"Mitra Hashemi Tabatabaei"},{"name":"Elnaz Hajirasoliha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Ophtalmic lens"},{"word":"Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate"},{"word":"Protein absorption"},{"word":"Silicone acrylate"}]},"article215":{"pmid":"31414394","title":"The viscosity behaviors of bacterial suspensions or extracellular polymeric substances and their effects on aerobic granular sludge.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"Although the viscosity behavior of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in flocculent activated sludge (FAS) and aerobic granular sludge (AGS) has been investigated, no studies have explored the role of viscosity in microbial attachment in pure culture.

Biofilms were formed on each food contact coupon surface using a three-strain cocktail of S. aureus. Five-day-old biofilms on STS No. 4, STS 2B, HDPE, and PP coupons were treated with SS at 100°C and SHS at 125 and 150°C for 2, 4, 7, 10, 15, and 20 s.

The filament of its flagellum is composed of multiple flagellin subunits, FlaA, -B, -C, and -D. In V. vulnificus genomes, however, open reading frames (ORFs) annotated by FlaE and -F are also present. Although neither FlaE nor FlaF is involved in filament formation and cellular motility, they are well expressed and secreted to the extracellular milieu through the secretion apparatus for flagellar assembly. In the extrapolymeric matrix of V. vulnificus biofilm, significant levels of FlaEF were detected. Mutants defective in both flaE and flaF formed significantly decreased biofilms compared to the wild-type biofilm. Thus, the potential role of FlaEF during the biofilm-forming process was investigated by exogenous addition of recombinant FlaEF (rFlaEF) to the biofilm assays. The added rFlaE and rFlaF were predominantly incorporated into the biofilm matrix formed by the wild type. However, biofilms formed by a mutant defective in exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis were not affected by added FlaEF. These results raised a possibility that FlaEF specifically interact with EPS within the biofilm matrix. In vitro pulldown assays using His-tagged rFlaEF or rFlaC revealed the specific binding of EPS to rFlaEF but not to rFlaC. Taken together, our results demonstrate that V. vulnificus FlaEF, flagellin-homologous proteins (FHPs), are crucial for biofilm formation by directly interacting with the essential determinant for biofilm maturation, EPS. Further analyses performed with other pathogenic Vibrio species demonstrated both the presence of FHPs and their important role in biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"You-Chul Jung"},{"name":"Mi-Ae Lee"},{"name":"Kyu-Ho Lee"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio"},{"word":"biofilm matrix"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides"},{"word":"flagellin-homologous proteins"}]},"article230":{"pmid":"31409683","title":"Aggregation of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Is Regulated by Carbon-Nitrogen Balance.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging opportunistic pathogens that colonize household water systems and cause chronic lung infections in susceptible patients. The ability of NTM to form surface-attached biofilms in the nonhost environment and corded aggregates in vivo is important to their ability to persist in both contexts. Underlying the development of these multicellular structures is the capacity of mycobacterial cells to adhere to one another. Unlike most other bacteria, NTM spontaneously and constitutively aggregate in vitro, hindering our ability to understand the transition between planktonic and aggregated cells. While culturing a model NTM, Mycobacterium smegmatis, in rich medium, we fortuitously discovered that planktonic cells accumulate after ∼3 days of growth. By providing selective pressure for bacteria that disperse earlier, we isolated a strain with two mutations in the oligopeptide permease operon (opp). A mutant lacking the opp operon (Δopp) disperses earlier than wild type (WT) due to a defect in nutrient uptake. Experiments with WT M. smegmatis revealed that growth as aggregates is favored when carbon is replete, but under conditions of low available carbon relative to available nitrogen, M. smegmatis grows as planktonic cells. By adjusting carbon and nitrogen sources in defined medium, we tuned the cellular C/N ratio such that M. smegmatis grows either as aggregates or as planktonic cells. C/N-mediated aggregation regulation is widespread among NTM with the possible exception of rough-colony Mycobacterium abscessus isolates. Altogether, we show that NTM aggregation is a controlled process that is governed by the relative availability of carbon and nitrogen for metabolism.","authors":[{"name":"William H DePas"},{"name":"Megan Bergkessel"},{"name":"Dianne K Newman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"carbon metabolism"},{"word":"nitrogen metabolism"},{"word":"physiology"}]},"article231":{"pmid":"31409682","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa Interstrain Dynamics and Selection of Hyperbiofilm Mutants during a Chronic Infection.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Opportunistic pathogens establishing new infections experience strong selection to adapt, often favoring mutants that persist.

Wounds were infected with a mixed community of six P. aeruginosa strains, including the model PA14 strain (PA14-1), and biopsies taken at 3, 14, and 28 days postinfection. Hyperbiofilm-forming rugose small-colony variants (RSCVs) were the earliest and predominant phenotypic variant. These variants were detected on day 3 and persisted, with the majority evolved from PA14-1. Whole-genome sequencing of PA14-1 RSCV isolates revealed driver mutations exclusively in the wsp pathway, conferring hyperbiofilm phenotypes. Several of the wsp mutant RSCVs also acquired CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity to prophages isolated from the P. aeruginosa wound isolate (B23-2) that was also present in the inoculum. These observations emphasize the importance of interstrain dynamics and the role of lysogenic phages in the survival of an invading pathogen. Rather than being a side effect of chronicity, the rapid rise of RSCVs in wounds is evidence of positive selection on the Wsp chemosensory system to produce mutants with elevated biofilm formation capacity. We predict that RSCVs provide a level of phenotypic diversity to the infecting bacterial community and are common, early adaptations during infections.

The presence of temporal or spatial variability significantly affects the competition dynamics in populations, and gives rise to some counterintuitive observations. In this paper, we consider both birth-death (BD) or death-birth (DB) Moran processes, which are set up on a circular or a complete graph. We investigate spatial and temporal variability affecting division and/or death parameters. Assuming that mutant and wild-type fitness parameters are drawn from an identical distribution, we study mutant fixation probability and timing. We demonstrate that temporal and spatial types of variability possess fundamentally different properties. Under temporal randomness, in a completely mixed system, minority mutants experience (i) higher than neutral fixation probability and a higher mean conditional fixation time, if the division rates are affected by randomness and (ii) lower fixation probability and lower mean conditional fixation time if the death rates are affected. Once spatial restrictions are imposed, however, these effects completely disappear, and mutants in a circular graph experience neutral dynamics, but only for the DB update rule in case (i) and for the BD rule in case (ii) above. In contrast to this, in the case of spatially variable environment, both for BD/DB processes, both for complete/circular graph and both for division/death rates affected, minority mutants experience a higher than neutral probability of fixation. Fixation time, however, is increased by randomness on a circle, while it decreases for complete graphs under random division rates. A basic difference between temporal and spatial kinds of variability is the types of correlations that occur in the system. Under temporal randomness, mutants are spatially correlated with each other (they simply have equal fitness values at a given moment of time; the same holds for wild-types). Under spatial randomness, there are subtler, temporal correlations among mutant and wild-type cells, which manifest themselves by cells of each type 'claiming' better spots for themselves. Applications of this theory include cancer generation and biofilm dynamics.","authors":[{"name":"Suzan Farhang-Sardroodi"},{"name":"Amir H Darooneh"},{"name":"Mohammad Kohandel"},{"name":"Natalia L Komarova"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Moran process"},{"word":"fixation"},{"word":"mutations"},{"word":"neutrality"},{"word":"randomness"},{"word":"rare mutant"}]},"article233":{"pmid":"31408741","title":"Antifungal activity of volatile compounds produced by Staphylococcus sciuri strain MarR44 and its potential for the biocontrol of Colletotrichum nymphaeae, causal agent strawberry anthracnose.","date":"2019-11-12","abs":"A nonpathogenic endophytic bacterial isolate, recovered from Fragaria × ananassa stolon, and its antifungal activity against Colletotrichum nymphaeae was evaluated under in vitro, in vivo, and greenhouse conditions.

The living cells of strain MarR44 inhibited mycelial growth of C. nymphaeae (52.46%) using dual-culture method. The volatile compounds (VOCs) produced by MarR44 inhibited mycelial growth and conidial germination of C. nymphaeae by 34.52% and 82.81%, respectively.

Specificity of TCS is defined by the capability and velocity of phosphoryl transfer between a cognate HK and a RR. Here, we provide genetic, enzymology and structural data demonstrating that the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP physically and specifically binds to RavS, a HK of the phytopathogenic, gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. The [c-di-GMP]-RavS interaction substantially promotes specificity between RavS and RavR, a GGDEF-EAL domain-containing RR, by reinforcing the kinetic preference of RavS to phosphorylate RavR. [c-di-GMP]-RavS binding effectively decreases the phosphorylation level of RavS and negatively regulates bacterial swimming. Intriguingly, the EAL domain of RavR counteracts the above regulation by degrading c-di-GMP and then increasing the level of phosphorylated RavS. Therefore, RavR acts as a bifunctional phosphate sink that finely controls the level of phosphorylated RavS. These biochemical processes interactively modulate the phosphoryl flux between RavS-RavR and bacterial lifestyle transition.

Targeted microbial analysis is reviewed as well as the latest results from open-ended sequencing of the peri-implant flora. At this time there remains a lack of consensus for a specific microbial profile that is associated with peri-implantitis, suggesting that there may be other factors which influence the microbiome such as titanium surface dissolution. Therapeutic interventions to address the biofilm are presented at the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative stages. Evidence supports that perioperative chlorhexidine reduces biofilm-related implant complications and failure. Regular maintenance for dental implants is also shown to reduce peri-implant mucositis and implant failure. Maintenance procedures should aim to disrupt the biofilm without damaging the titanium dioxide surface layer in an effort to prevent further oxidation. Evidence supports the use of glycine powder air polishing as a valuable adjunct to conventional therapies for use at implant maintenance visits. For the treatment of peri-implantitis, nonsurgical therapy has not been shown to be effective, and while surgical intervention is not always predictable, it has been shown to be superior to nonsurgical treatment for decontamination of the implant surface that is not covered by bone.","authors":[{"name":"Diane M Daubert"},{"name":"Bradley F Weinstein"}],"keywords":[]},"article238":{"pmid":"31407435","title":"Concepts for prevention of complications in implant therapy.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"The use of dental implants is nowadays a well-accepted and highly predictable treatment modality for restoring the dentition and reestablishing the masticatory function of edentulous and partially edentulous patients. Despite the high predictability and excellent long-term survival rates reported for implant therapy, complications may still occur and can jeopardize both short- and long-term success. The present paper provides an overview on the most important aspects related to the etiology, prevention, and management of complications associated with implant therapy. Data from the literature indicate that a number of factors, such as surgical trauma, implant diameter, type of implant-abutment connection, abutment disconnection and reconnection, presence of microgap, and implant malpositioning, can substantially influence the biologic processes of bone remodeling and biofilm formation, thus increasing the rate of short- and long-term hard- and soft-tissue complications. Other factors, such as excess cement at cement-retained prosthetic restorations, abutment mobility, and infections (e.g. peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis) caused by bacterial biofilm, are further causes for complications and failures. More recent evidence also indicates that besides the need for sufficient bone volume surrounding the implant, the presence of an adequate width and thickness of attached mucosa may improve biofilm control and limit crestal bone resorption. Furthermore, emerging evidence points also to the pivotal role of human factors as one of the most important causes of complications in implant dentistry. It can be concluded that clinicians need to consider all biologic and biomechanical factors affecting implant placement and survival, as well as undergo adequate training to improve their surgical skills to control and prevent implant complications. Careful patient selection and control of environmental and systemic factors, such as smoking, diabetes etc., coupled with an accurate surgical and prosthetic planning, enable a better prevention and control of infections.","authors":[{"name":"Georgios E Romanos"},{"name":"Rafael Delgado-Ruiz"},{"name":"Anton Sculean"}],"keywords":[{"word":"complications"},{"word":"dental implants"},{"word":"implant therapy"}]},"article239":{"pmid":"31406662","title":"Proanthocyanidin Interferes with Intrinsic Antibiotic Resistance Mechanisms of Gram-Negative Bacteria.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Antibiotic resistance is spreading at an alarming rate among pathogenic bacteria in both medicine and agriculture. Interfering with the intrinsic resistance mechanisms displayed by pathogenic bacteria has the potential to make antibiotics more effective and decrease the spread of acquired antibiotic resistance. Here, it is demonstrated that cranberry proanthocyanidin (cPAC) prevents the evolution of resistance to tetracycline in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, rescues antibiotic efficacy against antibiotic-exposed cells, and represses biofilm formation. It is shown that cPAC has a potentiating effect, both in vitro and in vivo, on a broad range of antibiotic classes against pathogenic E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. Evidence that cPAC acts by repressing two antibiotic resistance mechanisms, selective membrane permeability and multidrug efflux pumps, is presented. Failure of cPAC to potentiate antibiotics against efflux pump-defective mutants demonstrates that efflux interference is essential for potentiation. The use of cPAC to potentiate antibiotics and mitigate the development of resistance could improve treatment outcomes and help combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Vimal B Maisuria"},{"name":"Mira Okshevsky"},{"name":"Eric Déziel"},{"name":"Nathalie Tufenkji"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"anti‐biofilm"},{"word":"efflux pump"},{"word":"multidrug resistance"},{"word":"potentiation"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"31406097","title":"Inhibitory effect of zinc-containing desensitizer on bacterial biofilm formation and root dentin demineralization.","date":"2019-12-03","abs":"This study compared the effect of a novel zinc containing, Caredyne Shield (CS), and a fluoroaluminocalciumsilicate-based, Nanoseal (NS) desensitizers on dentin tubule occlusion, inhibition of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) biofilm growth, and resistance to bacterial demineralization.

Despite the isolates being closely related, PA14 exhibits increased virulence compared to that of PAO1 in various models. To determine which players are responsible for the hypervirulence phenotype of the PA14 strain, we elected a transcriptomic approach through RNA sequencing. We found 2,029 genes that are differentially expressed between the two strains, including several genes that are involved with or regulated by quorum sensing (QS), known to control most of the virulence factors in P. aeruginosa Among them, we chose to focus our study on QslA, an antiactivator of QS whose expression was barely detectable in the PA14 strain according our data. We hypothesized that lack of expression of qslA in PA14 could be responsible for higher QS expression in the PA14 strain, possibly explaining its hypervirulence phenotype. After confirming that QslA protein was highly produced in PAO1 but not in the PA14 strain, we obtained evidence showing that a PAO1 deletion strain of qslA has faster QS gene expression kinetics than PA14. Moreover, known virulence factors activated by QS, such as (i) pyocyanin production, (ii) H2-T6SS (type VI secretion system) gene expression, and (iii) Xcp-T2SS (type II secretion system) machinery production and secretion, were all lower in PAO1 than in PA14, due to higher qslA expression. However, biofilm formation and cytotoxicity toward macrophages, although increased in PA14 compared to PAO1, were independent of QslA control. Together, our findings implicated differential qslA expression as a major determinant of virulence factor expression in P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA14.","authors":[{"name":"T G Sana"},{"name":"R Lomas"},{"name":"M R Gimenez"},{"name":"A Laubier"},{"name":"C Soscia"},{"name":"C Chauvet"},{"name":"A Conesa"},{"name":"R Voulhoux"},{"name":"B Ize"},{"name":"S Bleves"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"T2SS"},{"word":"T6SS"},{"word":"pyocyanin"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article242":{"pmid":"31405860","title":"Disparate Candida albicans Biofilm Formation in Clinical Lipid Emulsions Due to Capric Acid-Mediated Inhibition.","date":"2020-02-18","abs":"Receipt of parenteral nutrition (PN) remains an independent risk factor for developing catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) caused by fungi, including by the polymorphic fungus Candida albicans, which is notoriously adept at forming drug-resistant biofilm structures.

Therefore, using an in vitro biofilm model system, we sought to determine whether various clinical lipid emulsions differentially impacted biofilm growth in C. albicans We observed that the lipid emulsions Intralipid and Omegaven both stimulated C. albicans biofilm formation during growth in minimal medium or a macronutrient PN solution. Conversely, Smoflipid inhibited C. albicans biofilm formation by approximately 50%. Follow-up studies revealed that while Smoflipid did not impair C. albicans growth, it did significantly inhibit hypha formation and hyphal elongation. Moreover, growth inhibition could be recapitulated in Intralipid when supplemented with capric acid-a fatty acid present in Smoflipid but absent in Intralipid. Capric acid was also found to dose dependently inhibit C. albicans biofilm formation in PN solutions.

Visualized by field emission-scanning electron microscopy, the suppressed formation of S. mutans biofilms grown with TF3 at sub-inhibitory concentrations could be attributed to the reduced biofilm matrix, which was proven to contain glucans and extracellular DNA (eDNA). Glucan-reduced effect of TF3 was achieved by down-regulating expression levels of gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD encoding glucosyltransferases. Besides, TF3 reduced eDNA formation of S. mutans by negatively regulating lrgA, lrgB, and srtA, which govern cell autolysis and membrane vesicle components. Furthermore, TF3 also played vital roles in antagonizing preformed biofilms of S. mutans. Bactericidal effects of TF3 became significant when its concentrations increased more than twofold of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Moreover, the capacities of S. mutans biofilms to produce acid and tolerate acid were significantly weakened by TF3 at MIC. Based on real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, the mechanistic effects of TF3 were speculated to comprise the inhibition of enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, F-type ATPase and the agmatine deiminase system. Moreover, TF3 has been found to downregulate LytST, VicRK, and ComDE two component systems in S. mutans, which play critical roles in the regulatory network of virulence factors.

Thus, environmental conditions can significantly affect the amount of biofilm formation and cell morphology of C. parapsilosis with Mn2+ to overcome developmental blocks to trigger biofilm formation and to partially relieve BCR1 suppressed cell differentiation.","authors":[{"name":"Sulman Shafeeq"},{"name":"Srisuda Pannanusorn"},{"name":"Youssef Elsharabasy"},{"name":"Bernardo Ramírez-Zavala"},{"name":"Joachim Morschhäuser"},{"name":"Ute Römling"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          BCR1        "},{"word":"          Candida parapsilosis        "},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"cell morphology"},{"word":"hyphae"},{"word":"manganese"},{"word":"metal ions"},{"word":"pseudohyphae"},{"word":"yeast cells"}]},"article257":{"pmid":"31403349","title":"Characterization and Treatment of Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis.","date":"2019-09-11","abs":"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common but treatable condition, with a number of effective available treatments, including oral and intravaginal metronidazole and clindamycin and oral tinidazole. However, as many as 50% of women with BV experience recurrence within 1 year of treatment for incident disease. Some reasons for recurrence include the persistence of residual infection, resistance, and possibly reinfection from either male or female partners. Persistence may occur due to the formation of a biofilm that protects BV-causing bacteria from antimicrobial therapy. Poor adherence to treatment among patients with genitourinary infections may lead to resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of recurrent etiology of BV are not known. Recommended treatment for recurrent BV consists of an extended course of metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice daily for 10-14 days); if ineffective, metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% for 10 days, followed by two times per week for 3-6 months, is an alternate treatment regimen. Past studies of clindamycin and tinidazole in the treatment of recurrent BV have focused on patients with evidence of metronidazole resistance. Secnidazole may be an attractive new option due to one-time dosing. Initial studies on biofilm disruption, use of probiotics and prebiotics, and botanical treatments have shown some promise, but must be studied further before use in the clinic.

The AHL-producing bacteria were directly isolated from the rice root by the biosensor reporter (Chromobacterium violaceum CV026) overlay method and characterized for biofilm production by the microtiter plate method.

These increasingly severe thermal conditions are causing an unprecedented increase in the frequency and severity of mortality events in marine ecosystems, including on coral reefs [3]. The degradation of coral reefs will result in the collapse of ecosystem services that sustain over half a billion people globally [4, 5]. Here, we show that marine heatwave events on coral reefs are biologically distinct to how coral bleaching has been understood to date, in that heatwave conditions result in an immediate heat-induced mortality of the coral colony, rapid coral skeletal dissolution, and the loss of the three-dimensional reef structure. During heatwave-induced mortality, the coral skeletons exposed by tissue loss are, within days, encased by a complex biofilm of phototrophic microbes, whose metabolic activity accelerates calcium carbonate dissolution to rates exceeding accretion by healthy corals and far greater than has been documented on reefs under normal seawater conditions. This dissolution reduces the skeletal density and hardness and increases porosity. These results demonstrate that severe-heatwave-induced mortality events should be considered as a distinct biological phenomenon from bleaching events on coral reefs. We also suggest that such heatwave mortality events, and rapid reef decay, will become more frequent as the intensity of marine heatwaves increases and provides further compelling evidence for the need to mitigate climate change and instigate actions to reduce marine heatwaves.","authors":[{"name":"William P Leggat"},{"name":"Emma F Camp"},{"name":"David J Suggett"},{"name":"Scott F Heron"},{"name":"Alexander J Fordyce"},{"name":"Stephanie Gardner"},{"name":"Lachlan Deakin"},{"name":"Michael Turner"},{"name":"Levi J Beeching"},{"name":"Unnikrishnan Kuzhiumparambil"},{"name":"C Mark Eakin"},{"name":"Tracy D Ainsworth"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioerosion"},{"word":"climate change"},{"word":"coral"},{"word":"coral reefs"},{"word":"decalcification"},{"word":"marine heatwave"}]},"article265":{"pmid":"31401887","title":"Dehydration affects drug transport over nasal mucosa.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Formulations for nasal drug delivery often rely on water sorption to adhere to the mucosa, which also causes a higher water gradient over the tissue and subsequent dehydration.

This strategy, known as drug repositioning or drug repurposing, could diminish the incidence of adverse effects and lower the cost of production, since several steps involved in drug discovery and development have already been accomplished. This review presents a set of known drugs that have been exploited as anticandidal agents, such as antidepressant agents, antiepileptic drugs, statins, among others. These substances affect the growth of Candida spp. in vitro, as well as virulence factors such as morphogenesis and biofilm formation. Moreover, some drugs are able to potentiate the anticandidal activity of known antifungal drugs. Drug repositioning appears as a remarkable alternative to increase the pharmacological arsenal against candidiasis, but further studies must be conducted in order to evaluate the real applicability of known drugs in the treatment of these infections.","authors":[{"name":"D C Moraes"},{"name":"A Ferreira-Pereira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungal activity"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"Drug repositioning"},{"word":"Fluconazole resistance"}]},"article277":{"pmid":"31398805","title":"Nanomagnetite-embedded PLGA Spheres for Multipurpose Medical Applications.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"We report on the synthesis and evaluation of biopolymeric spheres of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) containing different amounts of magnetite nanoparticles and Ibuprofen (PLGA-Fe","authors":[{"name":"Valentina Grumezescu"},{"name":"Oana Gherasim"},{"name":"Irina Negut"},{"name":"Stefan Banita"},{"name":"Alina Maria Holban"},{"name":"Paula Florian"},{"name":"Madalina Icriverzi"},{"name":"Gabriel Socol"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial materials"},{"word":"biopolymeric spheres"},{"word":"hyperthermia"},{"word":"magnetic nanoparticles"},{"word":"multifunctional materials"}]},"article278":{"pmid":"31398534","title":"Fibronectin and laminin induce biofilm formation by Streptococcus uberis and decrease its penicillin susceptibility.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of fibronectin and laminin on the in vitro biofilm formation by Streptococcus uberis and the susceptibility to penicillin under planktonic and biofilm growth conditions.

Here, we report the identification of a variant histone H3, which we have designated H3VCTG because of its exclusive presence in the CTG clade of ascomycetes, including Candida albicans, a human pathogen. C. albicans grows both as single yeast cells and hyphal filaments in the planktonic mode of growth. It also forms a three-dimensional biofilm structure in the host as well as on human catheter materials under suitable conditions. H3VCTG null (hht1/hht1) cells of C. albicans are viable but produce more robust biofilms than wild-type cells in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Indeed, a comparative transcriptome analysis of planktonic and biofilm cells reveals that the biofilm circuitry is significantly altered in H3VCTG null cells. H3VCTG binds more efficiently to the promoters of many biofilm-related genes in the planktonic cells than during biofilm growth, whereas the binding of the core canonical histone H3 on the corresponding promoters largely remains unchanged. Furthermore, biofilm defects associated with master regulators, namely, biofilm and cell wall regulator 1 (Bcr1), transposon enhancement control 1 (Tec1), and non-dityrosine 80 (Ndt80), are significantly rescued in cells lacking H3VCTG. The occupancy of the transcription factor Bcr1 at its cognate promoter binding sites was found to be enhanced in the absence of H3VCTG in the planktonic form of growth resulting in enhanced transcription of biofilm-specific genes. Further, we demonstrate that co-occurrence of valine and serine at the 31st and 32nd positions in H3VCTG, respectively, is essential for its function. Taken together, we show that even in a unicellular organism, differential gene expression patterns are modulated by the relative occupancy of the specific histone H3 type at the chromatin level.","authors":[{"name":"Laxmi Shanker Rai"},{"name":"Rima Singha"},{"name":"Hiram Sanchez"},{"name":"Tanmoy Chakraborty"},{"name":"Bipin Chand"},{"name":"Sophie Bachellier-Bassi"},{"name":"Shantanu Chowdhury"},{"name":"Christophe d'Enfert"},{"name":"David R Andes"},{"name":"Kaustuv Sanyal"}],"keywords":[]},"article284":{"pmid":"31397993","title":"Nonfreezable Water and Polymer Swelling Control the Marine Antifouling Performance of Polymers with Limited Hydrophilic Content.","date":"2019-08-23","abs":"Zwitterionic chemical groups have well-documented resistance to marine fouling species when presented as homogeneous polymer brushes. These model formulations are not, however, suitable for practical fouling-control applications. It is presently unknown if a uniform film of zwitterions is required to elicit nonfouling character via the binding of interfacial water or if the incorporation of zwitterionic functionality into a more practical bulk polymer system will suffice. Here, copolymers of n-butyl methacrylate were synthesized with low incorporation levels (up to 20 mol %) of hydrophilic functionality, including zwitterionic moieties. Their antifouling (AF) properties were evaluated using barnacle cyprids (Balanus improvisus), diatom cells (Navicula incerta), and a multispecies biofilm. The laboratory assays revealed higher resistance of ionic copolymers toward cyprid settlement, which was attributed to their swelling and the presence of nonfreezable water molecules bound tightly to the polymer chains. Additionally, cells of N. incerta and the multispecies biofilm were removed more effectively on polymers containing sulfobetaine methacrylate and sulfopropyl methacrylate moieties. The results indicate that the presence of tightly bound interfacial water is not limited to model systems of pure hydrophilic homopolymers, but that this mechanism can also reduce the settlement and adhesion of fouling species via bulk copolymer systems with limited hydrophilic content. The swelling of polymers with hydrophilic content may also contribute to their AF efficacy, and such materials may therefore represent a route to translation of the well-documented nonfouling character of zwitterions into practical, industrially relevant coating formulations.","authors":[{"name":"Jan H Kardela"},{"name":"Ian S Millichamp"},{"name":"James Ferguson"},{"name":"Alison L Parry"},{"name":"Kevin J Reynolds"},{"name":"Nick Aldred"},{"name":"Anthony S Clare"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"antifouling"},{"word":"barnacle cyprid"},{"word":"hydrophilic surface"},{"word":"zwitterionic"}]},"article285":{"pmid":"31397925","title":"Phospholipid Content of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Is Modulated by the Growth Phase Rather Than the Immobilization State.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Biofilms have significance in medical, industrial, and environmental settings, and can cause important damage.

Se NPs were characterized by UV-Vis., HRTM, FTIR, XRD, DLS, SEM, and EDX mapping technique. Antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of the synthesized Se NPs were investigated against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and yeast causing severe diseases such as urinary tract infection (UTI). The biogenic Se NPs exhibited an absorption peak at 435.0 nm while Se NPs-CN showed an absorption peak at 350.0 nm which is related to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Data obtained from HRTEM, SEM/mapping, and XRD analysis confirmed the mono-dispersion and crystalline nature of the prepared samples with an average diameter of 33.84 nm and 22.37 nm for the mycogenic Se NPs and Se NPs-CN, respectively.

As antibiotic resistance increases in general and because most antibiotics have poor effectiveness against biofilm-embedded bacteria in particular, there is a need for alternative and innovative treatment approaches. Recently, the immune system has moved into focus as the key player in infection defense and bone homeostasis, and the targeted modulation of the host response is becoming an emerging field of interest. The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge of impaired endogenous defense mechanisms that are unable to prevent chronicity of bone infections associated with a prosthetic or osteosynthetic device. The presence of foreign material adversely affects the immune system by generating a local immune-compromised environment where spontaneous clearance of planktonic bacteria does not take place. Furthermore, the surface structure of the implant facilitates the transition of bacteria from the planktonic to the biofilm stage. Biofilm formation on the implant surface is closely linked to the development of a chronic infection, and a misled adaption of the immune system makes it impossible to effectively eliminate biofilm infections. The interaction between the immune system and bone cells, especially osteoclasts, is extensively studied in the field of osteoimmunology and this crosstalk further aggravates the course of bone infection by shifting bone homeostasis in favor of bone resorption.

Biofilms play an important role in P. aeruginosa drug resistance. Three factors are most important to induce biofilm: quorum sensing (QS), bis-(3'-5')-cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), and small RNAs (sRNAs). P. aeruginosa has its own specific QS system (PQS) besides two common QS systems, LasI-LasR and RhlI-RhlR, in bacteria. PQS is interesting not only because there is a negative regulation from RhlR to pqsR but also because the null mutation in PQS leads to a reduced biofilm formation. Furthermore, P. aeruginosa dispersed cells have physiological features that are distinct between the planktonic cells and biofilm cells. In response to a low concentration of c-di-GMP, P. aeruginosa cells can disperse from the biofilms to become planktonic cells. These raise an interesting hypothesis of whether biofilm can be reversed through the QS mechanism in P. aeruginosa. Although a single factor is certainly not sufficient to prevent the biofilm formation, it necessarily explores such possibility. In this hypothesis, the literature is analyzed to determine the negative regulation pathways, and then the transcriptomic data are analyzed to determine whether this hypothesis is workable or not. Unexpectedly, the transcriptomic data reveal a negative regulation between lasI and psqR. Also, the individual cases from transcriptomic data demonstrate the negative regulations of PQS with laslI, laslR, rhlI, and rhlR under different experiments.

These biofilms/deposits have different cave distribution, pH, macro- and microelement and mineralogical composition, carbon and nitrogen content. In particular, water filaments and vermiculations had circumneutral and slightly acidic pH, respectively, both had abundant organic carbon and high microbial diversity. They were rich in macro- and microelements, deriving from mineral dissolution, and, in the case of water filaments, from seawater composition. Vermiculations had different color, partly associated with their mineralogy, and unusual minerals probably due to trapping capacities. Moonmilk was composed of gypsum, poor in organic matter, had an extremely low pH (0-1) and low microbial diversity. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, the microbial composition of the biofilms/deposits included autotrophic taxa associated with sulfur and nitrogen cycles and biomineralization processes. In particular, water filaments communities were characterized by bacterial taxa involved in sulfur oxidation and reduction in aquatic, aphotic, microaerophilic/anoxic environments (Campylobacterales, Thiotrichales, Arenicellales, Desulfobacterales, Desulforomonadales) and in chemolithotrophy in marine habitats (Oceanospirillales, Chromatiales). Their biodiversity was linked to the morphology of the water filaments and their collection site. Microbial communities within vermiculations were partly related to their color and showed high abundance of unclassified Betaproteobacteria and sulfur-oxidizing Hydrogenophilales (including Sulfuriferula), and Acidiferrobacterales (including Sulfurifustis), sulfur-reducing Desulfurellales, and ammonia-oxidizing Planctomycetes and Nitrospirae. The microbial community associated with gypsum moonmilk showed the strong dominance (>60%) of the archaeal genus Thermoplasma and lower abundance of chemolithotrophic Acidithiobacillus, metal-oxidizing Metallibacterium, Sulfobacillus, and Acidibacillus.

Of five previously predicted G5 domains we found that four of these, all derived from S. pneumoniae, are independently folded modules. As one of these exhibits extreme line broadening due to self-association, we were able to use NMR solution studies to probe the potential ligand interactions of the remaining three G5 domains. None of these G5 domains engage N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) as previously predicted but do interact with other small molecules that may modulate adherence to both bacteria and host cells. Specifically, while all G5 domains tested engage Zn, only one of these G5 domains engage heparin. NMR solution structural studies of the IgA1 Protease G5 (IgA1P-G5) and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase-D G5 (ENDD-G5) also facilitated identification of the ligand binding sites and confirm the typical G5 fold that comprises two connected β-sheets with no canonical core.

In this study, buried biocathodes were operated in laboratory settings for the simulation of in situ groundwater denitrification. Two alternative configurations were tested: biocathode buried in sand, and biocathode buried in gravel. A control test with a biocathode in absence of sand/gravel was also performed. In all the cases, biocathodes were driven by power supply or potentiostat to guarantee a steady electron flux to the cathode. The presence of sand and gravel strongly influenced the denitrification process: in both configurations, accumulation of intermediate N-forms was detected, suggesting that the denitrification process was only partially achieved. In addition, a significant decrease (in the 20-36% range) in nitrate removal rates was measured in sand and gravel setups compared to the control reactor; this issue could be attributed to lack of recirculation that limited contact between substrate and electrode-adherent biofilm. Biocathodes buried in gravel obtained better results than those buried in sand due to the lower packing of the medium.

Community analysis via ss-rRNA paired-end sequencing and distribution-based clustering revealed higher OTU richness, diversity, and variability in groundwater communities of FW301 than the other two wells for diversity binned over all time points. Microbial community composition of a given well was on average > 50% dissimilar to any other well at a given time (days), yet, functional gene diversity as measured with GeoChip remained relatively constant. Similarities in community structure across wells were observed with respect to the presence of 20 shared bacterial groups in all samples in all wells, although at varying levels over the tested time period. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis revealed that variability in FW301 was largely attributed to low abundance, highly-transient populations, while variability in the most hydrochemically stable well (FW303) was due to fluctuations in more highly abundant and frequently present taxa. Additionally, the youngest well FW305 showed a dramatic shift in community composition towards the end of the sampling period that was not observed in the other wells, suggesting possible succession events over time. Time-series analysis using vector auto-regressive models and Granger causality showed unique relationships between richness and geochemistry over time in each well. These results indicate temporally dynamic microbial communities over short time scales, with day-to-day population shifts in local community structure influenced by available source community diversity and local groundwater hydrochemistry.","authors":[{"name":"Anna J Zelaya"},{"name":"Albert E Parker"},{"name":"Kathryn L Bailey"},{"name":"Ping Zhang"},{"name":"Joy Van Nostrand"},{"name":"Daliang Ning"},{"name":"Dwayne A Elias"},{"name":"Jizhong Zhou"},{"name":"Terry C Hazen"},{"name":"Adam P Arkin"},{"name":"Matthew W Fields"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Functional gene array"},{"word":"Groundwater"},{"word":"Microbial community dynamics"},{"word":"Shallow subsurface"},{"word":"Spatiotemporal"},{"word":"Time series"},{"word":"Well construction"}]},"article323":{"pmid":"31386957","title":"Comparison of coagulative colloidal microbubbles with monomeric and polymeric inorganic coagulants for tertiary treatment of distillery wastewater.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The flotation using coagulative colloidal gas aphrons (CCGAs) is of great potential in effectively removing the recalcitrant dissolved organic matter (DOM) and colorants from the bio-chemically treated cassava distillery wastewater.

Growth was measured through colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, while cellular and colonial phenotypic stress responses were observed through visible light, fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy. Our data show the following: (1) The tolerance to high salt concentrations can be increased through a stepwise inoculation toward higher concentrations. (2) Ion-specific factors are more relevant for the growth limitation of P. halocryophilus in saline solutions than single physicochemical parameters like ionic strength or water activity. (3) P. halocryophilus shows the highest microbial sodium perchlorate tolerance described so far. However, (4) MSCg values are higher for all chlorides compared to perchlorates. (5) The MSCg for calcium chloride was increased by lowering the temperature from 25°C to 4°C, while sodium- and magnesium-containing salts can be tolerated at 25°C to higher concentrations than at 4°C. (6) Depending on salt type and concentration, P. halocryophilus cells show distinct phenotypic stress responses such as novel types of colony morphology on agar plates and biofilm-like cell clustering, encrustation, and development of intercellular nanofilaments.

Antifungal combinations with synergistic interaction can be a good choice for antifungal lock therapy; therefore, interactions were examined between two echinocandins (caspofungin and micafungin) and the chitin synthesis inhibitor nikkomycin Z against Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis biofilms. Susceptibility was evaluated using the XTT-based checkerboard microdilution method, while the nature of interactions was assessed by calculating fractional inhibitory concentration indices and using the Bliss independence model. Mathematic-based evaluations were supplemented with fluorescent LIVE/DEAD viability assay. The results obtained by statistical interaction analyses correlated well with the viability assay. The tested echinocandins with nikkomycin Z caused an extended cell death and the structure of the biofilm was sparse compared to the control, especially for C. albicans. The findings support the simultaneous usage of nikkomycin Z and caspofungin or micafungin in alternative therapies such as the antifungal lock therapy.

Over the past few decades, Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) process has been widely used as an efficient, well-designed and practical approach for treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater due to its cost-effectiveness and simplicity. SBR Performance can enhance by providing simultaneous suspended and attached growth of microorganisms which act as a hybrid growth. In this study, a lab-scale Hybrid Sequencing Batch Reactor (HSBR) with 6.4 l working volume was used to examine the effect of salinity (NaCl), increased from 0 to 6.7% (g NaCl/ L wastewater), on the biological treatment. Therefore, COD, MLSS, MLVSS and SVI parameters have been measured over a period of 7 months of operation. The operational parameters namely pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature were 7.5-8.5, 1.5-6.8 mg /L and 20-25 °C respectively during whole experiment. Influent COD of synthetic wastewater was maintained at 650 ± 25 mg/L. The HSBR Cycle time including, influent feeding, React, Settling and effluent discharge were 1/20/1/1 h respectively. Results indicated that by increasing salt concentration from 0 to 67.7 g NaCl/L, the COD removal efficiency reduced from 94.22 to 53.69%. Moreover, as the NaCl concentration increased, MLSS rose up to 69%, while MLVSS almost stayed constant and SVI dropped by 83%. The results indicated that the simultaneous use of suspended and attached growth of microorganisms and gradual increasing of salt content of wastewater could lead to greater biomass concentration and ultimately improvement in the degradation of organic matter. Besides, settling performance and its velocity were noticeably improved by increasing salinity.","authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Tizghadam Ghazani"},{"name":"Alireza Taghdisian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biological process"},{"word":"Hybrid growth"},{"word":"Hybrid sequencing batch reactor"},{"word":"Saline wastewater"},{"word":"Suspended sludge"}]},"article336":{"pmid":"31383746","title":"Multi-omics Analyses Reveal Synergistic Carbohydrate Metabolism in Streptococcus mutans-Candida albicans Mixed-Species Biofilms.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Candida albicans, a major opportunistic fungal pathogen, is frequently found together with Streptococcus mutans in dental biofilms associated with severe childhood caries (tooth decay), a prevalent pediatric oral disease.

RNA sequencing and iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation)-based quantitative proteomics revealed that C. albicans genes and proteins associated with carbohydrate metabolism were significantly enhanced, including sugar transport, aerobic respiration, pyruvate breakdown, and the glyoxylate cycle. Other C. albicans genes and proteins directly and indirectly related to cell morphogenesis and cell wall components such as mannan and glucan were also upregulated, indicating enhanced fungal activity in mixed-species biofilm. Further analyses revealed that S. mutans-derived exoenzyme glucosyltransferase B (GtfB), which binds to the fungal cell surface to promote coadhesion, can break down sucrose into glucose and fructose that can be readily metabolized by C. albicans, enhancing growth and acid production. Altogether, we identified key pathways used by C. albicans in the mixed biofilm, indicating an active fungal role in the sugar metabolism and environmental acidification (key virulence traits associated with caries onset) when interacting with S. mutans, and a new cross-feeding mechanism mediated by GtfB that enhances C. albicans carbohydrate utilization.

The amount of total EPS considerably decreased with biochar addition, which caused a shift in the EPS functional groups including carbonyl of protein, amide, and hydroxyl groups. Moreover, biochar could enhance the high molecular weight compounds metabolized into low molecular compounds. The results can provide new insights into the use of biochar in the enhancement of nitrogen removal by microbial community and metabolic product characteristics.","authors":[{"name":"Chaoren Deng"},{"name":"Lei Huang"},{"name":"Yinkun Liang"},{"name":"Hongyu Xiang"},{"name":"Jie Jiang"},{"name":"Qinghua Wang"},{"name":"Jie Hou"},{"name":"Yucheng Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biochar"},{"word":"Constructed wetland"},{"word":"EPS characterization"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Nitrogen removal"}]},"article344":{"pmid":"31382161","title":"Effects of nano-hydroxyapatite on the formation of biofilms by Streptococcus mutans in two different media.","date":"2019-12-20","abs":"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) on biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans, which is actively involved in the initiation of dental caries.","authors":[{"name":"Miseon Park"},{"name":"John B Sutherland"},{"name":"Fatemeh Rafii"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Glucosyltransferase"},{"word":"Nano-hydroxyapatite"},{"word":"Polysaccharide"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"}]},"article345":{"pmid":"31382160","title":"Cytotoxic and antibacterial effect of a red propolis mouthwash, with or without fluoride, on the growth of a cariogenic biofilm.","date":"2019-12-20","abs":"To evaluatein vitro the antibacterial activity, the antibiofilm effect and the cytotoxic potential of mouthwashes containing Brazilian red propolis with or without fluoride.","authors":[{"name":"Mariana Leonel Martins"},{"name":"Amanda Souza Nunes Monteiro"},{"name":"Juli Emily Costa Guimarães"},{"name":"Maria Bárbara de Carvalho Torres Guimarães"},{"name":"Raphael Ferreira da Silva"},{"name":"Lúcio Mendes Cabral"},{"name":"Adriana Farah"},{"name":"Juliana dePaula"},{"name":"Maria Teresa Villela Romanos"},{"name":"Lucianne Cople Maia"},{"name":"Yuri Wanderley Cavalcanti"},{"name":"Andréa Fonseca-Gonçalves"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-bacterial agents"},{"word":"Biolfims"},{"word":"Mouthwashes"},{"word":"Propolis"}]},"article346":{"pmid":"31382155","title":"Response of syntrophic aggregates to the magnetite loss in continuous anaerobic bioreactor.","date":"2019-11-19","abs":"Increasing studies indicate that magnetite addition could accelerate the methanogenesis via enhancing direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET)-based anaerobic syntrophy. However, magnetite is found to run off in continuous bioreactor, and the effect of magnetite loss on syntrophic aggregates is still underreported. In this study, two EGSB reactors (RM with magnetite-enhanced sludge, and RB as a control) were operated to investigate the magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the corresponding response of syntrophic aggregates. Results showed that magnetite in RM was washed out gradually in form of iron ions, and a slightly acidic niche was supposed to be the major cause. Nevertheless, candidate DIET partners like Geobacter and Methanothrix along with syntrophic volatile fatty acids (VFAs)-degrading microbes were enriched in RM. In addition, the improved redox activity of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), higher sludge conductivity and electron transport activity suggested that the DIET ability of sludge in RM was still enhanced, which favors the syntrophic metabolism of VFAs. Interestingly, syntrophic partners were loosely combined under the condition of high organic loading rate (OLR) in the presence of magnetite, but with gradual loss of magnetite, dense and active anaerobic granular sludge (AGS) was formed in RM. This study provided a comprehensive understanding of magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the response of syntrophic aggregates. The robust DIET-based syntrophy after magnetite adding could favor the high-efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the future, and further investigations on magnetite resupply and the mechanism of magnetite enriching candidate DIET partners are recommended.","authors":[{"name":"Caiqin Wang"},{"name":"Chen Wang"},{"name":"Luonan Jin"},{"name":"Donghui Lu"},{"name":"Hui Chen"},{"name":"Weitang Zhu"},{"name":"Xiangyang Xu"},{"name":"Liang Zhu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anaerobic bioreactor"},{"word":"Anaerobic granular sludge (AGS)"},{"word":"Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET)"},{"word":"Magnetite behavior"},{"word":"Syntrophic metabolism"}]},"article347":{"pmid":"31382154","title":"Molecular change of dissolved organic matter and patterns of bacterial activity in a stream along a land-use gradient.","date":"2019-11-19","abs":"Fluvial networks are globally relevant for the processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM). To investigate the change in molecular DOM diversity along the river course, high-field FTICR mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy of riverine DOM as well as bacterial abundance and activity were measured in a third order stream along a land-use gradient from pristine, agricultural to urban landscapes. DOM composition showed a clear evolution along the river course with an initial decrease of average oxidation and unsaturation followed by an increased relative abundance of CHNO and CHOS compounds introduced by agriculture and waste water, respectively. DOM composition was dominated by rather unsaturated CHO compounds (H/C ≤ 1) in headwaters and by more aliphatic molecules at downstream sites. Oxygenated functional groups shifted from aromatic ethers and hydroxyl groups to aliphatic carboxylic acids and aliphatic hydroxyl groups. This massive dislocation of oxygen significantly increased the diversity of atomic environments in branched aliphatic groups from headwater to downstream DOM. Mass spectra of DOM enabled the detection of compositional relationships to bacterial abundance and activity which was positively related to more aliphatic components (H/C > 1) and negatively related to unsaturated components. FTICR mass and NMR spectra corroborated the initial decline in DOM molecular diversity predicted by the River Continuum Concept (RCC) but demonstrated an anthropogenic increase in the molecular diversity of DOM further downstream. While the high DOM molecular diversity in first order headwater streams was the result of small scale ecosystem plurality, agriculture and waste water treatment introduced many components in the lower reaches. These anthropogenic influences together with massive bacterial oxidation of DOM contributed to a growth of molecular diversity of downstream DOM whose composition and structure differed entirely from those found in pristine headwaters.","authors":[{"name":"Norbert Kamjunke"},{"name":"Norbert Hertkorn"},{"name":"Mourad Harir"},{"name":"Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin"},{"name":"Christian Griebler"},{"name":"Mario Brauns"},{"name":"Wolf von Tümpling"},{"name":"Markus Weitere"},{"name":"Peter Herzsprung"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial production"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"DOM"},{"word":"FTICR MS"},{"word":"NMR"},{"word":"Stream"},{"word":"WWTP"}]},"article348":{"pmid":"31381597","title":"The NDV-3A vaccine protects mice from multidrug resistant Candida auris infection.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Candida auris is an emerging, multi-drug resistant, health care-associated fungal pathogen. Its predominant prevalence in hospitals and nursing homes indicates its ability to adhere to and colonize the skin, or persist in an environment outside the host-a trait unique from other Candida species. Besides being associated globally with life-threatening disseminated infections, C. auris also poses significant clinical challenges due to its ability to adhere to polymeric surfaces and form highly drug-resistant biofilms. Here, we performed bioinformatic studies to identify the presence of adhesin proteins in C. auris, with sequence as well as 3-D structural homologies to the major adhesin/invasin of C. albicans, Als3. Anti-Als3p antibodies generated by vaccinating mice with NDV-3A (a vaccine based on the N-terminus of Als3 protein formulated with alum) recognized C. auris in vitro, blocked its ability to form biofilms and enhanced macrophage-mediated killing of the fungus. Furthermore, NDV-3A vaccination induced significant levels of C. auris cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immunosuppressed mice from lethal C. auris disseminated infection, compared to the control alum-vaccinated mice. The mechanism of protection is attributed to anti-Als3p antibodies and CD4+ T helper cells activating tissue macrophages. Finally, NDV-3A potentiated the protective efficacy of the antifungal drug micafungin, against C. auris candidemia. Identification of Als3-like adhesins in C. auris makes it a target for immunotherapeutic strategies using NDV-3A, a vaccine with known efficacy against other Candida species and safety as well as efficacy in clinical trials.

However, prosthesis loosening can happen and is related to two major mechanisms: (1) aseptic loosening due to prosthesis micromotion and/or corrosion and release of wear particles from the different components of the implanted material and (2) septic loosening due to chronic prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The aseptic character of prosthesis loosening has been challenged over the years, especially considering that bacteria can persist in biofilms and be overlooked during diagnosis. Histological studies on periprosthetic tissue samples reported that macrophages are the principle cells associated with aseptic loosening due to wear debris. They produce cytokines and favor an inflammatory environment that induces formation and activation of osteoclasts, leading to bone resorption and periprosthetic osteolysis. In PJIs, the presence of infiltrates of polymorphonuclear neutrophils is a major criterion for histological diagnosis. Neutrophils are colocalized with osteoclasts and zones of osteolysis. A similar inflammatory environment also develops, leading to bone resorption through osteoclasts. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis are the main staphylococci observed in PJIs. They share the common feature to form biofilm. For S. aureus and S. epidermidis, the interaction between biofilm and immunes cells (macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils) differs regarding the species. Indeed, the composition of extracellular matrix of biofilm seems to impact the interaction with immune cells. Recent papers also reported the major role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in biofilm-associated PJIs with S. aureus. These cells prevent lymphocyte infiltration and facilitate biofilm persistence. Moreover, the role of T lymphocytes is still unclear and potentially underestimates. In this review, after introducing the cellular mechanism of aseptic and septic loosening, we will focus on the interrelationships between staphylococcal biofilm, immune cells, and bone cells.","authors":[{"name":"Jérôme Josse"},{"name":"Florent Valour"},{"name":"Yousef Maali"},{"name":"Alan Diot"},{"name":"Cécile Batailler"},{"name":"Tristan Ferry"},{"name":"Frédéric Laurent"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"osteoblast"},{"word":"osteoclast"},{"word":"polymorphonuclear neutrophil"},{"word":"prosthesis loosening"},{"word":"prosthetic joint infection"}]},"article355":{"pmid":"31378975","title":"Supportive periodontal therapy in moderate-to-severe periodontitis patients: A two-year randomized clinical trial.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Evaluate supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) consisting of oral prophylaxis with oral hygiene instructions as sole intervention (test) or combined with subgingival instrumentation removing/disrupting the subgingival biofilm (control).","authors":[{"name":"Patrícia Daniela Melchiors Angst"},{"name":"Amanda Finger Stadler"},{"name":"Marina Mendez"},{"name":"Rui Vicente Oppermann"},{"name":"Ubele van der Velden"},{"name":"Sabrina Carvalho Gomes"}],"keywords":[{"word":"dental scaling"},{"word":"long-term care"},{"word":"maintenance"},{"word":"oral prophylaxis"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article356":{"pmid":"31378837","title":"Improvement of menaquinone-7 production by Bacillus subtilis natto in a novel residue-free medium by increasing the redox potential.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"Bacillus subtilis natto is a GRAS bacterium.

Biofilm-forming rhizobacteria, which harbor multifarious plant growth promoting traits and tolerance to abiotic stress, are believed to benefit plant health and production even under environmental stresses. The primary objective of this study was to investigate indigenous biofilm-forming rhizobacteria (Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus sp., Pantoea sp., Brevibacterium sp. and Acinetobacter sp.) for their functional diversity relevant to plant growth promoting activities, biofilm development and tolerance to abiotic stress conditions. The most promising isolates among FAP1, FAP2, FAP3, FAP4, FAP5, FAP10, FAB1, FAB3 and FAA1 were selected. Rhizobacteria exhibited high tolerance to salinity (1.5 M NaCl) and drought stress (up to 55% PEG-6000) conditions in vitro. The isolates demonstrated varying levels of PGP activities (IAA production and phosphate solubilization), biofilm development, and production of alginate and exopolysaccharides in the presence of salinity, drought stress and elevated temperature. Further efficacy of the isolates was demonstrated by inoculating to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants in greenhouse conditions under both normal and drought stress for up to 30 days inoculation. The plant growth potential of the isolates was in the order of FAP3 > FAB3 > FAB1 > FAP10 > FAP5 > FAP4 > FAA1 > FAP2 > FAP1.

Consequently, commonly taken measures for disease prevention cannot be exactly the same for other individuals. The chance for developing tooth decay in individuals is dependent on factors such as immune system and oral microbiome which itself is affected by the environmental and genetic determinants.

To overcome these challenges, investigators should search for early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. More than 700 bacterial species reside in the oral cavity. The oral microbiome population varies by saliva and different habitats of oral cavity. Tobacco, alcohol, and betel nut, which are causative factors of oral cancer, may alter the oral microbiome composition. Both pathogenic and commensal strains of bacteria have significantly contributed to oral cancer. Numerous bacterial species in the oral cavity are involved in chronic inflammation that lead to development of oral carcinogenesis. Bacterial products and its metabolic by-products may induce permanent genetic alterations in epithelial cells of the host that drive proliferation and/or survival of epithelial cells. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum induce production of inflammatory cytokines, cell proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis, cellular invasion, and migration thorough host cell genomic alterations. Recent advancement in metagenomic technologies may be useful in identifying oral cancer-related microbiome, their genomes, virulence properties, and their interaction with host immunity.

The GSE minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for S. aureus and E. coli were 25 μg/ml and 250 μg/ml, respectively. To investigate biofilm inhibition and degradation effect, crystal violet assay and stainless steel were used. Biofilm formation rates of four strains (S. aureus 7, S. aureus 8, E. coli ATCC 25922, and E. coli O157:H4 FRIK 125) were 55.8%, 70.2%, 55.4%, and 20.6% at 1/2 × MIC of GSE, respectively. The degradation effect of GSE on biofilms attached to stainless steel coupons was observed (≥ 1 log CFU/coupon) after exposure to concentrations above the MIC for all strains and 1/2 × MIC for S. aureus 7.

To find a novel drug to eradicate this pathogen, we tested taurine-5- bromosalicylaldehyde Schiff base (TBSSB) as an innovative anti-mycobacterial drug using Mycobacterium smegmatis as a surrogate model for M. tuberculosis. We investigated the antimicrobial activity of TBSSB against M. smegmatis by plotting growth curves, examined the effect of TBSSB on biofilm formation, observed morphological changes by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and detected differentially expressed proteins using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. TBSSB inhibited mycobacterial growth and biofilm formation, altered cell ultrastructure and intracellular content, and inhibited cell division. Furthermore, M. smegmatis adapted itself to TBSSB inhibition by regulating the metabolic pathways and enzymatic activities of the identified proteins. NDMA-dependent methanol dehydrogenase, NAD(P)H nitroreductase, and amidohydrolase AmiB1 appear to be pivotal factors to regulate the M. smegmatis survival under TBSSB. Our dataset reinforced the idea that Schiff base-taurine compounds have the potential to be developed as novel anti-mycobacterial drugs.","authors":[{"name":"Wenyong Ding"},{"name":"Houli Zhang"},{"name":"Yuefei Xu"},{"name":"Li Ma"},{"name":"Wenli Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium"},{"word":"cell wall"},{"word":"morphology"},{"word":"taurine-5-bromosalicylaldehyde Schiff base"},{"word":"tuberculosis"},{"word":"two dimensional gel electrophoresis"}]},"article392":{"pmid":"31370051","title":"3D bioprinting of mature bacterial biofilms for antimicrobial resistance drug testing.","date":"2020-02-28","abs":"The potential to bioprint and study 3D bacterial biofilm constructs could have great clinical significance at a time when antimicrobial resistance is rising to dangerously high levels worldwide.

Submerged plants and the microorganisms attached to their surfaces, however, have displayed great potential as a means of coping with such pollution. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the transport pathways of PTEs across sediment and organisms as well as their accumulation mechanisms in the presence of submerged plants and their biofilms. The majority of previous studies have demonstrated that submerged plants and their biofilms are indicators of PTE pollution in the aquatic environment, yet relatively little is known about PTE accumulation in epiphytic biofilms. In this review, we describe the transport pathways of PTEs in the aquatic environment in order to offer remarkable insights into bioaccumulation mechanisms in submerged plants and their biofilms. Based on the literature cited in this review, the roles of epiphytic biofilms in bioaccumulation and as an indicator of ecosystem health are discussed.","authors":[{"name":"Nan Geng"},{"name":"Yichao Wu"},{"name":"Ming Zhang"},{"name":"Daniel C W Tsang"},{"name":"Jörg Rinklebe"},{"name":"Yinfeng Xia"},{"name":"Debao Lu"},{"name":"Lifang Zhu"},{"name":"Kumuduni Niroshika Palansooriya"},{"name":"Ki-Hyun Kim"},{"name":"Yong Sik Ok"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bioaccumulation"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Indicator species"},{"word":"Potentially toxic element"},{"word":"Submerged plant"}]},"article394":{"pmid":"31369673","title":"An Updated Conceptual Model on the Pathogenesis of Bacterial Vaginosis.","date":"2019-10-23","abs":"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge. It is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, pelvic inflammatory disease, and an increased risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The epidemiology of BV supports sexual transmission. However, its etiology remains unknown. At the center of the debate is whether BV is caused by a primary pathogen or a polymicrobial consortium of microorganisms that are sexually transmitted. We previously published a conceptual model hypothesizing that BV is initiated by sexual transmission of Gardnerella vaginalis. Critics of this model have iterated that G. vaginalis is found in virginal women and in sexually active women with a normal vaginal microbiota. In addition, colonization does not always lead to BV. However, recent advances in BV pathogenesis research have determined the existence of 13 different species within the genus Gardnerella. It may be that healthy women are colonized by nonpathogenic Gardnerella species, whereas virulent strains are involved in BV development. Based on our results from a recent prospective study, in addition to an extensive literature review, we present an updated conceptual model for the pathogenesis of BV that centers on the roles of virulent strains of G. vaginalis, as well as Prevotella bivia and Atopobium vaginae.","authors":[{"name":"Christina A Muzny"},{"name":"Christopher M Taylor"},{"name":"W Edward Swords"},{"name":"Ashutosh Tamhane"},{"name":"Debasish Chattopadhyay"},{"name":"Nuno Cerca"},{"name":"Jane R Schwebke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Atopobium vaginae        "},{"word":"          Gardnerella vaginalis        "},{"word":"          Prevotella bivia        "},{"word":" Bacterial vaginosis"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article395":{"pmid":"31369262","title":"From Phenylthiazoles to Phenylpyrazoles: Broadening the Antibacterial Spectrum toward Carbapenem-Resistant Bacteria.","date":"2019-09-12","abs":"The narrow antibacterial spectrum of phenylthiazole antibiotics was expanded by replacing central thiazole with a pyrazole ring while maintaining its other pharmacophoric features.

Our results showed that BOP has strong anti-inflammatory effects and acts by reducing nuclear factor κB activation, tumor necrosis factor α release, and neutrophil migration. In addition, BOP6 exhibited antifungal activity on planktonic and biofilm cultures of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, and Candida parapsisolis and reduced in vitro yeast cell adhesion to human keratinocytes at sub-inhibitory concentrations. BOP demonstrated significantly low toxicity in Galleria melonella larvae at antifungal doses. Lastly, a chemical analysis revealed the presence of caffeoyltartaric acid, 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, quercetin, and gibberellins A7, A9, and A20, which may be responsible for the biological properties observed.

A step-by-step approach was used to determine the technological properties of the isolated yeast strains. The enzymatic activity (catalase, urease, β-glucosidase, protease, and lipase) under adverse conditions (pH, salt, and temperature) were evaluated. Principal component analysis was used to assess data. Twenty-five strains with desirable technological properties were selected for evaluation of probiotic traits (tolerance at pH 2.5 and 0.3% bile salts, antimicrobial activity, hydrophobic properties, and biofilm production). These isolates were identified by sequencing the D1/D2 region of 26S rDNA. Finally, seven isolates with desirable probiotic traits were analyzed for their ability to survive through gastric transit using a gastrointestinal simulation model. An In vitro test showed that isolates 3, 12, 19, 24, and 43 exhibited high survival levels (60%-70%), similar to those of the indicator strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The results suggest that five isolates (S. cerevisiae strains 3, 12, 19, 24, and 43) showed desirable technological properties and probiotic traits and therefore can be used as functional starter cultures to produce fermented fish products. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Researchers have investigated the activity of LAB as functional and probiotic microorganisms; however, information on the probiotic potential of yeasts remains limited. Yeasts are microorganisms that present and induce biochemical changes in several fermented meat and fish products. In the present study, the technological and probiotic properties of 52 isolates from Suan yu were investigated to identify potential probiotic strains for starter cultures. Our results suggest that five isolated S. cerevisiae strains showed desirable technological properties and probiotic traits and therefore can be used as functional starter cultures to produce fermented fish products, and other fermented foods. Functional yeast isolates are used to effectively improve the quality of fermented fish products for consumer acceptance. This study has focused on the possibility to produce a functional Suan yu using a potential probiotic S. cerevisiae as starter culture to enhance health benefits.","authors":[{"name":"Xuefeng Zeng"},{"name":"Jin Fan"},{"name":"Laping He"},{"name":"Zhenhua Duan"},{"name":"Wenshui Xia"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Suan yu"},{"word":"multivariate analyses"},{"word":"probiotic"},{"word":"yeasts"}]},"article398":{"pmid":"31368351","title":"Inactivation of oral biofilms using visible light and water-filtered infrared A radiation and indocyanine green.","date":"2019-09-10","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Thomas Burchard"},{"name":"Lamprini Karygianni"},{"name":"Elmar Hellwig"},{"name":"Marie Follo"},{"name":"Thomas Wrbas"},{"name":"Annette Wittmer"},{"name":"Kirstin Vach"},{"name":"Ali Al-Ahmad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ICG"},{"word":"VIS+wIRA"},{"word":"aPDT"},{"word":"antimicrobial photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"indocyanine green"},{"word":"oral biofilm"},{"word":"visible light and water-filtered infrared A"}]},"article399":{"pmid":"31368074","title":"Optimized aeration strategies for nitrogen removal efficiency: application of end gas recirculation aeration in the fixed bed biofilm reactor.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Aeration strategy played an important role in reactor performance.
