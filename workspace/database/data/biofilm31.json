This study reports a novel one-step biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles using phytocompound, hordenine (HD), as a reducing and capping agent. The synthesis of the anisotropic hordenine-fabricated gold nanoparticles (HD-AuNPs) with an average particle size of 136.87 nm was achieved within 12 h of incubation at room temperature. Both HD and HD-AuNPs exhibited significant antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa PAO1, although greater biofilm inhibition was observed for the nanoparticles as compared to hordenine alone. In the microtitre plate assay and tube method, the nanoparticles significantly inhibited the biofilm formation by 73.69 and 78.41%, respectively. The exopolysaccharide production by the test pathogen was arrested by 68.46% on treatment with the nanoparticles. Further, the effect of HD and HD-AuNPs on the biofilm architecture of P. aeruginosa was revealed by light and confocal laser-scanning microscopy micrographs. The overall results of this study suggested the synergistic antibiofilm effect of AuNPs and HD for the treatment of chronic bacterial infections caused by biofilms forming pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Jobina Rajkumari"},{"name":"Himani Meena"},{"name":"Muralitharan Gangatharan"},{"name":"Siddhardha Busi"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"29155125","title":"Virulence characteristics and molecular relatedness of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus harboring different staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec.","date":"2018-07-20","abs":"Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a versatile pathogen capable of causing multitude of human diseases.

We hypothesized that biofilm formation might be more pronounced in the contagious GTB isolates compared with other genotypes affecting individual animals. Twenty-four dairy isolates, including 9 MRSA, were further characterized by genotyping by using ribosomal spacer PCR, spa typing, biofilm formation under static and dynamic conditions, and scanning electron microscopy. The GTB isolates (n = 6) were more able to form biofilms than other genotypes at 37°C and at 20°C after 48 and 72 h of incubation in the static assay using polystyrene microtiter plates. This result was supported by scanning electron micrographs showing a GTB isolate producing strong biofilm with extracellular matrix in contrast to a genotype C isolate. Furthermore, none of the MRSA isolates formed strong biofilms in the static assay. However, some MRSA produced low or moderate amounts of biofilm depending on the applied conditions. Under dynamic conditions, a much more diverse situation was observed. The ability of GTB isolates to be strong biofilm formers was not observed in all cases, emphasizing the importance of growth conditions for the expression of biofilm-related genes. No specific genotype, spa type, or MRSA isolate could be categorized significantly into one level of biofilm formation.

K.pneumoniae has a variety of virulence factors, especially capsule polysaccharide, hypermucoviscosity (HV), fimbriae, toxins and determinants for iron acquisition. The aim of this study was to detect the virulence factors in K.pneumoniae strains isolated from nosocomial infections in two years. Fifty three K.pneumoniae strains isolated from the samples of patients with nosocomial infections in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine Hospital between 2011 and 2013 were included in the study. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates were performed by VITEK 2 automatic system. Biofilm formation,α-hemolysin, capsule and HV were investigated by phenotypic methods. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect virulence genes encoding adhesins (fimH-1, mrkD, kpn, ycfM), siderophores (entB: enterobactin, iutA: aerobactin, irp-1, irp-2, ybtS, fyuA: yersiniabactin, iroN: catechols receptor), protectines or invasins (rmpA, magA, traT) and toxins (hlyA, cnf-1). Of the 53 K.pneumoniae isolates,12 (22.6%) were isolated from in patients of reanimation intensive care unit, 8 (15.1%) medical oncology, 7 (13.2%) newborn intensive care unit and 26 (49%) other clinics. The distribution of the isolates according to the samples was as follows: urine (n= 14), blood (n= 13), wound (n= 8), drainage fluid (n= 10), broncho-alveolar lavage (n= 7), and cerebrospinal fluid (n= 1). Isolates which were resistant to meropenem were 5.7% and production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was 71.7%. The capsule, biofilm formation, and HV were observed in 100%, 79.2%, and 1.9% of the isolates, respectively. Production of α-hemolysin was not detected in any of the isolates. The genes; entB (96.2%), ycfM (86.8%), and mrkD (83.0%) showed high prevalence. The other genes were detected in different ratios: fimH-1 (64.2%), fyuA (54.7%), kpn (49.1%), ybtS (41.5%), irp-1(41.5%), irp-2 (37.7%), traT (11.3%) and iutA (5.7%). Virulence genes; iroN, rmpA, magA, hlyA and cnf-1 were not detected in any of the isolates. Enterobactin had the highest rate among siderophores, and ycfM and mrkD in adhesins. The capsule and biofilm formation were commonly found in the isolates. Hypermucoviscosity was only found in one isolate but associated genes were not detected. Alfa hemolysin production and hlyA gene were not determined. As a result, it seems that the basis of the pathogenicity of K.pneumoniae strains isolated from nosocomial infections are capsule, adhesins, enterobactin and ability of biofilm formation. There is a need for new studies for the continuous monitoring of toxin and invasion ability as well as antibiotic resistance in the control of hospital infection caused by K.pneumoniae.","authors":[{"name":"Halit Kuş"},{"name":"Uğur Arslan"},{"name":"Hatice Türk Dağı"},{"name":"Duygu Fındık"}],"keywords":[]},"article8":{"pmid":"29152799","title":"Molecular basis for the differential expression of the global regulator VieA in Vibrio cholerae biotypes directed by H-NS, LeuO and quorum sensing.","date":"2019-02-01","abs":"VieA is a cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterase that modulates biofilm development and motility in Vibrio cholerae O1 of the classical biotype. vieA is part of an operon encoding the VieSAB signal transduction pathway that is nearly silent in V. cholerae of the El Tor biotype.

In El Tor biotype vibrios, transcription of vieSAB is repressed by the quorum sensing regulator HapR, which is absent in classical biotype strains. Restoring HapR expression in classical biotype V. cholerae repressed vieSAB transcription by binding to its promoter.

The homozygous gtr1/gtr1 mutant exhibited enhanced flocculation phenotypes and, similar to the rhb1/rhb1 mutant, exhibited enhanced biofilm formation on plastic surfaces.

Pneumococci can undergo a spontaneous and reversible phase variation that is reflected in colony opacity and which allows the population to adapt to different host environments. Generally, transparent variants are adapted for nasopharyngeal colonization, whereas opaque variants are associated with invasive disease. In recent work, colony phase variation was shown to occur by means of recombination events to generate multiple alleles of the hsdS targeting domain of a DNA methylase complex, which mediates epigenetic changes in gene expression. A panel of isogenic strains were created in the well-studied S. pneumoniae TIGR4 background that are locked in the transparent (n = 4) or opaque (n = 2) colony phenotype. The strains had significant differences in colony size which were stable over multiple passages in vitro and in vivo. While there were no significant differences in adherence for the phase-locked mutant strains to immortalized epithelial cells, biofilm formation and viability were reduced for the opaque variants in static assays. Nasopharyngeal colonization was stable for all strains, but the mortality rates differed between them. Transcript profiling by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses revealed that the expression levels of certain virulence factors were increased in a phase-specific manner. As epigenetic regulation of phase variation (often referred to as phasevarion) is emerging as a common theme for mucosal pathogens, these results serve as a model for future studies of host-pathogen interactions.

Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is one such communication system employed by Gram-negative bacteria. In addition to CDI mediation of growth inhibition, recent studies have demonstrated CDI-mediated control of communal behaviors such as biofilm formation. We postulated that CDI may therefore play an active role in host-pathogen interactions, allowing invading strains to establish themselves at polymicrobial mucosal interfaces through competitive interactions while simultaneously facilitating pathogenic capabilities via CDI-mediated signaling. Here, we show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces two CDI systems capable of mediating competition under conditions of growth on a surface or in liquid. Furthermore, we demonstrated a novel role for these systems in contributing to virulence in acute infection models, likely via posttranscriptional regulation of beneficial behaviors. While we did not observe any role for the P. aeruginosa CDI systems in biofilm biogenesis, we did identify for the first time robust CDI-mediated competition during interaction with a mammalian host using a model of chronic respiratory tract infection, as well as evidence that CDI expression is maintained in chronic lung infections. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for CDI in host-pathogen interactions and emphasize their importance during infection.

Moreover, we demonstrate that the Ml proteins studied form higher-order oligomers through their N-terminal region and that the same AT-rich site is recognized by MucR from Brucella abortus using a similar mechanism involving contacts with the minor groove of DNA and oligomerization.","authors":[{"name":"Ilaria Baglivo"},{"name":"Luciano Pirone"},{"name":"Emilia Maria Pedone"},{"name":"Joshua Edison Pitzer"},{"name":"Lidia Muscariello"},{"name":"Maria Michela Marino"},{"name":"Gaetano Malgieri"},{"name":"Andrea Freschi"},{"name":"Angela Chambery"},{"name":"Roy-Martin Roop Ii"},{"name":"Paolo Vincenzo Pedone"}],"keywords":[]},"article22":{"pmid":"29150517","title":"Multi-omics Reveals the Lifestyle of the Acidophilic, Mineral-Oxidizing Model Species Leptospirillum ferriphilum","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Leptospirillum ferriphilum plays a major role in acidic, metal-rich environments, where it represents one of the most prevalent iron oxidizers.

A cheZ gene has been found in Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571, in contrast to other rhizobial species studied so far. The CheZ protein in strain ORS571 has a conserved motif similar to that corresponding to the phosphatase active site in E. coli The construction of a cheZ deletion mutant strain and of cheZ mutant strains carrying a mutation in residues of the putative phosphatase active site showed that strain ORS571 participates in chemotaxis and motility, causing a hyperreversal behavior. In addition, the properties of the cheZ deletion mutant revealed that ORS571 CheZ is involved in other physiological processes, since it displayed increased flocculation, biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, and host root colonization. In particular, it was observed that the expression of several exp genes, involved in EPS synthesis, was upregulated in the cheZ mutant compared to that in the wild type, suggesting that CheZ negatively controls exp gene expression through an unknown mechanism. It is proposed that CheZ influences the Azorhizobium-plant association by negatively regulating early colonization via the regulation of EPS production.

A mutant strain of Pseudomonas putida S12 was used a model bacterium and either capacitive or resistive electrical circuits and two flow regimes, flow-through and cross-flow filtration, were studied. Major emphasis was placed on AC due to its ability of repulsing and inactivating bacteria. AC voltage at 1.5 V, 1 kHz frequency and wave pulse above offset (+0.45) with 100Ω external resistance on the ground side prevented almost completely attachment of bacteria (>98.5%) with concomitant high inactivation (95.3 ± 2.5%) in flow-through regime. AC resulted more effective than DC, both in terms of biofouling reduction compared to cathodic DC and in terms of cell inactivation compared to anodic DC. Although similar trends were observed, a net reduced extent of prevention of bacterial attachment and inactivation was observed in filtration as compared to flow-through regime, which is mainly attributed to the permeate drag force, also supported by theoretical calculations in DC in capacitive mode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis suggests a pure resistor behavior in resistance mode compared to involvement of redox reactions in capacitance mode, as source for bacteria detachment and inactivation. Although further optimization is required, electrically polarized CNT membranes offer a viable antibiofouling strategy to hinder biofouling and simplify membrane care during filtration.","authors":[{"name":"Chidambaram Thamaraiselvan"},{"name":"Avner Ronen"},{"name":"Sofia Lerman"},{"name":"Moran Balaish"},{"name":"Yair Ein-Eli"},{"name":"Carlos G Dosoretz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alternating current"},{"word":"Bacterial attachment"},{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Cell inactivation"},{"word":"Self-supported CNT membrane"}]},"article45":{"pmid":"29144785","title":"Role of slough and biofilm in delaying healing in chronic wounds.","date":"2019-07-15","abs":"The management of biofilms with maintenance desloughing and antimicrobial therapy is fast becoming the accepted treatment strategy for chronic wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Heather Newton"},{"name":"Jacky Edwards"},{"name":"Louise Mitchell"},{"name":"Steven L Percival"}],"keywords":[]},"article48":{"pmid":"29144777","title":"UrgoClean Ag: evidence base and mode of action.","date":"2019-07-15","abs":"UrgoClean Ag is indicated for all exuding wounds with signs of increased bioburden and biofilm.

Cryo-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed nZVI aggregates close to bacteria, but it was not possible to confirm direct interactions between nZVI and cell membranes. Scanning transmission electron microscopy in the SEM (STEM-in-SEM) showed that nZVI aggregates could enter the biofilm to a depth of 7-11 µm. Bacteria were surrounded by a ring of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) preventing direct nZVI/membrane interactions.

The growth profiles and viability assays indicated that GO exhibited a high antibacterial activity, of which the negative effects on bacteria growth raised with the increasing GO concentration. The antibacterial activity of GO was mainly attributed to the membrane stress and ROS-independent oxidative stress. Moreover, it was worthy to note that the biofilm formation was enhanced in the presence of GO at low dosage whereas inhibited in the high-concentration GO environment. These results could be explained by the roles of the dead cells, which were inactivated by GO. When the concentration of GO was limited, only a part of the cells would be inactivated, which may then serve as a protection barrier as well as the necessary nutrient to the remaining living cells for the formation of biofilm. In contrast, with a sufficient presence of GO, almost all cells can be inactivated completely and thus the formation of biofilm could no longer be triggered.

Biofilm formers can withstand severe conditions and the host's defense system. Therefore, it is necessary to search for effective biofilm inhibitors. In this study, we investigated the effect of a chloroform extract of turmeric on biofilm formation against antibiotic resistant bacteria. The extract exhibited its antibiofilm effect by altering adherence, motility, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production and cell surface hydrophobicity; important attributes of biofilm formation. Cell attachment assays indicated that a chloroform extract resulted in a 38.9-60.2% inhibition of cell adherence to a polystyrene surface, and a 44.5-58.3% inhibition to a glass surface. Static biofilm formation assays indicated that a chloroform extract resulted in a 23-74.5% reduction in biofilm formation. The chloroform extract inhibited flagella-directed swarming and swimming motility and pilus-directed twitching motility in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to repression of motility, a chloroform extract also significantly (p < 0.05) altered the hydrophobic behavior, and bacterial strains such as K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae exhibited hydrophilic behavior after the addition of the extract, as compared with control cells. The presence of the extract also significantly (p < 0.05) increased the detachment of biofilms by a surfactant as compared with controls. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) had indicated a loss of vital functional groups of polysaccharides and proteins from the EPS of cells treated with a chloroform extract. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicated the presence of many phytochemical constituents, mainly sesquiterpenes and fatty acid groups.

The in-depth analysis of the antimicrobial mechanism confirmed that the conjugates can quickly bind on the bacterial surface, irreversibly disrupt the bacterial membrane, and distinctly inhibit intracellular enzyme activity, ultimately leading to the bacterial death. Importantly, these conjugates are highly selective toward bacterial cells over mammalian cells as well as no cytotoxicity to A549 cells and no discernible hemolytic activity.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The supernatants of S. mutans, S. sanguinis, and P. gingivalis suspension were combined with BHI broth. After 24 h, the live P. gingivalis number was calculated by colony counting and the biofilm was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. To test the adhesive ability of S. mutans and S. sanguinis on different dental materials, the biofilm was formed on different dental materials and then the bacterial number was calculated by using a Spectramax 250 microplate reader at OD 550, and the adhesive ability of S. mutans and S. sanguinis on different dental materials was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS The growth and biofilm formation of P. gingivalis was significantly inhibited by S. mutans and S. sanguinis supernatants (P<0.05).

Biofilm formation by a knockout mutant of arcR, encoding an arginine-dependent regulator of transcription, was reduced to < 50% that of the wild-type whereas other strains were unaffected.

This situation is leading to significantly reduced therapeutic potential of a huge proportion of antimicrobial agents currently used in clinical settings. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) could provide the medical community with an alternative strategy to traditional antibiotics for combating microbial resistance. However, the development of AMPs into clinically useful antibiotics is hampered by their relatively low stability, toxicity, and high manufacturing costs. In this study, a novel in-house-designed potent ultrashort AMP named RBRBR was encapsulated into chitosan-based nanoparticles (CS-NPs) based on the ionotropic gelation method. The encapsulation efficacy reported for RBRBR into CS-NPs was 51.33%, with a loading capacity of 10.17%. The release kinetics of RBRBR from the nanocarrier exhibited slow release followed by progressive linear release for 14 days. The antibacterial kinetics of RBRBR-CS-NPs was tested against four strains of Staphylococcus aureus for 4 days, and the developed RBRBR-CS-NPs exhibited a 3-log decrease in the number of colonies when compared to CS-NP and a 5-log decrease when compared to control bacteria. The encapsulated peptide NP formulation managed to limit the toxicity of the free peptide against both mammalian cells and human erythrocytes. Additionally, the peptide NPs demonstrated up to 98% inhibition of biofilm formation when tested against biofilm-forming bacteria.

Further, they allowed a sustained release of econazole nitrate, maintaining the antifungal activity against C. albicans planktonic culture. Notably, biosurfactant-based vesicles were significantly more active than free econazole in the eradication of Candida biofilm. In conclusion, mixed vesicles are promising new vaginal delivery systems for the potential employment in the treatment of chronic infections.","authors":[{"name":"Angela Abruzzo"},{"name":"Barbara Giordani"},{"name":"Carola Parolin"},{"name":"Beatrice Vitali"},{"name":"Michele Protti"},{"name":"Laura Mercolini"},{"name":"Martina Cappelletti"},{"name":"Stefano Fedi"},{"name":"Federica Bigucci"},{"name":"Teresa Cerchiara"},{"name":"Barbara Luppi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"Biosurfactant"},{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"Lactobacillus"},{"word":"Mixed vesicles"},{"word":"Vaginal delivery"}]},"article72":{"pmid":"29138082","title":"Synthesis of chitosan-alginate microspheres with high antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against multi-drug resistant microbial pathogens.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The successful treatment of multi-drug resistant microbial pathogens represents a major challenge for public health management.

Coexistence of S. mutans with C. albicans can cause dental caries progression or recurrence of the disease in the future. Fifty-nine children with diagnosed early childhood caries (ECC) were recruited onto the study. The condition of the children's dentition was defined according to the World Health Organization guidelines. The participants were divided into children with initial enamel demineralization and children showing dentin damage. The study was performed on the S. mutans and C. albicans clinical strains, isolated from dental plaque of patients with ECC. The effect of a probiotic containing Lactobacillus salivarius on the ability of S. mutans and C. albicans to produce a double-species biofilm was investigated in an in vitro model. The biomass of the formed/non-degraded biofilm was analyzed on the basis of its crystal violet staining. The number of colonies of S. mutans and C. albicans (CFU/mL, colony forming units/mL) forming the biofilm was determined. Microorganism morphology in the biofilm was evaluated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In vitro analysis demonstrated that the presence of S. mutans increased the number of C. albicans colonies (CFU/mL); the double-species biofilm mass and hyphal forms produced in it by the yeast. L. salivarius inhibited the cariogenic biofilm formation of C. albicans and S. mutans. Under the influence of the probiotic; the biofilm mass and the number of S. mutans; C. albicans and S. mutans with C. albicans colonies in the biofilm was decreased. Moreover; it can be noted that after the addition of the probiotic; fungi did not form hyphae or germ tubes of pathogenic potential. These results suggest that L. salivarius can secrete intermediates capable of inhibiting the formation of cariogenic S. mutans and C. albicans biofilm; and may inhibit fungal morphological transformation and thereby reduce the pathogenicity of C. albicans; weakening its pathogenic potential.

Measurements of their metabolic activity showed that CD101 (0.25 or 1 μg/ml) significantly prevented adhesion-phase cells from developing into mature biofilms (P = 0.0062 or 0.0064, respectively) and eradicated preformed mature biofilms (P = 0.04 or 0.01, respectively) compared to those of untreated controls.

The sarA locus consists of three overlapping transcripts generated from three distinct promoters, all containing the sarA open reading frame (ORF). The 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of these transcripts contain three separate regions ∼711, 409, and 146 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the sarA translation start, the functions of which remain unknown. Recent transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis and subsequent characterization indicated that two sRNAs, teg49 and teg48, are processed and likely produced from the sarA P3 and sarA P1 transcripts of the sarA locus, respectively. In this report, we utilized a variety of sarA promoter mutants and cshA and rnc mutants to ascertain the contributions of these factors to the generation of teg49. We also defined the transcriptional regulon of teg49, including virulence genes not regulated by SarA. Phenotypically, teg49 did not impact biofilm formation or affect overall SarA expression significantly. Comparative analyses of RNA-Seq data between the wild-type, teg49 mutant, and sarA mutant strains indicated that ∼133 genes are significantly upregulated while 97 are downregulated in a teg49 deletion mutant in a sarA-independent manner. An abscess model of skin infection indicated that the teg49 mutant exhibited a reduced bacterial load compared to the wild-type S. aureus Overall, these results suggest that teg49 sRNA has a regulatory role in target gene regulation independent of SarA.

Unfortunately, it appears Fewtrell et al. were unaware that studies of silver nanoparticle and silver ion elution from ceramic filters manufactured and used in developing countries have already been completed. These existing studies have found that: 1) silver ions, not silver nanoparticles, are eluted from ceramic filters treated with silver nanoparticles or silver nitrate; and, 2) silver ions have not been shown to be genotoxic. Thus, the existing recommendation of applying silver nanoparticles to ceramic filters to prevent biofilm formation within the filter and improve microbiological efficacy should still be adhered to, as there is no identified risk to people who drink water from ceramic filters treated with silver nanoparticles or silver nitrate.

Tests were carried out both in a phosphate buffer, as well as triptic soy broth (TSB) of high ionic strength. Bacterial cell density distribution at the Nafion-liquid interface was visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy.

Results revealed an exclusion zone (EZ) of 40-60μm and a transition zone (TZ) of 40-80μm for bacterial cells suspended in tryptic soy broth. There were no statistical differences in the size of EZ and TZ for the bacterial strains tested with the same substrate, but differences existed for different substrates tested, implying a physicochemical underpinning for EZ. In a test conducted with E. coli, cells progressively penetrated EZ over 2days. Furthermore, EZ-bearing Nafion had 80% less biomass accumulation of E. coli over 2days compared to an EZ-less, hydrophilic, smooth aluminum oxide surface.

In this study, we have investigated the effect of an applied potential on the formation and electroactivity of biofilms established by Shewanella oneidensis bacteria on graphite felt electrodes in single- and double-chamber reactor configurations in oxic conditions. Using amperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and OCP/Power/Polarization curves techniques, we showed that a potential ranging between -0.3V and +0.5V (vs. Ag/AgCl/KCl sat.) and its converse application to a couple of electrodes leads to different electrochemical behaviors, anodic currents and biofilm architectures. For example, when the bacteria were confined in the anodic compartment of a double-chamber cell, a negative applied potential (-0.3V) at the bioanode favors a mediated electron transfer correlated with the progressive formation of a biofilm that fills the felt porosity and bridges the graphite fibers. In contrast, a positive applied potential (+0.3V) at the bioanode stimulates a direct electron transfer resulting in the fast-bacterial colonization of the fibers only. These results provide significant insight for the understanding of the complex bacteria-electrode interactions in microbial fuel cells.","authors":[{"name":"David Pinto"},{"name":"Thibaud Coradin"},{"name":"Christel Laberty-Robert"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteria/carbon interface"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Microbial fuel cell"},{"word":"Polarization"},{"word":"Shewanella oneidensis"}]},"article95":{"pmid":"29131752","title":"Surfactants and their role in wound cleansing and biofilm management.","date":"2019-07-10","abs":"Surfactants are widely used as detergents, emulsifiers, wetting agents, foaming agents and dispersants in the cosmetics, hygiene, food and oil industries.

These molecules mediate a variety of population-dependent responses including the expression of genes that regulate bioluminescence, type III secretion, siderophore production, colony morphology, biofilm formation, and metalloprotease production. Given their central role in regulating these responses, the detection and quantification of QS molecules have important practical implications. Until recently, the detection of QS molecules from Gram-negative bacteria has relied primarily on bacterial reporter systems. These bioassays though immensely useful are subject to interference by compounds that affect bacterial growth and metabolism. In addition, the reporter response is highly dependent on culture age and cell population density.

It is usually assumed that bacterial adhesion occurs from air or by convective-diffusion from a liquid suspension, but often bacteria adhere by transmission from a bacterially contaminated donor to a receiver surface. Therewith bacterial transmission is mechanistically different from adhesion, as it involves bacterial detachment from a donor surface followed by adhesion to a receiver one. Transmission is further complicated when the donor surface is not covered with a single layer of adhering bacteria but with a multi-layered biofilm, in which case bacteria can be transmitted either by interfacial failure at the biofilm-donor surface or through cohesive failure in the biofilm. Transmission through cohesive failure in a biofilm is more common than interfacial failure. The aim of this review is to oppose surface thermodynamics and adhesion force analyses, as can both be applied towards bacterial adhesion, with their appropriate extensions towards transmission. Opposition of surface thermodynamics and adhesion force analyses, will allow to distinguish between transmission of bacteria from a donor covered with a (sub)monolayer of adhering bacteria or a multi-layered biofilm. Contact angle measurements required for surface thermodynamic analyses of transmission are of an entirely different nature than analyses of adhesion forces, usually measured through atomic force microscopy. Nevertheless, transmission probabilities based on Weibull analyses of adhesion forces between bacteria and donor and receiver surfaces, correspond with the surface thermodynamic preferences of bacteria for either the donor or receiver surface. Surfaces with low adhesion forces such as polymer-brush coated or nanostructured surfaces are thus preferable for use as non-adhesive receiver surfaces, but at the same time should be avoided for use as a donor surface. Since bacterial transmission occurs under a contact pressure between two surfaces, followed by their separation under tensile or shear pressure and ultimately detachment, this will affect biofilm structure. During the compression phase of transmission, biofilms are compacted into a more dense film. After transmission, and depending on the ability of the bacterial strain involved to produce extracellular polymeric substances, biofilm left-behind on a donor or transmitted to a receiver surface will relax to its original, pre-transmission structure owing to the viscoelasticity of the extracellular polymeric substances matrix, when present. Apart from mechanistic differences between bacterial adhesion and transmission, the low numbers of bacteria generally transmitted require careful selection of suitably sensitive enumeration methods, for which culturing and optical coherence tomography are suggested. Opposing adhesion and transmission as done in this review, not only yields a better understanding of bacterial transmission, but may stimulate researchers to more carefully consider whether an adhesion or transmission model is most appropriate in the specific area of application aimed for, rather than routinely relying on adhesion models.","authors":[{"name":"Niar Gusnaniar"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Wenwen Qu"},{"name":"Titik Nuryastuti"},{"name":"Johanna M M Hooymans"},{"name":"Jelmer Sjollema"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adhesion force"},{"word":"Bacterial detachment"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"Surface free energy"},{"word":"Viscoelasticity"}]},"article106":{"pmid":"29129053","title":"Research on Chemical Composition and Biological Properties Including Antiquorum Sensing Activity of Angelica pancicii Vandas Aerial Parts and Roots.","date":"2018-01-10","abs":"The essential oil, different extracts, and isolated compounds of Angelica pancicii Vandas (Apiaceae) were investigated for the first time.

A significant increase in the rates of heteroresistance to imipenem and meropenem was observed during the study period. Mechanistic analysis revealed that efflux system overexpression and decreased OprD could have contributed to carbapenem heteroresistance in P. aeruginosa. It was also observed that all of the subpopulations produced enhanced levels of biofilm compared with their native strains. Moreover, previous carbapenem exposure was identified as a common independent risk factor for imipenem-heteroresistant (IPM-HR) and meropenem-heteroresistant (MEM-HR) isolates, but patients infected with MEM-HR isolates were at higher risk of poor outcomes than those with IPM-HR isolates. Most importantly, there was a remarkable increase in the prescription of carbapenems during the study period, which was demonstrated to correlate significantly with the quarterly increasing prevalence of IPM-HR and MEM-HR isolates, respectively.

In addition, using a quantitative approach, we reveal striking differences in surface complexity and hydrophobicity of the evolved colony types. Interestingly, one of the morphotypes completely lost the ability of independent biofilm formation and evolved to hitchhike with other morphotypes with improved biofilm forming abilities. Genome comparison suggests that major phenotypic transformations between the morphotypes can be triggered by subtle genetic differences.

This pore water system may represent a natural bioreactor where anoxic and oxic biotransformation process act in synergy to reduce or even eliminate contaminant fluxes to surface water.

We conceptualise anoxic-oxic interface development for metabolic and co-metabolic mineralisation by a range of aerobic bacteria with a focus on vinyl chloride degradation pathways. The superimposition of microbial metabolic processes occurring in sediment biofilms and bulk solute transport delivering reactants produces a scale dependence in contaminant transformation rates. Process interpretation is often confounded by the natural geological heterogeneity typical of most riverbed environments.

It is also unclear how the ecological dynamics of phages and their hosts depend on the biological and physical properties of the biofilm environment. To make headway in this area, we develop a biofilm simulation framework that captures key mechanistic features of biofilm growth and phage infection. Using these simulations, we find that the equilibrium state of interaction between biofilms and phages is governed largely by nutrient availability to biofilms, infection likelihood per host encounter and the ability of phages to diffuse through biofilm populations. Interactions between the biofilm matrix and phage particles are thus likely to be of fundamental importance, controlling the extent to which bacteria and phages can coexist in natural contexts.

Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a well-characterized antiseptic agent used in dentistry with broad spectrum activity. However, its application is limited due to inactivation in body fluid and cytotoxicity toward human cells, particularly at high concentrations. To overcome these limitations, we synthesized nanosystems composed of aminosilane-coated magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with chlorhexidine (MNP@CHX). In the presence of human saliva, MNPs@CHX displayed significantly greater bactericidal and fungicidal activity against planktonic and biofilm-forming microorganisms than free CHX. In addition, CHX attached to MNPs has an increased ability to restrict the growth of mixed-species biofilms compared to free CHX. The observed depolarization of mitochondria in fungal cells treated with MNP@CHX suggests that induction of oxidative stress and oxidation of fungal structures may be a part of the mechanism responsible for pathogen killing. Nanoparticles functionalized by CHX did not affect host cell proliferation or their ability to release the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-8. The use of MNPs as a carrier of CHX has great potential for the development of antiseptic nanosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Grażyna Tokajuk"},{"name":"Katarzyna Niemirowicz"},{"name":"Piotr Deptuła"},{"name":"Ewelina Piktel"},{"name":"Mateusz Cieśluk"},{"name":"Agnieszka Z Wilczewska"},{"name":"Jan R Dąbrowski"},{"name":"Robert Bucki"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"antimicrobial properties"},{"word":"chlorhexidine"},{"word":"magnetic nanoparticles"}]},"article136":{"pmid":"29122674","title":"Antibiofilm activity of nanoemulsions of Cymbopogon flexuosus against rapidly growing mycobacteria.","date":"2018-07-20","abs":"Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) are opportunistic microorganisms that can cause both local and disseminated infections. When in biofilm, these pathogens become highly resistant to antimicrobials used in clinical practice. Composed abundantly of polymeric substances, biofilms delay the diffusion of antimicrobials, preventing the drug from penetrating the deeper layers and having an effective action. Therefore, the search for new and alternative therapeutic options has become of fundamental importance. Natural products fall into these options, especially essential oils. However, these oils present problems, such as low miscibility in water (which decreases its bioavailability) and degradation by light and temperature. Thus, the objective of this work was to explore the action of free essential oil and nanoemulsions of Cymbopogon flexuosus on strains of RGM, in planktonic and sessile forms. In this work, standard strains of Mycobacterium fortuitum (ATCC 6841), Mycobacterium massiliense (ATCC 48898) and Mycobacterium abscessus (ATCC 19977) were used. The susceptibility of the microorganisms in planktonic form was obtained by conventional microdilution techniques and by cell viability curve. The analysis of the antibiofilm activity was performed by a semi-quantitative macrotechnique. The nanoemulsion exhibited significant antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentration values lower than those presented by the free essential oil, against strains in the planktonic state. However, both were efficient in destroying the already formed biofilm, whereas only the free oil inhibited the formation of mycobacterial biofilm. This study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of C. flexuosus essential oil, especially in its nanostructured form, which can be demonstrated against infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Grazielle Guidolin Rossi"},{"name":"Kevim Bordignon Guterres"},{"name":"Pauline Cordenonsi Bonez"},{"name":"Samanta da Silva Gundel"},{"name":"Vanessa Albertina Aggertt"},{"name":"Fallon Santos Siqueira"},{"name":"Aline Ferreira Ourique"},{"name":"Roger Wagnerd"},{"name":"Bruna Klein"},{"name":"Roberto Christ Vianna Santos"},{"name":"Marli Matiko Anraku de Campos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Cymbopogon flexuosus"},{"word":"Nanoemulsion"},{"word":"RGM"}]},"article137":{"pmid":"29122410","title":"Non-compliance with IDSA guidelines for patients presenting with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus prosthetic joint infection is a risk factor for treatment failure.","date":"2019-05-28","abs":"The long-term impact of treatment strategies proposed by the IDSA guidelines for patients presenting with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is not well-known.","authors":[{"name":"A Bouaziz"},{"name":"I Uçkay"},{"name":"S Lustig"},{"name":"A Boibieux"},{"name":"D Lew"},{"name":"P Hoffmeyer"},{"name":"P Neyret"},{"name":"C Chidiac"},{"name":"T Ferry"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Guidelines"},{"word":"Infections de prothèses articulaires"},{"word":"MSSA"},{"word":"Prosthetic joint infections"},{"word":"Recommandations"},{"word":"SASM"}]},"article138":{"pmid":"30965904","title":"Nitric Oxide Releasing Polymeric Coatings for the Prevention of Biofilm Formation.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The ability of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing polymer coatings to prevent biofilm formation is described.

The aim of this study is to assess how change in temperature and soil moisture affect biochemical biomarkers in Eisenia fetida earthworm and microbial activity in their excrements after exposure to a fungicide - propiconazole (PCZ) and an insecticide - chlorantraniliprole (CAP). For seven days, earthworms were exposed to the pesticides under four environmental conditions comprising combinations of two different temperatures (20°C and 25°C) and two different soil water holding capacities (30% and 50%). After exposure, in the collected earthworm casts the microbial activity was measured through dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and biofilm forming ability (BFA), and in the postmitochondrial fraction of earthworms the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) respectively. The temperature and the soil moisture affected enzyme activities and organism's response to pesticides. It was determined that a three-way interaction (pesticide concentration, temperature and moisture) is statistically significant for the CAT and GST after the CAP exposure, and for the AChE and CAT after the PCZ exposure. Interestingly, the AChE activity was induced by both pesticides at a higher temperature tested. The most important two-way interaction that was determined occurred between the concentration and temperature applied. DHA and BFA, as markers of microbial activity, were unevenly affected by PCZ, CAP and environmental conditions. The results of this experiment demonstrate that experiments with at least two different environmental conditions can give a very good insight into some possible effects that the climate change could have on the toxicity of pesticides. The interaction of environmental factors should play a more important role in the risk assessments for pesticides.","authors":[{"name":"Davorka K Hackenberger"},{"name":"Goran Palijan"},{"name":"Željka Lončarić"},{"name":"Olga Jovanović Glavaš"},{"name":"Branimir K Hackenberger"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AChE"},{"word":"BFA"},{"word":"CAT"},{"word":"DHA"},{"word":"GST"}]},"article141":{"pmid":"29121106","title":"Proteomics of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm matrix in a rat model of orthopedic implant-associated infection.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The matrix proteins of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm have not been well defined.

We show that certain supplementations to selective media strongly influence quantitative recovery of (un)treated biofilms. Hence, the developed media were optimized for selectivity and quantitative recovery before or after treatment with antibiotics of four major classes, i.e. ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, or tobramycin. Finally, in a proof of concept experiment the novel selective media were applied to determine the community composition of multispecies biofilms before and after treatment with tobramycin.","authors":[{"name":"Eva Vandeplassche"},{"name":"Tom Coenye"},{"name":"Aurélie Crabbé"}],"keywords":[]},"article143":{"pmid":"29120888","title":"Removal of Oral Biofilm on an Implant Fixture by a Cavitating Jet.","date":"2018-08-23","abs":"To demonstrate the effectiveness of the cavitating jet in removing biofilms from the rough surface of 3-dimensional structures.","authors":[{"name":"Junki Yamada"},{"name":"Takashi Takiguchi"},{"name":"Akihiro Saito"},{"name":"Hibiki Odanaka"},{"name":"Hitoshi Soyama"},{"name":"Matsuo Yamamoto"}],"keywords":[]},"article145":{"pmid":"29120113","title":"Hygiene practices in removable prosthodontics: A systematic review.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"To systematically review the recent scientific evidence about the hygiene practices of removable prostheses relative to the effectiveness, colour and dimensional stability.

Within this context, it is interesting to highlight the role played by bacteriophages, or phages, viruses that infect bacteria.

During long-duration space missions, microbial biofilms present a danger to crew health and spacecraft integrity. The use of antimicrobial surfaces provides an alternative strategy for inhibiting microbial growth and biofilm formation to conventional cleaning procedures and the use of disinfectants. Antimicrobial surfaces contain organic or inorganic compounds, such as antimicrobial peptides or copper and silver, that inhibit microbial growth. The efficacy of wetted oxidized copper layers and pure copper surfaces as antimicrobial agents was tested by applying cultures of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus cohnii to these metallic surfaces. Stainless steel surfaces were used as non-inhibitory control surfaces. The production of reactive oxygen species and membrane damage increased rapidly within 1 h of exposure on pure copper surfaces, but the effect on cell survival was negligible even after 2 h of exposure. However, longer exposure times of up to 4 h led to a rapid decrease in cell survival, whereby the survival of cells was additionally dependent on the exposed cell density. Finally, the release of metal ions was determined to identify a possible correlation between copper ions in suspension and cell survival. These measurements indicated a steady increase of free copper ions, which were released indirectly by cells presumably through excreted complexing agents. These data indicate that the application of antimicrobial surfaces in spaceflight facilities could improve crew health and mitigate material damage caused by microbial contamination and biofilm formation. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that cuprous oxide layers were superior to pure copper surfaces related to the antimicrobial effect and that cell density is a significant factor that influences the time dependence of antimicrobial activity.

The effect of citral on preformed biofilm was also tested using the same methodology. Monospecies and microcosm biofilms were tested. ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used (α=0.05). Cytotoxicity of the essential oil to human keratinocytes was performed by MTT assay. GC/MS demonstrated one major component (citral). The essential oil showed an inhibitory effect on all tested bacterial species, including S. mutans and L. acidophilus. Essential oil of C. citratus (10X MIC) reduced the number of viable cells of lactobacilli and streptococci biofilms (p < 0.05).

In the present study, the inhibitory effects of D‑tagatose on the growth and biofilm formation of S. mutans GS‑5 were examined. Monitoring S. mutans growth over a 24 h period revealed that D‑tagatose prolonged the lag phase without interfering with the final cell yield. This growth retardation was also observed in the presence of 1% sucrose, although it was abolished by the addition of D‑fructose. S. mutans biofilm formation was significantly inhibited by growth in sucrose media supplemented with 1 and 4% D‑tagatose compared with that in a culture containing sucrose alone, while S. mutans formed granular biofilms in the presence of this rare sugar. The inhibitory effect of D‑tagatose on S. mutans biofilm formation was significantly more evident than that of xylitol. Growth in sucrose media supplemented with D‑tagatose significantly decreased the expression of glucosyltransferase, exo‑β‑fructosidase and D‑fructose‑specific phosphotransferase genes but not the expression of fructosyltransferase compared with the culture containing sucrose only. The activity of cell‑associated glucosyltransferase in S. mutans was inhibited by 4% D‑tagatose. These results indicate that D‑tagatose reduces water‑insoluble glucan production from sucrose by inhibiting glucosyltransferase activities, which limits access to the free D‑fructose released during this process and retards the growth of S. mutans. Therefore, foods and oral care products containing D‑tagatose are anticipated to reduce the risk of caries by inhibiting S. mutans biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Khaleque Hasibul"},{"name":"Haruyuki Nakayama-Imaohji"},{"name":"Masahito Hashimoto"},{"name":"Hisashi Yamasaki"},{"name":"Takaaki Ogawa"},{"name":"Junpei Waki"},{"name":"Ayano Tada"},{"name":"Saori Yoneda"},{"name":"Masaaki Tokuda"},{"name":"Minoru Miyake"},{"name":"Tomomi Kuwahara"}],"keywords":[]},"article165":{"pmid":"29114981","title":"PtaB, a lim-domain binding protein in Aspergillus fumigatus regulates biofilm formation and conidiation through distinct pathways.","date":"2018-09-19","abs":"The exopolysaccharide galactosaminogalactan (GAG) plays an important role in mediating adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence in the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.

PtaB is a lim-domain binding protein that interacts with the transcription factor SomA and is required for normal conidiation and biofilm formation. Disruption of ptaB resulted in impaired GAG production and conidiation in association with a markedly reduced expression of GAG biosynthetic genes (uge3 and agd3), developmental regulators (medA and stuA), and genes involved in the core conidiation pathway. Overexpression of medA and dual overexpression of uge3 and agd3 in the ΔptaB mutant increased biofilm formation but not conidiation, whereas overexpression of core conidiation genes rescued conidiation but not biofilm formation. Overexpression of stuA modestly increased both conidiation and biofilm formation. Analysis of ptaB truncation mutants revealed that overexpression of the lim-domain binding region restored conidiation but not biofilm formation, suggesting that ptaB may govern these processes by interacting with different partners. These studies establish that PtaB governs GAG biosynthesis at the level of substrate availability and polymer deacetylation and that PtaB-mediated biofilm formation and conidiation are largely independent pathways.","authors":[{"name":"Shizhu Zhang"},{"name":"Yuan Chen"},{"name":"Zhihua Ma"},{"name":"Qiuyi Chen"},{"name":"Hanna Ostapska"},{"name":"Fabrice N Gravelat"},{"name":"Ling Lu"},{"name":"Donald C Sheppard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aspergillus fumigatus"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Conidiation"},{"word":"Galactosaminogalactan"}]},"article166":{"pmid":"29114647","title":"The effect of orthodontic treatment on periodontal tissue inflammation: A systematic review.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the periodontal tissue inflammation indexes in patients undergoing different orthodontic treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Carmine Verrusio"},{"name":"Vincenzo Iorio-Siciliano"},{"name":"Andrea Blasi"},{"name":"Stefania Leuci"},{"name":"Daniela Adamo"},{"name":"Michele Nicolò"}],"keywords":[]},"article167":{"pmid":"29114399","title":"Erratum: Author Correction: Identification of donor microbe species that colonize and persist long term in the recipient after fecal transplant for recurrent Clostridium difficile.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1038/s41522-017-0020-7.].","authors":[{"name":"Ranjit Kumar"},{"name":"Nengjun Yi"},{"name":"Degui Zhi"},{"name":"Peter Eipers"},{"name":"Kelly T Goldsmith"},{"name":"Paula Dixon"},{"name":"David K Crossman"},{"name":"Michael R Crowley"},{"name":"Elliot J Lefkowitz"},{"name":"J Martin Rodriguez"},{"name":"Casey D Morrow"}],"keywords":[]},"article168":{"pmid":"29114245","title":"The Selective Interaction of Pistacia lentiscus Oil vs. Human Streptococci, an Old Functional Food Revisited with New Tools.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Pistacia lentiscus berry oil (LBO) represents a typical vegetal product of the Mediterranean basin that has been formally used in traditional cuisine for 100s of years. In addition to its interesting alimentary properties, this product could represent an interesting candidate in the field of research on the study of new anti-infective agents. In fact, in Mediterranean countries, lentisk oil still continues to be widely used in folk medicine for oral and skin affections, in particular, acute gingivitis, pediatric skin infections such as impetigo and foot plaques, and biofilm related infections often associated with Streptococcus spp. Following these observations, we have hypothesized a lentisk oil-bacteria interaction, placing particular emphasis on the different Streptococcal species involved in these oral and skin diseases. In accordance with this hypothesis, the use of standard antimicrobial-antibiofilm methods (MIC, MBC, MBIC) allowed the interesting behavior of these bacteria to be observed and, in this context, the response to lentisk oil appears to be correlated with the pathogenic profile of the considered microorganism. Two probiotic strains of S. salivarius K12/M18 appeared to be non-sensitive to this product, while a set of five different pathogenic strains (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. pyogenes) showed a response that was correlated to the fatty acid metabolic pathway of the considered species. In fact, at different times of bacteria development, selective High Performance Liquid Chromatography analysis of the growth medium containing LBO detected a significant increase in free unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) in particular oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids, which are already known for their antibacterial activity. In this context, we have hypothesized that LBO could be able to modulate the pathogen/probiotic rate in a Streptococcal population using the fatty acid metabolic pathway to help the probiotic strain. This hypothesis was strengthened by performing antibacterial testing with oleic acid and an in silico evaluation of the Streptococcal MCRA protein, an enzyme involved in the production of saturated fatty acids from UFA. These results show that LBO may have been used in ancient times as a natural microbial modulating extract in the prevention of biofilm- associated diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Germano Orrù"},{"name":"Cristina Demontis"},{"name":"Antonello Mameli"},{"name":"Enrica Tuveri"},{"name":"Pierpaolo Coni"},{"name":"Giuseppina Pichiri"},{"name":"Ferdinando Coghe"},{"name":"Antonella Rosa"},{"name":"Paola Rossi"},{"name":"Guy D'hallewin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pistacia lentiscus oil"},{"word":"Streptococcus spp."},{"word":"biofilm inhibition"},{"word":"free fatty acids"},{"word":"natural antimicrobials"}]},"article169":{"pmid":"29114242","title":"Bacillus sp.

In vitro degradation and water contact angle analysis suggested that the MBG-incorporated PLGA scaffold exhibited controlled degradability, stabilizing the pH of the surrounding environment and improved the hydrophilicity. Moreover, the presence of MBG provides a well-interconnected pore structure, to which human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells can attach, spread and proliferate, promoting upregulation of the expression of osteogenic markers. Thus, MBG/PLGA scaffolds exhibit better cytocompatibility and osteoblastic difierentiation properties compared with pure PLGA scaffolds.

Potential causes include biofilm growth in distribution pipes which may result in pathogen retention, inhibited disinfectant diffusion, and proliferation of bad tastes and odors. However, there is no standard method for direct measurement of biofilms or quantification of biofilm cells in drinking water distribution systems. Three methods are compared here for quantification of biofilm cells grown in pipe loops samplers: biofilm heterotrophic plate count (HPC), biofilm biovolume by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and biofilm total cell count by flow cytometry (FCM) paired with Syto 9. Both biofilm biovolume by CLSM and biofilm total cell count by FCM were evaluated for quantification of the whole biofilms (including non-viable cells and viable but not culturable cells). Signal-to-background ratios and overall performance of biofilm biovolume by CLSM and biofilm total cell count by FCM were found to vary with the pipe material. Biofilm total cell count by FCM had a low signal-to-background ratio on all materials, indicating that further development is recommended before application in drinking water environments. Biofilm biovolume by CLSM showed the highest signal-to-background ratio for cement and cast iron, which suggests promise for wider application in full-scale systems. Biofilm biovolume by CLSM and Syto 9 staining allowed in-situ biofilm cell quantification thus elimination variable associated with cell detachment for quantification but had limitations associated with non-specific staining of cement and, to a lesser degree, auto-fluorescence of both cement and polyvinyl chloride materials. Due to variability in results obtained from each method, multiple methods are recommended to assess biofilm growth in drinking water distribution systems. Of the methods investigated here, HPC and CLSM and recommended for further development towards application in full-scale systems. HPC is a sample and widely applied method that quantifies viable culturable cells. CLSM analysis allows the elimination of experimental variables associated with cell detachment and affords the opportunity to evaluate biofilm components such as extracellular polymeric substances through the addition of specific probes. These two methods can be applied together to assess biofilms known to degrade treated water quality during conveyance in full-scale drinking water treatment systems.

Mixed biofilm formation and the metabolic activity of the biofilms were inhibited by 72.23% and 58.36% by Lactobacilli supernatant. The examination using confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy confirmed that Lactobacilli supernatant inhibited the growth of mixed biofilm and damaged the cells. Moreover, Lactobacilli supernatant also inhibited Candida yeast-to-hyphal transition. Therefore, Lactobacilli supernatant may serve as a possible antibiofilm agent to limit biofilm formation on voice prostheses.","authors":[{"name":"Yulong Tan"},{"name":"Matthias Leonhard"},{"name":"Doris Moser"},{"name":"Berit Schneider-Stickler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mixed fungal-bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"Probiotic"},{"word":"Silicone voice prostheses"}]},"article182":{"pmid":"29111051","title":"Antimicrobial activity of catechol functionalized-chitosan versus Staphylococcus epidermidis.","date":"2018-10-19","abs":"Protein mussel-inspired adhesive polymers, characterized by the presence of catechol groups, possess superior muco-adhesive properties and have great potentiality in wound healing.

Such forces can be measured by single cell force spectroscopy, where a single bacterium is attached to a cantilever of a scanning force microscope, and force-distance curves are measured. For the productive sea-water bacterium Paracoccus seriniphilus, pH dependent measurements reveal the highest adhesion forces at pH 4. Adhesion forces measured at salinities between 0% and 4.5% NaCl are in general higher for higher salinity. However, there is an exception for 0.9% where a higher adhesion force was measured than expected. These results are in line with zeta potential measurements of the bacterium, which also show an exceptionally low zeta potential at 0.9% NaCl. In the absence of macromolecular interactions, the adhesion forces are thus governed by (unspecific) electrostatic interactions, which can be adjusted by pH and ionic strength. It is further shown that microstructures on the titanium surface increase the adhesion force. Growth medium reduces the interaction forces dramatically, most probably through macromolecular bridging.","authors":[{"name":"Neda Davoudi"},{"name":"Katharina Huttenlochner"},{"name":"Jonas Chodorski"},{"name":"Christin Schlegel"},{"name":"Martin Bohley"},{"name":"Christine Müller-Renno"},{"name":"Jan C Aurich"},{"name":"Roland Ulber"},{"name":"Christiane Ziegler"}],"keywords":[]},"article191":{"pmid":"29107978","title":"Encapsulation of curcumin in polymeric nanoparticles for antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy.","date":"2019-01-18","abs":"Curcumin (CUR) has been used as photosensitizer in antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT).

To gain insights into these issues, we performed metagenome sequencing and analysis of microbial communities in three different filters of a full-scale drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). Filter communities were sampled from a rapid sand filter (RSF), granular activated carbon filter (GAC), and slow sand filter (SSF), and from the Schmutzdecke (SCM, a biologically active scum layer accumulated on top of SSF), respectively. Analysis of community phylogenetic structure revealed that the filter bacterial communities significantly differed from those in the source water and final effluent communities, respectively. Network analysis identified a filter-specific colonization pattern of bacterial groups. Bradyrhizobiaceae were abundant in GAC, whereas Nitrospira were enriched in the sand-associated filters (RSF, SCM, and SSF). The GAC community was enriched with functions associated with aromatics degradation, many of which were encoded by Rhizobiales (∼30% of the total GAC community). Predicting minimum generation time (MGT) of prokaryotic communities suggested that the GAC community potentially select fast-growers (<15 h of MGT) among the four filter communities, consistent with the highest dissolved organic matter removal rate by GAC.

The varnishes were based on ethylcellulose or ammonio methacrylate copolymer type A (Eudragit® RL). Chlorhexidine was released by diffusion from a heterogeneous matrix in the case of the ethylcellulose-based formulation, and from a homogeneous matrix in the case of Eudragit® RL. This dictated the release pattern of chlorhexidine under testing conditions: from film specimens, and from coated catheters in a static or flow-through system. Momentary saturation was observed with the flow-through system in Eudragit® RL-based coatings, an effect that might be present in vivo with other formulations as well. The coatings were retained on the catheters for at least 2weeks, and showed prolonged activity in a biological medium, including an antibiofilm effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Two real life scenarios: I) biodegradation in a pristine intermittent stream experiencing acute pollution and II) biodegradation in a chronically polluted intermittent stream, were examined via a multifactorial experiment using an artificial stream facility. Stream biofilms were exposed to different water flow conditions i.e. permanent and intermittent water flow. Venlafaxine, a readily biodegradable pharmaceutical was used as a measure of biodegradation capacity while pollution was simulated by a mixture of four emerging contaminants (erythromycin, sulfisoxazole, diclofenac and imidacloprid in addition to venlafaxine) in environmentally relevant concentrations. Biodegradation kinetics monitored via LC-MS/MS was established, statistically evaluated, and used to link biodegradation with stress events. The results suggest that the effects of intermittent flow do not hinder and may even stimulate pristine biofilm biodegradation capacity. Chronic pollution completely reduced biodegradation in permanent water flow experimental treatments while no change in intermittent streams was observed. A combined effect of water flow conditions and emerging contaminants exposure on biodegradation was found. The decrease in biodegradation due to exposure to emerging contaminants is significantly greater in streams with permanent water flow suggesting that the short and medium term biodegradation capacity in intermittent systems may be preserved or even greater than in perennial streams.","authors":[{"name":"Marko Rožman"},{"name":"Vicenç Acuña"},{"name":"Mira Petrović"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biodegradation"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Drought"},{"word":"Pharmaceutically active compounds"},{"word":"Stressor combination"}]},"article215":{"pmid":"29102134","title":"Inactivation of Cronobacter malonaticus cells and inhibition of its biofilm formation exposed to hydrogen peroxide stress.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Presence of Cronobacter malonaticus in powdered infant formula (PIF) poses a high risk to infant and public health.

Gentamicin is one of most used antibiotics for the local treatment of bone-related infections, alone or in combination, due to its bactericidal and broad-range activity. Gentamicin-loaded beads (GLBs), composed of calcium sulfate/hydroxyapatite, were assessed for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against planktonic and biofilm S. agalactiae, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis and E. coli, using standard methods and ultra-sensitive isothermal microcalorimetry. Gentamicin released from GLBs to clinically relevant concentrations (200-2500μg/mL) within 1h was able to kill planktonic S. agalactiae, S. epidermidis and E. coli at lower concentrations (MIC: ≤4μg/mL). Moreover, 12 and 23μg/mL of released gentamicin were able to prevent bacterial adhesion and suppress a 24h-old biofilm of E. coli, respectively.

In this context, we consider the interfacial assembly of a bacterial biofilm protein, BslA, at air-water and oil-water interfaces. Densely packed, high modulus monolayers form at air-water interfaces, leading to the formation of flattened sessile water drops. BslA forms elastic sheets at oil-water interfaces, leading to the production of stable monodisperse oil-in-water microcapsules. By contrast, water-in-oil microcapsules are unstable but display arrested rather than full coalescence on contact. The disparity in stability likely originates from a low areal density of BslA hydrophobic caps on the exterior surface of water-in-oil microcapsules, relative to the inverse case. In direct analogy with small molecule surfactants, the lack of stability of individual water-in-oil microcapsules is consistent with the large value of the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB number) calculated based on the BslA crystal structure. The occurrence of arrested coalescence indicates that the surface activity of BslA is similar to that of colloidal particles that produce Pickering emulsions, with the stability of partially coalesced structures ensured by interfacial jamming. Micropipette aspiration and flow in tapered capillaries experiments reveal intriguing reversible and nonreversible modes of mechanical deformation, respectively. The mechanical robustness of the microcapsules and the ability to engineer their shape and to design highly specific binding responses through protein engineering suggest that these microcapsules may be useful for biomedical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Gilad Kaufman"},{"name":"Wei Liu"},{"name":"Danielle M Williams"},{"name":"Youngwoo Choo"},{"name":"Manesh Gopinadhan"},{"name":"Niveditha Samudrala"},{"name":"Raphael Sarfati"},{"name":"Elsa C Y Yan"},{"name":"Lynne Regan"},{"name":"Chinedum O Osuji"}],"keywords":[]},"article251":{"pmid":"29094611","title":"The carboxylic acid transporters Jen1 and Jen2 affect the architecture and fluconazole susceptibility of Candida albicans biofilm in the presence of lactate.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Candida albicans has the ability to adapt to different host niches, often glucose-limited but rich in alternative carbon sources.

Therefore, strategies aimed at the inhibition of QS pathways, are regarded as potential novel therapies in managing bacterial virulence hence reducing their ability to induce infections in humans. In the present study, a portfolio of 25 medicinal plant extracts (ethanol 50% v/v) used in southwestern Kenya were assayed against a transformed E. coli Top 10 reporter QS strain. This biosensor responds to the exogenous addition of 3-oxo-N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC6HSL) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP).

While the effect of high c-di-GMP levels on bacterial lifestyles is well studied, the physiology of cells at low c-di-GMP levels remains unclear. Here, we showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells with high and low intracellular c-di-GMP contents possessed distinct transcriptome profiles. There were 535 genes being upregulated and 432 genes downregulated in cells with low c-di-GMP, as compared to cells with high c-di-GMP. Interestingly, both rhl and pqs quorum-sensing (QS) operons were expressed at higher levels in cells with low intracellular c-di-GMP content compared with cells with higher c-di-GMP content. The induced expression of pqs and rhl QS required a functional PqsR, the transcriptional regulator of pqs QS. Next, we observed increased production of pqs and rhl-regulated virulence factors, such as pyocyanin and rhamnolipids, in P. aeruginosa cells with low c-di-GMP levels, conferring them with increased intracellular survival rates and cytotoxicity against murine macrophages.

We determined a key amino acid substitution, A169 (i.e., threonine changed to alanine at position 169), in the FimA protein that changed ligand affinity of FimA toward N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.

This nsSNP was found in S. Heidelberg and S. Cerro isolates. Although this was not the case for the IroN receptor, the phylogeny of this receptor and different host origins of NTS isolates were positively correlated, suggesting existence of specific host immune selective pressures on this unique receptor in S. enterica.

Recently, the activity of the frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptide Esc(1-21) and its diastereomer Esc(1-21)-1c was evaluated against both planktonic and sessile forms of this pathogen. Furthermore, Esc(1-21) was found to significantly reduce the severity of P. aeruginosa keratitis in a mouse model and preserve antipseudomonal activity in the presence of human basal tears. Here, we have analyzed the activity of the peptides on P. aeruginosa biofilm formed on soft CLs. Microbiological assays and scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that the peptides were able to disrupt the bacterial biofilm, with the diastereomer having the greater efficacy (up to 85% killing vs no killing at 4 μM for some strains). Furthermore, upon covalent immobilization to the CL, the two peptides were found to cause more than four log reduction in the number of bacterial cells within 20 minutes and to reduce bacterial adhesion to the CL surface (77%-97% reduction) in 24 hours. Importantly, peptide immobilization was not toxic to mammalian cells and did not affect the lens characteristics. Overall, our data suggest that both peptides have great potential to be developed as novel pharmaceuticals for prevention and treatment of CL-associated P. aeruginosa keratitis.","authors":[{"name":"Bruno Casciaro"},{"name":"Debarun Dutta"},{"name":"Maria Rosa Loffredo"},{"name":"Stefania Marcheggiani"},{"name":"Alison M McDermott"},{"name":"Mark Dp Willcox"},{"name":"Maria Luisa Mangoni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"contact lens"},{"word":"keratitis"}]},"article274":{"pmid":"29085916","title":"Can't you hear me knocking: contact-dependent competition and cooperation in bacteria.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Microorganisms are in constant competition for growth niches and environmental resources.

However, infections of the conjunctiva are limited to strains within a distinct phyletic group with multilocus sequence types ST448, ST344, ST1186, ST1270, and ST2315. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of six pneumococcal strains isolated from eye infections. The conjunctivitis isolates are grouped in a distinct phyletic group together with a subset of nasopharyngeal isolates. The keratitis (infection of the cornea) and endophthalmitis (infection of the vitreous body) isolates are grouped with the remainder of pneumococcal strains. Phenotypic characterization is consistent with morphological differences associated with the distinct phyletic group. Specifically, isolates from the distinct phyletic group form aggregates in planktonic cultures and chain-like structures in biofilms grown on abiotic surfaces. To begin to investigate the association between genotype and epidemiology, we focused on a predicted surface-exposed adhesin (SspB) encoded exclusively by this distinct phyletic group. Phylogenetic analysis of the gene encoding SspB in the context of a streptococcal species tree suggests that sspB was acquired by lateral gene transfer from Streptococcus suis. Furthermore, an sspB deletion mutant displays decreased adherence to cultured cells from the ocular epithelium compared to the isogenic wild-type and complemented strains. Together these findings suggest that acquisition of genes from outside the species has contributed to pneumococcal tissue tropism by enhancing the ability of a subset of strains to infect the ocular epithelium causing conjunctivitis.

It was found alizarin (1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone) and chrysazin (1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone) suppressed C. albicans biofilm formation. Interestingly, alizarin and chrysazin at only 2 μg/ml effectively inhibited hyphal formation and prolonged the survival of C. albicans infected Caenorhabditis elegans, thus showing a distinct antivirulent potential. A structural activity relationship study of alizarin and 6 other anthraquinones showed the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-1 position which is important for antibiofilm and antifilamentation activities. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that alizarin downregulated the expression of several hypha-specific and biofilm related genes (ALS3, ECE1, ECE2, and RBT1). Furthermore, unlike the commercial antifungal drug fluconazole, no acute toxic effect was observed when uninfected nematodes were exposed to alizarin at concentrations up to 1 mg/ml.

In many plant pathogens the expression of virulence determinants is restricted to a certain range of temperatures. In the case of E. amylovora, temperatures above 18 °C are required for blossom blight epidemics under field conditions. Moreover, this bacterium is able to infect a variety of host tissues/organs apart from flowers, but it is still unknown how environmental temperatures, especially those below 18 °C, affect the pathogen ability to cause fire blight disease symptoms in such tissues/organs. There is also scarce information on how temperatures below 18 °C affect the E. amylovora starvation-survival responses, which might determine its persistence in the environment and probably contribute to the seasonal development of fire blight disease, as occurs in other pathogens. To characterize the virulence and survival of E. amylovora at temperate and low temperatures, we evaluated the effect of three temperatures (4 °C, 14 °C, 28 °C) on symptom development, and on different parameters linked to starvation and virulence. E. amylovora was pathogenic at the three assayed temperatures, with a slow-down of symptom development correlating with colder temperatures and slower growth rates. Siderophore secretion and motility also decreased in parallel to incubation temperatures. However, production of the exopolysaccharides amylovoran and levan was enhanced at 4 °C and 14 °C, respectively. Similarly, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress resistance were improved at 14 °C, with this temperature also favoring the maintenance of culturability, together with a reduction in cell size and the acquisition of rounded shapes in E. amylovora cells subjected to long-term starvation. However, starvation at 28 °C and 4 °C induced an enhanced viable but nonculturable (VBNC) response (to a lesser extent at 4 °C). This work reveals E. amylovora as a highly adaptable pathogen that retains its pathogenic potential even at the minimal growth temperatures, with an improved exopolysaccharide synthesis, biofilm formation or oxidative stress resistance at 14 °C, with respect to the optimal growth temperature (28 °C). Finally, our results also demonstrate the thermal modulation of starvation responses in E. amylovora, suggesting that the starvation-survival and the VBNC states are part of its life cycle. These results confirm the particular psychrotrophic adaptations of E. amylovora, revealing its pathogenic potential and survival at temperate and low environmental temperatures, which have probably contributed to its successful spread to countries with different climates. This knowledge might improve integrated control measures against fire blight.","authors":[{"name":"Ricardo D Santander"},{"name":"Elena G Biosca"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"Fire blight"},{"word":"Motility"},{"word":"Oxidative stress"},{"word":"Siderophores"},{"word":"Starvation"},{"word":"VBNC"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article278":{"pmid":"29085575","title":"Frequency of bap and cpaA virulence genes in drug resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and their role in biofilm formation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii has a high propensity to form biofilm and frequently causes medical device-related infections with multiple-drug-resistance in hospitals.

In this study, the detailed functions of this gene were investigated using a gene knockout technique. A bcsR knockout mutant (ΔbcsR) of C. sakazakii ATCC BAA-894 showed decreased adhesion/invasion (3.9-fold) in human epithelial cell line HCT-8.

Raman spectrometry was used to detect variations in biofilm components caused by bcsR knockout, and certain components, including carotenoids, fatty acids, and amides, were significantly reduced. However, another biofilm component, cellulose, was increased in ΔbcsR, suggesting that bcsR negatively affects cellulose biosynthesis. This result was also verified via RT-PCR, which demonstrated up-regulation of five crucial cellulose synthesis genes (bcsA, B, C, E, Q) in ΔbcsR. Furthermore, the expression of other virulence or biofilm-related genes, including flagellar assembly genes (fliA, C, D) and toxicity-related genes (ompA, ompX, hfq), was studied. The expression of fliC and ompA in the ΔbcsR mutant was found to be remarkably reduced compared with that in the wild-type and the others were also affected excepted ompX.

The inhibition of quorum-sensing activity in most microorganisms leads to a decrease in virulence.

Therefore, it is believed that there is an alternative way to control the physiological changes of H. pylori exposed to environmental stress. In this article, we present the compounds probably involved in the modulation of H. pylori virulence. Diffusible signal factors (DSFs) are fatty acid signal molecules involved in communication between microbes. DSFs are likely to stimulate H. Pylori transition into a sedentary state that correlates with bacterial transformation into a more resistant coccoid form and initiates biofilm formation.

This article has suggested and characterized the existence of an alternative DSF-mediated cell-cell signaling of H. pylori, which controls autoaggregative behaviors, biofilm formation, and the transition of microorganisms into the coccoid form.","authors":[{"name":"Paweł Krzyżek"},{"name":"Grażyna Gościniak"}],"keywords":[]},"article294":{"pmid":"29082233","title":"Macrophages as drivers of an opportunistic infection.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Opportunistic pathogens are a worldwide cause of mortality and morbidity, and infections with intrinsically antibiotic-resistant pathogens have a large clinical, social and economic impact. Bacteria belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), ubiquitous in natural and industrial environments, are notorious pathogens for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). In addition, Burkholderia cenocepacia is emerging as the culprit of non-CF related, sometimes fatal infections. Knowledge of the underlying infection mechanism of these pathogens is important for efficient treatment, however, to date not much is known about the lifestyle of Bcc bacteria during infection. In our recent study published in PLoS Pathogens, we provide experimental evidence that macrophages are critically important for proliferation of B. cenocepacia, and are major drivers of fatal pro-inflammatory infections in zebrafish larvae. This is in agreement with recent clinical information showing that B. cenocepacia is mainly localised in phagocytes in infected CF lungs. A predominant intramacrophage stage and a host-detrimental role for macrophages have major implications for treatment strategies of both CF and non-CF infections. Intracellular survival of bacteria traditionally classified as extracellular, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an emerging theme. Our finding that macrophages are essential for proliferation of B. cenocepacia in the host suggests a new paradigm for Bcc infections and urges the development of novel anti-infectious therapies to efficiently disarm these intrinsically antibiotic resistant facultative intracellular pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Annette C Vergunst"},{"name":"Nazareth Lopez Carranza"},{"name":"Lili Zhang"},{"name":"Margarida C Gomes"},{"name":"Yara Tasrini"},{"name":"Annemarie H Meijer"},{"name":"David O'Callaghan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia cenocepacia"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"intracellular bacteria"},{"word":"macrophages"},{"word":"nosocomial infections"},{"word":"opportunistic infections"},{"word":"zebrafish"}]},"article295":{"pmid":"29081982","title":"The making of a miscreant: tobacco smoke and the creation of pathogen-rich biofilms.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"We have previously reported that oral biofilms in clinically healthy smokers are pathogen-rich, and that this enrichment occurs within 24 h of biofilm formation.

By contrast, in pathogen-rich biofilms several metabolic pathways were over-expressed in response to smoke exposure. Under smoke-rich conditions, epithelial cells mounted an early and amplified pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress response to these virulence-enhanced commensal biofilms, and a muted early response to pathogen-rich biofilms. Commensal biofilms also demonstrated early and widespread cell death. Similar results were observed when smoke-free epithelial cells were challenged with smoke-conditioned biofilms, but not vice versa. In conclusion, our data suggest that smoke-induced transcriptional shifts in commensal biofilms triggers a florid pro-inflammatory response, leading to early commensal death, which may preclude niche saturation by these beneficial organisms. The cytokine-rich, pro-oxidant, anaerobic environment sustains inflammophilic bacteria, and, in the absence of commensal antagonism, may promote the creation of pathogen-rich biofilms in smokers.","authors":[{"name":"Samir A Shah"},{"name":"Sukirth M Ganesan"},{"name":"Saradhadevi Varadharaj"},{"name":"Shareef M Dabdoub"},{"name":"John D Walters"},{"name":"Purnima S Kumar"}],"keywords":[]},"article296":{"pmid":"29081917","title":"Inactivation of genes TEC1 and EFG1 in Candida albicans influences extracellular matrix composition and biofilm morphology.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Beatriz Helena Dias Panariello"},{"name":"Marlise I Klein"},{"name":"Ana Claudia Pavarina"},{"name":"Simone Duarte"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"EFG1"},{"word":"TEC1"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"}]},"article297":{"pmid":"29081915","title":"Osteopontin adsorption to Gram-positive cells reduces adhesion forces and attachment to surfaces under flow.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The bovine milk protein osteopontin (OPN) may be an efficient means to prevent bacterial adhesion to dental tissues and control biofilm formation.

The prevalence of NCFBE is on the increase in the United States and Europe, but no licensed therapies are currently available for its treatment. Although there are many similarities between NCFBE and cystic fibrosis (CF) in terms of respiratory symptoms, airway microbiology, and disease progression, there are key differences, for example, in response to treatment, suggesting differences in pathogenesis. This review discusses possible reasons underlying differences in response to inhaled antibiotics in people with CF and NCFBE. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are associated with the most severe forms of bronchiectasis. Suboptimal levels of antibiotics in the lung increase the mutation frequency of P. aeruginosa and lead to the development of mucoid strains characterized by formation of a protective polysaccharide biofilm. Mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa are associated with a chronic infection stage, requiring long-term antibiotic therapy. Inhaled antibiotics provide targeted delivery to the lung with minimal systemic toxicity and adverse events compared with oral/intravenous routes of administration, and they could be alternative treatment options to help address some of the treatment challenges in the management of severe cases of NCFBE. This review provides an overview of completed and ongoing trials that evaluated inhaled antibiotic therapy for NCFBE. Recently, several investigators conducted phase 3 randomized controlled trials with inhaled aztreonam and ciprofloxacin in patients with NCFBE. While the aztreonam trial results were not associated with significant clinical benefit in NCFBE, initial results reported from the inhaled ciprofloxacin (dry powder for inhalation and liposome-encapsulated/dual-release formulations) trials hold promise.

A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an eco-friendly and self-sustaining device that has great potential as a biosensor for in situ Cr(VI) measurement, especially for wastewater generated from different electroplating units.

The Cr(VI) removal efficiency of E. aestuarii YC211 was not affected by the surrounding environment (pH 5-9, 20-35 °C, coexisting ions, and salinity of 0-15 g/L). The maximum power density of the MFC biosensor was 98.3 ± 1.5 mW/m² at 1500 Ω. A good linear relationship (r² = 0.997) was observed between the Cr(VI) concentration (2.5-60 mg/L) and the voltage output. The developed MFC biosensor is a simple device that can accurately measure Cr(VI) concentrations in the actual electroplating wastewater that is generated from different electroplating units within 30 min with low deviations (-6.1% to 2.2%). After treating the actual electroplating wastewater with the MFC, the predominant family in the biofilm was found to be Bacillaceae (95.3%) and was further identified as the originally inoculated E. aestuarii YC211 by next generation sequencing (NGS).

However, the activity of essential oils against the causative agent Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) has not been well studied. Here, we evaluated the activity of 34 essential oils against B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture as a model for persister bacteria. We found that not all essential oils had activity against the B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture, with top five essential oils (oregano, cinnamon bark, clove bud, citronella, and wintergreen) at a low concentration of 0.25% showing high anti-persister activity that is more active than the known persister drug daptomycin. Interestingly, some highly active essential oils were found to have excellent anti-biofilm ability as shown by their ability to dissolve the aggregated biofilm-like structures. The top three hits, oregano, cinnamon bark, and clove bud completely eradicated all viable cells without any regrowth in subculture in fresh medium, whereas but not citronella and wintergreen did not have this effect. Carvacrol was found to be the most active ingredient of oregano oil showing excellent activity against B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells, while other ingredients of oregano oil p-cymene and α-terpinene had no apparent activity.

Therefore, this study was aimed at unraveling common bacterial surface virulence factors involved in pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance in representative CRAb of these ST genotypes.

Differently from the carbapenem-susceptible reference strain ATCC 17978, either overexpressed OXA-51 or both OXA-23 and OXA-51 co-purified with OMPs in CRAb. This tight association ensures their maximal concentration on the inner surface of the outer membrane to provide the best protection against carbapenems. These findings led us to propose for the first time a common behavior of OXA enzymes in CRAb. Despite the presence of both OmpA and phosphorylcholine-porinD and the ability of all the strains to adhere to cells, invasion, and survival within pneumocytes was shown only by ST2 and ST78 isolates, sharing the highest number of identified OMPs. Conversely, notwithstanding genetic and OMPs similarities with ST2, ST632 was unable to invade and survive within epithelial cells.

The ΔsrfAB which was deficient in production of surfactin, not only showed almost no ability to inhibit growth of A. citrulli but also decreased biofilm formation and reduced swarming motility.

In addition, corticosteroid use, dentures, and broad-spectrum antibiotic use have also contributed to the problem. Treatment of oral candidosis has continued to be problematic because of the potential toxicity of antifungals in clinical use, and, above all, development of drug resistance among patients. In this study, the antifungal effect of magnolol was investigated against 64 strains of Candida spp. (four standard and 60 oral isolates) through minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and growth curve assays. Insight into the mechanisms of the antifungal action has been gained through ultrastructural studies using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Molecular docking was done for predicting the interactions of magnolol with ergosterol at supramolecular level. The toxicity of magnolol on human erythrocytes was measured by in vitro hemolytic assay. MIC values of magnolol ranged from 16-64 μg/ml, respectively. All tested isolates showed a marked sensitivity towards magnolol in growth curve assays. Biofilm results suggested that magnolol showed strong anti-biofilm activity. The results obtained for four different Candida spp. demonstrated that MBIC values of magnolol showed the average biofilm inhibition by 69.5%, respectively. CLSM experiments showed that cells exposed to magnolol (MIC) exhibited cell membrane disruption. SEM analysis of magnolol treated cells resulted in deformed cells. TEM micrographs showed rupturing of the cell wall and plasma membrane, releasing the intracellular content, and swelling of the cell wall. Hemolytic activity of magnolol is 11.9% at its highest MIC compared to an activity level of 25.4% shown by amphotericin B (Amp B) at 1 μg/ml. Lipinski's parameters calculated for magnolol suggested its good oral bioavailability. Docking studies indicated that magnolol might be interacting with ergosterol in the fungal cell membranes.

We hypothesize that stream metabolism changes caused by irregular droughts are linked to the shading and bed sediment structure of temperate streams. We set up 16 outdoor experimental streams with low or high shade conditions and streambeds either with alternating sorted patches of gravel and sand or homogeneous gravel-sand mix sediment structures. We assessed community respiration (CR), net ecosystem production (NEP) and periphyton biomass and structure (diatoms, green algae, cyanobacteria) in the course of 6weeks colonization, 6weeks desiccation, and 2.5weeks after rewetting. The heterotroph to autotroph (H:A) and fungi to bacteria (F:B) ratios in the microbial biofilm community were assessed at the end of the colonization and rewetting phases. Streams with different bed sediment structure were functionally similar; their metabolism under desiccation was controlled solely by light availability. During flow recession, all streams showed net heterotrophy. As desiccation progressed, NEP and CR decreased to zero. Desiccation altered the periphyton composition from predominantly diatoms to green algae and cyanobacteria, particularly in streams with low shade and mixed sediments. Rapid post-drought resilience of NEP was accompanied by high cyanobacteria and green algae growth in low shade, but poor total periphyton growth in high shade streams. Variable periphyton recovery was followed by increased H:A in relation to shading, and decreased F:B in relation to sediments structure. These shifts resulted in poor CR recovery compared to the colonization phase, suggesting a link between CR resilience and microbial composition changes. The links between drought effects, post-drought recovery, shading level, and streambed structure reveal the importance of low-order stream management under a changing climate and land use to mitigate the future impact of unpredictable infrequent droughts on stream metabolism in temperate ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Sanja Zlatanović"},{"name":"Jenny Fabian"},{"name":"Katrin Premke"},{"name":"Michael Mutz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Climate change"},{"word":"Community respiration"},{"word":"Microbes"},{"word":"Net ecosystem production"},{"word":"Sediment heterogeneity"}]},"article337":{"pmid":"29069969","title":"Model extension, calibration and validation of partial nitritation-anammox process in moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) for reject and mainstream wastewater.","date":"2019-09-09","abs":"In the paper, the extension of mathematical model of partial nitritation-anammox process in a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) is presented.

However, due to the immobilization of the cells, in contrast to suspension-based systems, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) has to be transferred into the biofilm for consumption.

We identify several possible constraints underlying the evolution of this bacterium. On one hand, Ca. Legionella polyplacis and the louse symbionts Riesia and Puchtella experienced convergent evolution, perhaps due to adaptation to similar hosts. On the other hand, some metabolic differences are likely to reflect different phylogenetic positions of the symbionts and hence availability of particular metabolic function in the ancestor. This is exemplified by different arrangements of thiamine metabolism in Ca. Legionella polyplacis and Riesia. Finally, horizontal gene transfer is shown to play a significant role in the adaptive and diversification process. Particularly, we show that Ca. L. polyplacis horizontally acquired a complete biotin operon (bioADCHFB) that likely assisted this bacterium when becoming an obligate mutualist.","authors":[{"name":"Jana Ríhová"},{"name":"Eva Nováková"},{"name":"Filip Husník"},{"name":"Václav Hypša"}],"keywords":[{"word":"genome evolution"},{"word":"horizontal gene transfer"},{"word":"symbiosis"}]},"article340":{"pmid":"29069152","title":"In vitro and in vivo evaluations of glass-ionomer cement containing chlorhexidine for Atraumatic Restorative Treatment.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Addition of chlorhexidine has enhanced the antimicrobial effect of glass ionomer cement (GIC) indicated to Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART); however, the impact of this mixture on the properties of these materials and on the longevity of restorations must be investigated.

In this report, we describe a CheY-like protein required for control of the motile-to-sessile switch in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This regulator, which we have designated ClaR, possesses two distinct CheY-like receiver (REC) domains and is involved in the negative regulation of biofilm formation, through production of the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP) adhesin and cellulose. The ClaR REC domains share predicted structural homology with characterized REC domains and contain the majority of active site residues known to be essential for protein phosphorylation. REC1 is missing the conserved aspartate (N72) residue and although present in REC 2 (D193), it is not required for ClaR-dependent regulation suggesting that phosphorylation, which modulates the activity of many CheY-like proteins, appears not to be essential for ClaR activity. We also show that ClaR-dependent negative regulation of attachment is diminished significantly in mutants for PruA and PruR, proteins known to be involved in a pterin-mediated attachment regulation pathway. In A. tumefaciens, pterins are required for control of the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate monophosphate through the DcpA regulator, but our findings suggest that pterin-dependent ClaR control of attachment can function independently from DcpA, including dampening of c-di-GMP levels.

The adaptive response included the upregulation of proteins required for sensing and repairing DNA damage and substantial changes in the expression of enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism. We differentiated the immediate proteomic response, characterized by an increase in flagellar motility, from the long-term adaptive strategy, which included the upregulation of purine synthesis.

Colonization of P. aeruginosa in chronic infections leads to the formation of biofilms, which are difficult to eradicate. P. aeruginosa is capable of regulating its virulence factors in response to external environment triggers and its signaling mechanism involves two-component regulatory systems and small molecules such as bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate. PA1611-RetS-GacS/A-RsmA/Y/Z is a key regulatory pathway in P. aeruginosa that controls several virulence factors and biofilm formation. We have previously identified a conserved cytoplasmic membrane protein cmpX (PA1775), as a regulator for PA1611 expression. In this study, we demonstrate that cmpX regulates virulence, and controls biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa as well as provide evidence showing that cmpX affects Gac/Rsm pathway, possibly by modulating intra-cellular c-di-GMP levels. A cmpX knockout showed significantly decreased promoter activity of exoS (PA1362) and increased activity of small RNA, RsmY. As compared to the wild-type PAO1, cmpX mutant had elevated intracellular c-di-GMP level as measured indirectly by cdrA (PA4625) activity, as well as increased expression of wspR (PA3702), a c-di-GMP synthase.

While antibiotic exposure has been associated with modulated expression of many biofilm-related genes, the mechanisms of drug-induced biofilm formation remain a focus of ongoing research efforts and may vary significantly across species. In this work, we investigate antibiotic-induced biofilm formation in Enterococcus faecalis, a leading cause of nosocomial infections. We show that biofilm formation is enhanced by subinhibitory concentrations of cell wall synthesis inhibitors but not by inhibitors of protein, DNA, folic acid, or RNA synthesis. Furthermore, enhanced biofilm is associated with increased cell lysis, increases in extracellular DNA (eDNA) levels, and increases in the density of living cells in the biofilm. In addition, we observe similar enhancement of biofilm formation when cells are treated with nonantibiotic surfactants that induce cell lysis. These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced biofilm formation is governed by a trade-off between drug toxicity and the beneficial effects of cell lysis. To understand this trade-off, we developed a simple mathematical model that predicts changes in antibiotic-induced biofilm formation due to external perturbations, and we verified these predictions experimentally. Specifically, we demonstrate that perturbations that reduce eDNA (DNase treatment) or decrease the number of living cells in the planktonic phase (a second antibiotic) decrease biofilm induction, while chemical inhibitors of cell lysis increase relative biofilm induction and shift the peak to higher antibiotic concentrations. Overall, our results offer experimental evidence linking cell wall synthesis inhibitors, cell lysis, increased eDNA levels, and biofilm formation in E. faecalis while also providing a predictive quantitative model that sheds light on the interplay between cell lysis and antibiotic efficacy in developing biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Wen Yu"},{"name":"Kelsey M Hallinen"},{"name":"Kevin B Wood"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"mathematical modeling"},{"word":"subinhibitory antibiotics"}]},"article368":{"pmid":"29061737","title":"Antifungal Activity of Oleylphosphocholine on In Vitro and In Vivo Candida albicans Biofilms.","date":"2019-04-17","abs":"In this study, we investigated the potential antifungal activity of the alkylphospholipid oleylphosphocholine (OlPC), a structural analogue of miltefosine, on in vitro and in vivoCandida albicans biofilm formation.

PG1660 is co-transcribed with its downstream gene PG1659, and the transcription start site was identified as adenine residue 54-nucleotides upstream of the ATG translation start codon.

Here, we isolated 21 L. salivarius strains composed of 6 strains isolated before the AGP prohibition (SBPs) and 15 strains isolated after the AGP prohibition (SAPs) at an interval of a decade, and the draft genomes were generated de novo. Several genomic differences between SBPs and SAPs were identified, although the number and function of antibiotic resistance genes were not different. SBPs showed larger genome size and a higher number of orthologs, as well as lower genetic diversity, than SAPs. SBPs had genes associated with the utilization of L-rhamnose and D-tagatose for energy production. Because these sugars are also used in exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, we tried to identify differences in biofilm formation-associated genes. The genes for the production of EPSs and extracellular proteins were different in terms of amino acid sequences. Indeed, SAPs formed dense biofilm and survived better than SBPs in the swine intestinal environment. These results suggest that SAPs have evolved and adapted to protect themselves from new selection pressure of the swine intestinal microenvironment by forming dense biofilms, adopting a distinct antibiotic resistance strategy.

The diversity of P. pulmonicola population studied, observed for isolates recovered from successive samples but also within a sample suggested that existence of a diversified population may represent a patho-adaptive strategy for host persistence in the heterogeneous and fluctuating CFRT environment.","authors":[{"name":"Chloé Dupont"},{"name":"Fabien Aujoulat"},{"name":"Raphaël Chiron"},{"name":"Pauline Condom"},{"name":"Estelle Jumas-Bilak"},{"name":"Hélène Marchandin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pandoraea"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"diversity"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article383":{"pmid":"29056864","title":"Understanding Curli Amyloid-Protein Aggregation by Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange and Mass Spectrometry.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Bacteria within Curli biofilms are protected from environmental pressures (e.g., disinfectants, antibiotics), and this is responsible for intractable infections. Understanding aggregation of the major protein component of Curli, CsgA, may uncover disease-associated amyloidogenesis mechanisms. Here, we report the application of pulsed hydrogen-deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to study CsgA aggregation, thereby obtaining region-specific information. By following time-dependent peptide signal depletion, presumably a result of insoluble fibril formation, we acquired sigmoidal profiles that are specific for regions (region-specific) of the protein. These signal-depletion profiles not only provide an alternative aggregation measurement, but also give insight on soluble species in the aggregation. The HDX data present as bimodal isotopic distributions, one representing a highly disordered species whereas the other a well-structured one. Although the extents of deuterium uptake of the two species remain the same with time, the relative abundance of the lower mass, less-exchanged species increases in a region-specific manner. The same region-specific aggregation properties also pertain to different aggregation conditions. Although CsgA is an intrinsically disordered protein, within the fibril it is thought to consist of five imperfect β-strand repeating units (labeled R1-R5). We found that the exterior repeating units R1 and R5 have higher aggregation propensities than do the interior units R2, R3, and R4. We also employed TEM to obtain complementary information of the well-structured species. The results provide insight on aggregation and a new approach for further application of HDX-MS to unravel aggregation mechanisms of amyloid proteins.","authors":[{"name":"Hanliu Wang"},{"name":"Qin Shu"},{"name":"Don L Rempel"},{"name":"Carl Frieden"},{"name":"Michael L Gross"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CsgA"},{"word":"Curli"},{"word":"EX1-like"},{"word":"Mass Spectrometry"},{"word":"Pulsed HDX"},{"word":"hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX)"},{"word":"protein aggregation"},{"word":"transmission electron microscopy"}]},"article385":{"pmid":"29056457","title":"Vibrio cholerae Combines Individual and Collective Sensing to Trigger Biofilm Dispersal.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Bacteria can generate benefits for themselves and their kin by living in multicellular, matrix-enclosed communities, termed biofilms, which are fundamental to microbial ecology and the impact bacteria have on the environment, infections, and industry [1-6]. The advantages of the biofilm mode of life include increased stress resistance and access to concentrated nutrient sources [3, 7, 8]. However, there are also costs associated with biofilm growth, including the metabolic burden of biofilm matrix production, increased resource competition, and limited mobility inside the community [9-11]. The decision-making strategies used by bacteria to weigh the costs between remaining in a biofilm or actively dispersing are largely unclear, even though the dispersal transition is a central aspect of the biofilm life cycle and critical for infection transmission [12-14]. Using a combination of genetic and novel single-cell imaging approaches, we show that Vibrio cholerae integrates dual sensory inputs to control the dispersal response: cells use the general stress response, which can be induced via starvation, and they also integrate information about the local cell density and molecular transport conditions in the environment via the quorum sensing apparatus. By combining information from individual (stress response) and collective (quorum sensing) avenues of sensory input, biofilm-dwelling bacteria can make robust decisions to disperse from large biofilms under distress, while preventing premature dispersal when biofilm populations are small. These insights into triggers and regulators of biofilm dispersal are a key step toward actively inducing biofilm dispersal for technological and medical applications, and for environmental control of biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Praveen K Singh"},{"name":"Sabina Bartalomej"},{"name":"Raimo Hartmann"},{"name":"Hannah Jeckel"},{"name":"Lucia Vidakovic"},{"name":"Carey D Nadell"},{"name":"Knut Drescher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"HapR"},{"word":"RpoS"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm dissolution"},{"word":"dispersal"},{"word":"dispersion"},{"word":"microbial community"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"stress response"}]},"article386":{"pmid":"29056188","title":"Effect of baking soda in dentifrices on plaque removal.","date":"2019-08-12","abs":"The prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases targets control of dental plaque biofilm.

Mycoplasma infections cause diseases in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, urethritis in men resulting in painful dysuria, urgency and urethral discharge. Cough, fever, headache, urethritis may persist for several weeks and convalescence is slow. The symptoms of these diseases are aggravated by the detection of mycoplasma infections, that takes either a long time, besides being expensive or is specific and restricted to only a limited number of contaminant strains. Mycoplasmas are hard to detect visually but could be seen and followed by time-lapse microscopy. Our hypothesis is that one can detect mycoplasma infection irrespective of its origin and type of mycoplasma. Main lines of supporting evidence are provided by the time-lapse microscopy showing dynamic morphological alterations caused by mycoplasmas before changes in human cell cultures become visible. Morphometric measurements of mycoplasma infections revealed four subphases: i) detachment of infected cells, ii) aggregation, iii) biofilm formation and iv) shrinkage of infected cells. The applicability of time-lapse microscopy for the detection of mycoplasma infection was validated by a mycoplasma test Kit. Most important implications related to morphometric parameters include the observation of mycoplasma infected cultures for an extended period of time instead of applying static snap-shot microscopy. A reliable method is offered to estimate the time of mycoplasma exposure that elapsed during the cell growth. This microphotometric approach served a more economical detection of mycoplasma contamination at its early stage of cell growth and spread, irrespective of the origin of contaminated serum, without defining the type of mycoplasma.","authors":[{"name":"Laszlo Talas"},{"name":"Gaspar Banfalvi"},{"name":"Eszter Fidrus"},{"name":"Zsuzsa M Szigeti"},{"name":"Gabor Nagy"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aggregation"},{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"Detachment"},{"word":"Mycoplasma PCR test"},{"word":"Mycoplasma infection"},{"word":"Shrinkage of biofilm"}]},"article394":{"pmid":"29055386","title":"Peritoneal dialysis: The unique features by compartmental delivery of renal replacement therapy.","date":"2018-07-16","abs":"Despite decades of research, the clinical efficacy of peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains enigmatic. We may wonder why the modality fail in some patients but perhaps the more proper question would be, why it works in so many? We know that the contribution of residual renal function (RRF), more so than in hemodialysis, is critically important to the well-being of many of the patients. Unique features of the modality include the relatively low volume of dialysate fluid needed to provide effective uremic control and the disproportionate tendency for both hypokalemia and hypoalbuminemia, when compared to hemodialysis. It is currently believed that most uremic toxins are generated on the interface of human and bacterial structures in the gastrointestinal tract, the intestinal biota. PD offers disproportionate removal of these toxins upon first-pass, i.e., via PD fluid exchanges before reaching the systemic circulation beyond the gastrointestinal compartment. Studies examining the net removal gradient of protein-bound uremic toxins during PD are scarce, whereas RRF receives considerably more attention without effective interventions being developed to preserve it. We propose an alternative view on PD, emphasizing the modality's compartmental nature, both for its benefits and the limitations.","authors":[{"name":"Tibor Fülöp"},{"name":"Lajos Zsom"},{"name":"Mihály B Tapolyai"},{"name":"Miklos Z Molnar"},{"name":"Sohail Abdul Salim"},{"name":"István Arany"},{"name":"Mehrdad Hamrahian"},{"name":"László Rosivall"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Albumin"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Gastrointestinal tract"},{"word":"Hypocalcemia"},{"word":"Hypokalemia"},{"word":"Obesity"},{"word":"Parathyroidectomy"},{"word":"Residual renal function"},{"word":"Urea"}]},"article395":{"pmid":"29055214","title":"Effect of magnetic powder on membrane fouling mitigation and microbial community/composition in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) for municipal wastewater treatment.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This study aims to investigate the usefulness of magnetic powder addition in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) for membrane fouling mitigation and its effect on microbial community and composition.

Here, we compare the responses of a biofilm of an EPS-producing (ATCC 12600) and a non-EPS producing (5298) Staphylococcus aureus strain to fluid shear and mechanical challenge. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed absence of calcofluor-white-stainable EPS in biofilms of S. aureus 5298. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy combined with tribometry indicated that polysaccharide production per bacterium in the initial adhering layer was higher during growth at high shear than at low shear and that this increased EPS production extended to entire biofilms, as indicated by tribometrically measured coefficients of friction (CoF). CoF of biofilms grown under high fluid shear were higher than those when grown under low shear, likely due to wash-off polysaccharides. Measurement of a biofilm's CoF implies application of mechanical pressure that yielded an immediate increase in the polysaccharide band area of S. aureus ATCC 12600 biofilms due to their compression. Compression decreased after relief of pressure to the level observed prior to mechanical pressure. For biofilms grown under high shear, this coincided with a higher percent whiteness in optical coherence tomography-images indicative of water outflow, returning back into the biofilm during stress relaxation. Biofilms grown under low shear, however, were stimulated during tribometry to produce EPS, also after relief of stress. Knowledge of factors that govern EPS production and water flow in biofilms will allow better control of biofilms under mechanical challenge and better understanding of the barrier properties of biofilms against antimicrobial penetration.","authors":[{"name":"Jiapeng Hou"},{"name":"Deepak H Veeregowda"},{"name":"Betsy van de Belt-Gritter"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FTIR"},{"word":"biofilm relaxation"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"friction"},{"word":"tribochemistry"},{"word":"viscosity"}]},"article397":{"pmid":"29054868","title":"Conditional Function of Autoaggregative Protein Cah and Common cah Mutations in Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Cah is a calcium-binding autotransporter protein involved in autoaggregation and biofilm formation. Although cah is widespread in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), we detected mutations in cah at a frequency of 31.3% in this pathogen. In STEC O157:H7 supershedder strain SS17, a large deletion results in a smaller coding sequence, encoding a protein lacking the C-terminal 71 amino acids compared with Cah in STEC O157:H7 strain EDL933. We examined the function of Cah in biofilm formation and host colonization to better understand the selective pressures for cah mutations. EDL933-Cah played a conditional role in biofilm formation in vitro: it enhanced E. coli DH5α biofilm formation on glass surfaces under agitated culture conditions that prevented autoaggregation but inhibited biofilm formation under hydrostatic conditions that facilitated autoaggregation. This function appeared to be strain dependent since Cah-mediated biofilm formation was diminished when an EDL933 cah gene was expressed in SS17. Deletion of cah in EDL933 enhanced bacterial attachment to spinach leaves and altered the adherence pattern of EDL933 to bovine recto-anal junction squamous epithelial (RSE) cells. In contrast, in trans expression of EDL933 cah in SS17 increased its attachment to leaf surfaces, and in DH5α, it enhanced its adherence to RSE cells. Hence, the ecological function of Cah appears to be modulated by environmental conditions and other bacterial strain-specific properties. Considering the prevalence of cah in STEC and its role in attachment and biofilm formation, cah mutations might be selected in ecological niches in which inactivation of Cah would result in an increased fitness in STEC during colonization of plants or animal hosts.","authors":[{"name":"Michelle Qiu Carter"},{"name":"Maria T Brandl"},{"name":"Indira T Kudva"},{"name":"Robab Katani"},{"name":"Matthew R Moreau"},{"name":"Vivek Kapur"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)"},{"word":"adaptive mutations"},{"word":"adherence"},{"word":"adhesins"},{"word":"attachment"},{"word":"autotransporter proteins"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC)"},{"word":"epithelial cell"},{"word":"plant"},{"word":"produce"}]},"article398":{"pmid":"29054673","title":"Fluvial biofilms exposed to desiccation and pharmaceutical pollution: New insights using metabolomics.","date":"2018-05-03","abs":"In many arid and semi-arid systems, biological communities in river ecosystems are submitted to flow interruption and desiccation, as well as to the impact of urban wastewaters. In this work, we studied (using a LC-LTQ-Orbitrap) the metabolomic response of biofilm communities exposed to both hydrological and chemical stressors. Fluvial biofilms were exposed to a mixture of 9 pharmaceuticals at a total concentration of 5000ng/L (mimicking concentrations and compounds found in polluted aquatic environments) and/or to seven days of desiccation, under laboratory conditions. The biosynthesis of fatty acids was the main metabolic pathway disrupted in biofilms. Endogenous biofilm's metabolites (metabolome) altered due to these stressors were identified. The metabolites that significantly changed only due to one of the stressors could be proposed as potential specific biomarkers. A biomarker of pharmaceutical exposure was the lysophosphatidic acid, which decreased a 160%, while for desiccation stearidonic acid (increased 160%), 16-Oxohexadecanoic acid (increased 340%) and palmitoleic acid (decreased 290%) were the biomarkers proposed. Besides, other metabolites showed different responses depending on the treatment, such as palmitic acid, linolenic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid and azelaic acid. The Carbon:Phosphorus (C:P) molar ratio increased due to all stress factors, whereas the algal community composition changed mainly due to desiccation.
