Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) produced by macrophages plays an important role in host defense against intracellular pathogens, and NO is a promising agent in preventing biofilms formation in vitro. However, the rate of delivery of NO by various NO donors (e.g., diazeniumdiolates, S-nitrosothiols, etc.) is difficult to control, which hinders fundamental studies aimed at understanding the role of NO in biofilm control. In this study, by using a novel precisely controlled electrochemical NO releasing catheter device, we examine the effect of physiological levels of NO on eradicating mature Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm (7 days), as well as the potential application of the combination of NO with antimicrobial agents. It is shown that physiological levels of NO exhibit mixed effects of killing bacteria and dispersing ambient biofilm. The overall biofilm-eradicating effect of NO is quite efficient in a dose-dependent manner over a 3 h period of NO treatment. Moreover, NO also greatly enhances the efficacy of antimicrobial agents, including human beta-defensin 2 (BD-2) and several antibiotics, in eradicating biofilm and its detached cells, which otherwise exhibited high recalcitrance to these antimicrobial agents. The electrochemical NO release technology offers a powerful tool in evaluating the role of NO in biofilm control as well as a promising approach when combined with antimicrobial agents to treat biofilm-associated infections in hospital settings, especially infections resulting from intravascular catheters.

Pneumococcal biofilm formation within the nasopharynx leads to long-term colonization and persistence within the host. We have previously demonstrated that the capsular surface-associated pneumococcal serine rich repeat protein (PsrP), key factor for biofilm formation, binds to keratin-10 (KRT10) through its microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecule (MSCRAMM)-related globular binding region domain (BR187-385). Here, we show that BR187-385 also binds to DNA, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and size exclusion chromatography. Further, heterologous expression of BR187-378 or the longer BR120-378 construct on the surface of a Gram-positive model host bacterium resulted in the formation of cellular aggregates that was significantly enhanced in the presence of DNA. Crystal structure analyses revealed the formation of BR187-385 homo-dimers via an intermolecular β-sheet, resulting in a positively charged concave surface, shaped to accommodate the acidic helical DNA structure. Furthermore, small angle X-ray scattering and circular dichroism studies indicate that the aggregate-enhancing N-terminal region of BR120-166 adopts an extended, non-globular structure. Altogether, our results suggest that PsrP adheres to extracellular DNA in the biofilm matrix and thus promotes pneumococcal biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Tim Schulte"},{"name":"Cecilia Mikaelsson"},{"name":"Audrey Beaussart"},{"name":"Alexey Kikhney"},{"name":"Maya Deshmukh"},{"name":"Sebastian Wolniak"},{"name":"Anuj Pathak"},{"name":"Christine Ebel"},{"name":"Jonas Löfling"},{"name":"Federico Fogolari"},{"name":"Birgitta Henriques-Normark"},{"name":"Yves F Dufrêne"},{"name":"Dmitri Svergun"},{"name":"Per-Åke Nygren"},{"name":"Adnane Achour"}],"keywords":[]},"article2":{"pmid":"27580679","title":"Discovery of new diketopiperazines inhibiting Burkholderia cenocepacia quorum sensing in vitro and in vivo.","date":"2019-05-08","abs":"Burkholderia cenocepacia, an opportunistic respiratory pathogen particularly relevant for cystic fibrosis patients, is difficult to eradicate due to its high level of resistance to most clinically relevant antimicrobials.

Here, we report the discovery of new diketopiperazine inhibitors of the B. cenocepacia acyl homoserine lactone synthase CepI, and report their anti-virulence properties. Out of ten different compounds assayed against recombinant CepI, four were effective inhibitors, with IC50 values in the micromolar range. The best compounds interfered with protease and siderophore production, as well as with biofilm formation, and showed good in vivo activity in a Caenorhabditis elegans infection model.

Understanding the composition and properties of the biofilm ECM is crucial to understanding how it functions and protects cells. New methods to isolate and characterize ECM are emerging for different biofilm systems. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance was used to quantitatively track the isolation of the insoluble ECM from the uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain UTI89 and understand the role of Congo red in purification protocols. UTI89 assembles amyloid-integrated biofilms when grown on YESCA nutrient agar. The ECM contains curli amyloid fibers and a modified form of cellulose. Biofilms formed by UTI89 and other E. coli and Salmonella strains are often grown in the presence of Congo red to visually emphasize wrinkled agar morphologies and to score the production of ECM. Congo red is a hallmark amyloid-binding dye and binds to curli, yet also binds to cellulose. We found that growth in Congo red enabled more facile extraction of the ECM from UTI89 biofilms and facilitates isolation of cellulose from the curli mutant, UTI89ΔcsgA. Yet, Congo red has no influence on the isolation of curli from curli-producing cells that do not produce cellulose. Sodium dodecyl sulfate can remove Congo red from curli, but not from cellulose. Thus, Congo red binds strongly to cellulose and possibly weakens cellulose interactions with the cell surface, enabling more complete removal of the ECM. The use of Congo red as an extracellular matrix purification aid may be applied broadly to other organisms that assemble extracellular amyloid or cellulosic materials.

The results indicated that the 3D-BER could significantly reduce antibiotic concentrations in wastewater, achieving removal rates of 88.9-93.5% and 89.3-95.6% for SMX and TC, respectively.

The majority of the highly virulent Y. pestis strains and some phylogenetic lines of Y. pseudotuberculosis 0:1 serotype contain disrupted porin genes.

C-di-GMP is synthesized from two molecules of GTP by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and its actions are terminated by EAL or HD-GYP domain phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which hydrolyze c-di-GMP to linear pGpG or GMP. Thus far the majority of efforts have been dedicated to the development of inhibitors of DGCs but not PDEs. This is probably because the old view was that inhibiting any c-di-GMP PDE would lead to biofilm formation, an undesirable phenotype. Recent data however suggest that some PDEs only change the localized (not global) concentration of c-di-GMP to increase bacterial virulence and do not affect biofilm formation. A challenge therefore is to be able to develop selective PDE inhibitors that inhibit virulence-associated PDEs but not inhibit PDEs that regulate bacterial biofilm formation. Using high throughput docking experiments to screen a library of 250 000 commercially available compounds against E. coli YahA (also called PdeL), a benzoisothiazolinone derivative was found to bind to the c-di-GMP binding site of YahA with favorable energetics. Paradoxically the in silico identified inhibitor (a benzoisothiazolinone derivative) did not inhibit the hydrolysis of c-di-GMP by YahA, the model PDE that was used in the docking, but instead inhibited RocR, which is a PDE from the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa (PA). RocR promotes bacterial virulence but not biofilm dispersal, making it an ideal PDE to target for anti-virulence purposes. This newly identified RocR ligand displayed some selectivity and did not inhibit other P. aeruginosa PDEs, such as DipA, PvrR and PA4108. DipA, PvrR and PA4108 are key enzymes that reduce global c-di-GMP concentration and promote biofilm dispersal; therefore the identification of an inhibitor of a PA PDE, such as RocR, that does not inhibit major PDEs that modulate global c-di-GMP is an important step towards the development of selective c-di-GMP PDEs that could have interesting biomedical applications. The identified RocR ligand could also inhibit P. aeruginosa (PAO1) swarming but not swimming or biofilm formation. Rhamnolipid production was decreased, explaining the inhibition of swarming.","authors":[{"name":"Yue Zheng"},{"name":"Genichiro Tsuji"},{"name":"Clement Opoku-Temeng"},{"name":"Herman O Sintim"}],"keywords":[]},"article19":{"pmid":"29364607","title":"[Role of the Microbial Community in Formation of Speleothem (Moonmilk) in the Snezhnaya Carst Cave (Abkhazia).]","date":"2018-02-08","abs":"The resi Its of investigation of speleothem (moonmilk) from the Snezhnaya cave (West Caucasus, Abkhazia) are-reported.

The metals each individually inhibited Cr(VI) removal, and the extent of inhibition increased in a cooperative manner in the presence of a combination of the metals.

This bacterium adheres to and invades the host cells in the bladder, where it forms biofilm-like polymicrobial structures termed intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) that protect UPEC from antimicrobial agents and the host immune systems. Using genetic screening, we found that deletion of the fur gene, which encodes an iron-binding transcriptional repressor for iron uptake systems, elevated the expression of type I fimbriae and motility when UPEC was grown under iron-rich conditions, and it led to an increased number of UPEC cells adhering to and internalized in bladder epithelial cells. Consequently, the IBC colonies that the fur mutant formed in host cells were denser and larger than those formed by the wild-type parent strain. Fur is inactivated under iron-restricted conditions. When iron was depleted from the bacterial cultures, wild-type UPEC adhesion, invasion, and motility increased, similar to the case with the fur mutant. The purified Fur protein bound to regions upstream of fimA and flhD, which encode type I fimbriae and an activator of flagellar expression that contributes to motility, respectively. These results suggest that Fur is a repressor of fimA and flhD and that its repression is abolished under iron-depleted conditions.

QS relies on the production, release and group-wide detection of signal molecules called autoinducers. To date, studies of bacterial pathogenesis in well-mixed cultures have revealed virulence factors and the regulatory circuits controlling them, including the overarching role of QS(3). Although flow is ubiquitous to nearly all living systems(4), much less explored is how QS influences pathogenic traits in scenarios that mimic host environments, for example, under fluid flow and in complex geometries. Previous studies(5-7) have shown that sufficiently strong flow represses QS. Nonetheless, it is not known how QS functions under constant or intermittent flow, how it varies within biofilms or as a function of position along a confined flow, or how surface topography (grooves, crevices, pores) influence QS-mediated communication. We explore these questions using two common pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio cholerae. We identify conditions where flow represses QS and other conditions where QS is activated despite flow, including characterizing geometric and topographic features that influence the QS response. Our studies highlight that, under flow, genetically identical cells do not exhibit phenotypic uniformity with respect to QS in space and time, leading to complex patterns of pathogenesis and colonization. Understanding the ramifications of spatially and temporally non-uniform QS responses in realistic environments will be crucial for successful deployment of synthetic pro- and anti-QS strategies.

Biofilms are communities of microbes embedded in matrices composed of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and have been implicated in both the healthy microbiome and disease states. The immune system recognizes many different bacterial patterns, molecules, and antigens, but these components can be camouflaged in the biofilm mode of growth. Instead, immune cells come into contact with components of the EPS matrix, a diverse, hydrated mixture of extracellular DNA (bacterial and host), proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. As bacterial cells transition from planktonic to biofilm-associated they produce small molecules, which can increase inflammation, induce cell death, and even cause necrosis. To survive, invading bacteria must overcome the epithelial barrier, host microbiome, complement, and a variety of leukocytes. If bacteria can evade these initial cell populations they have an increased chance at surviving and causing ongoing disease in the host. Planktonic cells are readily cleared, but biofilms reduce the effectiveness of both polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages. In addition, in the presence of these cells, biofilm formation is actively enhanced, and components of host immune cells are assimilated into the EPS matrix. While pathogenic biofilms contribute to states of chronic inflammation, probiotic Lactobacillus biofilms cause a negligible immune response and, in states of inflammation, exhibit robust antiinflammatory properties. These probiotic biofilms colonize and protect the gut and vagina, and have been implicated in improved healing of damaged skin.

Recent work suggests that cells add a constant size between birth and division (adder model). However, it is not known how cell size homeostasis is influenced by the existence of heterogeneous microenvironments, such as those during biofilm formation. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 can use diverse energy sources on a range of surfaces via extracellular electron transport (EET), which can impact growth, metabolism, and size diversity. Here, we track bacterial surface communities at single-cell resolution to show that not only do bacterial motility appendages influence the transition from two- to three-dimensional biofilm growth and control postdivisional cell fates, they strongly impact cell size homeostasis. For every generation, we find that the average growth rate for cells that stay on the surface and continue to divide (nondetaching population) and that for cells that detach before their next division (detaching population) are roughly constant. However, the growth rate distribution is narrow for the nondetaching population, but broad for the detaching population in each generation. Interestingly, the appendage deletion mutants (ΔpilA, ΔmshA-D, Δflg) have significantly broader growth rate distributions than that of the wild type for both detaching and nondetaching populations, which suggests that Shewanella appendages are important for sensing and integrating environmental inputs that contribute to size homeostasis. Moreover, our results suggest multiplexing of appendages for sensing and motility functions contributes to cell size dysregulation.

Of particular importance are organisms like sponges and macroalgae and their associated microbiome. Planctomycetes, abundant in macroalgae biofilms, are promising producers of bioactive compounds since they share characteristics, like large genomes and complex life cycles, with the most bioactive bacteria, the Actinobacteria. Furthermore, genome mining revealed the presence of secondary metabolite pathway genes or clusters in 13 analyzed Planctomycetes genomes. In order to assess the antimicrobial production of a large and diverse collection of Planctomycetes isolated from macroalgae from the Portuguese coast, molecular, and bioactivity assays were performed in 40 bacteria from several taxa. Two genes commonly associated with the production of bioactive compounds, nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and polyketide synthases (PKS) genes were screened. Molecular analysis revealed that 95% of the planctomycetes potentially have one or both secondary bioactive genes; 85% amplified with PKS-I primers and 55% with NRPS primers. Some of the amplified genes were confirmed to be involved in secondary metabolite pathways. Using bioinformatic tools their biosynthetic pathways were predicted. The secondary metabolite genomic potential of strains LF1, UC8, and FC18 was assessed using in silico analysis of their genomes. Aqueous and organic extracts of the Planctomycetes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against an environmental Escherichia coli, E. coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, and a clinical isolate of Candida albicans. The screening assays showed a high number of planctomycetes with bioactive extracts revealing antifungal (43%) and antibacterial (54%) activity against C. albicans and B. subtilis, respectively. Bioactivity was observed in strains from Rhodopirellula lusitana, R. rubra, R. baltica, Roseimaritima ulvae, and Planctomyces brasiliensis. This study confirms the bioactive capacity of Planctomycetes to produce antimicrobial compounds and encourages further studies envisaging molecule isolation and characterization for the possible discovery of new drugs.

Formation of clumps, which are large, tightly packed groups of cells held together by fibrin(ogen), has been demonstrated to be important for S. aureus virulence and immune evasion. Clumps of cells are able to avoid detection by the host's immune system due to a fibrin(ogen) coat that acts as a shield, and the size of the clumps facilitates evasion of phagocytosis.

The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate differences in the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on unmodified polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ETTs and on ETTs etched with a fungal lipase, Rhizopus arrhizus, to create nanoscale surface features. These differences were evaluated using an in vitro model of the pediatric airway to simulate a ventilated patient in the pediatric intensive care unit. Each experiment was run for 24 hours and was supported by computational models of the ETT. Dynamic conditions within the ETT had an impact on the location of bacterial growth within the tube. These conditions also quantitatively affected bacterial growth especially within the areas of tube curvature. Most importantly, experiments in the in vitro model revealed a 2.7 log reduction in the number (colony forming units/mL) of P. aeruginosa on the nanoroughened ETTs compared to the untreated PVC ETTs after 24 hours. This reduction in total colony forming units/mL along the x-axis of the tube was similar to previous studies completed for Staphylococcus aureus.

Among QS-regulated processes mediated through autoinducers are aggregation, biofilm formation, bioluminescence, and sporulation. Autoinducers are therefore master regulators of bacterial lifestyles. For over 10 years, mathematical modelling of QS has sought, in parallel to experimental discoveries, to elucidate the mechanisms regulating this process. In this review, we present the progress in mathematical modelling of QS, highlighting the various theoretical approaches that have been used and discussing some of the insights that have emerged.

The objective of this study was to identify various etiologies for peri-implantitis and to establish a classification system based on the pathogenesis.

Its different strains' chromosomes greatly vary in number (karyotype). This study isolates two novel centromeric loci (CEN1 and CEN2), which support both the yeast's autonomous replication and the stable maintenance of plasmids. In the sequenced genome of the D. bruxellensis strain CBS 2499, CEN1 and CEN2 are each present in one copy. They differ from the known point CEN elements, and their biological activity is retained within ~900-1300 bp DNA segments. CEN1 and CEN2 have features of both point and regional centromeres: They contain conserved DNA elements, ARSs, short repeats, one tRNA gene, and transposon-like elements within less than 1 kb. Our discovery of a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) next to CEN2 is the first report of such transposons in yeast. The transformants carrying circular plasmids with cloned CEN1 and CEN2 undergo a phenotypic switch: They form fluffy colonies and produce three times more biofilm. The introduction of extra copies of CEN1 and CEN2 promotes both genome rearrangements and ploidy shifts, with these effects mediated by homologous recombination (between circular plasmid and genome centromere copy) or by chromosome breakage when integrated. Also, the proximity of the MITE-like transposon to CEN2 could translocate CEN2 within the genome or cause chromosomal breaks, so promoting genome dynamics. With extra copies of CEN1 and CEN2, the yeast's enhanced capacities to rearrange its genome and to change its gene expression could increase its abilities for exploiting new and demanding niches.

We performed complex physiological and metagenomic analyses to determine which microorganisms are the main driving agents responsible for self-purification of the mine waters and identify metabolic processes responsible for the observed features. SEM and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed accumulation of heavy metals on the mat surface, whereas, sorption experiments showed that neither microbial mats were completely saturated with heavy metals present in the mine waters, indicating that they have a large potential to absorb significant quantities of metal. The metagenomic analysis revealed that Methylococcaceae and Methylophilaceae families were the most abundant in both communities, moreover, it strongly suggest that backbones of both mats were formed by filamentous bacteria, such as Leptothrix, Thiothrix, and Beggiatoa. The Kowary bacterial community was enriched with the Helicobacteraceae family, whereas the Zloty Stok community consist mainly of Sphingomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Caulobacteraceae families. Functional (culture-based) and metagenome (sequence-based) analyses showed that bacteria involved in immobilization of heavy metals, rather than those engaged in mobilization, were the main driving force within the analyzed communities. In turn, a comparison of functional genes revealed that the biofilm formation and heavy metal resistance (HMR) functions are more desirable in microorganisms engaged in water purification than the ability to utilize heavy metals in the respiratory process (oxidation-reduction). These findings provide insight on the activity of bacteria leading, from biofilm formation to self-purification, of mine waters contaminated with heavy metals.

These proteins are denoted EbfG1-4 (enable biofilm formation with a GG-motif). Furthermore, the conserved cysteine of the peptidase domain of the Synpcc7942_1133 gene product (dubbed PteB for peptidase transporter essential for biofilm) is crucial for biofilm development and is required for efficient secretion of the GG-motif containing proteins. Transcriptional profiling of ebfG1-4 indicated elevated transcript levels in the biofilm-forming mutant compared to wild type (WT). However, these transcripts decreased, acutely but transiently, when the mutant was cultured in extracellular fluids from a WT culture, and biofilm formation was inhibited. We propose that WT cells secrete inhibitor(s) that suppress transcription of ebfG1-4, whereas secretion of the inhibitor(s) is impaired in the biofilm-forming mutant, leading to synthesis and secretion of EbfG1-4 and supporting the formation of biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Rami Parnasa"},{"name":"Elad Nagar"},{"name":"Eleonora Sendersky"},{"name":"Ziv Reich"},{"name":"Ryan Simkovsky"},{"name":"Susan Golden"},{"name":"Rakefet Schwarz"}],"keywords":[]},"article77":{"pmid":"27558694","title":"Disruption of the carA gene in Pseudomonas syringae results in reduced fitness and alters motility.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Pseudomonas syringae infects diverse plant species and is widely used in the study of effector function and the molecular basis of disease.

Both groups received oral hygiene education and scaling and root planing. Clinical evaluation was performed using plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), pocket probing depth (PPD), gingival recession (GR), and clinical attachment level (CAL) before instrumentation (baseline) and at 3 and 6 months. The prevalence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida dubliniensis in subgingival biofilm was determined by polymerase chain reaction. The data were statistically analyzed considering p < 0.05. Clinical conditions improved between baseline and 3 months after periodontal treatment. However, NS had a better clinical response, presenting greater PPD reduction and CAL increase in comparison to SM. Periodontal treatment reduced the levels of P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and T. forsythia individually after 3 months for the NS group and after 6 months for both groups. The prevalence of Candida species was markedly higher in SM than in NS at all time points evaluated.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of Syngonanthus nitens (S. nitens) extract that was not loaded (E) or loaded (SE) into a liquid crystal precursor system (S) for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) with Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the microdilution technique. Additionally, we performed hyphae inhibition and biofilm tests. Finally, experimental candidiasis was evaluated in in vivo models with Wistar female rats. The results showed effective antifungal activity after incorporation into S for all strains tested, with MICs ranging from 31.2 to 62.5 μg/mL. Microscopic observation of SE revealed an absence of filamentous cells 24 h of exposure to a concentration of 31.2 μg/mL. E demonstrated no effective action against biofilms, though SE showed inhibition against biofilms of all strains. In the in vivo experiment, SE was effective in the treatment of infection after only two days of treatment and was more effective than E and amphotericin B. The S. nitens is active against Candida albicans (C. albicans) and the antifungal potential is being enhanced after incorporation into liquid crystal precursor systems (LCPS).

Cellular drug accumulation and assessments of intracellular activities were performed using Vero cell culture. SEM revealed that nimbolide caused significant membrane damage and lysis of the S. aureus cells. The biofilm structure was disrupted, and the biofilm formation was greatly reduced in the presence of nimbolide as examined by SEM. The level of accumulation of nimbolide in Vero cells incubated for 24 h is relatively higher than that of ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (Cc/Ce for nimbolide > ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid).

Mannose-resistant Klebsiella-like (Mrk) hemagglutinins are critical for K pneumonia biofilm development, and the expression of the genes encoding these proteins is activated by a 3',5'-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP)-regulated transcription factor, MrkH. To gain insight into MrkH function, we performed structural and biochemical analyses. Data revealed MrkH to be a monomer with a two-domain architecture consisting of a PilZ C-domain connected to an N domain that unexpectedly also harbors a PilZ-like fold. Comparison of apo- and c-di-GMP-bound MrkH structures reveals a large 138° interdomain rotation that is induced by binding an intercalated c-di-GMP dimer. c-di-GMP interacts with PilZ C-domain motifs 1 and 2 (RxxxR and D/NxSxxG) and a newly described c-di-GMP-binding motif in the MrkH N domain. Strikingly, these c-di-GMP-binding motifs also stabilize an open state conformation in apo MrkH via contacts from the PilZ motif 1 to residues in the C-domain motif 2 and the c-di-GMP-binding N-domain motif. Use of the same regions in apo structure stabilization and c-di-GMP interaction allows distinction between the states. Indeed, domain reorientation by c-di-GMP complexation with MrkH, which leads to a highly compacted structure, suggests a mechanism by which the protein is activated to bind DNA. To our knowledge, MrkH represents the first instance of specific DNA binding mediated by PilZ domains.

Furthermore, we found that LeuO directly bound to the carRS promoter and that ToxR-dependent activation of leuO transcription regulated carRS transcription in response to bile salts. Our results suggest that LeuO functions downstream of ToxR to modulate carRS expression in response to environmental cues. This study extends the functional role of ToxR and LeuO in environmental adaptation to include cell surface remodeling and CAMP resistance.","authors":[{"name":"X Renee Bina"},{"name":"Mondraya F Howard"},{"name":"Vanessa M Ante"},{"name":"James E Bina"}],"keywords":[]},"article107":{"pmid":"27550437","title":"Lipid composition in a strain of Bacillus subtilis, a producer of iturin A lipopeptides that are active against uropathogenic bacteria.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Urinary tract infections are a common disease in humans.

The biological activity of extracted LPs was confirmed by examining extracts from I'1a cultures against uropathogenic bacteria that had been isolated from biofilms on urinary catheters. Compared with cultures of DSM 3257, which produce surfactin at a relatively low level, the extract obtained from strain I'1a exhibited a greater inhibitory effect against both planktonic and sessile forms of Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, cyclic LP biosurfactants may disturb the integrity of cytoplasmic membranes; therefore, we investigated the effects of synthetized LPs on fatty acids and phospholipids of B. subtilis. LPs and lipids were analyzed using GC-MS, LC-MS/MS and MALDI-TOF/TOF techniques. Compared with B. subtilis DSM 3257, membranes of the I'1a strain were characterized by an increased amount of anteiso fatty acids and a ten-fold higher ratio of phosphatidylglycerol (PG)-to-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Interestingly, in cultures of B. subtilis DSM 3257 supplemented with LP extracts of the I'1a strain, the PG-to-PE ratio was fourfold higher, and the amount of anteiso fatty acids was also increased.

An N1-substituted compound showed very strong activity against the biofilms formed by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans but was previously shown to be toxic against various eukaryotic cell lines. In contrast, 2N-substituted compounds were nontoxic and active against biofilms formed by Gram-negative bacteria and C. albicans but had reduced activity against biofilms formed by Gram-positive bacteria. In an attempt to develop nontoxic compounds with potent activity against biofilms formed by Gram-positive bacteria for application in antibiofilm coatings for medical implants, we synthesized novel compounds with substituents at both the N1 and 2N positions and tested these compounds for antibiofilm activity and toxicity. Interestingly, most of these N1-,2N-disubstituted 5-aryl-2-aminoimidazoles showed very strong activity against biofilms formed by Gram-positive bacteria and C. albicans in various setups with biofilms formed by monospecies and mixed species but lost activity against biofilms formed by Gram-negative bacteria. In light of application of these compounds as anti-infective coatings on orthopedic implants, toxicity against two bone cell lines and the functionality of these cells were tested. The N1-,2N-disubstituted 5-aryl-2-aminoimidazoles in general did not affect the viability of bone cells and even induced calcium deposition.

Flo11p is implicated in many developmental processes, including flocculation, formation of pseudohyphae, agar invasion, and formation of microbial mats and biofilms. However, Flo11p mediates different processes in different yeast strains. To investigate the mechanisms by which FLO11 determines these differences in colony morphology, flocculation, and invasion, we studied gene structure, function, and expression levels. Nonflocculent Saccharomyces cerevisiae Σ1278b cells exhibited significantly higher FLO11 mRNA expression, especially in the stationary phase, than highly flocculent S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus. The two strains varied in cell surface hydrophobicity, and Flo11p contributed significantly to surface hydrophobicity in S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus but not in strain Σ1278b. Sequencing of the FLO11 gene in S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus revealed strain-specific differences, including a 15-amino-acid insertion in the adhesion domain. Flo11p adhesion domains from strain Σ1278b and S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus were expressed and used to coat magnetic beads. The adhesion domain from each strain bound preferentially to homologous cells, and the preferences were independent of the cells in which the adhesion domains were produced. These results are consistent with the idea that strain-specific variations in the amino acid sequences in the adhesion domains cause different Flo11p flocculation activities. The results also imply that strain-specific differences in expression levels, posttranslational modifications, and allelic differences outside the adhesion domains have little effect on flocculation. IMPORTANCE As a nonmotile organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae employs the cell surface flocculin Flo11/Muc1 as an important means of adapting to environmental change. However, there is a great deal of strain variation in the expression of Flo11-dependent phenotypes, including flocculation. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of this strain-specific phenotypic variability. Our data indicate that strain-specific differences in the level of flocculation result from significant sequence differences in the FLO11 alleles and do not depend on quantitative differences in FLO11 expression or on surface hydrophobicity. We further have shown that beads coated with amino-terminal domain peptide bind preferentially to homologous cells. These data show that variability in the structure of the Flo11 adhesion domain may thus be an important determinant of membership in microbial communities and hence may drive selection and evolution.

Here, we report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae flocculins Flo11p and Flo1p have similar β-aggregation-prone sequences and are similarly stimulated by shear force, despite being nonhomologous. Shear from vortex mixing induced the formation of small flocs in cells expressing either adhesin. After the addition of Ca(2+), yeast cells from vortex-sheared populations showed greatly enhanced flocculation and displayed more pronounced thioflavin-bright surface nanodomains. At high concentrations, amyloidophilic dyes inhibited Flo1p- and Flo11p-mediated agar invasion and the shear-induced increase in flocculation. Consistent with these results, atomic force microscopy of Flo11p showed successive force-distance peaks characteristic of sequentially unfolding tandem repeat domains, like Flo1p and Als5p. Flo11p-expressing cells bound together through homophilic interactions with adhesion forces of up to 700 pN and rupture lengths of up to 600 nm. These results are consistent with the potentiation of yeast flocculation by shear-induced formation of high-avidity domains of clustered adhesins at the cell surface, similar to the activation of Candida albicans adhesin Als5p. Thus, yeast adhesins from three independent gene families use similar force-dependent interactions to drive cell adhesion. IMPORTANCE The Saccharomyces cerevisiae flocculins mediate the formation of cellular aggregates and biofilm-like mats, useful in clearing yeast from fermentations. An important property of fungal adhesion proteins, including flocculins, is the ability to form catch bonds, i.e., bonds that strengthen under tension. This strengthening is based, at least in part, on increased avidity of binding due to clustering of adhesins in cell surface nanodomains. This clustering depends on amyloid-like β-aggregation of short amino acid sequences in the adhesins. In Candida albicans adhesin Als5, shear stress from vortex mixing can unfold part of the protein to expose aggregation-prone sequences, and then adhesins aggregate into nanodomains. We therefore tested whether shear stress from mixing can increase flocculation activity by potentiating similar protein remodeling and aggregation in the flocculins. The results demonstrate the applicability of the Als adhesin model and provide a rational framework for the enhancement or inhibition of flocculation in industrial applications.

Current treatment for these infections is based on only four available drug classes. This limited therapeutic arsenal and the emergence of drug-resistant strains are a matter of concern due to the growing number of patients to be treated, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Adaptation of fungi to drug pressure involves transcriptional regulation, in which chromatin dynamics and histone modifications play a major role. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histones and actively participate in controlling stress responses.

In spite of 15 years of studies on the psychrophilic biofilm-producing Candidatus Altiarchaeum hamiconexum and its close relatives, very little is known about the phylogenetic and functional diversity of the widespread free-living marine members of this taxon. From methanogenic sediments in the White Oak River Estuary, NC, USA, we sequenced a single cell amplified genome (SAG), WOR_SM1_SCG, and used it to identify and refine two high-quality genomes from metagenomes, WOR_SM1_79 and WOR_SM1_86-2, from the same site. These three genomic reconstructions form a monophyletic group, which also includes three previously published genomes from metagenomes from terrestrial springs and a SAG from Sakinaw Lake in a group previously designated as pMC2A384. A synapomorphic mutation in the Altiarchaeales tRNA synthetase β subunit, pheT, caused the protein to be encoded as two subunits at non-adjacent loci. Consistent with the terrestrial spring clades, our estuarine genomes contained a near-complete autotrophic metabolism, H2 or CO as potential electron donors, a reductive acetyl-CoA pathway for carbon fixation, and methylotroph-like NADP(H)-dependent dehydrogenase. Phylogenies based on 16S rRNA genes and concatenated conserved proteins identified two distinct sub-clades of Altiarchaeales, Alti-1 populated by organisms from actively flowing springs, and Alti-2 which was more widespread, diverse, and not associated with visible mats. The core Alti-1 genome suggested Alti-1 is adapted for the stream environment with lipopolysaccharide production capacity and extracellular hami structures. The core Alti-2 genome suggested members of this clade are free-living with distinct mechanisms for energy maintenance, motility, osmoregulation, and sulfur redox reactions. These data suggested that the hamus structures found in Candidatus Altiarchaeum hamiconexum are not present outside of stream-adapted Altiarchaeales. Homologs to a Na(+) transporter and membrane bound coenzyme A disulfide reductase that were unique to the brackish sediment Alti-2 genomes, could indicate adaptations to the estuarine, sulfur-rich environment.

Until today, the only licensed vaccine against Mtb is the live attenuated M. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which has variable levels of protection against the pulmonary form of infection. The quest for a new vaccine is a priority given the rise of multidrug-resistant Mtb around the world, as well as the tremendous burden imposed by latent TB. The objective of this study was to evaluate the immunogenicity and capacity of protection of a modified BCG strain (BCGΔBCG1419c) lacking the c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase gene BCG1419c, in diverse mice models. In a previous report, we have shown that BCGΔBCG1419c was capable of increasing biofilm production and after intravenous infection of immunocompetent mice; this strain persisted longer in lungs than parental BCG Pasteur. This led us to hypothesize that BCGΔBCG1419c might therefore possess some advantage as vaccine candidate. Our results in this report indicate that compared to conventional BCG, vaccination with BCGΔBCG1419c induced a better activation of specific T-lymphocytes population, was equally effective in preventing weight loss despite being used at lower dose, reduced tissue damage (pneumonic scores), increased local IFNγ(+) T cells, and diminished bacterial burden in lungs of BALB/c mice infected intratracheally with high dose Mtb H37Rv to induce progressive TB. Moreover, vaccination with BCGΔBCG1419c improved resistance to reactivation after immunosuppression induced by corticosterone in a murine model of chronic infection similar to latent TB. Furthermore, despite showing increased persistence in immunocompetent mice, BCGΔBCG1419c was as attenuated as parental BCG in nude mice.

Biofilms consist of bacterial aggregates enveloped by a self-produced matrix attached to the surface. Ca(2+) ions promote the formation of biofilms, and enhance their stability, viscosity, and strength. Bisphosphonates exhibit a high affinity for Ca(2+) ions, and may inhibit the formation of biofilms by acting as sequestering agents for Ca(2+) ions. Although the antibacterial activity of bisphosphonates is well known, research into their anti-biofilm behavior is still in its early stages. In this study, we describe the synthesis of a new thin coating composed of poly(styryl bisphosphonate) grafted onto oxidized polypropylene films for anti-biofilm applications. This grafting process was performed by graft polymerization of styryl bisphosphonate vinylic monomer onto O2 plasma-treated polypropylene films. The surface modification of the polypropylene films was confirmed using surface measurements, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and water contact angle goniometry. Significant inhibition of biofilm formation was achieved for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

It is unclear how natural regulation of inflammation affects the periodontal biofilm. Promoters of active resolution of inflammation, including resolvin E1 (RvE1), effectively treat inflammatory periodontitis in animal models. The goals of this study were 1) to compare periodontal tissue gene expression in different clinical conditions, 2) to determine the impact of local inflammation on the composition of subgingival bacteria, and 3) to understand how inflammation impacts these changes. Two clinically relevant experiments were performed in rats: prevention and treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis with RvE1 topical treatment. The gingival transcriptome was evaluated by RNA sequencing of mRNA. The composition of the subgingival microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA sequencing. Periodontitis was assessed by bone morphometric measurements and histomorphometry of block sections. H&E and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining were used to characterize and quantify inflammatory changes. RvE1 treatment prevented bone loss in ligature-induced periodontitis. Osteoclast density and inflammatory cell infiltration in the RvE1 groups were lower than those in the placebo group. RvE1 treatment reduced expression of inflammation-related genes, returning the expression profile to one more similar to health. Treatment of established periodontitis with RvE1 reversed bone loss, reversed inflammatory gene expression, and reduced osteoclast density. Assessment of the rat subgingival microbiota after RvE1 treatment revealed marked changes in both prevention and treatment experiments.

Here, with the aim of constructing a novel live attenuated Salmonella vaccine candidate, we firstly analyzed the impact of the absence of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) in Salmonella virulence. C-di-GMP is an intracellular second messenger that controls a wide range of bacterial processes, including biofilm formation and synthesis of virulence factors, and also modulates the host innate immune response. Our results showed that a Salmonella multiple mutant in the twelve genes encoding diguanylate cyclase proteins that, as a consequence, cannot synthesize c-di-GMP, presents a moderate attenuation in a systemic murine infection model. An additional mutation of the rpoS gene resulted in a synergic attenuating effect that led to a highly attenuated strain, referred to as ΔXIII, immunogenic enough to protect mice against a lethal oral challenge of a S. Typhimurium virulent strain. ΔXIII immunogenicity relied on activation of both antibody and cell mediated immune responses characterized by the production of opsonizing antibodies and the induction of significant levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-17 and IL-10. ΔXIII was unable to form a biofilm and did not survive under desiccation conditions, indicating that it could be easily eliminated from the environment.

However, after 48 h of culture, the pellicle started to express spoIID in specific area corresponding to protrusions, and after 96 h both the ring and the whole pellicle expressed spoIID. Spore counts and microscopy observations of the ring and the pellicle harvested separately confirmed these results and revealed that sporulation occured 24 h-later in the pellicle comparatively to the ring, although both structures contained nearly 100% spores after 96 h of culture. We hypothesize that two mechanisms, due to microenvironments in the biofilm, can explain this difference. First, the ring experiences a decreased concentration of nutrients earlier than the pellicle, because of a lower exchange area with the culture medium. An second, the ring is exposed to partial dryness. Both reasons could speed up sporulation in this biofilm structure. Our results also suggest that spores in the biofilm display a phenotypic heterogeneity. These observations might be of particular significance for the food industry, since the biofilm part sticking to container walls - the ring - is likely to contain spores and will therefore resist both to washing and to cleaning procedures, and will be able to restart a new biofilm when food production has resumed.

The nearest neighbors of Ochrophyta in the phylogenetic tree appear to be almost exclusively bacterivorous, whereas the hypothesis of plastid acquisition by the ancestors of the ochrophyte lineage suggests an ability to engulf eukaryotic alga. In line with this hypothesis, the heterotrophic predator at the base of the ochrophyte lineage may be regarded as a model for the ochrophyte ancestor. Here, we present a new genus and species of marine free-living heterotrophic heterokont Develorapax marinus, which falls into an isolated heterokont cluster, along with the marine flagellate Developayella elegans, and is able to engulf eukaryotic cells. Together with environmental sequences D. marinus and D. elegans form a class-level clade Developea nom. nov. represented by species adapted to different environmental conditions and with a wide geographical distribution. The position of Developea among Heterokonta in large-scale phylogenetic tree is discussed. We propose that members of the Developea clade represent a model for transition from bacterivory to a predatory feeding mode by selection for larger prey. Presumably, such transition in the grazing strategy is possible in the presence of bacterial biofilms or aggregates expected in eutrophic environment, and has likely occurred in the ochrophyte ancestor.

Based upon studies in mammals, there is considerable evidence to suggest that, besides impairing the immune system, cortisol can have a direct effect on bacterial cells. Hitherto, this intriguing field of microbial endocrinology has remained largely unexplored in aquatic diseases. The present study investigated in vitro the impact of cortisol on phenotypic traits of the fresh water fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare. Colonies obtained from the highly virulent (HV) isolates resulted in significantly larger and more spreading colonies compared to those from the low virulent (LV) isolates. High cortisol doses added displayed a direct effect on the bacterial cells and induced a significant decrease in colony size. An additional intriguing finding was the inverse relationship between cortisol concentrations added to the broth and the spreading character of colonies retrieved, with higher cortisol doses resulting in less rhizoid to rough and even smooth colony formation (the latter only in the LV trout isolate), suggesting a dose-response effect. The loss of the rhizoid appearance of the F. columnare colonies upon administration of cortisol, and hence the loss of motility, might indicate a phenotypic change to the biofilm state.

Additionally, inactivation of condensins dramatically reduced the virulence of the bacterium in a murine model of lung infection. These data demonstrate that condensins are involved in the differentiation of P. aeruginosa and reveal their importance for pathogenicity.","authors":[{"name":"Hang Zhao"},{"name":"April L Clevenger"},{"name":"Jerry W Ritchey"},{"name":"Helen I Zgurskaya"},{"name":"Valentin V Rybenkov"}],"keywords":[]},"article167":{"pmid":"27528069","title":"PARSING UNKNOWNS.","date":"2018-03-06","abs":"Sarah Webb explores techniques researchers are using to elucidate biofilm structure and characterize the makeup of microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah Webb"}],"keywords":[]},"article168":{"pmid":"27527785","title":"Candida tropicalis from veterinary and human sources shows similar in vitro hemolytic activity, antifungal biofilm susceptibility and pathogenesis against Caenorhabditis elegans.","date":"2017-10-08","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro hemolytic activity and biofilm antifungal susceptibility of veterinary and human Candida tropicalis strains, as well as their pathogenesis against Caenorhabditis elegans.

Biofilm susceptibility to itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin was assessed using broth microdilution assay. The in vivo evaluation of strain pathogenicity was investigated using the nematode C. elegans. Hemolytic factor was observed in 95% of the strains and 97.5% of the isolates showed ability to form biofilm. Caspofungin and amphotericin B showed better results than azole antifungals against mature biofilms. Paradoxical effect on mature biofilm metabolic activity was observed at elevated concentrations of caspofungin (8-64μg/mL). Azole antifungals were not able to inhibit mature C. tropicalis biofilms, even at the higher tested concentrations. High mortality rates of C. elegans were observed when the worms were exposed to with C. tropicalis strains, reaching up to 96%, 96h after exposure of the worms to C. tropicalis strains. These results reinforce the high pathogenicity of C. tropicalis from veterinary and human sources and show the effectiveness of caspofungin and amphotericin B against mature biofilms of this species.

This prolonged therapy is likely due to the presence of M. tuberculosis persisters, which exhibit antibiotic tolerance. Inorganic polyphosphate [poly(P)] is a key regulatory molecule in the M. tuberculosis stringent response mediating antibiotic tolerance. The polyphosphate kinase PPK1 is responsible for poly(P) synthesis in M. tuberculosis, while the exopolyphosphatases PPX1 and PPX2 and the GTP synthase PPK2 are responsible for poly(P) hydrolysis. In the present study, we show by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry that poly(P)-accumulating M. tuberculosis mutant strains deficient in ppx1 or ppk2 had significantly lower intracellular levels of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and 1-deoxy-xylulose-5-phosphate. Real-time PCR revealed decreased expression of genes in the G3P synthesis pathway in each mutant. The ppx1-deficient mutant also showed a significant accumulation of metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as altered arginine and NADH metabolism. Each poly(P)-accumulating strain showed defective biofilm formation, while deficiency of ppk2 was associated with increased sensitivity to plumbagin and meropenem and deficiency of ppx1 led to enhanced susceptibility to clofazimine. A DNA vaccine expressing ppx1 and ppk2, together with two other members of the M. tuberculosis stringent response, M. tuberculosis rel and sigE, did not show protective activity against aerosol challenge with M. tuberculosis, but vaccine-induced immunity enhanced the killing activity of isoniazid in a murine model of chronic tuberculosis. In summary, poly(P)-regulating factors of the M. tuberculosis stringent response play an important role in M. tuberculosis metabolism, biofilm formation, and antibiotic sensitivity in vivo.","authors":[{"name":"Yu-Min Chuang"},{"name":"Noton K Dutta"},{"name":"Chien-Fu Hung"},{"name":"T-C Wu"},{"name":"Harvey Rubin"},{"name":"Petros C Karakousis"}],"keywords":[]},"article172":{"pmid":"27527084","title":"A Novel RNase 3/ECP Peptide for Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Eradication That Combines Antimicrobial, Lipopolysaccharide Binding, and Cell-Agglutinating Activities.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Eradication of established biofilm communities of pathogenic Gram-negative species is one of the pending challenges for the development of new antimicrobial agents. In particular, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the main dreaded nosocomial species, with a tendency to form organized microbial communities that offer an enhanced resistance to conventional antibiotics. We describe here an engineered antimicrobial peptide (AMP) which combines bactericidal activity with a high bacterial cell agglutination and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affinity. The RN3(5-17P22-36) peptide is a 30-mer derived from the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), a host defense RNase secreted by eosinophils upon infection, with a wide spectrum of antipathogen activity. The protein displays high biofilm eradication activity that is not dependent on its RNase catalytic activity, as evaluated by using an active site-defective mutant. On the other hand, the peptide encompasses both the LPS-binding and aggregation-prone regions from the parental protein, which provide the appropriate structural features for the peptide's attachment to the bacterial exopolysaccharide layer and further improved removal of established biofilms. Moreover, the peptide's high cationicity and amphipathicity promote the cell membrane destabilization action. The results are also compared side by side with other reported AMPs effective against either planktonic and/or biofilm forms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1. The ECP and its derived peptide are unique in combining high bactericidal potency and cell agglutination activity, achieving effective biofilm eradication at a low micromolar range.

The enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis are not proper virulence factors, but they are necessary for cell function. The deletion of the genes encoding those enzymes often results in an attenuation of virulence.

To identify compounds capable of lowering c-di-GMP levels in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we screened 5000 compounds for their potential c-di-GMP-lowering effect using a recently developed c-di-GMP biosensor strain. Our screen identified the anti-cancerous drug doxorubicin as a potent c-di-GMP inhibitor. In addition, the drug decreased the transcription of many biofilm-related genes. However, despite its effect on the c-di-GMP content in P. aeruginosa, doxorubicin was unable to inhibit biofilm formation or disperse established biofilms. On the contrary, the drug was found to promote P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, possibly through release of extracellular DNA from a subpopulation of killed bacteria.

A multiple species reactive-transport model was developed to explain the role of biofilms in DBPs formation by accounting for the simultaneous transport and interactions of disinfectants, organic compounds, and biomass. Using parameter values from experimental studies in the literature, the model equations were solved to predict chlorine decay and microbial regrowth dynamics in an actual DWDS, and trihalomethanes (THMs) formation in a pilot-scale distribution system simulator. The model's capability of reproducing the measured concentrations of free chlorine, suspended biomass, and THMs under different hydrodynamic and temperature conditions was demonstrated. The contribution of bacteria-derived precursors to the total THMs production was found to have a significant dependence on the system's hydraulics, seasonal variables, and the quality of the treated drinking water. Under system conditions that promoted fast bacterial re-growth, the transformation of non-microbial into microbial carbon DBP precursors by the biofilms showed a noticeable effect on the kinetics of THMs formation, especially when a high initial chlorine dose was applied. These conditions included elevated water temperature and high concentrations of nutrients in the influent water. The fraction of THMs formed from microbial sources was found to reach a peak of 12% of the total produced THMs under the investigated scenarios.

GBS can also cause severe infections in pregnant women and adults with underlying disease, as well as mild diseases, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs). GBS strains exhibit 10 different serotypes, and the identification of serotype distribution is important epidemiologically. The role of biofilm production is one of the virulence factors that has been discussed in the pathogenesis of GBS infections. Although resistance to penicillin and ampicillin has not been documented in GBS, different rates of resistance has been reported for the alternative antibiotics to penicillin. The aim of this study was to investigate the serotype distribution, the ability of biofilm formation and the antibiotic susceptibilities of S.agalactiae strains isolated from urine cultures. A total of 60 strains were included in the study, 40 of them were isolated from patients (38 female 2 male; mean age: 36.7 years) with urinary tract complaints whose cultures yielded single type of colonies in the number of ≥ 50.000 cfu/ml, whereas 20 of them were isolated from patients (19 female 1 male; mean age: 37.2 years) without urinary tract complaints whose cultures yielded mixed colonies in the number of ≤ 20.000 cfu/ml. Chromogenic media were used for the isolation and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. The isolates were then serotyped by latex agglutination method and their antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion method recommended by CLSI documents. Biofilm formation of the strains were investigated by microplate and Congo red agar (CRA) methods. In our study, the most frequently detected serotypes were V (n= 18; 30%) and II (n= 14; 23.3%), followed by serotype Ia (n= 10; 16.7%), III (n= 9; 15%), Ib (n= 3; 5%), VI (n= 1; 1.7%) and VII (n= 1; 1.7%). Serotype IV, VIII and IX were not detected, while four (6.7%) isolates were untypeable. Serotype V (13/40; 32.5%) and serotip II (6/20; 30%) were in the first line among the strains isolated from patient and control groups, respectively. All of the GBS isolates were found susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin and cefotaxime. The rates of resistance against ofloxacin, erythromycin and clindamycin in patient group were found as 22.5%, %10 and 5%, respectively. In the control group resistance rates against erythromycin and clindamycin were both 10%, while no resistance was detected to the other antibiotics. The ofloxacin resistance in the patient group was found significantly higher than that of control group (p= 0.02). By microplate method, the percentage of moderate/strong biofilm producers was found as 42.5% (17/40) in the patient group and 20% (4/20) in the control group, however the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p= 0.08). All GBS strains were detected as positive by the CRA method, and it has been suggested that this might have been due to the binding of Congo red to sialic acid found in the GBS capsule, therefore this method thought to be improper for the investigation of biofilm formation in GBS strains. In conclusion, the most frequent serotypes of the GBS urinary isolates in our study were similar with the frequent serotypes reported in other studies. Our data have pointed out that the biofilm formation of GBS may not play a role in the pathogenesis of UTIs. In the meantime the high quinolone resistance detected in our study should be considered in the treatment of UTI due to GBS.

The present study aimed to investigate the filamentation ability, the expression of virulence genes (ALST1-3, LIP1, LIP4, and SAPT1-4) and the cell damage of C. tropicalis strains with diverse virulences. C. tropicalis exhibited strain-dependent filamentation ability, which was positively correlated with biofilm formation. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis showed that the ALST3 and SAPT3 genes had the highest expression in their corresponding genes for most C. tropicalis.

Presently, the adoption of alternative strategies that promote the elimination of resistant microbial strains from the environment is of utmost importance. This review discusses and analyses several (potential) alternative strategies to current chemical antibiotics. Bacteriophage (or phage) therapy, although not new, makes use of strictly lytic phage particles as an alternative, or a complement, in the antimicrobial treatment of bacterial infections. It is being rediscovered as a safe method, because these biological entities devoid of any metabolic machinery do not possess any affinity whatsoever to eukaryotic cells. Lysin therapy is also recognized as an innovative antimicrobial therapeutic option, since the topical administration of preparations containing purified recombinant lysins with amounts in the order of nanograms, in infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, demonstrated a high therapeutic potential by causing immediate lysis of the target bacterial cells. Additionally, this therapy exhibits the potential to act synergistically when combined with certain chemical antibiotics already available on the market. Another potential alternative antimicrobial therapy is based on the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), amphiphilic polypeptides that cause disruption of the bacterial membrane and can be used in the treatment of bacterial, fungal and viral infections, in the prevention of biofilm formation, and as antitumoral agents. Interestingly, bacteriocins are a common strategy of bacterial defense against other bacterial agents, eliminating the potential opponents of the former and increasing the number of available nutrients in the environment for their own growth. They can be applied in the food industry as biopreservatives and as probiotics, and also in fighting multi-resistant bacterial strains. The use of antibacterial antibodies promises to be extremely safe and effective. Additionally, vaccination emerges as one of the most promising preventive strategies. All these will be tackled in detail in this review paper.

All the channels had the same conditions of light irradiance, temperature, slope, and particle size (sand). Discharge and water surface slope were modified to create a range of hydraulic conditions, with pairs of colonised and non-colonised channels subjected to the same flows. We observed that biofilm slightly modified bed roughness and flow hydraulics, but that highly influenced bed disturbance. Biofilm caused bed scour to occur in patches unevenly distributed along the channel length, as a result of localised weaknesses of the biofilm. Once biofilm was ripped up it was transported in chunks, and sand grains were observed attached to these chunks. In non-colonised sediments the erosion was more homogeneous and the formation and movement of bedforms were observed. On average, bedload rates were 5 times lower when biofilm was present. Overall, the protective effect of the biofilm prevented generalised erosion of the channel and delayed the entrainment and transport of sand grains. Results emphasised the important role of biofilm in the incipient motion of bed-material in stream channels; this role may affect the magnitude and frequency of subsequent river bed processes, notably the onset of bedload and associated channel morpho-dynamics.","authors":[{"name":"Gemma Piqué"},{"name":"Damià Vericat"},{"name":"Sergi Sabater"},{"name":"Ramon J Batalla"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bed roughness"},{"word":"Bedload"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Erosion patterns"},{"word":"Indoor channels"},{"word":"Sand"}]},"article192":{"pmid":"27522205","title":"Hydrogen-based membrane biofilm reactor for tetracycline removal: biodegradation, transformation products, and microbial community.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Tetracycline (TC) in aqueous environment could be reductively degraded by using a hydrogen-based membrane biofilm reactor (H","authors":[{"name":"Banu Taşkan"},{"name":"Özge Hanay"},{"name":"Ergin Taşkan"},{"name":"Mehmet Erdem"},{"name":"Halil Hasar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biological degradation"},{"word":"H2 gas"},{"word":"Membrane biofilm reactor"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Tetracycline"},{"word":"Transformation products"}]},"article193":{"pmid":"27521618","title":"Topical delivery of low-cost protein drug candidates made in chloroplasts for biofilm disruption and uptake by oral epithelial cells.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Protein drugs (PD) are minimally utilized in dental medicine due to high cost and invasive surgical delivery.

We report an exciting low-cost approach using plant-made antimicrobial peptides (PMAMPs) retrocyclin or protegrin with complex secondary structures (cyclic/hairpin) for topical use to control biofilms. The PMAMPs rapidly killed the pathogen Streptococcus mutans and impaired biofilm formation following a single topical application of tooth-mimetic surface.

In addition, we identified a novel role for PMAMPs in delivering drugs to periodontal and gingival cells, 13-48 folds more efficiently than any other tested cell penetrating peptides. Therefore, PDs fused with protegrin expressed in plant cells could potentially play a dual role in delivering therapeutic proteins to gum tissues while killing pathogenic bacteria when delivered as topical oral formulations or in chewing gums.

To evaluate the importance of PatA and PatB of C. jejuni, we constructed patA and patB isogenic mutants and compared their phenotypes with those of the parental strains.

We have found that the expression level of cidB is critical to oxidative stress tolerance of S. mutans, most likely by impacting lrg expression. Intriguingly, the impaired aerobic growth phenotype of the cidB mutant could be restored by the additional loss of either CidA or LrgA. Growth-dependent expression of cid and lrg was demonstrated to be tightly under the control of both CcpA and the VicKR two-component system (TCS), regulators known to play an essential role in controlling major catabolic pathways and cell envelope homeostasis, respectively. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that mutation of cidB resulted in global gene expression changes, comprising major domains of central metabolism and virulence processes, particularly in those involved with oxidative stress resistance. Loss of CidB also significantly changed the expression of genes related to genomic islands (GI) TnSmu1 and TnSmu2, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas system, and toxin-antitoxin (T/A) modules. Taken together, these data show that CidB impinges on the stress response, as well as the fundamental cellular physiology of S. mutans, and further suggest a potential link between Cid/Lrg-mediated cellular processes, S. mutans pathogenicity, and possible programmed growth arrest and cell death mechanisms.","authors":[{"name":"Sang-Joon Ahn"},{"name":"Kelly C Rice"}],"keywords":[]},"article197":{"pmid":"27520811","title":"Distinguishing the Signals of Gingivitis and Periodontitis in Supragingival Plaque: a Cross-Sectional Cohort Study in Malawi.","date":"2020-03-18","abs":"Periodontal disease ranges from gingival inflammation (gingivitis) to the inflammation and loss of tooth-supporting tissues (periodontitis). Previous research has focused mainly on subgingival plaque, but supragingival plaque composition is also known to be associated with disease. Quantitative modeling of bacterial abundances across the natural range of periodontal severities can distinguish which features of disease are associated with particular changes in composition. We assessed a cross-sectional cohort of 962 Malawian women for periodontal disease and used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (V5 to V7 region) to characterize the bacterial compositions of supragingival plaque samples. Associations between bacterial relative abundances and gingivitis/periodontitis were investigated by using negative binomial models, adjusting for epidemiological factors. We also examined bacterial cooccurrence networks to assess community structure. The main differences in supragingival plaque compositions were associated more with gingivitis than periodontitis, including higher bacterial diversity and a greater abundance of particular species. However, even after controlling for gingivitis, the presence of subgingival periodontitis was associated with an altered supragingival plaque. A small number of species were associated with periodontitis but not gingivitis, including members of Prevotella, Treponema, and Selenomonas, supporting a more complex disease model than a linear progression following gingivitis. Cooccurrence networks of periodontitis-associated taxa clustered according to periodontitis across all gingivitis severities. Species including Filifactor alocis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were central to this network, which supports their role in the coaggregation of periodontal biofilms during disease progression. Our findings confirm that periodontitis cannot be considered simply an advanced stage of gingivitis even when only considering supragingival plaque.","authors":[{"name":"Liam Shaw"},{"name":"Ulla Harjunmaa"},{"name":"Ronan Doyle"},{"name":"Simeon Mulewa"},{"name":"Davie Charlie"},{"name":"Ken Maleta"},{"name":"Robin Callard"},{"name":"A Sarah Walker"},{"name":"Francois Balloux"},{"name":"Per Ashorn"},{"name":"Nigel Klein"}],"keywords":[]},"article198":{"pmid":"27520808","title":"Copper Resistance of the Emerging Pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii is an important emerging pathogen that is capable of causing many types of severe infection, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Since A. baumannii can rapidly acquire antibiotic resistance genes, many infections are on the verge of being untreatable, and novel therapies are desperately needed. To investigate the potential utility of copper-based antibacterial strategies against Acinetobacter infections, we characterized copper resistance in a panel of recent clinical A. baumannii isolates. Exposure to increasing concentrations of copper in liquid culture and on solid surfaces resulted in dose-dependent and strain-dependent effects; levels of copper resistance varied broadly across isolates, possibly resulting from identified genotypic variation among strains. Examination of the growth-phase-dependent effect of copper on A. baumannii revealed that resistance to copper increased dramatically in stationary phase. Moreover, A. baumannii biofilms were more resistant to copper than planktonic cells but were still susceptible to copper toxicity. Exposure of bacteria to subinhibitory concentrations of copper allowed them to better adapt to and grow in high concentrations of copper; this copper tolerance response is likely achieved via increased expression of copper resistance mechanisms. Indeed, genomic analysis revealed numerous putative copper resistance proteins that share amino acid homology to known proteins in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Transcriptional analysis revealed significant upregulation of these putative copper resistance genes following brief copper exposure. Future characterization of copper resistance mechanisms may aid in the search for novel antibiotics against Acinetobacter and other highly antibiotic-resistant pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Caitlin L Williams"},{"name":"Heather M Neu"},{"name":"Jeremy J Gilbreath"},{"name":"Sarah L J Michel"},{"name":"Daniel V Zurawski"},{"name":"D Scott Merrell"}],"keywords":[]},"article199":{"pmid":"27520408","title":"Antibacterial Nanoparticles in Endodontics: A Review.","date":"2017-06-27","abs":"A major challenge in root canal treatment is the inability of the current cleaning and shaping procedures to eliminate bacterial biofilms surviving within the anatomic complexities and uninstrumented portions of the root canal system.","authors":[{"name":"Annie Shrestha"},{"name":"Anil Kishen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial"},{"word":"chitosan"},{"word":"functionalized"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"silver"}]},"article200":{"pmid":"27520088","title":"An ex vivo lung model to study bronchioles infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.","date":"2019-11-01","abs":"A key aim in microbiology is to determine the genetic and phenotypic bases of bacterial virulence, persistence and antimicrobial resistance in chronic biofilm infections.

However, the function(s) of this domain is unknown. Staphylococcus aureus SufT is composed solely of a DUF59 domain. We noted that sufT is often co-localized with sufBC, which encode for the Suf FeS cluster biosynthetic machinery. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that sufT was recruited to the suf operon, suggesting a role for SufT in FeS cluster assembly. A S. aureus ΔsufT mutant was defective in the assembly of FeS proteins. The DUF59 protein Rv1466 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis partially corrected the phenotypes of a ΔsufT mutant, consistent with a widespread role for DUF59 in FeS protein maturation. SufT was dispensable for FeS protein maturation during conditions that imposed a low cellular demand for FeS cluster assembly. In contrast, the role of SufT was maximal during conditions imposing a high demand for FeS cluster assembly. SufT was not involved in the repair of FeS clusters damaged by reactive oxygen species or in the physical protection of FeS clusters from oxidants. Nfu is a FeS cluster carrier and nfu displayed synergy with sufT. Furthermore, introduction of nfu upon a multicopy plasmid partially corrected the phenotypes of the ΔsufT mutant. Biofilm formation and exoprotein production are critical for S. aureus pathogenesis and vancomycin is a drug of last-resort to treat staphylococcal infections. Defective FeS protein maturation resulted in increased biofilm formation, decreased production of exoproteins, increased resistance to vancomycin, and the appearance of phenotypes consistent with vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus. We propose that SufT, and by extension the DUF59 domain, is an accessory factor that functions in the maturation of FeS proteins. In S. aureus, the involvement of SufT is maximal during conditions of high demand for FeS proteins.","authors":[{"name":"Ameya A Mashruwala"},{"name":"Shiven Bhatt"},{"name":"Saroj Poudel"},{"name":"Eric S Boyd"},{"name":"Jeffrey M Boyd"}],"keywords":[]},"article207":{"pmid":"27517499","title":"Multiple exposure routes of a pesticide exacerbate effects on a grazing mayfly.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Hydrophobic pesticides such as pyrethroid insecticides tend to occur in their soluble form mainly as transient pulses in streams. In addition, they are regularly detected in significant quantities adsorbed to stream sediments and other organic in-stream structures. Consequently, stream biota is likely subjected to pesticide exposure via multiple routes. In this study we aimed at investigating the influence of exposure routes for the pyrethroid insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin on the grazing mayfly Heptagenia sulphurea. Therefore, H. sulphurea was exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin via single- (water or biofilm) or biphasic exposure (water and biofilm) at environmentally realistic concentrations (0, 0.1, 1μgL(-1)) and exposure duration (2h) in a full factorial design (n=5). Mortality, moulting frequency, and biofilm accrual (proxy for feeding rate) were recorded subsequent to a 7 d post exposure period. Mortality significantly increased and moulting frequency significantly decreased with increasing concentrations of lambda-cyhalothrin in the water phase whereas exposure via biofilm prompted no significant effects on these endpoints (α=0.05). Effect predictions systematically underestimated and overestimated effects for mortality and moulting frequency, respectively. Similarly, mayfly feeding rate was significantly reduced by water phase exposure whereas pre-exposed biofilm did not significantly affect this variable. However, we found a significant but non-systematic interaction between water phase and biofilm exposure on mayfly feeding rate. Our results show that exposure to the same pesticide via multiple exposure routes may increase the magnitude of effects beyond the level predicted from single phase exposures which has clear implications for the aquatic risk assessment of hydrophobic pesticides. However, our results additionally reveal that interactions between pesticide exposure routes may vary between selected dependent variables. We emphasize that unravelling the underlying mechanisms causing these discrepancies in interactive effects between exposure routes is a major aspect that should receive further attention in future research.

To overcome these challenges and gain a competitive advantage, oral streptococci employ numerous adaptive strategies, many of which appear to be intertwined with the development of genetic competence. Here, we demonstrate that the regulatory circuits that control development of competence in Streptococcus mutans, a primary etiological agent of human dental caries, are integrated with key stress tolerance pathways by the molecular alarmone (p)ppGpp. We first observed that the growth of a strain that does not produce (p)ppGpp (ΔrelAPQ, (p)ppGpp(0)) is not sensitive to growth inhibition by comX inducing peptide (XIP), unlike the wild-type strain UA159, even though XIP-dependent activation of the alternative sigma factor comX by the ComRS pathway is not impaired in the (p)ppGpp(0) strain. Overexpression of a (p)ppGpp synthase gene (relP) in the (p)ppGpp(0) mutant restored growth inhibition by XIP. We also demonstrate that exposure to micromolar concentrations of XIP elicited changes in (p)ppGpp accumulation in UA159. Loss of the RelA/SpoT homolog (RSH) enzyme, RelA, lead to higher basal levels of (p)ppGpp accumulation, but to decreased sensitivity to XIP and to decreases in comR promoter activity and ComX protein levels. By introducing single amino acid substitutions into the RelA enzyme, the hydrolase activity of the enzyme was shown to be crucial for full com gene induction and transformation by XIP. Finally, loss of relA resulted in phenotypic changes to ΔrcrR mutants, highlighted by restoration of transformation and ComX protein production in the otherwise non-transformable ΔrcrR-NP mutant. Thus, RelA activity and its influence on (p)ppGpp pools appears to modulate competence signaling and development through RcrRPQ and the peptide effectors encoded within rcrQ. Collectively, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that integrate intercellular communication with the physiological status of the cells and the regulation of key virulence-related phenotypes in S. mutans.

Once a chronic wound becomes infected it is difficult to resolve and a combination of continuous inflammation and bacterial proliferation makes these wounds difficult to manage. A state of prolonged inflammation can occur as a result of impaired homeostatic pathways, which are exacerbated by bacterial growth. Chronic, infected wounds can persist for many months or even years, sometimes requiring surgical intervention in the form of regular debridement or amputation when other strategies such as antimicrobial treatments fail. The complex relationships between both oral microbiota and the host have been extensively characterized, including the shift from health to disease, and this has allowed the development of numerous control strategies.

Firstly, HNT surfaces were functionalized with cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) molecules with the aim to enhance the affinity of the nanofiller towards PO, which was estimated by means of HPLC experiments. The HNT/CB[6] hybrid was characterized by several methods (thermogravimetry, FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy) highlighting the influence of the supramolecular interactions on the composition, thermal behavior and morphology of the filler. Then, a pectin+HNT/CB[6] biofilm was prepared by the use of the casting method under specific experimental conditions in order to favor the entrapment of the volatile PO into the nanocomposite structure. Water contact angle measurements, thermogravimetry and tensile tests evidenced the effects of the modified filler on the thermo-mechanical and wettability properties of pectin, which were correlated to the microscopic structure of the biocomposite film. In addition, PO release in food simulant solvent was investigated at different temperatures (4 and 25°C), whereas the antioxidant activity of the nanocomposite film was estimated using the DPPH method. Finally, we studied the in vitro antibacterial activity of the biofilm against Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), which were isolated by beef and cow milk, respectively. These experiments were carried out at specific temperatures (4, 37 and 65°C) that can be useful for a multi-step food conservation.

Variation is expected due to differences in surface area, the composition of the substratum and culturing conditions. MOA per methanotrophic cell has been calculated in the study of natural systems such as lake sediments to examine the inherent conditions for methanotrophic activity. In this study, biomass normalised MOA (i.e., MOA per methanotophic cell) was measured on stabilised compost, a commonly used cover in landfills, and on graphite granules, an inert substratum widely used in microbial electrosynthesis studies. After initially enriching methanotrophs on both substrata, biomass normalised MOA was quantified under excess oxygen and limiting methane conditions in 160ml serum vials on both substrata and blends of the substrata. Biomass concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay for microbial protein. The biomass normalised MOA was consistent across all compost-to-graphite granules blends, but varied with time, reflecting the growth phase of the microorganisms. The biomass normalised MOA ranged from 0.069±0.006μmol CH4/mg dry biomass/h during active growth, to 0.024±0.001μmol CH4/mg dry biomass/h for established biofilms regardless of the substrata employed, indicating the substrata were equally effective in terms of inherent composition. The correlation of MOA with biomass is consistent with studies on methanotrophic activity in natural systems, but biomass normalised MOA varies by over 5 orders of magnitude between studies. This is partially due to different methods being used to quantify biomass, such as pmoA gene quantification and the culture dependent Most Probable Number method, but also indicates that long term exposure of materials to a supply of methane in an aerobic environment, as can occur in natural systems, leads to the enrichment and adaptation of types suitable for those conditions.

Behaviors in a closed-culture system were compared to those in different sap-renewal cultures that would more closely mimic the physicochemical environment encountered in planta. Significant differences in biofilm formation and growth in saps from PD-susceptible and -resistant spp. were only observed using sap renewal culture. Compared to saps from susceptible V. vinifera, those from PD-resistant V. aestivalis supported lower titers of X. fastidiosa and less biofilm and V. champinii suppressed both growth and biofilm formation, behaviors which are correlated with disease susceptibility. Furthermore, in microfluidic chambers X. fastidiosa formed thick mature biofilm with three-dimensional (3-D) structures, such as pillars and mounds, in saps from all susceptible spp. In contrast, only small aggregates of various shapes were formed in saps from four out of five of the resistant spp.; sap from the resistant spp. V. mustangensis was an exception in that it also supported thick lawns of biofilm but not the above described 3-D structures typically seen in a mature biofilm from the susceptible saps.

Understanding the role of water structure at these materials in preventing protein adhesion and biofilm formation is critical to designing more effective coatings. Such fouling experiments are typically performed under biological conditions using isotonic aqueous buffers. Previous studies have explored the structure of pure water at a few different antifouling surfaces, but the effect of electrolytes and ionic strength (I) on the water structure at antifouling surfaces is not well studied. Here sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is used to characterize the interfacial water structure at poly(ether sulfone) (PES) and two surface-modified PES films in contact with 0.01 M phosphate buffer with high and low salt (Ionic strength, I= 0.166 and 0.025 M, respectively). Unmodified PES, commonly used as a filtration membrane, and modified PES with a hydrophobic alkane (C18) and with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were used. In the low ionic strength phosphate buffer, water was strongly ordered near the surface of the PEG-modified PES film due to exclusion of phosphate ions and the creation of a surface potential resulting from charge separation between phosphate anions and sodium cations. However, in the high ionic strength phosphate buffer, the sodium and potassium chloride (138 and 3 mM, respectively) in the phosphate buffered saline screened this charge and substantially reduced water ordering. A much smaller water ordering and subsequent reduction upon salt addition was observed for the C18-modified PES, and little water structure change was seen for the unmodified PES. The large difference in water structuring with increasing ionic strength between widely used phosphate buffer and phosphate buffered saline at the PEG interface demonstrates the importance of studying antifouling coatings in the same aqueous environment for which they are designed. These results further suggest that strong long-range water structuring is limited in high ionic strength environments, such as within cells, facilitating chemical and biological reactions and processes.","authors":[{"name":"Aliyah Barrett"},{"name":"Joseph Imbrogno"},{"name":"Georges Belfort"},{"name":"Poul B Petersen"}],"keywords":[]},"article242":{"pmid":"27506163","title":"Interaction of Staphylococcus aureus persister cells with the host when in a persister state and following awakening.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Persister cells, a tolerant cell sub-population, are commonly associated with chronic and recurrent infections.

Our results show that S. aureus persister cells are not able to initiate infections in A. thaliana and present significantly reduced virulence towards C. elegans compared to total populations. In contrast, awakened S. aureus persister cells are able to initiate infections in A. thaliana and in C. elegans albeit, with lower mortality than total population. Furthermore, exposure of S. aureus persister cells to cis-DA led to a loss of tolerance to ciprofloxacin, and an increase of the bacterial fluorescence to levels found in total population. In addition, macrophage engulfment of persister cells was significantly lower than engulfment of total population, both before and following awakening. Overall our findings indicate that upon awakening of a persister population the cells regain their ability to infect hosts despite the absence of an increased immune response.","authors":[{"name":"Elin G Mina"},{"name":"Cláudia N H Marques"}],"keywords":[]},"article243":{"pmid":"27505992","title":"Effect of mechanical toothbrushing combined with different denture cleansers in reducing the viability of a multispecies biofilm on acrylic resins.","date":"2016-08-10","abs":"To investigate the efficacy of immersion and brushing with different cleansing agents in reducing the viability of multispecies biofilm on acrylic resins.","authors":[{"name":"Beatriz Helena Dias Panariello"},{"name":"Fernanda Emiko Izumida"},{"name":"Eduardo Buozi Moffa"},{"name":"Ana Claudia Pavarina"},{"name":"Janaina Habib Jorge"},{"name":"Eunive Teresinha Giampaolo"}],"keywords":[]},"article244":{"pmid":"27505991","title":"Antimicrobial efficacy of complete denture cleansers.","date":"2016-08-10","abs":"To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of alkaline peroxides against microbial biofilms on acrylic resin surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Flávia Cristina Targa Coimbra"},{"name":"Marcela Moreira Salles"},{"name":"Viviane Cássia De Oliveira"},{"name":"Ana Paula Macedo"},{"name":"Cláudia Helena Lovato Da Silva"},{"name":"Valéria Oliveira Pagnano"},{"name":"Helena de Freitas Oliveira Paranhos"}],"keywords":[]},"article245":{"pmid":"27505986","title":"Prevention of caries with probiotic bacteria during early childhood.

This structure was modeled by filling glass capillary tubes with an agarose gel that had been seeded with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria and then incubating the gel biofilm in medium for up to 30 h. Confocal microscopy showed that the bacteria formed in discrete pockets distributed throughout the gel matrix. These aggregates enlarged over time and also developed a size gradient, with the clusters being larger near the nutrient- and oxygen-supplied interface and smaller at greater depths. Bacteria entrapped in gels for 24 h grew slowly (specific growth rate, 0.06 h(-1)) and were much less susceptible to oxacillin, minocycline, or ciprofloxacin than planktonic cells. Microelectrode measurements showed that the oxygen concentration decreased with depth into the gel biofilm, falling to values less than 3% of air saturation at depths of 500 μm. An anaerobiosis-responsive green fluorescent protein reporter gene for lactate dehydrogenase was induced in the region of the gel where the measured oxygen concentrations were low, confirming biologically relevant hypoxia.

N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated quorum sensing (QS) tightly regulates the expression of multiple virulence factors in the opportunistic pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, inhibiting QS could lead to health benefits. In this study, we demonstrate an anti-virulence activity of a cranberry extract rich in proanthocyanidins (cerPAC) against P. aeruginosa in the model host Drosophila melanogaster and show this is mediated by QS interference. cerPAC reduced the production of QS-regulated virulence determinants and protected D. melanogaster from fatal infection by P. aeruginosa PA14. Quantification of AHL production using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed that cerPAC effectively reduced the level of AHLs produced by the bacteria. Furthermore, monitoring QS signaling gene expression revealed that AHL synthases LasI/RhlI and QS transcriptional regulators LasR/RhlR genes were inhibited and antagonized, respectively, by cerPAC. Molecular docking studies suggest that cranberry-derived proanthocyanidin binds to QS transcriptional regulators, mainly interacting with their ligand binding sites.

Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying biofilm-associated antimicrobial tolerance will aid the development of antibiofilm drugs. Screening of a Streptococcus mutans transposon mutant library for genes that are important for biofilm-associated antimicrobial tolerance provided evidence that the dlt genes play a role in the tolerance of S. mutans biofilms towards gentamicin. The minimum bactericidal concentration for biofilm cells (MBC-B) for a dltA transposon mutant was eight-fold lower than that of the wild-type. The minimum bactericidal concentration for planktonic cells (MBC-P) was only slightly reduced, indicating that the mechanism involved in the observed antimicrobial tolerance has a predominant role specifically in biofilms. Experiments with a knockout dltA mutant and complemented strain confirmed that the dlt genes in S. mutans play a role in biofilm-associated tolerance to gentamicin. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses of biofilms grown on glass slides showed that the dltA mutant produced roughly the same amount of biofilm as the wild-type, indicating that the reduced antimicrobial tolerance of the dltA mutant is not due to a defect in biofilm formation. The products of the dlt genes have been shown to mediate alanylation of teichoic acids, and in accordance the dltA mutant showed a more negatively charged surface than the wild-type, which likely is an important factor in the reduced tolerance of the dltA mutant biofilms towards the positively charged gentamicin.

Using effect directed analysis, treated and untreated OSPW were fractionated by solid phase extraction and the fractions with the largest decrease in toxicity and estrogenicity were selected for analysis by electrospray ionization combined with linear ion trap and a high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer (negative ion mode). The aim of this study was to determine whether compositional changes between the untreated and treated fractions provide insight related to biodegradation and detoxification of NAs. The O2S, O3S and O4S compounds were either not major contributors of toxicity or estrogenicity or the more toxic or estrogenic ones were biodegraded. The O3- and O4-NAs seem to be more readily metabolized than O2NAs and their degradation would contribute to detoxification. The decrease in acute toxicity may be associated with the degradation of C12 and C13 bicyclic and C12-C14 tricyclic NAs while the decrease in estrogenicity may be linked to the degradation of C16 O2-NAs with double bond equivalents (DBE)=5 and 6, C16 and 17 O2-NAs with DBE=7, and C19-O2-NAs with DBE=8. The residual acute toxicity may be caused by recalcitrant components and/or degradation products such as the O2 bicyclic and tricyclic NAs, particularly the C14 and C15 bicyclic and C14-C16 tricyclic NAs as well as the polycyclic aromatic NAs (DBE≥5 compounds).

It is common practice to treat these surfaces with biocides in order to eradicate the microorganisms present. The aim of the present research was to compare the changes occurring to the microbial community present in the biofilm in one site of the Catacombs of Domitilla (CD15) before and after a biocide treatment (a mixture of quaternary ammonium compounds and octylisothiazolone, OIT), applied for a one month period. A multistep approach was followed, based on microscopy, cultural methods and molecular techniques (f-ITS and 16S rDNA sequencing), for the phenotypic and genetic analysis of the culturable microbial population. Our results highlighted that the biocide treatments had little effect against cyanobacteria, while the bacterial population increased in numbers but changed drastically in terms of diversity. In fact, some bacteria proliferate at the expense of the organic matter released by dead microorganisms as demonstrated by laboratory tests. Further, our data describe how the microbial interaction can have different responses depending on the favorable conditions for one kind of microorganism in respect to the others. This study exemplifies the real risks of applying biocide treatments on complex microbial communities and pinpoints the necessity of subjecting treatments to monitoring and reassessment.

We analysed the antimicrobial potential of nisin against 23 S. aureus DFU biofilm-producing isolates.

To delineate the functional correlation between ZCF32 and biofilm development, we determined the set of genes directly regulated by Zcf32.

However, along with significant improvements of the hygienic water quality, there is an increasing demand of using the river for recreational purposes, in particular for bathing. In the Safe Ruhr interdisciplinary research project, demands, options and chances for lifting the bathing ban for the Ruhr River were investigated. As being the prominent reason for persisting recreational restrictions, microbiological water quality was in the focus of interest. Not only the faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) as required by the European Bathing Water Directive were considered, but also pathogens such as Salmonella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Campylobacter, Leptospira, enteroviruses and protozoan parasites. In this introductory paper, we firstly relate current recreational desires to historical experiences of river bathing. After recapitulating relevant microbial river contamination sources (predominantly sewage treatment plants, combined sewer overflows, and surface runoffs), we review existing knowledge about the relationships of FIOs and pathogens in rivers designated for recreational purposes, and then trace the evolution, rationale and validity of recreational freshwater quality criteria which are, despite obvious uncertainties, mostly relying on the FIO paradigm. In particular, the representativeness of FIOs is critically discussed. The working programme of Safe Ruhr, aiming at initiating and facilitating a process towards legalisation of Ruhr River bathing, is outlined. Sources of contamination can be technically handled which leaves the actual measures to political decisions. As contaminations are transient, only occasionally exceeding legal limits, a flexible bathing site management, warning bathers of non-safe situations, may amend technical interventions and offer innovative solutions. As a result, a situation-adapted system for lifting of the bathing ban for Ruhr River appears realistic.","authors":[{"name":"Thomas Kistemann"},{"name":"Alexandra Schmidt"},{"name":"Hans-Curt Flemming"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Big jump"},{"word":"European bathing water directive"},{"word":"Faecal indicator bacteria"},{"word":"Pathogenic microorganisms"},{"word":"River bathing"},{"word":"Safe ruhr"}]},"article277":{"pmid":"27498608","title":"Structure-function aspects of the Porphyromonas gingivalis tyrosine kinase Ptk1.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The development of synergistically pathogenic communities of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii is controlled by a tyrosine-phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathway in P. gingivalis.

In a given bacterial organism, there are often multiple variants of the two enzymes, which are tightly regulated by a variety of external and internal cues due to the presence of specialized sensory or regulatory domains. Dependent on the second messenger level, specific c-di-GMP receptors then control fundamental cellular processes, such as bacterial life style, biofilm formation, and cell cycle control. Here, I review the large body of data on structure-function relationships in diguanylate cyclases. Although the catalytic GGDEF domain is related to the respective domain of adenylate cyclases, the catalyzed intermolecular condensation reaction of two GTP molecules requires the formation of a competent GGDEF dimer with the two substrate molecules juxtaposed. This prerequisite appears to constitute the basis for GGDEF regulation with signal-induced changes within the homotypic dimer of the input domain (PAS, GAF, HAMP, etc.), which are structurally coupled with the arrangement of the GGDEF domains via a rigid coiled-coil linker. Alternatively, phosphorylation of a Rec input domain can drive GGDEF dimerization. Both mechanisms allow modular combination of input and output function that appears advantageous for evolution and rationalizes the striking similarities in domain architecture found in diguanylate cyclases and histidine kinases.","authors":[{"name":"Tilman Schirmer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"diguanylate cyclase"},{"word":"regulation"},{"word":"second messenger"},{"word":"signal transduction"},{"word":"signaling"}]},"article280":{"pmid":"27498125","title":"Characterization of a novel cell wall binding domain-containing Staphylococcus aureus endolysin LysSA97.","date":"2017-06-20","abs":"Endolysin from Staphylococcus aureus phage SA97 (LysSA97) was cloned and investigated.

Over time, using it for recreational purposes became a serious health hazard and bathing was banned due to chemical and microbiological risks. The purpose of the collaborative project Safe Ruhr was to verify the current status and to provide a scientific basis for lifting the bathing ban. As the river also provides a raw water source for drinking water production, it was investigated how well the treatment procedures control possible hygienic risks. As study area, the barrier Lake Baldeney was chosen as it embraces earlier bathing sites and tributes to river bank filtration water for drinking water treatment plants. The hygienic condition of the river water was determined over 18 months by measuring general physical, chemical and microbiological water quality parameters including fecal indicators, bacterial obligate and facultative pathogens, parasitic protozoa, enteric viruses and schistosome parasites (Trichobilharzia). Samples were taken at eight locations including sites before and after receiving the discharge of stormwater and treated wastewater, potential future bathing sites and a raw water abstraction point for potable water production. In summary, for all investigated physico-chemical parameters no significant difference between the eight investigated sampling locations on a distinct sampling date were observed. This study focused on hygienically relevant bacteria and parasitic protozoa. Fecal indicators, Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci and Clostridium perfringens as well as coliform bacteria were detected in 94-100% of the water samples. Enteric pathogens, including Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella enterica, were isolated from 33% and 28% of the samples, respectively, in relatively low concentrations. Among the environmental facultative pathogens, P. aeruginosa was detected at a high frequency of 82% of all samples, but in low numbers, while Aeromonas spp. were found in all water samples in relative high concentrations. The levels of all target organisms were not clearly associated with sources of pollution, with the exception of slightly enhanced numbers of coliform bacteria and E. coli downstream of a sewage discharge point from a wastewater treatment plant. Seasonal variations were observed with higher detection rates of Campylobacter spp. in winter and S. enterica in autumn and winter in contrast to the other bacterial groups, which showed no significant fluctuations throughout the year. Precipitation within two days prior to sampling resulted in a trend of enhanced numbers of coliform bacteria, E. coli, intestinal enterococci and Aeromonas. Sampling and analysis of parasitic protozoa was carried out in accordance to the European bathing water guideline and the ISO 15553 method. Characteristics of the river (flow, vegetation, birds protection zone, bathing of people, sewage etc.) were compared to the number of organisms detected. All in all 184 samples were investigated for Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. 80% of the samples were positive for Giardia spp. with a mean of 5cysts/100l (0.1-157.9). Highest values were achieved in autumn and winter, lowest values during the assumed bathing season. There seemed to be a trend to lower values in and after a reservoir in the river course, but with no statistical significance. A statistical significance could be shown for higher concentrations after heavy rainfall that led to discharge of combined sewage overflows in the city of Essen. Only 29% of the samples were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. with a single maximum value of 27.7 and all other concentrations below 5 oocysts/100l. On a low level there seemed to be slightly higher findings during summer and bathing season than in autumn and winter. No correlation to heavy rainfall could be found. The findings correspond to earlier results from the River Rhine (Germany). The influence of sewage on the water quality of the Ruhr could be shown from the correlation of Giardia load and activity of combined sewage overflows after heavy rainfall. The rare and low findings of Cryptosporidium spp. lead to the same conclusion, that microbial water quality in the investigation area is rather influenced from sewage water than from diffuse water sources into the River Ruhr.","authors":[{"name":"Martin Strathmann"},{"name":"Marina Horstkott"},{"name":"Christoph Koch"},{"name":"Uta Gayer"},{"name":"Jost Wingender"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial pathogens"},{"word":"Fecal indicators"},{"word":"Parasitic protozoa"},{"word":"Raw water"},{"word":"Recreational water"},{"word":"River Ruhr"}]},"article290":{"pmid":"27495361","title":"Candida virulence and ethanol-derived acetaldehyde production in oral cancer and non-cancer subjects.","date":"2017-09-15","abs":"To compare biofilm-forming ability, hydrolytic enzymes and ethanol-derived acetaldehyde production of oral Candida isolated from the patients with oral cancer and matched non-oral cancer.","authors":[{"name":"A D Alnuaimi"},{"name":"A N Ramdzan"},{"name":"D Wiesenfeld"},{"name":"N M O'Brien-Simpson"},{"name":"S D Kolev"},{"name":"E C Reynolds"},{"name":"M J McCullough"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"acetaldehyde"},{"word":"carcinogens"},{"word":"microbial-induced carcinogenesis"},{"word":"oral cancer"}]},"article291":{"pmid":"27495263","title":"Antibacterial, anti-biofilm and anticancer potentials of green synthesized silver nanoparticles using benzoin gum (Styrax benzoin) extract.","date":"2017-02-16","abs":"This study described a simple and green approach for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) employing benzoin gum water extract as a reducing and capping agent and their applications.

In this study, we proposed low-dose ozonation as a biomass control strategy to maintain high removal efficiencies of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over extended operation of BTFs. To obtain an optimized biomass control strategy, the relative performance of five parallel BTFs receiving different ozone doses was determined, and the affecting mechanism of ozonation on biofilm was elucidated. Experimental results showed that the decline in ozone-free BTF performance began from day 150, which was correlated with excess biomass accumulation, abundant excretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and a decline in metabolic activity of biofilm over extended operation. Ozone of 5-10 mg m(-3) was effective in preventing excessive growth and uneven distribution of biomass, and eventually maintaining long-term stable operations. Ozone of over 20 mg m(-3) possibly inhibited microorganism growth severely, thereby deteriorating the elimination performance instead. Comparison of the biofilm EPS indicated that the presence of ozone reduce EPS contents to different extents, which was possibly beneficial for mass transfer and metabolic activity. Comparative community analysis showed that ozonation resulted in different microbial communities in the BTFs. Dyella was found to be the most abundant bacterial genera in all BTFs regardless of ozonation, indicating strong resistance to ozonation. Chryseobacterium and Burkholderia members were markedly enriched in the ozone-added biofilm, implying good adaptation to ozone presence. These findings provided an improved understanding of low-dose ozonation in maintaining a stable long-term operation of BTF.

The strategy for choosing surgical or therapeutic (conservative) treatment is based on the identification of the pathogen: knowledge of the aetiological agents is an essential element in the decision-making process to ensure the most effective treatment is administered. The pathogen also needs to be considered in the challenging case of doubtful infection, where perhaps the only sign is inflammation, for a more accurate prediction of progression to either sepsis or healing. Biofilm-related infections and low-grade infections may fall into this category. Biofilm slows the metabolism of microorganisms and prolongs their survival, which renders them resistant to antibiotics. Moreover, when microorganisms are embedded in the biofilm they are poorly recognised by the immune system and the infection becomes chronic. As recently demonstrated, isolation and identification of bacteria in biofilm is difficult as the bacteria are concealed. The development of an effective means of sample collection and laboratory methods that can dislodge bacteria from prosthetic surfaces has therefore become necessary. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the reliability of an innovative technology (MicroDTTect), specifically applied to collect and transport explanted samples (prostheses, osteosynthetic devices, biological tissues), and compare with flocked swabs. The MicroDTTect system is quick and simple to use and, most importantly, is a closed system that is totally sterile and safe for the patient being treated. It contains a specific concentration of dithiotreitol (DTT) that can dislodge bacteria from the biofilm adhering to prosthetic surfaces. The numbers of positive and negative samples were measured to compare the MicroDTTect methodology with swab collection in 30 procedures. The results showed that MicroDTTect had a higher sensitivity compared to swabs (77% and 46%, respectively), and was associated with more positive results than swabs (35% and 20%, respectively). These preliminary results show that MicroDTTect is superior to swab collection for bacterial identification in orthopaedic surgery. The early identification of microorganisms that cause sepsis may help improve treatment strategies and the efficacy of therapy, which will lead to an increased healing rate, reduced severity of sequelae and improved quality of life.","authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Maria Calori"},{"name":"Massimiliano Colombo"},{"name":"Paola Navone"},{"name":"Marta Nobile"},{"name":"Francesco Auxilia"},{"name":"Marco Toscano"},{"name":"Lorenzo Drago"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"DTT"},{"word":"Dithiotreithol"},{"word":"Osteomyelitis"},{"word":"Periprosthetic infection"},{"word":"Septic non-union"},{"word":"Surgical site infection"},{"word":"Swabs"}]},"article311":{"pmid":"27492011","title":"Plasmid pPCP1-derived sRNA HmsA promotes biofilm formation of Yersinia pestis.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The ability of Yersinia pestis to form a biofilm is an important characteristic in flea transmission of this pathogen.

To dissect the roles of the dual promoters in conditions involving KatA, we created the promoter mutants for each -10 box (p1m, p2m, and p1p2m) and found that katAp1 is required for the function of KatA in the logarithmic growth phase during the planktonic culture as well as in acute virulence, whereas katAp2 is required for the function of KatA in the stationary phase as well as in the prolonged biofilm culture.

The bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a key player in the regulation of the transition from planktonic to sessile lifestyles and this regulation is crucial in the development of biofilms. In Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Rup4959, a multidomain response regulator with diguanylate cyclase activity, when overexpressed causes an increment in the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP that gives rise to a pleiotropic phenotype consisting of increased biofilm formation and crinkly colony morphology. In a broad genomic screen we have isolated mutant derivatives that lose the crinkly morphology, designed as cfc (crinkle free colony). A total of 19 different genes have been identified as being related with the emergence of the cfc phenotype either because the expression or functionality of Rup4959 is compromised, or due to a lack of transduction of the c-di-GMP signal to downstream elements involved in the acquisition of the phenotype. Discernment between these possibilities was investigated by using a c-di-GMP biosensor and by HPLC-MS quantification of the second messenger. Interestingly five of the identified genes encode proteins with AAA+ ATPase domain. Among the bacterial determinants found in this screen are the global transcriptional regulators GacA, AlgU and FleQ and two enzymes involved in the arginine biosynthesis pathway. We present evidences that this pathway seems to be an important element to both the availability of the free pool of the second messenger c-di-GMP and to its further transduction as a signal for biosynthesis of biopolimers.

However, when another crystal form of this enzyme was eventually solved at lower resolution, molecular replacement using this new structure as the search model did not give a convincing solution with the original atomic resolution data set. Hence, it was considered that these crystals might have arisen from a protein impurity, although molecular replacement using the structures of common crystallization contaminants as search models again failed. A script to perform molecular replacement using MOLREP in which the first chain of every structure in the PDB was used as a search model was run on a multi-core cluster. This identified a number of prokaryotic phosphate-binding proteins as scoring highly in the MOLREP peak lists. Calculation of an electron-density map at 1.1 Å resolution based on the solution obtained with PDB entry 2q9t allowed most of the amino acids to be identified visually and built into the model. A BLAST search then indicated that the molecule was most probably a phosphate-binding protein from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (UniProt ID B4SL31; gene ID Smal_2208), and fitting of the corresponding sequence to the atomic resolution map fully corroborated this.

The structure and composition of the PET-colonizing bacterial/archaeal and eukaryotic communities varied with season and station. Abundant PET-colonizing taxa belonged to the phylum Bacteroidetes (e.g. Flavobacteriaceae, Cryomorphaceae, Saprospiraceae-all known to degrade complex carbon substrates) and diatoms (e.g. Coscinodiscophytina, Bacillariophytina). The PET-colonizing microbial communities differed significantly from free-living communities, but from particle-associated (>3 μm) communities or those inhabiting glass substrates. These data suggest that microbial community assembly on plastics is driven by conventional marine biofilm processes, with the plastic surface serving as raft for attachment, rather than selecting for recruitment of plastic-specific microbial colonizers. A small proportion of taxa, notably, members of the Cryomorphaceae and Alcanivoraceae, were significantly discriminant of PET but not glass surfaces, conjuring the possibility that these groups may directly interact with the PET substrate. Future research is required to investigate microscale functional interactions at the plastic surface.

Poly(l-lactide)-imidazolium salt films were obtained with different surface morphologies (spherical and directional), and the presence of the imidazolium salt in the surface was confirmed. These films with different concentrations of the imidazolium salts C16MImCl and C16MImMeS presented antibiofilm activity against isolates of Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida albicans. The minor antibiofilm concentration assay enabled one to determine that an increasing imidazolium salt content promoted, in general, an increase in the inhibition percentage of biofilm formation. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs confirmed the effective prevention of biofilm formation on the imidazolium salt containing biomaterials. Lower concentrations of the imidazolium salts showed no cytotoxicity, and the poly(l-lactide)-imidazolium salt films presented good cell adhesion and proliferation percentages with human mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, no acute microscopic lesions were identified in the histopathological evaluation after contact between the films and pig ear skin. In combination with the good morphological, physicochemical, and mechanical properties, these poly(l-lactide)-based materials with imidazolium salt additives can be considered as promising biomaterials for use in the manufacturing of medical devices.

The symbiotic significance of each of these polysaccharides varies depending on the specific rhizobia-legume couple. In this work we show that the production of exopolysaccharide by Sinorhizobium fredii HH103, but not by other S. fredii strains such as USDA257 or NGR234, is repressed by nod gene inducing flavonoids such as genistein and that this repression is dependent on the presence of a functional NodD1 protein. In agreement with the importance of EPS for bacterial biofilms, this reduced EPS production upon treatment with flavonoids correlates with decreased biofilm formation ability. By using quantitative RT-PCR analysis we show that expression of the exoY2 and exoK genes is repressed in late stationary cultures of S. fredii HH103 upon treatment with genistein. Results presented in this work show that in S. fredii HH103 EPS production is regulated just in the opposite way than other bacterial signals such as Nod factors and type 3 secreted effectors: it is repressed by flavonoids and NodD1 and enhanced by the nod repressor NolR. These results are in agreement with our previous observations showing that lack of EPS production by S. fredii HH103 is not only non-detrimental but even beneficial for symbiosis with soybean.

The process is cell contact-dependent, yet the mechanisms enabling extracellular events to trigger plasmid transfer to begin inside the cell remain obscure. In this study of plasmid R1 we investigated the role of plasmid proteins in the initiation of gene transfer. We find that TraI, the central regulator of conjugative DNA processing, interacts physically, and functionally with the plasmid partitioning proteins ParM and ParR. These interactions stimulate TraI catalyzed relaxation of plasmid DNA in vivo and in vitro and increase ParM ATPase activity. ParM also binds the coupling protein TraD and VirB4-like channel ATPase TraC. Together, these protein-protein interactions probably act to co-localize the transfer components intracellularly and promote assembly of the conjugation machinery. Importantly these data also indicate that the continued association of ParM and ParR at the conjugative pore is necessary for plasmid transfer to start efficiently. Moreover, the conjugative pilus and underlying secretion machinery assembled in the absence of Par proteins mediate poor biofilm formation and are completely dysfunctional for pilus specific R17 bacteriophage uptake. Thus, functional integration of Par components at the interface of relaxosome, coupling protein, and channel ATPases appears important for an optimal conformation and effective activation of the transfer machinery. We conclude that low copy plasmid R1 has evolved an active segregation system that optimizes both its vertical and lateral modes of dissemination.

To gain insights into the characteristic biofilm phenotype of P. aeruginosa in the CF lungs, mimicking the CF lung environment is critical. We previously showed that growth of the non-CF-adapted P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain in a rotating wall vessel, a device that simulates the low fluid shear (LS) conditions present in the CF lung, leads to the formation of in-suspension, self-aggregating biofilms. In the present study, we determined the phenotypic and transcriptomic changes associated with the growth of a highly adapted, transmissible P. aeruginosa CF strain in artificial sputum medium under LS conditions. Robust self-aggregating biofilms were observed only under LS conditions. Growth under LS conditions resulted in the upregulation of genes involved in stress response, alginate biosynthesis, denitrification, glycine betaine biosynthesis, glycerol metabolism, and cell shape maintenance, while genes involved in phenazine biosynthesis, type VI secretion, and multidrug efflux were downregulated. In addition, a number of small RNAs appeared to be involved in the response to shear stress. Finally, quorum sensing was found to be slightly but significantly affected by shear stress, resulting in higher production of autoinducer molecules during growth under high fluid shear (HS) conditions. In summary, our study revealed a way to modulate the behavior of a highly adapted P. aeruginosa CF strain by means of introducing shear stress, driving it from a biofilm lifestyle to a more planktonic lifestyle.","authors":[{"name":"Jozef Dingemans"},{"name":"Pieter Monsieurs"},{"name":"Sung-Huan Yu"},{"name":"Aurélie Crabbé"},{"name":"Konrad U Förstner"},{"name":"Anne Malfroot"},{"name":"Pierre Cornelis"},{"name":"Rob Van Houdt"}],"keywords":[]},"article329":{"pmid":"27485973","title":"Role of extracellular matrix protein CabA in resistance of Vibrio vulnificus biofilms to decontamination strategies.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Biofilms are recalcitrant and raise safety problems in the food industry.

The cabA mutant biofilms on oyster are defective in biomass and resistance to detachment and disinfection. The bacterial cells in the wild-type biofilms are clustered by filaments which are not apparent in the cabA mutant biofilms.

However, lower frequency (100 Hz, 1.2 or 5 V) treatment led to 47 ± 19% permanent decrease in limiting current on the same biofilm, which is attributed to the action of electrohydrodynamic force that caused biofilm damage and loss of intercellular electron transfer network.

Optimal therapy necessitates interdisciplinary coordination of surgical and antimicrobial treatment. Challenges in the treatment are the increased occurrence of resistant pathogens, selection of adequate antimicrobial and surgical treatment strategies, inappropriate pretreatment and comorbidities of patients. Current treatment concepts lead to a high success rate in terms of infection eradication, when correctly applied. The individual expectations and underlying conditions of each patient must be considered when determining the therapy concept. The first step is to distinguish between acute and chronic infections. In acute infections the prosthesis can be retained but chronic infections necessitate a complete exchange of the prosthesis. Complicating factors, such as compromising soft tissue and bone conditions, osteomyelitis and infections caused by difficult-to-treat bacteria should, however, always be treated by a complete exchange of the prosthesis, even for acute infections. The antimicrobial treatment must be tailored to the causative agent, the surgical strategy as well as comorbidities and drug intolerances of the patient.

The objective was to find out how the resistance to bacterial colonisation was related to different surface finishes. MATERIAL AND METHODS Each of 14 samples of alloplastic material currently used in the manufacture of orthopaedic implants was inoculated with each of the group of microorganisms most frequently infecting joint replacements; these were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. At 24 hours of incubation, biofilms produced on sample surfaces were collected, stained with crystalline violet and assessed by spectrophotometry. The average value of biofilm absorbances (AV595) for the group of microorganism tested was taken as a basic characteristic of each material sample indicating its sensitivity to bacterial. RESULTS Of the metal materials with smooth surface finish, Vitalium (AV595, 0.368) showed the lowest affinity to microbial colonisation; next was titanium (AV595, 0.459) and steel (AV595, 0.505). A significant increase in sensitivity to bacterial colonisation was recorded in all types of surface finish of steel (AV595, 0.571) and in titanium alloy with a rough surface texture (AV595, 0.737 to 1.676); p < 0.05. Porous titanium surfaces significantly increased material affinity to colonisation. DISCUSSION Our study had certain limitations concerning in vitro evaluation of porous surfaces that have high affinity to bacterial colonisation. Porous titanium, and its hydroxyapatite layer in particular, considerably promotes osteoblast colonisation of the surface as well as implant osseointegration in the bone bed. Microorganisms therefore have no room for surface colonisation. Problematic may remain the surface parts outside contact with bone that keep their affinity to bacterial colonisation. CONCLUSIONS The material of choice for cemented implants is Vitalium which, of all metal surfaces, has the lowest sensitivity to bacterial colonisation. The materials of choice for cementless implants are titanium alloys. However, an osteoactive surface not in contact with bone remains a problem. On the one hand, its roughness and porosity are crucial to good osseointegration, on the other hand, its affinity to bacterial colonisation is high.","authors":[{"name":"R Ballay"},{"name":"I Landor"},{"name":"F Růžička"},{"name":"P Melicherčík"},{"name":"J Tomaides"},{"name":"D Jahoda"}],"keywords":[]},"article338":{"pmid":"27483985","title":"Bacterial repopulation of drinking water pipe walls after chlorination.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The short-term kinetics of bacterial repopulation were evaluated after chlorination of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) colonized with drinking water biofilms and compared with bare HDPE surfaces.

Development of novel molecules that inhibit bacterial biofilm formation may be an alternative prophylactic option for the treatment of biofilm-associated A. baumannii infections. Marine environments, which are unlike their terrestrial counterparts, harbor an abundant biodiversity of marine organisms that produce novel bioactive natural products with pharmaceutical potential.

In addition, the anti-biofilm activities of 5-episinuleptolide were observed for Gram-negative bacteria but not for Gram-positive bacteria, indicating that the inhibition mechanism of 5-episinuleptolide is effective against only Gram-negative bacteria. The mechanism of biofilm inhibition was demonstrated to correlate to decreased gene expression from the pgaABCD locus, which encodes the extracellular polysaccharide poly-β-(1,6)-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG).

Previous studies on bacterial cold tolerance mainly focus on the structural change of cell membrane and changes at the RNA and protein levels. Whether or not genomic change can also contribute to this process has not been explored. Here we employed a whole-genome deep-sequencing method to probe the changes at DNA level in a model psychrotrophic bacteria strain. We found that temperature downshift induced a 10 000-fold increase of the excision of a novel P4-like cryptic prophage. Importantly, although prophage excision only occurred in a relatively small population of bacteria, it was able to facilitate biofilm formation and promote the survival of the entire population. This prophage excision affected cell physiology by disrupting a critical gene encoding transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA). In addition, we found that the histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) could silence prophage excision via binding to the promoter of the putative excisionase gene at warm temperatures. H-NS level was reduced at cold temperatures, leading to de-repression of prophage excision.

Elucidating both functional and structural community changes over time within prairie streams provides a general understanding of microbial responses to environmental disturbance. We examined microbial succession of biofilm communities at three sites in a third-order stream at Konza Prairie over a 2- to 64-day period. Microbial abundance (bacterial abundance, chlorophyll a concentrations) increased and never plateaued during the experiment. Net primary productivity (net balance of oxygen consumption and production) of the developing biofilms did not differ statistically from zero until 64 days suggesting a balance of the use of autochthonous and allochthonous energy sources until late succession. Bacterial communities (MiSeq analyses of the V4 region of 16S rRNA) established quickly. Bacterial richness, diversity and evenness were high after 2 days and increased over time. Several dominant bacterial phyla (Beta-, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi) and genera (Luteolibacter, Flavobacterium, Gemmatimonas, Hydrogenophaga) differed in relative abundance over space and time. Bacterial community composition differed across both space and successional time. Pairwise comparisons of phylogenetic turnover in bacterial community composition indicated that early-stage succession (≤16 days) was driven by stochastic processes, whereas later stages were driven by deterministic selection regardless of site. Our data suggest that microbial biofilms predictably develop both functionally and structurally indicating distinct successional trajectories of bacterial communities in this ecosystem.","authors":[{"name":"Allison M Veach"},{"name":"James C Stegen"},{"name":"Shawn P Brown"},{"name":"Walter K Dodds"},{"name":"Ari Jumpponen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNA barcoding"},{"word":"algae"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"community ecology"},{"word":"microbial biology"}]},"article349":{"pmid":"27481242","title":"Neuraminidase A-Exposed Galactose Promotes Streptococcus pneumoniae Biofilm Formation during Colonization.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the nasopharynx. Herein we show that carbon availability is distinct between the nasopharynx and bloodstream of adult humans: glucose is absent from the nasopharynx, whereas galactose is abundant. We demonstrate that pneumococcal neuraminidase A (NanA), which cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from host glycoproteins, exposed galactose on the surface of septal epithelial cells, thereby increasing its availability during colonization. We observed that S. pneumoniae mutants deficient in NanA and β-galactosidase A (BgaA) failed to form biofilms in vivo despite normal biofilm-forming abilities in vitro Subsequently, we observed that glucose, sucrose, and fructose were inhibitory for biofilm formation, whereas galactose, lactose, and low concentrations of sialic acid were permissive. Together these findings suggested that the genes involved in biofilm formation were under some form of carbon catabolite repression (CCR), a regulatory network in which genes involved in the uptake and metabolism of less-preferred sugars are silenced during growth with preferred sugars. Supporting this notion, we observed that a mutant deficient in pyruvate oxidase, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-phosphate under non-CCR-inducing growth conditions, was unable to form biofilms. Subsequent comparative transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of planktonic and biofilm-grown pneumococci showed that metabolic pathways involving the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-phosphate and subsequently leading to fatty acid biosynthesis were consistently upregulated during diverse biofilm growth conditions.

Biofilm formation poses a significant problem to the drinking water industry as a potential source of bacterial contamination, including pathogens, and, in many cases, also affecting the taste and odor of drinking water and promoting the corrosion of pipes. This article critically reviews important research findings on biofilm growth in DWDS, examining the factors affecting their formation and characteristics as well as the various technologies to characterize and monitor and, ultimately, to control their growth. Research indicates that temperature fluctuations potentially affect not only the initial bacteria-to-surface attachment but also the growth rates of biofilms. For the latter, the effect is unique for each type of biofilm-forming bacteria; ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, for example, grow more-developed biofilms at a typical summer temperature of 22 °C compared to 12 °C in fall, and the opposite occurs for the pathogenic Vibrio cholerae. Recent investigations have found the formation of thinner yet denser biofilms under high and turbulent flow regimes of drinking water, in comparison to the more porous and loosely attached biofilms at low flow rates. Furthermore, in addition to the rather well-known tendency of significant biofilm growth on corrosion-prone metal pipes, research efforts also found leaching of growth-promoting organic compounds from the increasingly popular use of polymer-based pipes. Knowledge of the unique microbial members of drinking water biofilms and, importantly, the influence of water characteristics and operational conditions on their growth can be applied to optimize various operational parameters to minimize biofilm accumulation. More-detailed characterizations of the biofilm population size and structure are now feasible with fluorescence microscopy (epifluorescence and CLSM imaging with DNA, RNA, EPS, and protein and lipid stains) and electron microscopy imaging (ESEM). Importantly, thorough identification of microbial fingerprints in drinking water biofilms is achievable with DNA sequencing techniques (the 16S rRNA gene-based identification), which have revealed a prevalence of previously undetected bacterial members. Technologies are now moving toward in situ monitoring of biomass growth in distribution networks, including the development of optical fibers capable of differentiating biomass from chemical deposits. Taken together, management of biofilm growth in water distribution systems requires an integrated approach, starting from the treatment of water prior to entering the networks to the potential implementation of biofilm-limiting operational conditions and, finally, ending with the careful selection of available technologies for biofilm monitoring and control. For the latter, conventional practices, including chlorine-chloramine disinfection, flushing of DWDS, nutrient removal, and emerging technologies are discussed with their associated challenges.","authors":[{"name":"Sanly Liu"},{"name":"Cindy Gunawan"},{"name":"Nicolas Barraud"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"},{"name":"Elizabeth J Harry"},{"name":"Rose Amal"}],"keywords":[]},"article357":{"pmid":"27479347","title":"Biofilm Affecting the Mechanical Integrity of Implant-Abutment Joints.","date":"2018-10-23","abs":"This in vitro study evaluated the effect of biofilms on abutment torque loss and wear of implant internal connection surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Abraão M Prado"},{"name":"Jorge Pereira"},{"name":"Bruno Henriques"},{"name":"César Am Benfatti"},{"name":"Ricardo S Magini"},{"name":"José López-López"},{"name":"Júlio Cm Souza"}],"keywords":[]},"article358":{"pmid":"27479081","title":"Nitric Oxide Regulation of H-NOX Signaling Pathways in Bacteria.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Nitric oxide (NO) is a freely diffusible, radical gas that has now been established as an integral signaling molecule in eukaryotes and bacteria.

If vancomycin cannot be used due to allergy and/or non-susceptibility, there is increasing evidence that linezolid and daptomycin are the drugs of choice. It is reasonable to start linezolid orally or intravenously, but subsequent dose reduction may be necessary in case of myelosuppression.

Hundreds of thousands of these nanocultures can be easily generated and imaged using conventional or confocal microscopy. Each nanoculture begins as a several nanoliter droplet of suspended cells, encapsulated by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane. The PDMS shell provides long-lasting mechanical support, enabling long term study, and is selectively permeable to small molecules including antibiotics, signaling molecules and functional fluorescent probes. Thus, as microcolonies mature within the nanocultures, they can be stressed or interrogated using selected probes to characterize cell physiological properties, antibiotic susceptibilities, and antagonistic interactions. We demonstrate this platform by investigating broad ranges of microcolony dynamics, including direct and indirect bacterial-fungal interactions.

Peptidoglycan (PG) is important for helical shape, colonization, and host-pathogen interactions in C. jejuni Therefore, changes in PG greatly impact the physiology of this organism. O-acetylation of peptidoglycan (OAP) is a bacterial phenomenon proposed to be important for proper cell growth, characterized by acetylation of the C6 hydroxyl group of N-acetylmuramic acid in the PG glycan backbone. The OAP gene cluster consists of a PG O-acetyltransferase A (patA) for translocation of acetate into the periplasm, a PG O-acetyltransferase B (patB) for O-acetylation, and an O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterase (ape1) for de-O-acetylation. In this study, reduced OAP in ΔpatA and ΔpatB had minimal impact on C. jejuni growth and fitness under the conditions tested. However, accumulation of OAP in Δape1 resulted in marked differences in PG biochemistry, including O-acetylation, anhydromuropeptide levels, and changes not expected to result directly from Ape1 activity. This suggests that OAP may be a form of substrate level regulation in PG biosynthesis. Ape1 acetylesterase activity was confirmed in vitro using p-nitrophenyl acetate and O-acetylated PG as substrates. In addition, Δape1 exhibited defects in pathogenesis-associated phenotypes, including cell shape, motility, biofilm formation, cell surface hydrophobicity, and sodium deoxycholate sensitivity.

The plasticizing effect of yerba mate extract makes it an attractive additive for starch films which will be used as packaging or coating; and its contribution to an earlier biodegradability will contribute to waste reduction.

Starch is the main fermentable carbohydrate in the human diet, and often consumed simultaneously with sucrose. Recently we have characterized L. reuteri strains that also possess 4,6-α-glucanotransferases (4,6-α-GTases) that act on starch yielding isomalto-/malto-polysaccharides. In this study we have characterized the EPS formed by L. reuteri 35-5 cells and enzymes from sucrose plus starch. The data show that both in vivo and in vitro the L. reuteri 35-5 GS and 4,6-α-GTase enzymes, incubated with sucrose plus starch, cross-react and contribute to synthesis of the final hybrid EPS products. This may have strong effects on the EPS functional properties, influence biofilm formation, and affect the relationship between dietary intake of sucrose and starch, and dental caries formation.

It is associated with hospital-acquired infections, particularly in patients with compromised immunity, and is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa is also of nosocomial importance on dairy farms and veterinary hospitals, where it is a key morbidity factor in bovine mastitis. P. aeruginosa uses a cell-cell communication system consisting of signalling molecules to coordinate bacterial secondary metabolites, biofilm formation, and virulence. Simple and sensitive methods for the detection of biomolecules as indicators of P. aeruginosa infection would be of great clinical importance. Here, we report the synthesis of the P. aeruginosa natural product, barakacin, which was recently isolated from the bovine ruminal strain ZIO. A simple and sensitive electrochemical method was used for barakacin detection using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) and glassy carbon (GC) electrodes, based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The influence of electrolyte pH on the peak potential and peak currents was also investigated. At pH 2.0, the peak current was linearly dependent on barakacin concentration (in the range used, 1-10 μM), with correlation coefficients greater than 0.98 on both electrodes. The detection limit (S/N = 3) on the BDD electrode was 100-fold lower than that obtained on the GC electrode. The optimized method using the BDD electrode was extended to bovine (cow feces) and human (sputum of a CF patient) samples. Spiked barakacin was easily detected in these matrices at a limit of 0.5 and 0.05 μM, respectively. Graphical abstract Electrochemical detection of barakacin.

We recently reported that clinical CF isolates of Pa inhibit the formation and growth of Af biofilms. Here, we report that the bacteriophage Pf4, produced by Pa, can inhibit the metabolic activity of Af biofilms. This phage-mediated inhibition was dose dependent, ablated by phage denaturation, and was more pronounced against preformed Af biofilm rather than biofilm formation. In contrast, planktonic conidial growth was unaffected. Two other phages, Pf1 and fd, did not inhibit Af, nor did supernatant from a Pa strain incapable of producing Pf4. Pf4, but not Pf1, attaches to Af hyphae in an avid and prolonged manner, suggesting that Pf4-mediated inhibition of Af may occur at the biofilm surface. We show that Pf4 binds iron, thus denying Af a crucial resource. Consistent with this, the inhibition of Af metabolism by Pf4 could be overcome with supplemental ferric iron, with preformed biofilm more resistant to reversal. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bacterium producing a phage that inhibits the growth of a fungus and the first description of a phage behaving as an iron chelator in a biological system.","authors":[{"name":"Jack C Penner"},{"name":"Jose A G Ferreira"},{"name":"Patrick R Secor"},{"name":"Johanna M Sweere"},{"name":"Maria K Birukova"},{"name":"Lydia-Marie Joubert"},{"name":"Janus A J Haagensen"},{"name":"Omar Garcia"},{"name":"Andrey V Malkovskiy"},{"name":"Gernot Kaber"},{"name":"Hasan Nazik"},{"name":"Robert Manasherob"},{"name":"Alfred M Spormann"},{"name":"Karl V Clemons"},{"name":"David A Stevens"},{"name":"Paul L Bollyky"}],"keywords":[]},"article391":{"pmid":"27472955","title":"An assessment of early colonisation of implant-abutment metal surfaces by single species and co-cultured bacterial periodontal pathogens.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Numerous studies have proposed that smooth metal surfaces reduce initial bacterial attachment in the establishment of an early biofilm formation.

In most bacteria, it is synthesized via the condensation of two molecules phosphatidylglycerol (PG) by phospholipase D-type cardiolipin synthases (PLD-type Cls). In the plant pathogen and natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens CL comprises up to 15% of all phospholipids in late stationary growth phase. A. tumefaciens harbors two genes, atu1630 (cls1) and atu2486 (cls2), coding for PLD-type Cls. Heterologous expression of either cls1 or cls2 in Escherichia coli resulted in accumulation of CL supporting involvement of their products in CL synthesis. Expression of cls1 and cls2 in A. tumefaciens is constitutive and irrespective of the growth phase. Membrane lipid profiling of A. tumefaciens mutants suggested that Cls2 is required for CL synthesis at early exponential growth whereas both Cls equally contribute to CL production at later growth stages. Contrary to many bacteria, which suffer from CL depletion, A. tumefaciens tolerates large changes in CL content since the CL-deficient cls1/cls2 double mutant showed no apparent defects in growth, stress tolerance, motility, biofilm formation, UV-stress and tumor formation on plants.

In this investigation the focus was on the impact of osmotic (2M NaCl) and oxidative (5 mM H2O2) stress conditions during C. albicans biofilm formation. Oxidative stress enhanced extracellular DNA secretion into the biofilm matrix, increased the chitin level, and reduced virulence factors, namely phospholipase and proteinase activity, while osmotic stress mainly increased extracellular proteinase and decreased phospholipase activity. Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of mannan isolated from the C. albicans biofilm cell wall revealed a decrease in mannan content and reduced β-linked mannose moieties under stress conditions. The results demonstrate that C. albicans adapts to oxidative and osmotic stress conditions by inducing biofilm formation with a rich exopolymeric matrix, modulating virulence factors as well as the cell wall composition for its survival in different host niches.","authors":[{"name":"Suma C Pemmaraju"},{"name":"Kumar Padmapriya"},{"name":"Parul A Pruthi"},{"name":"R Prasad"},{"name":"Vikas Pruthi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"osmotic stress"},{"word":"oxidative stress"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"27472312","title":"Efficient Double Suzuki Cross-Coupling Reactions of 2,5-Dibromo-3-hexylthiophene: Anti-Tumor, Haemolytic, Anti-Thrombolytic and Biofilm Inhibition Studies.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The present study describes several novel 2,5-biaryl-3-hexylthiophene derivatives (3a-i) synthesized via a Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction in moderate to good yields.

Bulk phase and microfluidic experiments previously revealed that ComR-dependent activation of comX is altered by pH and by carbohydrate source. Biofilm formation is a major factor in bacterial survival and virulence in the oral cavity. Here, we sought to determine the response of S. mutans biofilm cells to XIP during different stages of biofilm maturation. Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we showed that exogenous addition of XIP to early biofilms resulted in robust comX activation. However, as the biofilms matured, increasing amounts of XIP were required to activate comX expression. Single-cell analysis demonstrated that the entire population was responding to XIP with activation of comX in early biofilms, but only a sub-population was responding in mature biofilms. The sub-population response of mature biofilms was retained when the cells were dispersed and then treated with XIP. The proportion and intensity of the bi-modal response of mature biofilm cells was altered in mutants lacking the Type II toxins MazF and RelE, or in a strain lacking the (p)ppGpp synthase/hydrolase RelA. Thus, competence signaling is markedly altered in cells growing in mature biofilms, and pathways that control cell death and growth/survival decisions modulate activation of comX expression in these sessile populations.
