Identifying the primary causal factors of resistance shall improve clinical management. In this study, we sought to identify the underlying mechanisms of fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside resistance in MDR, non-MDR, and drug susceptible P. aeruginosa (n = 19) strains obtained from keratitis patients. Phenotypic assays were performed to study the bacterial growth kinetics, efflux, permeability, and biofilm formation. Mutational alteration of target genes (DNA sequencing), relative expression of efflux system genes (real time PCR), and detection of aminoglycoside modifying enzyme (AME) genes (PCR) were done by molecular methods. We repeatedly found the mutations in quinolone resistance determining region of fluoroquinolone target genes, gyrA and parC, and the presence of AME genes, aph(3″)-I and aph(6)-I, in all MDR isolates. Furthermore, the MDR isolates were largely characterized by slower growth, cytotoxic type III secretion system genotype, better biofilm-forming ability, and the presence of additional AME genes. The non-MDR isolates were resensitized upon inhibition of active efflux or enhancement of membrane permeability.

In this study, based on transcriptome-wide data, we identified and described a total of 21 AQP genes in common vetch (Vicia sativa subsp. sativa), which is an economically important pasture legume worldwide. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the VsAQPs were sorted into four subfamilies, including four plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), six tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), seven NOD26-like intrinsic proteins, and four small basic intrinsic proteins. Furthermore, chemical and physical properties of these VsAQPs, including the isoelectric point and theoretical molecular weight, were analyzed. Analyses of the AQP signature sequences and key residues indicated the substrate specificity of each VsAQP. A set of VsAQPs was selected for gene expression analysis in a number of tissues and after drought stress treatments using real-time quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction assays. Most of the PIPs and TIPs were proposed to have critical roles in regulating the flow of water during drought stress. Heterologous expression experiments in yeast indicated that VsPIP1;2 and VsPIP2;2 are key candidate genes for improving drought stress tolerance.

We compared the population structure, virulence and antimicrobial resistance determinants of northern Australian community-onset A. baumannii strains with local and global strains. We performed whole-genome sequencing on 55 clinical and five throat colonization A. baumannii isolates collected in northern Australia between 1994 and 2016. Clinical isolates included CAP (n=41), healthcare-associated pneumonia (n=7) and nosocomial bloodstream (n=7) isolates. We also included 93 publicly available international A. baumannii genome sequences in the analyses. Patients with A. baumannii CAP were almost all critically unwell; 82 % required intensive care unit admission and 18 % died during their inpatient stay. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that community-onset strains were not phylogenetically distinct from nosocomial strains. Some non-multidrug-resistant local strains were closely related to multidrug-resistant strains from geographically distant locations. Pasteur sequence type (ST)10 was the dominant ST and accounted for 31/60 (52 %) northern Australian strains; the remainder belonged to a diverse range of STs. The most recent common ancestor for ST10 was estimated to have occurred in 1738 (95 % highest posterior density, 1626-1826), with evidence of multiple introduction events between Australia and Southeast Asia between then and the present day. Virulence genes associated with biofilm formation and the type 6 secretion system (T6SS) were absent in many strains, and were not associated with in-hospital mortality. All strains were susceptible to gentamicin and meropenem; none carried an AbaR resistance island. Our results suggest that international dissemination of A. baumannii is occurring in the community on a contemporary timescale.

In addition to Lactobacilli, other microorganisms populate the cervicovaginal microbiota, like Candida spp. and Gardnerella vaginalis. The overgrowth of Candida spp. or G. vaginalis, known as biofilm-producing microorganisms in the genital ecosystem, may lead to microbial dysbiosis that increases the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, like Chlamydia trachomatis. C. trachomatis, the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases, is still considered an important public health problem worldwide because of the impact of asymptomatic infections on long-term reproductive sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. The aim of our study was to investigate the interaction between C. trachomatis and the biofilm produced by Candida albicans or Gardnerella vaginalis, evaluating whether the biofilm can harbor C. trachomatis and influence its survival as well as its infectious properties. In order to do so, we developed an in vitro coculture transwell-based biofilm model. Our findings proved, for the first time, that C. trachomatis, an intracellular obligate pathogen, survived, for up to 72 hours after exposure, inside the biofilm produced by C. albicans or G. vaginalis, retaining its infectious properties, as evidenced by the typical chlamydial inclusions observed in the cell monolayer (chlamydial inclusion-forming units at 72 h: 9255 ± 1139 and 9873 ± 1015, respectively). In conclusion, our results suggest that the biofilm related to Candida or Gardnerella genital infections may act as a reservoir of C. trachomatis and, thus, contribute to the transmission of the infection in the population as well as to its dissemination into the upper genital tract, increasing the risk of developing severe reproductive sequelae.","authors":[{"name":"Simone Filardo"},{"name":"Marisa Di Pietro"},{"name":"Giulia Tranquilli"},{"name":"Rosa Sessa"}],"keywords":[]},"article9":{"pmid":"30804914","title":"Positive Regulation of Spoilage Potential and Biofilm Formation in Shewanella baltica OS155 via Quorum Sensing System Composed of DKP and Orphan LuxRs.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The spoilage potential and biofilm formation of Shewanella baltica are reported to be regulated by Quorum sensing (QS) system from the phenotype point of view, but the specific mechanism is not fully understood.

Consequently, the addition of riboflavin to a bioelectrochemical system (BES) containing S. oneidensis cells as biocatalyst leads to a strong current increase. Still, an external application of riboflavin to increase current production in continuously operating BESs does not seem to be applicable due to the constant washout of the soluble flavin compound. In this study, we developed a recyclable electron shuttle to overcome the limitation of mediator addition to BES. Riboflavin was coupled to magnetic beads that can easily be recycled from the medium. The effect on current production and cell distribution in a BES as well as the recovery rate and the stability of the beads was investigated. The addition of synthesized beads leads to a more than twofold higher current production, which was likely caused by increased biofilm production.

Additionally, these samples must fit into the dimensions of the sample holder provided by the high-pressure freezer. We explored the potential of a 10 μm thin polyester filter membrane (PE-filter) as a versatile sample substrate for high-pressure freezing. Planktonic bacteria, bacterial spores and suspended eukaryotic cells could be concentrated on the PE-filter, whereas biofilm, bacterial microcolonies and HeLa cells were able to grow directly on the PE-filter. These microorganism-loaded PE-filters were used for high-pressure freezing, freeze-substitution and plastic embedding in Epon or Lowicryl. Embedded filters were cross-sectioned so that the interface between microorganism and substrate as well as the overlying medium was revealed. Although the structural preservation was good for thin samples and samples with lower water content, such as biofilms, adherent HeLa-cell cultures were likewise sufficiently preserved for transmission electron microscopy imaging. The fact that microorganism-loaded PE-filters could be also examined with confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy under fully hydrated conditions, and freeze-substituted PE-filters samples with scanning electron microscopy, demonstrates the versatility of the PE-filter as a sample substrate for a wide array of microorganisms. LAY DESCRIPTION: In order to investigate biological samples in the transmission electron microscope it is imperative to remove all their water content, or the specimens will be destroyed by boiling in the high vacuum of the microscope. In order to avoid dramatic morphology-changes due to drying artefacts or the impact of chemical stabilisers, high-pressure freezing (HPF) was developed. This protocol allows freezing biological samples in an instant (within a few milliseconds) down to -196°C while applying high pressure at the same time so that the specimen retains all its water in a solidified noncrystalline form. However, the formation of morphology-destroying ice crystals is only avoided, if the cooling of the sample is faster than the ice crystal formation, which is only possible with very thin samples (up to a maximum of 200 μm in optimal cases). High-pressure freezing is regarded as the gold-standard for sample preparation of cells, tissues and small organisms. However, all of these samples must fit into the dimensions of the specific sample holder of the high-pressure freezer and their transfer into the high-pressure freezing machine must be achieved without significant impact on sample physiology. Additionally, it may also necessary to concentrate and immobilise a biological specimen before they can be placed in the HPF sample holder. Although a few number of strategies and sample substrates have been used for different types of biological samples, we explored the potential of a 10 μm thin polyester filter membrane (PE-filter) as a versatile sample substrate for HPF. In culture medium suspended bacteria, suspended bacterial spores and in medium suspended higher cells could be concentrated on the PE-filter, whereas bacterial biofilm or bacterial microcolonies from an agar plate, and surface-adhering higher cells were able to grow directly on the PE-filter. These microorganism-loaded PE-filters could be directly used for high-pressure freezing, and were finally embedded in a plastic resin like Epon or Lowicryl.

Until now, there are few reports on adhesion behaviors between bacteria and inorganic fiber surface. In this study, inorganic basalt fiber (BF) was modified with cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) to make surface more hydrophilic and positively charged. The initial adhesion behaviors of BF modified with CPAM (CMBF) were interpreted by thermodynamics and extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. According to the total interaction energy calculated by the extended DLVO theory, insurmountable energy barrier between BF and Escherichia coli (E. coli) made irreversible adhesion unachievable due to hydrophobicity and electronegativity of BF, but allowed reversible adhesion at second minimum. By contrast, the energy barrier between CMBF and E. coli could be overcome allowing irreversible bacterial adhesion and thus a huge amount of biomass because of hydrophilicity and electropositivity of CMBF. The results showed the total interaction energies were dominated by Lewis acid-base and electrostatic interactions and coating BF with CPAM could promote initial bacterial adhesion on carrier surface. Overall, the extended DLVO theory provides a comprehensive tool to interpret initial adhesion behaviors between bacteria and inorganic fibers.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoying Zhang"},{"name":"Xiangtong Zhou"},{"name":"Haipeng Xi"},{"name":"Jiaxing Sun"},{"name":"Xianlin Liang"},{"name":"Jing Wei"},{"name":"Xiang Xiao"},{"name":"Zhigang Liu"},{"name":"Shanwei Li"},{"name":"Zhishui Liang"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Chen"},{"name":"Zhiren Wu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteria adhesion"},{"word":"Extended DLVO theory"},{"word":"Modified basalt fiber"},{"word":"Surface properties"},{"word":"Total interaction energies"}]},"article24":{"pmid":"30802748","title":"Enhanced simultaneous organics and nutrients removal in tidal flow constructed wetland using activated alumina as substrate treating domestic wastewater.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"A tidal flow constructed wetland (TFCW), a commonly applied system to clean wastewater, contains a substrate to assist pollutants removal, while the choice of substrate affects the formation of bacterial biofilms.

The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities of Japonicin-2LF were evaluated using both reference and clinic isolated strains. The permeability of the cell membrane treated by the peptide was revealed by fluorescent staining. The cytotoxicity was examined by haemolysis, MTT and LDH assays. Wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella) infection model was applied to assess the efficacy of Japonicin-2LF against the reference and clinic MRSA isolates in vivo. Japonicin-2LF exhibited potent antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA, killing the bacteria via membrane permeabilisation. Additionally, Japonicin-2LF demonstrated the inhibition and eradication of biofilms, particularly against the biofilm of MRSA by eradicating the biofilm matrix as well as killing all the sessile bacteria. In the in vivo assay, Japonicin-2LF significantly decreased the mortality of MRSA acute infected larvae. In conclusion, it is a novel antimicrobial peptide discovered from the skin secretion of Limnonectes fujianensis, and particularly effective against both planktonic and sessile MRSA.

To gain a deeper understanding of the genetic basis for the development of a transmissible biofilm infection in the flea foregut, we evaluated additional gene differences and performed in vivo transcriptional profiling of Y. pestis, a Y. pseudotuberculosis wild-type strain (unable to form biofilm in the flea foregut), and a Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant strain (able to produce foregut-blocking biofilm in fleas) recovered from fleas 1 day and 14 days after an infectious blood meal.

We have previously described the adhesion and internalization of SDSD isolates in human cells and now we describe the biofilm production capability of this bacterium. In this work we integrated microbiology, imaging and computational methods to evaluate the biofilm production capability of SDSD isolates; to assess the presence of biofilm regulatory protein BrpA homolog in the biofilm producers; and to predict a structural model of BrpA-like protein and its binding to putative inhibitors. Our results show that SDSD isolates form biofilms on abiotic surface such as glass (hydrophilic) and polystyrene (hydrophobic), with the strongest biofilm formation observed in glass. This ability was mainly associated with a proteinaceous extracellular matrix, confirmed by the dispersion of the biofilms after proteinase K and trypsin treatment. The biofilm formation in SDSD isolates was also confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Under SEM observation, VSD16 isolate formed cell aggregates during biofilm growth while VSD9 and VSD10 formed smooth and filmy layers. We show that brpA-like gene is present and expressed in SDSD biofilm-producing isolates and its expression levels correlated with the biofilm production capability, being more expressed in the late exponential phase of planktonic growth compared to biofilm growth. Fisetin, a known biofilm inhibitor and a putative BrpA binding molecule, dramatically inhibited biofilm formation by the SDSD isolates but did not affect planktonic growth, at the tested concentrations. Homology modeling was used to predict the 3D structure of BrpA-like protein. Using high throughput virtual screening and molecular docking, we selected five ligand molecules with strong binding affinity to the hydrophobic cleft of the protein, making them potential inhibitor candidates of the SDSD BrpA-like protein.

The present investigation was aimed to catalogue the primary colonizers on artificial surfaces and their comparison with planktonic community in southern coastal seawater of India. Surface seawater samples and biofilm assembled on three artificial surfaces over a period of 72 h of immersion in the intake area of a nuclear power plant at Kudankulam, India were collected. The structure of surface assemblages and plankton were unveiled by employing culture dependent, DGGE and NGS methods. In static condition, a collection of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria was screened in vitro for their ability to form potent biofilm. Proteobacteria preponderated the communities both in seawater and natural biofilm and Gammaproteobacteria accounted for >85% in the latter. Vibrionaceae, Alteromonadaceae and Pseudoalteromonadaceae dominated the biofilm community and constituted for 41, 25 and 8%, respectively. In contrast to other studies that showed Rhodobacteraceae family of Alphaproteobacteria as predominant component, we found Vibrionaceae of Gammaproteobacteria as dominant group in early stage of biofilm formation. Both DGGE and NGS data indicated that the attached community is noticeably distinct from those suspended in water column and form the basis for the proposed hypothesis of species sorting theory, that is, the local environmental conditions influence bacterial community assembly. Collectively, the data are testament for species sorting process that occur during initial assembly of bacterial community in marine environment and shed light on the structure of marine bacterial biofilm development. The outcome of the present study is of immense importance for designing long-term, efficient and appropriate strategies to control the biofouling phenomenon.","authors":[{"name":"Meora Rajeev"},{"name":"T J Sushmitha"},{"name":"Subba Rao Toleti"},{"name":"Shunmugiah Karutha Pandian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Artificial surfaces"},{"word":"Natural biofilm"},{"word":"Next–generation sequencing"},{"word":"Pioneering biofouling community"},{"word":"Species sorting"}]},"article46":{"pmid":"30798222","title":"Reduction of Cu(II) and simultaneous production of acetate from inorganic carbon by Serratia Marcescens biofilms and plankton cells in microbial electrosynthesis systems.","date":"2019-04-23","abs":"Simultaneous Cu(II) reduction (6.42 ± 0.02 mg/L/h), acetate production (1.13 ± 0.02 mg/L/h) from inorganic carbon (i.e., CO","authors":[{"name":"Yitong Qian"},{"name":"Liping Huang"},{"name":"Peng Zhou"},{"name":"Fuping Tian"},{"name":"Gianluca Li Puma"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CO(2) fixation"},{"word":"Cu-tolerant biofilm and plankton cell"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"Microbial electrosynthesis system"},{"word":"Physiological activity"},{"word":"Variable cathode potential"}]},"article47":{"pmid":"30797834","title":"The transcription factor NemR is an electrophile-sensing regulator important for the detoxification of reactive electrophiles in Acinetobacter nosocomialis.","date":"2019-08-27","abs":"NemR is an electrophile-sensing regulator which controls two enzymes required for the detoxification of reactive electrophiles: N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) reductase and glyoxalase I in Escherichia coli.

These bacteria form thicker biofilms and stay more active than soluble-respiring bacteria biofilms because their electron acceptor is always accessible. In bioelectrochemical systems such as microbial fuel cells, corrosion-resistant metals uptake current from the bacteria, producing power. While beneficial for engineering applications, collecting current using corrosion resistant metals induces pH stress in the biofilm, unlike the naturally occurring process where a reduced metal combines with protons released during respiration. To reduce pH stress, some bioelectrochemical systems use forced convection to enhance mass transport of both nutrients and byproducts; however, biofilms' small pore size limits convective transport, thus, reducing pH stress in these systems remains a challenge. Understanding how convection is necessary but not sufficient for maintaining biofilm health requires decoupling mass transport from momentum transport (i.e. fluidic shear stress). In this study we use a rotating disc electrode to emulate a practical bioelectrochemical system, while decoupling mass transport from shear stress. This is the first study to isolate the metabolic and structural changes in electroactive biofilms due to shear stress. We find that increased shear stress reduces biofilm development time while increasing its metabolic rate. Furthermore, we find biofilm health is negatively affected by higher metabolic rates over long-term growth due to the biofilm's memory of the fluid flow conditions during the initial biofilm development phases. These results not only provide guidelines for improving performance of bioelectrochemical systems, but also reveal features of biofilm behavior. Results of this study suggest that optimized reactors may initiate operation at high shear to decrease development time before decreasing shear for steady-state operation. Furthermore, this biofilm memory discovered will help explain the presence of channels within biofilms observed in other studies.","authors":[{"name":"A-Andrew D Jones"},{"name":"Cullen R Buie"}],"keywords":[]},"article61":{"pmid":"30795855","title":"Synthetic nanoparticles for selective hydrolysis of bacterial autoinducers in quorum sensing.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are signal molecules used by a large number of gram-negative bacteria in quorum sensing and their hydrolysis is known to inhibit biofilm formation.

The antifungal drug caspofungin of the echinocandin family is the latest generation of antifungal drugs to be developed. It functions by inhibiting glucan synthase thus weakening the fungal cell wall leading to death. Recently reports of resistance to caspofungin have been reported mainly through mutations in the FKS encoded subunits of glucan synthase at hot spot 1 (amino acids 641 to 649, FSTLSLRDP) and hot spot 2 (amino acids 1357 to 1364, DWIRRYTL). Our study aimed at sequencing both hot spots from 16 C. albicans Lebanese hospital isolates resistant and sensitive to caspofungin to determine whether mutations in these hot spots are present, and whether such mutations also impart resistance to our isolates. In addition, we wanted to determine any relationship between resistance and pathogenicity related attributes such as virulence, resistance to cell wall disrupting agents, biofilm formation, and cell wall chitin deposition. Five isolates were found to contain mutations with the mutations restricted to resistant strains. Within hot spot 1 substitution at positions S642, T643, L644, R647, and D648 were found, while within hot spot 2 substitutions at positions L1364, T1363, and R1360, W1358 and R1361 were identified with some of the mutations not previously documented. Strains that were resistant to caspofungin also showed increased resistance to Congo red but decreased biofilm formation and attenuated virulence in a mouse model of infection. Caspofungin sensitive strains showed decreased resistance to Congo red yet increased virulence and biofilm formation. Chitin content analysis showed that caspofungin resistant strains had elevated levels of chitin resulting in cell wall thickening that counters the effect of caspofungin, while sensitive strains showed decreased chitin content. Our results demonstrate an inverse correlation between resistance and virulence whereby resistance is due to thickening of the cell wall preventing the cell from gaining virulence attributes, while a more susceptible cell wall increases susceptibility to drugs but allows increased virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Maggie Toutounji"},{"name":"Sima Tokajian"},{"name":"Roy A Khalaf"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Caspofungin"},{"word":"FKS1 gene"},{"word":"Pathogenicity"},{"word":"Resistance"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article65":{"pmid":"30794843","title":"Triclosan-loaded chitosan as antibacterial agent for adhesive resin.","date":"2020-01-10","abs":"The aim of this study was to formulate and to evaluate the immediate and long-term physical, chemical and antibacterial properties of an experimental adhesive resin with chitosan or triclosan-loaded chitosan.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Helena Schauenberg Machado"},{"name":"Isadora Martini Garcia"},{"name":"Amanda de Souza da Motta"},{"name":"Vicente Castelo Branco Leitune"},{"name":"Fabrício Mezzomo Collares"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-bacterial agents"},{"word":"Dental bonding"},{"word":"Dental caries"},{"word":"Drug carrier"},{"word":"Light-curing of dental adhesives"}]},"article67":{"pmid":"30794234","title":"Does Suture Type Influence Bacterial Retention and Biofilm Formation After Irrigation in a Mouse Model?","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Irrigation and débridement are frequently utilized in the management of surgical infections, but even with aggressive débridement, it is difficult to remove all the suture material from the tissues and retained suture material may harbor bacteria and/or biofilm.

DO sensor designs can employ selectively permeable membranes to isolate DO from untargeted compounds or organisms in waterbodies. Hence, the DO concentration can be monitored and the health of the water can be evaluated over time. However, the presence of bacteria in natural waterbodies can lead to the formation of biofilms that can block pores and prevent analyte from permeating the membrane, resulting in inaccurate readings. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of a fluorosilane-based omniphobic lubricant-infused (OLI) coating on a selectively permeable membrane and investigate the rate of biofilm formation for a commercially available DO sensor. Coated and unmodified membranes were incubated in an environment undergoing accelerated bacterial growth, and the change in sensitivity was evaluated after 40, 100, 250, and 500 h. Our findings show that the OLI membranes attenuate biofouling by 70% and maintain sensitivity after 3 weeks of incubation, further demonstrating that oxygen transfer through the OLI coating is achievable. Meanwhile, unmodified membranes exhibit significant biofouling that results in a 3.35 higher rate of decay in oxygen measurement sensitivity and an over 70% decrease in static contact angle. These results show that the OLI coating can be applied on commercially available membranes to prevent biofouling. Therefore, OLI coatings are a suitable candidate to suppress biofilm formation in the widespread use of selectively permeable membranes for environmental, medical, and fluid separation applications.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Osborne"},{"name":"Aditya Aryasomayajula"},{"name":"Amid Shakeri"},{"name":"Ponnambalam Ravi Selvaganapathy"},{"name":"Tohid F Didar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofouling"},{"word":"dissolved oxygen sensing"},{"word":"lubricant-infused coating"},{"word":"membrane fouling"}]},"article71":{"pmid":"30793535","title":"Genome and transcriptome analysis of Bacillus velezensis BS-37, an efficient surfactin producer from glycerol, in response to d-/l-leucine.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Surfactin is one of the most widely studied biosurfactants due to its many potential applications in different fields. In the present study, Bacillus velezensis BS-37, initially identified as a strain of Bacillus subtilis, was used to efficiently produce surfactin with the addition of glycerol, an inexpensive by-product of biodiesel production. After 36 hr of growth in glycerol medium, the total surfactin concentration reached more than 1,000 mg/L, which was two times higher than that in sucrose medium. Moreover, the addition of l- and d-Leu to the culture medium had opposite effects on surfactin production by BS-37. While surfactin production increased significantly to nearly 2,000 mg/L with the addition of 10 mM l-Leu, it was dramatically reduced to about 250 mg/L with the addition of 10 mM d-Leu. To systemically elucidate the mechanisms influencing the efficiency of this biosynthesis process, we sequenced the genome of BS-37 and analyzed changes of the transcriptome in glycerol medium in response to d-/l-leucine. The RPKM analysis of the transcriptome of BS-37 showed that the transcription levels of genes encoding modular surfactin synthase, the glycerol utilization pathway, and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) synthesis pathways were all at a relatively high level, which may offered an explanation why this strain can efficiently use glycerol to produce surfactin with a high yield. Neither l-Leu nor d-Leu had a significant effect on the expression of genes in these pathways, indicating that l-Leu plays an important role as a precursor or substrate involved in surfactin production, while d-Leu appears to act as a competitive inhibitor. The results of the present study provide new insights into the synthesis of surfactin and ways of its regulation, and enrich the genomic and transcriptomic resources available for the construction of high-producing strains.","authors":[{"name":"Dayuan Zhou"},{"name":"Fangxiang Hu"},{"name":"Junzhang Lin"},{"name":"Weidong Wang"},{"name":"Shuang Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"genome"},{"word":"leucine"},{"word":"surfactin"},{"word":"transcriptome"}]},"article72":{"pmid":"30793347","title":"Transcriptome analysis predicts mode of action of benzimidazole molecules against Staphylococcus aureus UAMS-1.","date":"2020-01-17","abs":"Antimicrobial drug resistance is one of the most critical problems that plagued the human race in modern times.

The presence of this bacterium in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods has recently been reported.

To help understand the genome-wide characteristics of RTE food isolates, the complete genomes of 27 RTE food isolates were sequenced and compared to those of 20 clinical and 19 other environmental (e.g., water and aquatic product source) isolates using a comparative genomics approach. Analysis revealed that V. parahaemolyticus RTE food isolates had higher numbers of genes on average and possessed more accessory genes than isolates from other sources. Most RTE food isolates were positive for some known virulence-associated genes and pathogenicity islands (PAIs), and some of these isolates were genetically homologous to clinical isolates. Genome-wide association analysis revealed 79 accessory genes and 78 missense single-nucleotide polymorphisms that affected 11 protein-coding genes were significantly associated with RTE food sources. These genes were mostly involved in defense mechanisms and energy production and conversion according to functional annotation in the COG database. KEGG Pathway analysis showed that these genes mainly affected the biofilm formation of V. parahaemolyticus, and subsequent experiments confirmed that nearly all RTE food isolates possessed the ability to form biofilm. The biofilm formation can facilitate the persistence of V. parahaemolyticus in RTE foods, and the presence of virulence-associated genes poses a pathogenic potential to humans. Our findings highlight the potential risk of V. parahaemolyticus in Chinese RTE foods and illustrate the genomic basis for the persistence of these isolates.

In fact, using LAB for treating mastitis probably requires the formation of a beneficial biofilm by the probiotic bacteria. The present study investigated the ability of five LAB strains, selected on the basis of results from previous studies, to remove and to replace pathogenic biofilms in vitro. For this purpose, Staphylococcus (S.) aureus ATCC 12,600 and two strains-S. xylosus (35/07) and S. epidermidis (575/08)-belonging to the group of coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) were allowed to form biofilms in a 96-well plate. Subsequently, the LAB were added to the well. The biofilm challenge was evaluated by scraping off and suspending the biofilm cells, followed by a plate count of serial dilutions using selective media.

For many reasons, the emergence/re-emergence of threatening pathogens has increased and poses a serious challenge to health care services. Considering the changing dynamics of 21st-century materials with medical potentialities, the integration of bioactive agents into materials to engineer antibacterial matrices has received limited attention so far. Thus, antimicrobial active conjugates are considered potential candidates to eradicate infections and reduce microbial contaminations in healthcare facilities. In this context, eco-friendly and novel conjugates with antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and anticancer potentialities were developed using biogenic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from Convolvulus arvensis (C. arvensis) extract and chitosan (CHI). A range of instrumental and imaging tools, i.e., UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), were employed to characterize the freshly extracted C. arvensis AgNPs. Biogenic AgNPs obtained after a 24-h reaction period were used to engineer CHI-based conjugates and designated as CHI‒AgNPs1 to CHI‒AgNPs5, subject to the C. arvensis AgNPs concentration. After the stipulated loading period, 92% loading efficiency (LE) was recorded for a CHI‒AgNPs3 conjugate. Gram+ and Gram- bacterial isolates, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, were used to test the antibacterial activities of newly developed CHI‒AgNPs conjugates. In comparison to the control sample with bacterial cell count 1.5 × 10⁸ CFU/mL, a notable reduction in the log values was recorded for the CHI‒AgNPs3 conjugate. The antibiofilm potential of CHI‒AgNPs conjugates was tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, the CHI‒AgNPs3 conjugate also showed substantial cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell line. In summary, the newly engineered CHI‒AgNPs conjugates with antibacterial, antibiofilm, and anticancer potentialities are potential candidate materials for biomedical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Bilal"},{"name":"Yuping Zhao"},{"name":"Tahir Rasheed"},{"name":"Ishtiaq Ahmed"},{"name":"Sherif T S Hassan"},{"name":"Muhammad Zohaib Nawaz"},{"name":"Hafiz M N Iqbal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AgNPs"},{"word":"Convolvulus arvensis"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"anticancer"},{"word":"chitosan"}]},"article81":{"pmid":"30790754","title":"Removal of petroleum hydrocarbons and sulfates from produced water using different bioelectrochemical reactor configurations.","date":"2019-04-08","abs":"Produced water (PW) is a wastewater generated in large quantities from the extraction of oil and gas.

Our previous work revealed that RpoS contributes to the spoilage activities of P. fluorescens by regulating resistance to different stress conditions, extracellular acylated homoserine lactone (AHL) levels, extracellular protease and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) production. However, RpoS-dependent genes in P. fluorescens remained undefined. RNA-seq transcriptomics analysis combined with quantitative proteomics analysis based on multiplexed isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling was performed in the P. fluorescens wild-type strain UK4 and its derivative carrying an rpoS mutation. A total of 375 differentially expressed coding sequences (DECs) and 212 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified. The DECs were further verified by qRT-PCR.

This phenomenon has been partially explained by the appearance of so-called persister cells, phenotypic variants of wild-type cells, capable of surviving very high concentrations of antimicrobial agents. Persister cells in C. albicans were found exceptionally in biofilms, while none were detected in planktonic cultures of this fungus. Yet, this topic remains controversial, as others could not observe persister cells in biofilms formed by the C. albicans SC5314 laboratory strain. Due to ambiguous data in the literature, this work aimed to reevaluate the presence of persister cells in C. albicans biofilms. We demonstrated that the isolation of C. albicans persister cells as described previously was likely to be the result of the survival of biofilm cells that were not reached by the antifungal. We tested biofilms of SC5314 and its derivatives, as well as 95 clinical isolates, using an improved protocol, demonstrating that persister cells are not a characteristic trait of C. albicans biofilms.

We found that depleting the anionic phospholipid cardiolipin reduces biofilm formation in Escherichia coli cells by as much as 50%. The absence of cardiolipin activates the regulation of colanic acid synthesis (Rcs) envelope stress response, which represses the production of flagella, disrupts initial biofilm attachment, and reduces biofilm growth. We demonstrate that a reduction in the concentration of cardiolipin impairs translocation of proteins across the inner membrane, which we hypothesize activates the Rcs pathway through the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF.

Most strains that lack RscS or encode divergent RscS proteins cannot colonize a squid host unless RscS from a squid symbiont is heterologously expressed. In this study, we examine V. fischeri isolates worldwide to understand the landscape of biofilm regulation during beneficial colonization. We provide a detailed study of three distinct evolutionary groups of V. fischeri and find that while the RscS-Syp biofilm pathway is required in one of the groups, two other groups of squid symbionts require Syp independent of RscS. Mediterranean squid symbionts, including V. fischeri SR5, colonize without an RscS homolog encoded by their genome. Additionally, group A V. fischeri strains, which form a tightly related clade of Hawaii isolates, have a frameshift in rscS and do not require the gene for squid colonization or competitive fitness. These same strains have a frameshift in sypE, and we provide evidence that this group A sypE allele leads to an upregulation in biofilm activity.

In this work, hydrophilic micellar systems of nystatin were developed with sodium deoxycholate on silicone endotracheal tubes. The physical characteristics of the micellar system at different nystatin:deoxycholate ratios were studied using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The electron microscopy results reveal that the deoxycholate micellar system altered the surface morphology, and the size of the aggregates was observed to be smaller. The hydrophilic structures of deoxycholate produce systems with a high surface area containing nystatin molecules on their interior. The X-ray and differential scanning calorimetry assays revealed a typical change in the crystallinity of micellar systems when the deoxycholate proportion increases. The endothermic peak of nystatin was not observed in the micellar systems as a consequence of the reduced crystallinity. Nystatin was homogenously dispersed in the surfactant matrix. Micellar systems with 1:0.8 nystatin:deoxycholate ratio (MS-N:DC [1:0.8]) showed increased antifungal activity compared to nystatin raw material.

Because CDNs are possibly absorbed and delivered into the bone marrow, where bone-resorbing osteoclasts are derived from monocyte/macrophage lineages, CDNs could affect bone metabolism by regulating osteoclast differentiation. In this study, we investigated the effect of CDNs on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. When bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were differentiated into osteoclasts with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in the presence of CDNs, the differentiation was inhibited by CDNs in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, CDNs did not influence the differentiation of committed osteoclasts or osteoblast precursors. STING signaling pathway appeared to be critical for CDNs-mediated inhibition of osteoclast differentiation since CDNs induced the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, a representative feature of STING activation, and osteoclast differentiation was restored in STING knockdown BMMs with siRNA. Moreover, CDNs increased the mRNA expression of STING-meditated IFN-β, which is a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis. In addition, CDNs also induced the phosphorylation of STAT1, which mediates IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) signal transduction.

Therefore, spore-forming bacteria belonging to Sporosarcina genus such as pasteurii, globispora, and psychrophila were assessed for probiotic characteristics such as biofilm formation, intestinal adhesion, acid and bile tolerance, antibiotic sensitivity, and anti-pathogenic activity. This ensures bacterial viability under gastrointestinal conditions and enabled the same to colonize effectively in the intestinal lumen (in vitro). The bacterial cell counts ranging from 6.59 to 6.91 log(CFU/mL) was observed for Sporosarcina spp. after 16 h. This indicated that there is no significant difference in the cell counts (P-value = 0.90). The cell counts of Sporosarcina spp. ranging from 5.57 to 5.93 log(CFU/mL) displayed strong acid tolerance at pH 2. They were also viable at higher bile (0.5%) concentration. Among the Sporosarcina spp., pasteurii showed better tolerance (6.90 log(CFU/mL)) even after 16 h. Among the selected bacteria, Sporosarcina psychrophila was more susceptible to teicoplanin and meropenem with an inhibition zone of 30 mm. Maximum antagonistic activity was observed against Serratia marcescens (with inhibition zone up to 15 mm).

When PlzD or PlzD-GFP was highly over-produced in nutrient-poor condition, the polar flagellar motility of V. alginolyticus was reduced. This inhibitory effect is c-di-GMP independent as mutants substituting putative c-di-GMP-binding residues retain the effect. Moderate over-expression of PlzD-GFP allowed its localization at the flagellated cell pole. Truncation of the N-terminal 12 or 35 residues of PlzD abolished the inhibitory effect and polar localization, and no inhibitory effect was observed by deleting plzD or expressing an endogenous level of PlzD-GFP. Subcellular fractionation showed that PlzD, but not its N-terminally truncated variants, was precipitated when over-produced. Moreover, immunoblotting and N-terminal sequencing revealed that endogenous PlzD is synthesized from Met33.

Therefore, in this study, we developed a dynamic model to simulate sewer processes initiated by sewer. The dynamic sewer process model was calibrated and validated with experimental data collected from two pressurized mains in actual operation in Hong Kong (TCS and MH17). The results show that the dynamic model can satisfactorily predict the dynamic concentrations of sulfide and ammonium (with measured and simulated values differing by less than 6%). The model was employed to systematically assess the long-term effects of three commonly used control strategies, i.e. addition of nitrate salts, addition of biocides, and hydraulic flushing, on sulfide formation and to predict sewer biofilm compositions. The modeling results reveal that the effect of odor mitigation measures on sulfide control varied with time due to the re-establishment of sulfate-reducing bacteria community in sewer biofilm. The long-term effect of nitrate addition would be diminishing because of the growth of heterotrophic denitrifies in sewer biofilms (increased from 7% to 21% after 55 days of nitrate addition) to consumed more nitrate. After dosing biocide or hydraulic flushing in sewers, sulfide production would rebound in the following several days due to the regrowth of sewer biofilms, indicating that the optimization of odor mitigation strategies is necessary.

Antagonism towards S. pyogenes and potential off-target effects were determined using sessile monospecies biofilms and pharyngeal microcosms, respectively. The candidate probiotics were antagonistic towards S. pyogenes (rank order of increasing potency, Lactobacillus acidophilus < Lactobacillus plantarum < Streptococcus salivarius) in the absence of significant acidification or cell-cell contact.

We carried out a microcosm experiment where activated sludge bioreactors operated in daily cycles were subjected to eight different frequency levels of augmentation with a toxic pollutant, from never (undisturbed) to every day (press-disturbed), for 35 days. Microbial communities were assessed by combining distance-based methods, general linear multivariate models, α-diversity indices, and null model analyses on metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene amplicon data. A stronger temporal decrease in α-diversity at the extreme, undisturbed and press-disturbed, ends of the disturbance range led to a hump-backed pattern, with the highest diversity found at intermediate levels of disturbance. Undisturbed and press-disturbed levels displayed the highest community and functional similarity across replicates, suggesting deterministic processes were dominating. The opposite was observed amongst intermediately disturbed levels, indicating stronger stochastic assembly mechanisms. Trade-offs were observed in the ecosystem function between organic carbon removal and both nitrification and biomass productivity, as well as between diversity and these functions. Hence, not every ecosystem function was favoured by higher community diversity.

Here, we report that the lack of citrullination in a PPAD deletion mutant (Δ8820) enhances biofilm formation. More Δ8820 cells attached to the surface than the parent strain during the early stages of biofilm development and, ultimately, mature Δ8820 biofilms were comprised of significantly more cell-cell aggregates and extracellular matrix.

The robustness and reproducibility of the proposed method fill the current gap towards a reliable full-scale recovery as well as towards an accurate and meaningful investigation of anammox EPS and pave the way for further exploration of their applicative potential thus stimulating the desirable shift from the current wastewater treatment perspective towards biorefinery in a circular economy context.","authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Lotti"},{"name":"Emiliano Carretti"},{"name":"Debora Berti"},{"name":"Maria Raffaella Martina"},{"name":"Claudio Lubello"},{"name":"Francesca Malpei"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anammox biofilm"},{"word":"Biorefinery"},{"word":"Circular economy"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"Excess sludge"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"Extraction/recovery"}]},"article138":{"pmid":"30772604","title":"2,6-Disubstituted imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole derivatives as potent staphylococcal biofilm inhibitors.","date":"2019-04-18","abs":"A class of 36 new 2-(6-phenylimidazo[2,-1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-2-yl)-1H-indoles was efficiently synthesized and evaluated for their anti-biofilm properties against the Gram-positive bacterial reference strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 6538 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, and the Gram-negative strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922.

Artisanal cheese is usually produced using raw cow's milk, animal rennet and salt, without the addition of starter cultures. Coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) are often present in artisanal cheeses. Pathogenic potential of some CoNS species, especially S. epidermidis, suggests that they could correspond to emerging pathogens. The identified risk factors correspond to virulence, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. Therefore, we aimed to characterize S. epidermidis isolated along the artisanal raw milk production chain. Seventy artisanal cheeses samples from unpasteurized cow milk purchased in Podlasie and Warmia and Mazury region in Poland, were included in this study. A total of 26 S. epidermidis isolates were obtained. Most of them were antimicrobial resistant, such as to penicillin (84,6%), clindamycin (46,2%), tetracycline (42,3%), erythromycin (42,3%) and cefoxitin (26,9%). Only one isolate was susceptible to all antibiotics used in the study. All methicillin resistant S. epidermidis strains (26,9%) harbored mecA gene. Isolates, phenotypic resistant to tetracycline, harbored at least one tetracycline resistance determinant on which tet(M) was most frequent. Moreover, all tetracycline resistant strains harbored Tn916-Tn1545-like integrase family gene. In the erythromycin resistant isolates, the macrolide resistance genes ermC, ermB or msrA/B were present. Seven strains demonstrated a strong ability to form biofilm and moderate and weak biofilm was demonstrated by 4 strains, whereas 11 of S. epidermidis isolates were found to be unable to form a biofilm. All strains producing strong biofilm harbored the icaD gene which occurred independently or in combination with the icaA. Insertion element IS256, was identified in 15,4% of S. epidermidis strains, all of which were multidrug resistant. Arginine Catabolic Mobile Element (ACME) was identified in 13 of the 26 examined strains (50%). Most common was ACME type I (26,9%), followed by type III (15,4%) and type II (7,7%).

We couple stable isotope labeling with stimulated Raman scattering microscopy to visualize biofilm metabolic activity in situ. This approach shows that phenazines promote metabolism in microaerobic biofilm regions and influence metabolic responses to ciprofloxacin treatment.

In the present study, we show that EseC, but not EseD, inhibits the autoaggregation and biofilm formation of E. piscicida At 18 h postsubculture, a ΔeseC strain developed strong autoaggregation and mature biofilm formation, accompanied by enhanced formation of EseB filamentous appendages. This is in contrast to the weak autoaggregation and immature biofilm formation seen in the E. piscicida wild-type strain. EseE, a protein that directly binds to EseC and also positively regulates the transcription of the escC-eseE operon, was liberated and showed increased levels in the absence of EseC. This led to augmented transcription of the escC-eseE operon, thereby increasing the steady-state protein levels of intracellular EseB, EseD, and EseE, as well as biofilm formation. Notably, the levels of intracellular EseB and EseD produced by the ΔeseE and ΔeseC ΔeseE strains were similar but remarkably lower than those produced by the wild-type strain at 18 h postsubculture.

Despite the fact that cytotoxicity is well-characterized, few studies discuss the genome-wide genetic and epigenetic molecular mechanisms between host and C. albicans. The aim of this study is to identify drug targets and design a multiple-molecule drug to prevent the infection from C. albicans. To investigate the common and specific pathogenic mechanisms in human oral epithelial OKF6/TERT-2 cells during the C. albicans infection in different strains, systems modeling and big databases mining were used to construct candidate host⁻pathogen genetic and epigenetic interspecies network (GEIN). System identification and system order detection are applied on two-sided next generation sequencing (NGS) data to build real host⁻pathogen cross-talk GEINs. Core host⁻pathogen cross-talk networks (HPCNs) are extracted by principal network projection (PNP) method. By comparing with core HPCNs in different strains of C. albicans, common pathogenic mechanisms were investigated and several drug targets were suggested as follows: orf19.5034 (YBP1) with the ability of anti-ROS; orf19.939 (NAM7), orf19.2087 (SAS2), orf19.1093 (FLO8) and orf19.1854 (HHF22) with high correlation to the hyphae growth and pathogen protein interaction; orf19.5585 (SAP5), orf19.5542 (SAP6) and orf19.4519 (SUV3) with the cause of biofilm formation.

A well-designed active release coating might assist host immunity in clearing bacterial contaminants within the narrow perioperative window and ultimately prevent microbial colonization of the joint prosthesis. A first-in-class compound (CZ-01127) was tested as the active release agent in a silicone (Si) coating using an in vitro dynamic flow model of surgical site contamination and compared with analogous coatings containing clinical gold-standard antibiotics vancomycin and gentamicin; the CZ-01127 coating outperformed both vancomycin and gentamicin coatings and was the only to decrease the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) inocula below detectable limits for the first 3 days. The antimicrobial activity of CZ-01127, and for comparison vancomycin and gentamicin, were characterized against both planktonic and biofilm MRSA using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, serial passages, and serial dilution tests against established biofilms grown with a CBR 90 CDC biofilm reactor. Despite a similar MIC (1 µg/ml) and behavior in a 25-day serial passage analysis, CZ-01127 displayed much greater bactericidal activity against established biofilms and was the only to decrease biofilm colony forming units (CFUs) below detectable limits at the highest concentration tested (500 µg/ml). Coating release profiles were characterized using ATR-FTIR and displayed burst release kinetics within the decisive period of the perioperative window suggesting the silicon carrier is broadly useful for screening antibiotic compound for local delivery applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: With an aging population, an increasing number of people are undergoing total joint replacement procedures in which diseased joint tissues are replaced with permanent metallic implants. Some of these procedures are burdened by costly and debilitating infections. A promising approach to prevent infections is the use of an antimicrobial coating on the surface of the implant which releases antibiotics into the surgical site to prevent infection. In this study, we tested a new antibiotic compound formulated in a silicone coating. Data showed that this compound was more effective at killing pathogenic methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria than two clinical gold-standard antibiotics-vancomycin and gentamicin-and could be a promising agent for antimicrobial coating technologies.","authors":[{"name":"Nicholas N Ashton"},{"name":"Gina Allyn"},{"name":"Scott T Porter"},{"name":"Travis J Haussener"},{"name":"Paul R Sebahar"},{"name":"Ryan E Looper"},{"name":"Dustin L Williams"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiofilm"},{"word":"Antibiotic"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Coating"},{"word":"Norspermidine"},{"word":"Prosthetic joint infection"}]},"article152":{"pmid":"30769118","title":"Evolved Biofilm: Review on the Experimental Evolution Studies of Bacillus subtilis Pellicles.","date":"2019-12-21","abs":"For several decades, laboratory evolution has served as a powerful method to manipulate microorganisms and to explore long-term dynamics in microbial populations. Next to canonical Escherichia coli planktonic cultures, experimental evolution has expanded into alternative cultivation methods and species, opening the doors to new research questions. Bacillus subtilis, the spore-forming and root-colonizing bacterium, can easily develop in the laboratory as a liquid-air interface colonizing pellicle biofilm. Here, we summarize recent findings derived from this tractable experimental model. Clonal pellicle biofilms of B. subtilis can rapidly undergo morphological and genetic diversification creating new ecological interactions, for example, exploitation by biofilm non-producers. Moreover, long-term exposure to such matrix non-producers can modulate cooperation in biofilms, leading to different phenotypic heterogeneity pattern of matrix production with larger subpopulation of ON cells. Alternatively, complementary variants of biofilm non-producers, each lacking a distinct matrix component, can engage in a genetic division of labor, resulting in superior biofilm productivity compared to the generalist wild type. Nevertheless, inter-genetic cooperation appears to be evanescent and rapidly vanquished by individual biofilm formation strategies altering the amount or the properties of the remaining matrix component. Finally, fast-evolving mobile genetic elements can unpredictably shift intra-species interactions in B. subtilis biofilms. Understanding evolution in clonal biofilm populations will facilitate future studies in complex multispecies biofilms that are more representative of nature.","authors":[{"name":"Ákos T Kovács"},{"name":"Anna Dragoš"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"experimental evolution"},{"word":"heterogeneity"},{"word":"sociomicrobiology"}]},"article153":{"pmid":"30768738","title":"Susceptibility to Oral Antiseptics and Virulence Factors Ex Vivo Associated with Candida spp. Isolated from Dental Prostheses.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"To isolate Candida spp. from dental prosthesis users' saliva and to evaluate the isolates for the presence of several virulence factors.

It remains unclear, however, whether the interaction between plants and B. cereus AR156 may facilitate composition changes of plant root exudates and whether these changes directly affect the growth of both plant pathogens and B. cereus AR156 itself. Here, we addressed these questions by analyzing the influences of root exudate changes mediated by B. cereus AR156 during biocontrol against tomato bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. Indeed, some upregulated metabolites in tomato root exudates induced by B. cereus AR156 (REB), such as lactic acid and hexanoic acid, induced the growth and motile ability of in vitro B. cereus AR156 cells. Exogenously applying hexanoic acid and lactic acid to tomato plants showed positive biocontrol efficacy (46.6 and 39.36%) against tomato bacterial wilt, compared with 51.02% by B. cereus AR156 itself. Furthermore, fructose, lactic acid, sucrose and threonine at specific concentrations stimulated the biofilm formation of B. cereus AR156 in Luria-Bertan- Glycerol- Magnesium medium (LBGM), and we also detected more colonized cells of B. cereus AR156 on the tomato root surface after adding these four compounds to the system.

Based on possible electrochemical ractions of silver electrodes in chlorine containing medium; pH measurements of the medium post treatment; the time delay between initiation of treatment and observed bactericidal effects; and the presence of chlorotyrosine in the cell lysates, hypochlorous acid is hypothesized to be the chemical agent responsible for the observed (destruction/killing/eradication) of these biofilm forming bacteria.

OMVs are observed in lab-grown and environmental biofilms, but our understanding of their function comes primarily from planktonic studies. Planktonic OMVs assist in toxin delivery, cell-cell communication, horizontal gene transfer, small RNA trafficking, and immune system evasion. Previous studies reported differences in size and proteomic cargo between planktonic and agar plate biofilm OMVs, suggesting possible differences in function between OMV types. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa interstitial biofilms, extracellular vesicles were reported to arise through cell lysis, in contrast to planktonic OMV biogenesis that involves the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) without appreciable autolysis. Differences in biogenesis mechanism could provide a rationale for observed differences in OMV characteristics between systems. Using nanoparticle tracking, we found that P. aeruginosa PAO1 planktonic and biofilm OMVs had similar characteristics. However, P. aeruginosa PA14 OMVs were smaller, with planktonic OMVs also being smaller than their biofilm counterparts. Large differences in Staphylococcus killing ability were measured between OMVs from different strains, and a smaller within-strain difference was recorded between PA14 planktonic and biofilm OMVs. Across all conditions, the predatory ability of OMVs negatively correlated with their size. To address biogenesis mechanism, we analyzed vesicles from wild type and pqsA mutant biofilms. This showed that PQS is required for physiological-scale production of biofilm OMVs, and time-course analysis confirmed that PQS production precedes OMV production as it does in planktonic cultures. However, a small sub-population of vesicles was detected in pqsA mutant biofilms whose size distribution more resembled sonicated cell debris than wild type OMVs. These results support the idea that, while a small and unique population of vesicles in P. aeruginosa biofilms may result from cell lysis, the PQS-induced mechanism is required to generate the majority of OMVs produced by wild type communities.","authors":[{"name":"Adam C Cooke"},{"name":"Alexander V Nello"},{"name":"Robert K Ernst"},{"name":"Jeffrey W Schertzer"}],"keywords":[]},"article175":{"pmid":"30763337","title":"TyrR is involved in the transcriptional regulation of biofilm formation and D-alanine catabolism in Azospirillum brasilense Sp7.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Azospirillum brasilense is one of the most studied species of diverse agronomic plants worldwide. The benefits conferred to plants inoculated with Azospirillum have been primarily attributed to its capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen and synthesize phytohormones, especially indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The principal pathway for IAA synthesis involves the intermediate metabolite indole pyruvic acid. Successful colonization of plants by Azospirillum species is fundamental to the ability of these bacteria to promote the beneficial effects observed in plants. Biofilm formation is an essential step in this process and involves interactions with the host plant. In this study, the tyrR gene was cloned, and the translated product was observed to exhibit homology to TyrR protein, a NtrC/NifA-type activator. Structural studies of TyrR identified three putative domains, including a domain containing binding sites for aromatic amino acids in the N-terminus, a central AAA+ ATPase domain, and a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif domain in the C-terminus, which binds DNA sequences in promoter-operator regions. In addition, a bioinformatic analysis of promoter sequences in A. brasilense Sp7 genome revealed that putative promoters encompass one to three TyrR boxes in genes predicted to be regulated by TyrR. To gain insight into the phenotypes regulated by TyrR, a tyrR-deficient strain derived from A. brasilense Sp7, named A. brasilense 2116 and a complemented 2116 strain harboring a plasmid carrying the tyrR gene were constructed. The observed phenotypes indicated that the putative transcriptional regulator TyrR is involved in biofilm production and is responsible for regulating the utilization of D-alanine as carbon source. In addition, TyrR was observed to be absolutely required for transcriptional regulation of the gene dadA encoding a D-amino acid dehydrogenase.

Previously, we have shown that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of MA folding in vacuo can be used to characterize MA conformers in seven groupings relating to bending at the functional groups (W, U and Z-conformations). Providing a new OPLS-based forcefield parameterization for the critical cyclopropyl group of MAs and extensive simulations in explicit solvents (TIP4P water, hexane), we now present a more complete picture of MA folding properties together with improved simulation analysis techniques. We show that the 'WUZ' distance-based analysis can be used to pinpoint conformers with hairpin bends at the functional groups, with these conformers constituting only a fraction of accessible conformations. Applying principle component analysis (PCA) and refinement using free energy landscapes (FELs), we are able to discriminate a complete and unique set of conformational preferences for representative alpha-, methoxy- and keto-MAs, with overall preference for folded conformations. A control backbone-MA without any mero-chain functional groups showed significantly less folding in the mero-chain, confirming the role of functionalization in directing folding. Keto-MA showed the highest percentage of WUZ-type conformations and, in particular, a tendency to fold at its alpha-methyl trans-cyclopropane group, in agreement with results from Villeneuve et al. MAs demonstrate similar folding in vacuum and water, with a majority of folded conformations around the W-conformation, although the molecules are more flexible in vacuum than in water. Exchange between conformations, with a disperse distribution that includes unfolded conformers, is common in hexane for all MAs, although with more organization for Keto-MA.

At the outset, our initial hypothesis was that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) possess antimicrobial and antivirulence activities. Early on, we discovered that HMOs do indeed modulate bacterial growth and biofilm production for numerous bacterial pathogens. In light of this discovery, three priorities emerged for our program moving forward. The first was to decode the mode of action behind this activity. The second was to decipher the functional effects of HMO structural diversity as there are ca. 200 unique HMOs present in human milk. Finally, we set our sights on discovering novel uses for HMOs as we believed this would uniquely position our team to achieve a major breakthrough in human health and wellness. Through a combination of fractionation techniques, chemical synthesis, and industrial partnerships, we have determined the identities of several HMOs with potent antimicrobial activity against the important neonate pathogen Group B Streptococcus (Group B Strep; GBS).

They are able to proliferate under both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor conditions. This adaptation is what makes these fungi successful pathogens. For both species, sugars are very important nutrients and as the sugar level differs depending on the host niche, different sugar sensing systems must be present. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model for the identification of these sugar sensing systems. One of the main carbon sources for yeast is glucose, for which three different pathways have been described. First, two transporter-like proteins, ScSnf3 and ScRgt2, sense glucose levels resulting in the induction of different hexose transporter genes. This situation is comparable in C. albicans and C. glabrata, where sensing of glucose by CaHgt4 and CgSnf3, respectively, also results in hexose transporter gene induction. The second glucose sensing mechanism in S. cerevisiae is via the G-protein coupled receptor ScGpr1, which causes the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, resulting in rapid adaptation to the presence of glucose. The main components of this glucose sensing system are also conserved in C. albicans and C. glabrata. However, it seems that the ligand(s) for CaGpr1 are not sugars but lactate and methionine. In C. glabrata, this pathway has not yet been investigated. Finally, the glucose repression pathway ensures repression of respiration and repression of the use of alternative carbon sources. This pathway is not well characterized in Candida species. It is important to note that, apart from glucose, other sugars and sugar-analogs, such as N-acetylglucosamine in the case of C. albicans, are also important carbon sources. In these fungal pathogens, sensing sugars is important for a number of virulence attributes, including adhesion, oxidative stress resistance, biofilm formation, morphogenesis, invasion, and antifungal drug tolerance. In this review, the sugar sensing and signaling mechanisms in these Candida species are compared to S. cerevisiae.","authors":[{"name":"Mieke Van Ende"},{"name":"Stefanie Wijnants"},{"name":"Patrick Van Dijck"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Candida glabrata"},{"word":"Gpr1/Gpa2"},{"word":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae"},{"word":"Snf1/Mig1"},{"word":"Snf3/Rgt2-Hgt4"},{"word":"sugar sensing"},{"word":"sugar transport"}]},"article184":{"pmid":"30761113","title":"Concentration Dependent Effect of Plant Root Exudates on the Chemosensory Systems of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Plant root colonization by rhizobacteria can protect plants against pathogens and promote plant growth, and chemotaxis to root exudates was shown to be an essential prerequisite for efficient root colonization. Since many chemoattractants control the transcript levels of their cognate chemoreceptor genes, we have studied here the transcript levels of the 27 Pseudomonas putida KT2440 chemoreceptor genes in the presence of different maize root exudate (MRE) concentrations. Transcript levels were increased for 10 chemoreceptor genes at low MRE concentrations, whereas almost all receptor genes showed lower transcript levels at high MRE concentrations. The exposure of KT2440 to different MRE concentrations did not alter c-di-GMP levels, indicating that changes in chemoreceptor transcripts are not mediated by this second messenger. Data suggest that rhizosphere colonization unfolds in a temporal fashion. Whereas at a distance to the root, exudates enhance chemoreceptor gene transcript levels promoting in turn chemotaxis, this process is reversed in root vicinity, where the necessity of chemotaxis toward the root may be less important. Insight into KT2440 signaling processes were obtained by analyzing mutants defective in the three cheA paralogous genes. Whereas a mutant in cheA1 showed reduced c-di-GMP levels and impaired biofilm formation, a cheA2 mutant was entirely deficient in MRE chemotaxis, indicating the existence of homologs of the P. aeruginosawsp and che (chemotaxis) pathways. Signaling through both pathways was important for efficient maize root colonization. Future studies will show whether the MRE concentration dependent effect on chemoreceptor gene transcript levels is a feature shared by other species.","authors":[{"name":"Diana López-Farfán"},{"name":"José A Reyes-Darias"},{"name":"Miguel A Matilla"},{"name":"Tino Krell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"chemoreceptor"},{"word":"chemotaxis"},{"word":"root colonization"},{"word":"root exudates"}]},"article185":{"pmid":"30760902","title":"Bacteria and archaea on Earth and their abundance in biofilms.","date":"2020-01-21","abs":"Biofilms are a form of collective life with emergent properties that confer many advantages on their inhabitants, and they represent a much higher level of organization than single cells do.

In this study, we investigated the antibacterial properties of titanium samples following treatment with a non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma jet (NTAPPJ) on bacteria with two different cell wall structures, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The hydrophilicity and surface energy of titanium surfaces were significantly increased after NTAPPJ treatment without altering topographical features. Changes in the chemical composition and reductive potential were observed on the NTAPPJ-treated titanium surfaces. The adhesion and biofilm formation rate of bacteria were significantly reduced on the NTAPPJ-treated titanium surfaces compared with the untreated samples, which was confirmed by fluorescent imaging. Regarding the comparison between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, both adhesion and the biofilm formation rate were significantly lower for gram-negative bacteria than gram-positive bacteria on samples treated for longer durations with the NTAPPJ. Transmission electron microscopy imaging showed a comparably more disruptive membrane structure of gram-negative bacteria than gram-positive bacteria on the NTAPPJ-treated surfaces. Our results indicated that the NTAPPJ treatment could be useful for preventing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on titanium dental implant surfaces, while the reductive potential on surfaces treated by the NTAPPJ could cause oxidation of bacteria, which could be more sensitive to gram-negative bacteria due to differences in the cell wall structure.","authors":[{"name":"Myung-Jin Lee"},{"name":"Jae-Sung Kwon"},{"name":"Heng Bo Jiang"},{"name":"Eun Ha Choi"},{"name":"Gyungsoon Park"},{"name":"Kwang-Mahn Kim"}],"keywords":[]},"article187":{"pmid":"30760838","title":"Synthesis and antibiotic activity of novel acylated phloroglucinol compounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2020-02-12","abs":"The rise in antibiotic resistance among pathogenic microorganisms has created an imbalance in the drugs available for treatment, in part due to the slow development of new antibiotics.

Currently, there are not many on-line systems for monitoring the activity of the biofilm and the electron transfer process without harming the biofilm. Raman microscopy was shown to be capable of providing biochemical information, i.e., the redox state of C-type cytochromes, which is integral to external electron transfer, without harming the biofilm. In the current study, a custom 3D printed flow-through cuvette was used in order to analyze the oxidation state of the C-type cytochromes of suspended cultures of three Geobacter sulfurreducens strains (PCA, KN400 and ΔpilA). It was found that the oxidation state is a good indicator of the metabolic state of the cells. Furthermore, an anaerobic fluidic system enabling in situ Raman measurements was designed and applied successfully to monitor and characterize G. sulfurreducens biofilms during electricity generation, for both a wild strain, PCA, and a mutant, ΔS. The cytochrome redox state, monitored by the Raman peak areas, could be modulated by applying different poise voltages to the electrodes. This also correlated with the modulation of current transferred from the cytochromes to the electrode. The Raman peak area changed in a predictable and reversible manner, indicating that the system could be used for analyzing the oxidation state of the proteins responsible for the electron transfer process and the kinetics thereof in-situ.","authors":[{"name":"Adolf Krige"},{"name":"Magnus Sjöblom"},{"name":"Kerstin Ramser"},{"name":"Paul Christakopoulos"},{"name":"Ulrika Rova"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Geobacter sulfurreducens"},{"word":"Omc"},{"word":"Raman spectroscopy"},{"word":"cytochrome-C"},{"word":"microbial fuel cell"}]},"article194":{"pmid":"30759807","title":"A Multi-Bioassay Integrated Approach to Assess the Antifouling Potential of the Cyanobacterial Metabolites Portoamides.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The cyclic peptides portoamides produced by the cyanobacterium Phormidium sp.

Therefore, the coatings hinder water penetration along the otherwise vulnerable dentin/restoration interface, even after in vitro aging, and increase its resistance against degradation by water, acids, and saliva. Moreover, they do not weaken the resin composite restorations mechanically. The peptide-coated highly-hydrophobic dentin is expected to notably improve the service life of resin composite restorations and to enable the development of entirely hydrophobic restorative systems. The peptide coatings were also antimicrobial and thus, they provide a second tier of protection preventing re-infection of tissues in contact with restorations. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We present a technology using designer peptides to treat the most prevalent chronic disease worldwide; dental caries. Specifically, we used antimicrobial amphipathic peptides to coat dentin with the goal of increasing the service life of the restorative materials used to treat dental caries, which is nowadays 5 years on average. Water and waterborne agents (enzymes, acids) degrade restorative materials and enable re-infection at the dentin/restoration interface. Our peptide coatings will hinder degradation of the restoration as they produced highly hydrophobic and antimicrobial dentin/material interfaces. We anticipate a high technological and economic impact of our technology as it can notably reduce the lifelong dental bill of patients worldwide. Our findings can enable the development of restorations with all-hydrophobic and so, more protective components.","authors":[{"name":"Dina G Moussa"},{"name":"Alex Fok"},{"name":"Conrado Aparicio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"Dental restoration"},{"word":"Dentin"},{"word":"GL13K"},{"word":"Hydrophobic coating"},{"word":"Recurrent caries"}]},"article207":{"pmid":"30753649","title":"The serine peptidase inhibitor TPCK induces several morphophysiological changes in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto.","date":"2020-01-16","abs":"Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (C. parapsilosis) has emerged as the second/third commonest Candida species isolated from hospitals worldwide. Candida spp. possess numerous virulence attributes, including peptidases that play multiple roles in both physiological and pathological events. So, fungal peptidases are valid targets for new drugs development. With this premise in mind, we have evaluated the effect of serine peptidase inhibitors (SPIs) on both cell biology and virulence aspects of C. parapsilosis. First, five different SPIs, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, N-α-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride, and N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) were tested, and TPCK showed the best efficacy to arrest fungal growth. Subsequently, the ability of TPCK to modulate physiopathological processes was investigated. Overall, TPCK was able to (i) inhibit the cell-associated serine peptidase activities, (ii) promote morphometric and ultrastructural alterations, (iii) induce an increase in the intracellular oxidation level, which culminates in a vigorous lipid peroxidation and accumulation of neutral lipids in cytoplasmic inclusions, (iv) modulate the expression/exposition of surface structures, such as mannose/glucose-rich glycoconjugates, N-acetylglucosamine-containing molecules, chitin, polypeptides and surface aspartic peptidases, (v) reduce the adhesion to either polystyrene or glass surfaces as well as to partially disarticulate the mature biofilm, (vi) block the fungal interaction with macrophages, and (vii) protect Galleria mellonella from fungal infection, enhancing larvae survivability. Altogether, these results demonstrated that TPCK induced several changes over fungal biology besides the interference with aspects associated to C. parapsilosis virulence and pathogenesis, which indicates that SPIs could be novel promising therapeutic agents in dealing with candidiasis.","authors":[{"name":"Rafael M Gandra"},{"name":"Laura N Silva"},{"name":"Xênia M Souto"},{"name":"Leandro S Sangenito"},{"name":"Lucas P S Cruz"},{"name":"Lys A Braga-Silva"},{"name":"Diego S Gonçalves"},{"name":"Sergio H Seabra"},{"name":"Marta H Branquinha"},{"name":"André L S Santos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Candida parapsilosis        "},{"word":"          Galleria mellonella        "},{"word":"TPCK"},{"word":"proteolytic inhibitors"},{"word":"serine peptidases"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"30753506","title":"Efficacy of T-2307, a novel arylamidine, against ocular complications of disseminated candidiasis in mice.","date":"2019-09-11","abs":"T-2307, a novel arylamidine, shows broad-spectrum activity against pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans.

A variable pattern of toxicity was exhibited, in accordance with the constraints imposed by the host environments.

Both the admitted patients had temporary vascular catheter infections from the aforementioned pathogens. We conclude that the outbreak is due to colonization of treated reverse osmosis water, presumably through contamination via polluted filters and compounded by the usage of reprocessed dialysers in the dialysis center. This is especially relevant because contaminated treated water is directly introduced into the blood compartment of the dialysers during reprocessing. In addition, there seems to be a propensity for both organisms to cause prolonged febrile reactions in patients with temporary vascular catheters, likely through the early development of biofilm. Intensification of general sterilization procedures, servicing and replacement of old decrepit components of the water treatment system and temporary cessation of dialyser reuse practice seem to have halted the outbreak. Due to the virulent nature and difficult resistant profile of nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria, we strongly recommend meticulous vigilance in the surveillance of culture isolates in routine microbiological specimens from dialysis centers, especially if there is a senescent water treatment system and a practice of reprocessing dialysers.","authors":[{"name":"May K Thet"},{"name":"Ma Lourdes F Pelobello"},{"name":"Milton Das"},{"name":"Mohammed M Alhaji"},{"name":"Vui Heng Chong"},{"name":"Muhammad Abdul Mabood Khalil"},{"name":"Terence Chinniah"},{"name":"Jackson Tan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Ralstonia Pickettii"},{"word":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"},{"word":"Outbreak"},{"word":"hemodialysis"}]},"article217":{"pmid":"30746681","title":"N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is one of the most common pathogens to establish and cause infection in human beings, affecting about 50% of the world's population.

For this reason, the aim of this work was to evaluate the response of S. saprophyticus biofilms to five antimicrobial agents. Staphylococcus saprophyticus was evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility in its planktonic form by means of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and in biofilms by means of minimum inhibitory concentration in biofilm (MICB) against the following antimicrobial agents by the microdilution technique: vancomycin, oxacillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin. Of the 169 S. saprophyticus studied, 119 produced a biofilm as demonstrated by the polystyrene plate adherence method. Biofilm cells of S. saprophyticus exhibited a considerable increase in MICB when compared to the planktonic forms, with an increase of more than 32 times in the MICB of some drugs. Some isolates switched from the category of susceptible in the planktonic condition to resistant in the biofilm state. Statistical analysis of the results showed a significant increase in MICB (p < 0.0001) for all five drugs tested in the biofilm state compared to the planktonic form. Regarding determination of the minimum bactericidal concentration in biofilm (MBCB), there were isolates for which the minimum bactericidal concentration of all drugs was equal to or higher than the highest concentration tested.","authors":[{"name":"Katheryne Benini Martins"},{"name":"Adriano Martison Ferreira"},{"name":"Valéria Cataneli Pereira"},{"name":"Luiza Pinheiro"},{"name":"Adilson de Oliveira"},{"name":"Maria de Lourdes Ribeiro de Souza da Cunha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MBCB"},{"word":"MICB"},{"word":"Staphylococcus saprophyticus"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article219":{"pmid":"30745390","title":"Role of Viscoelasticity in Bacterial Killing by Antimicrobials in Differently Grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizes the sputum of most adult cystic fibrosis patients, forming difficult-to-eradicate biofilms in which bacteria are protected in their self-produced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrices.

These deposits reduce the eco-efficiency of the processing equipment and increase the risk of subsequent surface contamination with the formation of biofilms. In the agro-food and water supplier sectors, which are our main concern, fouling on the hot walls of processing heat exchangers is a common occurrence and requires frequent cleaning cycles to ensure hygiene requirements are met. This results in a considerable ecological footprint. Sensors and diagnostic tools for monitoring fouling are thus of utmost importance to ensure the rational validation of the cleaning end-point and to decrease the environmental impact of the cleaning cycles. In this paper, a non-destructive ultrasonic monitoring technique using coda waves and the associated signal processing was tested to monitor the evolution over time of a deposit layer on a solid wall during cleaning. To ascertain the feasibility of the method, a piece of wax of controlled thickness was deposited to simulate the initial fouling state and a cleaning cycle was launched. The decorrelation coefficient was used as an indicator to monitor fouling. This article presents the principle of this unprecedented technique for measuring the degree of fouling. The results of the experiments show that this non-destructive monitoring technology is sensitive to changes in fouling and that the decorrelation coefficient curves are in agreement with the cleaning kinetics captured using a video camera, thus ascertaining the pertinence of the diagnostic tool proposed.","authors":[{"name":"B Chen"},{"name":"D Callens"},{"name":"P Campistron"},{"name":"E Moulin"},{"name":"P Debreyne"},{"name":"G Delaplace"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cleaning"},{"word":"Coda wave interferometry"},{"word":"Fouling"},{"word":"Ultrasonic"}]},"article221":{"pmid":"30744421","title":"Dose-response effect of chlorhexidine on a multispecies oral biofilm formed on pure titanium and on a titanium-zirconium alloy.","date":"2019-06-27","abs":"This study aimed to test the dose-response effect of chlorhexidine on multispecies biofilms formed on commercially pure titanium (cpTi) and titanium-zirconium (TiZr) alloy.

Results showed that biofilm development have different growth rate and distinct algae composition in different seasons, which are mainly related to the difference in temperature, nutrient levels, and suspend solids in lake water. Biofilm development was much quicker on small plastics in all seasons. At the end of the experiment, all plastics lost buoyancy in summer while only a small portion lost buoyance in other seasons. Sinking of the floating plastics can be attributed to the development of biofilm and the trapped minerals. Our results demonstrated that biofilm development can cause the sinking of floating plastics in fresh lakes but the time required to lose buoyance can differ seasonally. Floating plastics will remain in water for a longer time in cold season but sink in a short time in warm season.

Especially for extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of archaea and their biofilms in bioleaching environments information is rather limited. The present work focused on investigations of biofilm dynamics and EPS production of the thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus sp. DSM 29099 under bioleaching conditions. The results show that biofilms are dispersed non-homogeneously on pyrite. Large parts of the pyrite surfaces remain free of cells. Cell detachment from pyrite results in microbial footprints which, based on lectin binding assays, consist of mannose, glucose and fucose containing compounds. A monolayer biofilm develops on pyrite after 2-4 days of incubation. In addition, the pyrite surface is covered with a layer of organic compounds. EPS analysis indicates the presence of proteins, polysaccharides and uronic acids, the composition of which varies according to substrate and lifestyle (i.e. planktonic, biofilm cells). This report provides insight into EPS and biofilm characteristics of thermophilic archaea and improves understanding of the mineral-microbial-biofilm interfacial interactions in extreme environments. Moreover, the results on interaction dynamics of archaeal microbial consortia will facilitate the understanding of thermophilic bioleaching.","authors":[{"name":"Ruiyong Zhang"},{"name":"Thomas R Neu"},{"name":"Véronique Blanchard"},{"name":"Mario Vera"},{"name":"Wolfgang Sand"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm dynamics"},{"word":"Bioleaching"},{"word":"Confocal laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"Thermoacidophilic archaea"}]},"article232":{"pmid":"30742947","title":"In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of laser exposed chlorpromazine against Gram-positive bacteria in planktonic and biofilm growth state.","date":"2019-05-28","abs":"Aqueous chlorpromazine solutions exposed to 266 nm generated as fourth harmonic of Nd:YAG pulsed laser along time intervals from 1 min to 240 min were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against planktonic and adherent Gram-positive bacterial strains.

LuxR interacts with RNA polymerase in vitro and in vivo and specifically interacts with both the N- and C-terminal domains of the RNA polymerase α-subunit. Amino acid substitutions in the RNAP interaction domain on LuxR decrease interactions between LuxR and the α-subunit and result in defects in transcription activation of quorum-sensing genes in vivo. The RNAP-LuxR interaction domain is conserved in Vibrio cholerae HapR and is required for activation of the HapR-regulated gene hapA.

Enterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of local and disseminated multidrug-resistant hospital infections, but the molecular mechanisms used by this non-motile bacterium to penetrate surfaces and translocate through tissues remain largely unexplored. Here we present experimental evidence indicating that E. faecalis generates exopolysaccharides containing β-1,6-linked poly-N-acetylglucosamine (polyGlcNAc) as a mechanism to successfully penetrate semisolid surfaces and translocate through human epithelial cell monolayers. Genetic screening and molecular analyses of mutant strains identified glnA, rpiA and epaX as genes critically required for optimal E. faecalis penetration and translocation. Mechanistically, GlnA and RpiA cooperated to generate uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) that was utilized by EpaX to synthesize polyGlcNAc-containing polymers. Notably, exogenous supplementation with polymeric N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) restored surface penetration by E. faecalis mutants devoid of EpaX. Our study uncovers an unexpected mechanism whereby the RpiA-GlnA-EpaX metabolic axis enables production of polyGlcNAc-containing polysaccharides that endow E. faecalis with the ability to penetrate surfaces.

MRSA isolates from patients with CF that were collected over a 4-year period were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing, transcriptional analysis, and metabolic studies. Persistent MRSA infection was associated with staphylococcal metabolic adaptation, but not changes in immunogenicity. Adaptation was characterized by selective use of the tricarboxylic acid cycle cycle and generation of biofilm, a means of limiting oxidant stress. Increased transcription of specific metabolic genes was conserved in all host-adapted strains, most notably a 10,000-fold increase in fumC, which catalyzes the interconversion of fumarate and malate. Elevated fumarate levels promoted in vitro biofilm production in clinical isolates. Host-adapted strains preferred to assimilate glucose polymers and pyruvate, which can be metabolized to generate N-acetylglucosamine polymers that comprise biofilm.

This study endeavors to systematically review scientific data on the traditional uses, phytochemical composition, and pharmacological properties of P. nigrum. Information was obtained using a combination of keywords via recognized electronic databases (e.g., Science Direct and Google Scholar). Google search was also used. Books and online materials were also considered, and the literature search was restricted to the English language. The country with the highest number of traditional reports of P. nigrum for both human and veterinary medicine was India, mostly for menstrual and ear-nose-throat disorders in human and gastrointestinal disorders in livestock. The seeds and fruits were mostly used, and the preferred mode of preparation was in powdered form, pills or tablets, and paste. Piper nigrum and its bioactive compounds were also found to possess important pharmacological properties. Antimicrobial activity was recorded against a wide range of pathogens via inhibition of biofilm, bacterial efflux pumps, bacterial swarming, and swimming motilities. Studies also reported its antioxidant effects against a series of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species including the scavenging of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, DPPH, ABTS, and reducing effect against ferric and molybdenum (VI). Improvement of antioxidant enzymes in vivo has also been reported. Piper nigrum also exhibited anticancer effect against a number of cell lines from breast, colon, cervical, and prostate through different mechanisms including cytotoxicity, apoptosis, autophagy, and interference with signaling pathways. Its antidiabetic property has also been confirmed in vivo as well as hypolipidemic activity as evidenced by decrease in the level of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein and increase in high-density lipoprotein.

Biofilms were either nonantibiotic exposed or previously exposed to ciprofloxacin before disaggregation and subsequent challenge with ciprofloxacin. Viable counts showed that late stationary phase cells were tolerant to ciprofloxacin over 24 h exposure, while all other populations presented a biphasic killing pattern. In contrast, the metabolic activity of planktonic and biofilm-derived cells remained similar to controls during the initial 6 h of ciprofloxacin exposure, despite a significant reduction in viable cell numbers. A similar effect was observed when assessing the postantibiotic effect of 1 h ciprofloxacin exposure. Thus, although cell reduction occurred, the metabolic status of the cells remained unchanged. The recovery of disaggregated biofilm cells previously exposed to ciprofloxacin was significantly quicker than naïve biofilm cells, and this latter population's recovery was significantly slower than all planktonic populations. Results from this work have implications for our understanding of biofilm-related infections and their resilience to antimicrobial treatment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Removal of biofilms from surfaces and infection sites via disaggregation and induction of dispersion may reverse their antibiotic tolerant state. However, little is known of the recovery of the cells upon disaggregation from biofilms. Driven by this gap in knowledge we quantified the effect of ciprofloxacin on disaggregated biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including those previously exposed to ciprofloxacin. Our results provide further insight into bacterial resilience, regrowth, and antimicrobial efficacy, as reduction in cell viability does not directly correlate with the metabolic activity of bacteria at the time of the exposure to antimicrobials.

These infections are often recalcitrant to treatment and require therapy with multiple drugs for long duration. The biofilm resident bacteria also display phenotypic drug tolerance and thus it has been hypothesized that the drug unresponsiveness in vivo could be due to formation of biofilms inside the host. We have discussed the biofilms of several pathogenic non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) species in context to the in vivo pathologies. Besides pathogenic NTMs, Mycobacterium smegmatis is often used as a model organism for understanding mycobacterial physiology and has been studied extensively for understanding the mycobacterial biofilms. A number of components of the mycobacterial cell wall such as glycopeptidolipids, short chain mycolic acids, monomeromycolyl diacylglycerol, etc. have been shown to play an important role in formation of pellicle biofilms. It shall be noted that these components impart a hydrophobic character to the mycobacterial cell surface that facilitates cell to cell interaction. However, these components are not necessarily the constituents of the extracellular matrix of mycobacterial biofilms. In the end, we have described the biofilms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis. Three models of Mtb biofilm formation have been proposed to study the factors regulating biofilm formation, the physiology of the resident bacteria, and the nature of the biomaterial that holds these bacterial masses together. These models include pellicle biofilms formed at the liquid-air interface of cultures, leukocyte lysate-induced biofilms, and thiol reductive stressinduced biofilms. All the three models offer their own advantages in the study of Mtb biofilms. Interestingly, lipids (mainly keto-mycolic acids) are proposed to be the primary component of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in the pellicle biofilm, whereas the leukocyte lysate-induced and thiol reductive stress-induced biofilms possess polysaccharides as the primary component of EPS. Both models also contain extracellular DNA in the EPS. Interestingly, thiol reductive stressinduced Mtb biofilms are held together by cellulose and yet unidentified structural proteins.

As increasingly isolated strains present resistance to currently used antifungals, it is necessary to develop novel antimycotics. In a previous study, sodium houttuyfonate (SH) alone or in combination with fluconazole revealed relatively strong antifungal potential against C. albicans, and the underlying mechanism might be likely to be associated with β-glucan synthesis and transportation (Shao et al., 2017). In the present experiment, we used a standard C. albicans isolate and a phr1 mutant (phr1-/-) to investigate the interaction of SH with β-glucan, one of the critical components in cell wall and biofilm matrix. We showed that lyticase was the most effective enzyme that could significantly increase the antifungal inhibition of SH at 64 μg/mL in C. albicans SC5314 but became futile in phr1-/-. Although the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of SH were comparable in the two Candida strains used, phr1-/- appeared to be more susceptible to SH compared with C. albicans SC5314 in biofilms (64 versus 512 μg/mL). The peak areas of SH decreased markedly by 71.6, 38.2, and 62.6% in C. albicans SC5314 and by 70% and 53.2% in phr1-/- by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis after co-incubation of SH with laminarin, extracellular matrix (EM) and cell wall. The chitin appeared to not interact with SH. We further demonstrated that sub-MIC SH (8 μg/mL) was able to induce cell wall remodeling by unmasking β-1,3-glucan and chitin in both C. albicans SC5314 and phr1-/-.

T4P continuously elongate and retract. These pilus dynamics crucially affect the local order, shape, and fluidity of microcolonies. The major pilin subunit of the T4P bears multiple post-translational modifications. By interfering with different steps of the pilin glycosylation and phosphoform modification pathways, we investigated the effect of pilin post-translational modification on the shape and dynamics of microcolonies formed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Deleting the phosphotransferase responsible for phosphoethanolamine modification at residue serine 68 inhibits shape relaxations of microcolonies after perturbation and causes bacteria carrying the phosphoform modification to segregate to the surface of mixed colonies. We relate these mesoscopic phenotypes to increased attractive forces generated by T4P between cells. Moreover, by deleting genes responsible for the pilin glycan structure, we show that the number of saccharides attached at residue serine 63 affects the ratio between surface tension and viscosity and cause sorting between bacteria carrying different pilin glycoforms. We conclude that different pilin post-translational modifications moderately affect the attractive forces between bacteria but have severe effects on the material properties of microcolonies.","authors":[{"name":"Robert Zöllner"},{"name":"Tom Cronenberg"},{"name":"Nadzeya Kouzel"},{"name":"Anton Welker"},{"name":"Michael Koomey"},{"name":"Berenike Maier"}],"keywords":[]},"article251":{"pmid":"30739147","title":"Microbial Organic Matter Utilization in High-Arctic Streams: Key Enzymatic Controls.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"In the Arctic, climate changes contribute to enhanced mobilization of organic matter in streams. Microbial extracellular enzymes are important mediators of stream organic matter processing, but limited information is available on enzyme processes in this remote area.

We evaluated 12 stream reaches in Northeast Greenland draining areas exhibiting different geomorphological features with contrasting contents of soil organic matter to cover a wide range of environmental conditions. We determined stream nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, quantified algal biomass and bacterial density, and characterized the extracellular enzyme activities involved in catalyzing the cleavage of a range of organic matter compounds (e.g., β-glucosidase, phosphatase, β-xylosidase, cellobiohydrolase, and phenol oxidase). We found significant differences in microbial organic matter utilization among the study streams draining contrasting geomorphological features, indicating a strong coupling between terrestrial and stream ecosystems. Phosphatase and phenol oxidase activities were higher in solifluction areas than in alluvial areas. Besides dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen availability was the main driver controlling enzyme activities in the high-Arctic, which suggests enhanced organic matter mineralization at increased nutrient availability. Overall, our study provides novel information on the controls of organic matter usage by high-Arctic stream biofilms, which is of high relevance due to the predicted increase of nutrient availability in high-Arctic streams in global climate change scenarios.","authors":[{"name":"Ada Pastor"},{"name":"Anna Freixa"},{"name":"Louis J Skovsholt"},{"name":"Naicheng Wu"},{"name":"Anna M Romaní"},{"name":"Tenna Riis"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Extracellular enzymes"},{"word":"Geomorphology"},{"word":"Greenland"},{"word":"Nutrients"}]},"article252":{"pmid":"30739073","title":"Mycobacterial metabolic characteristics in a water meter biofilm revealed by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics.","date":"2019-09-25","abs":"Mycobacteria represent one of the most persistent bacterial populations in drinking water distribution system (DWDS) biofilm communities; however, mycobacterial in situ metabolic profiles are largely unknown.

In drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), effective removal of cyanotoxins with reduced toxicity is a primary concern. Commonly used treatments, such as ozonation, chlorination or activated carbon, undergo significant changes in their operating conditions (mainly dosage) to counter the variation in different environmental parameters, such as pH, temperature, and high cyanotoxin concentration. Presence of metal ions, natural organic matter (NOM), and other chemicals demand higher dosage and hence affect the activation energy to efficiently break down the cyanotoxin molecule. Due to these higher dose requirements, the treatment leads to the formation of toxic metabolites at a concentration high enough to break the guideline values. Biological methods of cyanotoxin removal proceed via enzymatic pathway where the protein-encoding genes are often responsible for the compound breakdown into non-toxic metabolites. However, in contrast to the chemical treatment, the biological processes advance at a much slower kinetic rate, predominantly due to a longer onset period (high lag phase). In fact, more than 90% of the studies reported on the biological degradation of the cyanotoxins attribute the biodegradation to the bacterial suspension. This suspended growth limits the mass transfer kinetics due to the presence of metal ions, NOMs and, other oxidizable matter, which further prolongs the lag phase and makes biological process toxic-free, albeit less efficient. In this context, this review attempts to bring out the importance of the attached growth mechanism, in particular, the biofilm-based treatment approaches which can enhance the biodegradation rate.","authors":[{"name":"Pratik Kumar"},{"name":"Krishnamoorthy Hegde"},{"name":"Satinder Kaur Brar"},{"name":"Maximiliano Cledon"},{"name":"Azadeh Kermanshahi-Pour"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Attached growth process"},{"word":"Biodegradation"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cyanotoxin"},{"word":"Gene analysis"}]},"article255":{"pmid":"30737896","title":"Proteoliposome-based model for screening inhibitors targeting histidine kinase AgrC.","date":"2020-02-27","abs":"AgrC, as an integral membrane receptor protein with histidine kinase activity, is an important component of the agr quorum-sensing system of Staphylococcus aureus.

These results were further confirmed by scanning electron microscope images, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, confocal-laser scanning microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and corrosion testing using electrochemical analysis.","authors":[{"name":"Ini-Ibehe Nabuk Etim"},{"name":"Jie Wei"},{"name":"Junhua Dong"},{"name":"Dake Xu"},{"name":"Nan Chen"},{"name":"Xin Wei"},{"name":"Mingzhong Su"},{"name":"Wei Ke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EIS"},{"word":"Steel reinforced concrete"},{"word":"XPS"},{"word":"XRD"},{"word":"microbiological corrosion"}]},"article273":{"pmid":"30732463","title":"Ureteral stent-associated infection and sepsis: pathogenesis and prevention: a review.","date":"2019-07-01","abs":"Ureteral stents are commonly used devices in hospital settings.

In presence of EN2 and EN9, the corrosion rates (CR) were higher, about 0.021 mm/y and 0.032 mm/y than control system (0.004 mm/y). On the other hand, the presence of corrosion inhibitor 2-mercaptopyridine (2-MCP) with bacteria (EN2 and EN9), the biofilm on metal surface was highly inhibited and thus reduces the corrosion rate (CR: 0.004 mm/y). The electrochemical behaviour of CW024A metal was correlated with the adsorbed corrosion inhibitor film and biofilm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed that the presence of EN2 and EN9 more pits was observed on the metal surface rather than 2-MCP system. EIS confirms the inhibitor act as cathodic type of inhibitor and thus leads to the inhibition of CR. Overall, this work concluded that corrosion inhibitor (2-MCP) inhibits, the bacterial biofilm formation on the metal surface due to the formation of productive layer on metal surface as coordination of NH bond. Which leads to the reduction of bacterial attachment and thus higher corrosion inhibition efficiency (75%) obtained.

One of the derivatives, PPAP 23, which showed high antimicrobial activity and low cytotoxicity, was chosen for further investigation of its bactericidal profiles and mode of action. PPAP 23 showed a better efficacy in killing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and decreasing the metabolic activity of 5-day-old biofilm cells than vancomycin. Moreover, S. aureus did not appear to develop resistance against PPAP 23. The antimicrobial mechanism of PPAP 23 was investigated by RNA-seq combined with phenotypic and biochemical approaches. RNA-seq suggested that PPAP 23 signaled iron overload to the bacterial cells because genes involved in iron transport were downregulated and iron storage gene was upregulated by PPAP 23. PPAP 23 affected the membrane integrity but did not induce pore formation; it inhibited bacterial respiration. PPAP 23 preferentially inhibited Fe-S cluster enzymes; it has a mild iron chelating activity and supplementation of exogenous iron attenuated its antimicrobial activity. PPAP 23 was more effective in inhibiting the growth of S. aureus under iron-restricted condition. The crystal structure of a benzylated analog of PPAP 23 showed a highly defined octahedral coordination of three PPAP ligands around a Fe (3+) core. This suggests that PPAPs are generally capable of iron chelation and are able to form defined stable complexes. PPAP 23 was found to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Fluorescence microscopic analysis showed that PPAP 23 caused an enlargement of the bacterial cells, perturbed the membrane, and dislocated the nucleoid. Taken together, we postulate that PPAP 23 interacts with the cytoplasmic membrane with its hydrophobic pocket and interferes with the iron metabolism to exert its antimicrobial activity in Staphylococcus aureus.","authors":[{"name":"Huanhuan Wang"},{"name":"Frank Kraus"},{"name":"Peter Popella"},{"name":"Aslihan Baykal"},{"name":"Claudia Guttroff"},{"name":"Patrice François"},{"name":"Peter Sass"},{"name":"Bernd Plietker"},{"name":"Friedrich Götz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"PPAP 23"},{"word":"Staphylococci"},{"word":"VRE"},{"word":"antibiotic"},{"word":"iron metabolism"},{"word":"mode of action"}]},"article283":{"pmid":"30728810","title":"Role of Two-Component System Response Regulator bceR in the Antimicrobial Resistance, Virulence, Biofilm Formation, and Stress Response of Group B Streptococcus.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) is a leading cause of sepsis in neonates and pregnant mothers worldwide. Whereas the hyper-virulent serogroup III clonal cluster 17 has been associated with neonatal disease and meningitis, serogroup III ST283 was recently implicated in invasive disease among non-pregnant adults in Asia. Here, through comparative genome analyses of invasive and non-invasive ST283 strains, we identified a truncated DNA-binding regulator of a two-component system in a non-invasive strain that was homologous to Bacillus subtilis bceR, encoding the bceRSAB response regulator, which was conserved among GBS strains. Using isogenic knockout and complementation mutants of the ST283 strain, we demonstrated that resistance to bacitracin and the human antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin LL-37 was reduced in the ΔbceR strain with MICs changing from 64 and 256 μg/ml to 0.25 and 64 μg/ml, respectively. Further, the ATP-binding cassette transporter was upregulated by sub-inhibitory concentrations of bacitracin in the wild-type strain. Upregulation of dltA in the wild-type strain was also observed and thought to explain the increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides. DltA, an enzyme involved in D-alanylation during the synthesis of wall teichoic acids, which mediates reduced antimicrobial susceptibility, was previously shown to be regulated by the bceR-type regulator in Staphylococcus aureus. In a murine infection model, we found that the ΔbceR mutation significantly reduced the mortality rate compared to that with the wild-type strain (p < 0.01). Moreover, this mutant was more susceptible to oxidative stress compared to the wild-type strain (p < 0.001) and was associated with reduced biofilm formation (p < 0.0001). Based on 2-DGE and mass spectrometry, we showed that downregulation of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC), a Gls24 family stress protein, and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) in the ΔbceR strain might explain the attenuated virulence and compromised stress response. Together, we showed for the first time that the bceR regulator in GBS plays an important role in bacitracin and antimicrobial peptide resistance, virulence, survival under oxidative stress, and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Ying Yang"},{"name":"Mingjing Luo"},{"name":"Haokui Zhou"},{"name":"Carmen Li"},{"name":"Alison Luk"},{"name":"GuoPing Zhao"},{"name":"Kitty Fung"},{"name":"Margaret Ip"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Group B Streptococcus"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide resistance"},{"word":"bceR"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"stress response"},{"word":"two component system"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article284":{"pmid":"30728626","title":"Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm and Virulence by Active Fraction of Syzygium cumini (L.)

As these two bacterial processes are energy-dependent, herein it was evaluated if 2-AI compounds affect mycobacterial bioenergetics.

However, they exert negative effects in clinical applications, for example, teeth staining, taste disturbance and harm to oral tissue after a long-term exposure. Therefore, biocompatible strategies for efficient antibacterial drug delivery are in high demand. In this study, aimed at dental caries therapy enhancement, we designed a pH-responsive nanocarrier system, capable of releasing CHX in an acidic environment within cariogenic biofilms. Cationic poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-(((2-aminoethyl)carbamoyl)oxy)ethyl methacrylate) (PEG-b-PAECOEMA) was synthesized first. Modification of PAECOEMA by citraconic anhydride (CA) forms negatively charged PEG-b-PAECOEMA/CA, which could assemble into core-shell polyionic complex micelles (PICMs) when mixed with cationic CHX via electrostatic interactions. PICMs are stable in healthy neutral oral microenvironments with CHX encapsulated in the core and PEG shell exposed. Once in acidic milieu within caries-producing biofilms, they rapidly disassemble and release CHX cargo owing to degradation of citraconic amide groups. Molecular structures of the above copolymers were confirmed using 1H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. The pH-dependent degradation rates of citraconic amide in PEG-b-PAECOEMA/CA copolymer were measured by fluorescamine method. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies confirmed successful assembly of well-defined spherical PICMs in aqueous solution. The disassembly of PICMs in acidic microenvironment was observed using dynamic light scattering (DLS). PICMs showed an obvious pH-dependent drug release profile when the pH changed from 7.4 to 5.5. More importantly, the micellar system could reduce drug toxicity of CHX and exhibited outstanding antibacterial capability in the biofilm of Streptococcus mutans. Micelles constructed from pH-sensitive PEG-b-PAECOEMA/CA are highly promising for dental caries therapy and provide guidelines for drug-delivery system design in other acidic pathologic systems.","authors":[{"name":"Zhouxiang Zhao"},{"name":"Chunmei Ding"},{"name":"Yaqin Wang"},{"name":"Hong Tan"},{"name":"Jianshu Li"}],"keywords":[]},"article298":{"pmid":"30723364","title":"In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial property of silver nanoparticles and chlorhexidine against five different oral pathogenic bacteria.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Numerous antimicrobial agents are used to eliminate oral biofilm.

In dentistry, Streptococcus gordonii is an early oral colonizer initiating dental biofilm formation and also being involved in life-threatening infective endocarditis. To treat oral biofilms, antibacterial mouth rinses are commonly used. Such initial biomaterial-bacteria interactions and the influence of antibacterial treatments are poorly understood and investigated here in situ by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). A saliva-coated titanium (Ti) biosensor is applied to analyze possible specific signal patterns indicating microbial binding mechanisms and bactericide-caused changes in bacterial film rigidity or cell leakage caused by a clinically relevant antibacterial agent (ABA), i.e., a mouth rinse comprising chlorhexidine (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). Apparent missing mass effects during the formation of microscopically proven dense and vital bacterial films indicate punctual, specific binding of S. gordonii to the saliva-coated biosensor, compared to unspecific adhesion to pure Ti. Coincidentally to ABA-induced killing of surface-adhered bacteria, an increase of adsorbed dissipative mass can be sensed, contrary to the prior mass-loss. This suggests the acoustic sensing of the leakage of cellular content caused by bacterial cell wall rupturing and membrane damage upon the bactericidal attack. The results have significant implications for testing bacterial adhesion mechanisms and cellular integrity during interaction with antibacterial agents.","authors":[{"name":"Zeqian Xu"},{"name":"Luisa Coriand"},{"name":"Ronny Loeffler"},{"name":"Juergen Geis-Gerstorfer"},{"name":"Yi Zhou"},{"name":"Lutz Scheideler"},{"name":"Monika Fleischer"},{"name":"Frank K Gehring"},{"name":"Frank Rupp"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial"},{"word":"Cellular leakage"},{"word":"Cetylpyridinium chloride"},{"word":"Chlorhexidine"},{"word":"QCM-D"},{"word":"Saliva-coated biosensor"}]},"article300":{"pmid":"30720875","title":"Antimicrobial action of photodynamic therapy in root canals using LED curing light, curcumin and carbopol gel.","date":"2019-10-29","abs":"To evaluate the capacity of carbopol gel to maintain the intensity of a LED curing light (blueLED) along the length of prepared root canals in bovine teeth, and to assess the antimicrobial capacity of curcumin photoactivated by a LED curing light in the presence of carbopol gel.","authors":[{"name":"D F Oda"},{"name":"M A H Duarte"},{"name":"F B Andrade"},{"name":"L T Moriyama"},{"name":"V S Bagnato"},{"name":"I G de Moraes"}],"keywords":[{"word":"curcumin"},{"word":"disinfection"},{"word":"endodontics"},{"word":"photodynamic therapy"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"30720812","title":"Nanoprobe-based force spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing the mechanical adhesion of bacteria.","date":"2019-08-07","abs":"The first stage of biofilm-associated infections is commonly caused by initial adhesion of bacteria to intravascular tubes, catheters and other medical devices.

Previously, it has been reported that substrate stiffness plays an important role in the initial attachment of bacteria. However, the mechanism of how the stiffness modulates the initial adhesion of bacteria remains unclear. Here, we developed magnetic nanoprobe-based force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) as a new platform to measure the adhesion force of bacteria. Through examining the initial adhesion force and the adhesive protein, fibronectin-binding protein (FnBP), of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), we found that the increase of the substrate stiffness promoted the expression of FnBP, thus enhancing the initial adhesion force of bacteria. Following the formation of initial adhesion, the substrates with soft stiffness delayed the biofilm formation, whereas those with moderate stiffness showed preferential promotion of the biofilm formation. We expect this versatile platform to be beneficial to the study of adhesion behaviors of bacteria that sheds light on the design of new medical materials to treat microbial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Chanchan Yu"},{"name":"Di Zhang"},{"name":"Xueyan Feng"},{"name":"Yahong Chai"},{"name":"Pan Lu"},{"name":"Qilong Li"},{"name":"Feng Feng"},{"name":"Xiuyu Wang"},{"name":"Yao Li"}],"keywords":[]},"article302":{"pmid":"30720223","title":"Improving Polymethyl Methacrylate Resin Using a Novel Titanium Dioxide Coating.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"The objective of this study was to improve the surface characteristics of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) by developing a novel, thin film coating process and to characterize the resulting coated surface.","authors":[{"name":"Ghaith Darwish"},{"name":"Su Huang"},{"name":"Kent Knoernschild"},{"name":"Cortino Sukotjo"},{"name":"Stephen Campbell"},{"name":"Arghya Kamal Bishal"},{"name":"Valentim Adelino Barão"},{"name":"Christine D Wu"},{"name":"Christos G Taukodis"},{"name":"Bin Yang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. albicans attachment"},{"word":"poly methyl methacrylate resin"},{"word":"surface characterization"},{"word":"titanium dioxide coating"}]},"article303":{"pmid":"30719720","title":"Inflammatory potential of monospecies biofilm matrix components.","date":"2019-10-29","abs":"To assess the inflammatory potential of biofilm matrix constituents of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa monospecies biofilms on macrophages.","authors":[{"name":"T Ramirez"},{"name":"A Shrestha"},{"name":"A Kishen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm matrix"},{"word":"macrophages"},{"word":"pro-inflammatory cytokines"}]},"article304":{"pmid":"30719447","title":"Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Activity against Streptococcus mutans of Individual and Mixtures of the Main Polyphenolic Compounds Found in Chilean Propolis.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Dental caries is multifactorial disease and an important health problem worldwide.

Beyond its function at the ribosomal level it should be exported to the bacterial surface and act as an environmental sensor. In Bacillus cereus, and other cutaneous bacteria, it serves as a Substance P (SP) receptor and is essential for bacterial adaptation to the host. However, the modus operandi of EfTu as a bacterial sensor remains to be investigated. Studies realized by confocal and transmission electron microscopy revealed that, in the absence of an exogenous signal, EfTu is not exposed on the bacterial surface but is recruited under the effect of SP. In addition, SP acts as a transcriptional regulator of the tuf gene encoding for EfTu. As observed using gadolinium chloride, an inhibitor of membrane mechanosensitive channels (Msc), Msc control EfTu export and subsequently the bacterial response to SP both in terms of cytotoxicity and biofilm formation activity. Microscale thermophoresis revealed that in response to SP, EfTu can form homopolymers. This event should occur after EfTu export and, as shown by proteo-liposome reconstruction studies, SP appears to promote EfTu polymers association to the membrane, leading subsequently to the bacterial response. Molecular modeling suggests that this mechanism should involve EfTu unfolding and insertion into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, presumably through formation of homopolymers. This study is unraveling the original mechanism action of EfTu as a bacterial sensor but also reveals that this protein should have a broader role, including in eukaryotes.","authors":[{"name":"Awa R N'Diaye"},{"name":"Valerie Borrel"},{"name":"Pierre-Jean Racine"},{"name":"Thomas Clamens"},{"name":"Segolene Depayras"},{"name":"Olivier Maillot"},{"name":"Beatrice Schaack"},{"name":"Sylvie Chevalier"},{"name":"Olivier Lesouhaitier"},{"name":"Marc G J Feuilloley"}],"keywords":[]},"article308":{"pmid":"30718527","title":"Biofilm Formation of Staphylococcus aureus under Food Heat Processing Conditions: First Report on CML Production within Biofilm.","date":"2020-03-12","abs":"This study aimed to evaluate the Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation and Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine generation ability under food heat processing conditions including pH (5.0-9.0), temperature (25 °C, 31 °C, 37 °C, 42 °C and 65 °C), NaCl concentration (10%, 15% and 20%, w/v) and glucose concentration (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, w/v).

I previously showed that the cysL deletion mutant was defective in biofilm formation, but the reason for this remains unidentified. CysL is a transcriptional activator of the cysJI operon, which encodes sulfite reductase, an enzyme involved in cysteine biosynthesis. Decreased production of sulfite reductase led to biofilm formation defects in the ΔcysL mutant. The ΔcysL mutation was suppressed by disrupting cysH operon genes, whose products function upstream of sulfite reductase in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway, indicating that defects in cysteine biosynthesis were not a direct cause for the defective biofilm formation observed in the ΔcysL mutant. The cysH gene encodes phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase, which requires a reduced form of thioredoxin (TrxA) as an electron donor. High expression of trxA inhibited biofilm formation in the ΔcysL mutant but not in the wild-type strain. Northern blot analysis showed that trxA transcription was induced in the ΔcysL mutant in a disulfide stress-induced regulator Spx-dependent manner. On the basis of these results, I propose that the ΔcysL mutation causes phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase to consume large amounts of reduced thioredoxin, inducing disulfide stress and activating Spx. The spx mutation restored biofilm formation to the ΔcysL mutant. The ΔcysL mutation reduced expression of the eps operon, which is required for exopolysaccharide production. Moreover, overexpression of the eps operon restored biofilm formation to the ΔcysL mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that the ΔcysL mutation activates Spx, which then inhibits biofilm formation through repression of the eps operon.","authors":[{"name":"Kazuo Kobayashi"}],"keywords":[{"word":" Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"Spx"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cysteine biosynthesis"},{"word":"disulfide stress"}]},"article310":{"pmid":"30718303","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa Can Inhibit Growth of Streptococcal Species via Siderophore Production.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes patients to accumulate thick, dehydrated mucus in the lung and develop chronic, polymicrobial infections due to reduced mucociliary clearance.

EG produced significant gene expression change in three genes-gtfC,gtfB, and gbpB; it has the capacity to inhibit S. mutans biofilm formation on solid surfaces (polystyrene, glass), as well as acidogenicity. Therefore, EG might be used as an antibiofilm and/or anticaries agent for oral formulations in order to reduce the prevalence of dental caries.","authors":[{"name":"Vika Gabe"},{"name":"Tomas Kacergius"},{"name":"Saleh Abu-Lafi"},{"name":"Povilas Kalesinskas"},{"name":"Mahmud Masalha"},{"name":"Mizied Falah"},{"name":"Basheer Abu-Farich"},{"name":"Andrius Melninkaitis"},{"name":"Mouhammad Zeidan"},{"name":"Anwar Rayan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"acidogenicity"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"ethyl gallate"},{"word":"gene expression"},{"word":"natural product"}]},"article316":{"pmid":"30717032","title":"Exploration of factors in response to low acid tolerance using random mutagenesis in Cronobacter malonaticus.","date":"2020-02-03","abs":"Cronobacter species are associated with rare but severe infections in newborns, and their tolerance to environmental stress such as acid stress has been described. However, the factors involved in low acid tolerance in Cronobacter are poorly understood.

Eight mutants from mutant library (n = 215) were successfully screened through a comparison of growth with wild type (WT) strain under acid stress (pH 4.0). Eight mutating sites including glucosyltransferase MdoH, extracellular serine protease, sulfate transporter, phosphate transporter permease subunit PstC, lysine transporter, nitrogen regulation protein NR (II), D-alanine-D-alanine ligase, glucan biosynthesis protein G were successfully identified by arbitrary polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The biomass of biofilm of eight mutants were significantly reduced using crystal violet staining (CVS) compared with that of WT. furthermore, the more compact biofilms of WT was observed than those of eight mutants through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Disassembly of biofilms appeared among mutants and WT strain from 48 h to 72 h through the increasing of dead cells and reduction of viable cells and exopolysaccharide.

The removal of nine micropollutants (i.e., pharmaceuticals and corrosion inhibitors) was investigated by using Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBRs), selecting phosphorus (PAO) or glycogen (GAO) accumulating organisms under different redox conditions. Three laboratory-scale MBBRs were operated in sequencing-batch mode under cyclical anaerobic and aerobic/anoxic conditions for phosphorus removal.

Experiments showed that aerobic PAO were able to efficiently remove most of the targeted micropollutants. The removal of benzotriazole, 5‑methyl‑1H‑benzotriazole, carbamazepine, ketoprofen and diclofenac occurred simultaneously to phosphorus uptake and terminated when phosphorus was no longer available. Denitrifying PAO and aerobic GAO exhibited lower removal of micropollutants than aerobic PAO.

The DSF family AIs are fatty acids, differing in their acyl chain length, branching, and substitution but having in common a cis-2 double bond that is required for their activity. In both human and plant pathogens, DSFs regulate diverse phenotypes, including virulence factor expression, antibiotic resistance, and biofilm dispersal. Despite their widespread relevance to both human health and agriculture, the molecular basis of DSF recognition by their cellular receptors remained a mystery. Here, we report the first structure-function studies of the DSF receptor regulation of pathogenicity factor R (RpfR). We present the X-ray crystal structure of the RpfR DSF-binding domain in complex with the Burkholderia DSF (BDSF), which to our knowledge is the first structure of a DSF receptor in complex with its AI. To begin to understand the mechanistic role of the BDSF-RpfR contacts observed in the biologically important complex, we have also determined the X-ray crystal structure of the RpfR DSF-binding domain in complex with the inactive, saturated isomer of BDSF, dodecanoic acid (C12:0). In addition to these ligand-receptor complex structures, we report the discovery of a previously overlooked RpfR domain and show that it binds to and negatively regulates the DSF synthase regulation of pathogenicity factor F (RpfF). We have named this RpfR region the RpfF interaction (FI) domain, and we have determined its X-ray crystal structure alone and in complex with RpfF. These X-ray crystal structures, together with extensive complementary in vivo and in vitro functional studies, reveal the molecular basis of DSF recognition and the importance of the cis-2 double bond to DSF function. Finally, we show that throughout cellular growth, the production of BDSF by RpfF is post-translationally controlled by the RpfR N-terminal FI domain, affecting the cellular concentration of the bacterial second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). Thus, in addition to describing the molecular basis for the binding and specificity of a DSF for its receptor, we describe a receptor-synthase interaction regulating bacterial quorum-sensing signaling and second messenger signal transduction.","authors":[{"name":"Evan J Waldron"},{"name":"Daniel Snyder"},{"name":"Nicolas L Fernandez"},{"name":"Emily Sileo"},{"name":"Daigo Inoyama"},{"name":"Joel S Freundlich"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"Vaughn S Cooper"},{"name":"Matthew B Neiditch"}],"keywords":[]},"article327":{"pmid":"30715289","title":"Effects of low-intensity and low-frequency ultrasound combined with tobramycin on biofilms of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-10-15","abs":"Low-intensity and low-frequency ultrasound (LILFU) can enhance the bactericidal action of antibiotics against various sensitive bacterial species.

Isolates from a range of environments all grow by autotrophic Fe(II) oxidation. Their success lies partly in their microaerophily, which enables them to compete with abiotic Fe(II) oxidation at Fe(II)-rich oxic/anoxic transition zones.

While some Zetaproteobacteria taxa appear to be cosmopolitan, others are enriched by specific habitats. OTU networks show that certain Zetaproteobacteria co-exist, sharing compatible niches. These niches may correspond with adaptations to O2, H2 and nitrate availability, based on genomic analyses of metabolic potential. Also, a putative Fe(II) oxidation gene has been found in diverse Zetaproteobacteria taxa, suggesting that the Zetaproteobacteria evolved as Fe(II) oxidation specialists.

It can infect most of the Staphylococcus aureus human isolates of dominant clonal complexes. We show that a major factor contributing to the wide host range of phiAGO1.3 is a lack or sparcity of target sites for certain restriction-modification systems of types I and II in its genome. Phage phiAGO1.3 requires for adsorption β-O-GlcNAcylated cell wall teichoic acid, which is also essential for the expression of methicillin resistance. Under certain conditions an exposure of S. aureus to phiAGO1.3 can lead to the establishment of a mixed population in which the bacteria and phages remain in equilibrium over multiple generations. This is reminiscent of the so called phage carrier state enabling the co-existence of phage-resistant and phage-sensitive cells supporting a continuous growth of the bacterial and phage populations. The stable co-existence of bacteria and phage favors the emergence of phage-resistant variants of the bacterium. All phiAGO1.3-resistant cells isolated from the phage-carrier-state cultures contained a mutation inactivating the two-component regulatory system ArlRS, essential for efficient expression of numerous S. aureus virulence-associated traits. Moreover, the mutants were unaffected in their susceptibility to infection with an unrelated, polyvalent S. aureus phage of the genus Kayvirus.

Our study was based on pilot-scale sand filters, and we investigated the antibiotic resistome using high-throughput qPCR. A total of 180 resistance genes from eight categories of antibiotics were detected in 15 biofilm samples of three sand filters. The results indicated that higher concentration of influent organic carbon led to lower diversity of bacterial community and richness of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in biofilm. We discovered a negative correlation (p ≤ 0.01) between the richness of ARGs and the corresponding TOC level. Moreover, the absolute abundance of ARGs was positively correlated (p ≤ 0.05) with the abundance of 16S rRNA gene and was determined by the organic carbon concentration. Sand filters with gradient influent organic carbon concentration led to the formation of different antibiotic resistomes and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that difference in bacterial community composition was likely the main reason behind this difference. We also observed a similar trend in the relative abundance of ARGs, which increased with the depth of sand filters. However, this trend was more pronounced in filters with low organic carbon concentrations.

Active release coatings have promise to provide early protection to an implant by eradicating small colony biofilm contaminants or planktonic bacteria that can form biofilm. Traditional antibiotics can be limited as active release agents in that they have limited effect against biofilms and develop resistance at sub-lethal concentrations. A unique first-in-class compound (CZ-01127) was assessed as the active release agent in a silicone (Si)-based coating to prevent PJI in a sheep model of joint space infection. Titanium (Ti) plugs contained a porous coated Ti (PCTi) region and polymer-coated region. Plugs were implanted into a femoral condyle of sheep to assess the effect of the Si polymer on cancellous bone ingrowth, the effect of CZ-01127 on bone ingrowth, and the ability of CZ-01127 to prevent PJI. Microbiological results showed that CZ-01127 was able to eradicate bacteria in the local region of the implanted plugs. Data further showed that Si did not adversely affect bone ingrowth. However, bacteria that reached the joint space (synovium) were not fully eradicated. Outcomes suggested that the CZ-01127 coating provided local protection to the implant system in a challenging model, the design of which could be beneficial for testing future antimicrobial therapies for PJI. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is now commonplace, and constitutes an underlying problem that patients and physicians face. Active release antibiotic coatings have potential to prevent these infections. Traditional antibiotics are limited in their ability to eradicate bacteria that reside in biofilms, and are more susceptible to resistance development. This study addressed these limitations by testing the efficacy of a unique antimicrobial compound in a coating that was tested in a challenging sheep model of PJI. The unique coating was able to eradicate bacteria and prevent infection in the environment adjacent to the implant. Bacteria that escaped into the joint space still caused infection, yet benchmark data can be used to optimize the coating and translate it toward clinical use.","authors":[{"name":"Dustin L Williams"},{"name":"Richard T Epperson"},{"name":"Nicholas N Ashton"},{"name":"Nicholas B Taylor"},{"name":"Brooke Kawaguchi"},{"name":"Raymond E Olsen"},{"name":"Travis J Haussener"},{"name":"Paul R Sebahar"},{"name":"Gina Allyn"},{"name":"Ryan E Looper"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bone ingrowth"},{"word":"CZ-01127"},{"word":"Coating"},{"word":"Drug delivery"},{"word":"Implant"},{"word":"Silicone"}]},"article355":{"pmid":"30710463","title":"Controlling chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections by strategically interfering with the sensory function of SagS.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"The hybrid sensor SagS plays a central role in the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, by enabling the switch from the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth and by facilitating the transition of biofilm cells to a highly tolerant state.

We developed a biofilm assay and found that axenic Synechocystis forms biofilms of cells and extracellular material but only when cells are induced by an environmental signal, such as a reduction in the concentration of growth medium BG11. Mutants lacking cell surface structures, namely type IV pili and the S-layer, do not form biofilms. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms of cell-cell binding by Synechocystis, we also developed a rapid (8-h) axenic aggregation assay. Mutants lacking type IV pili were unable to aggregate, but mutants lacking a homolog to Wza, a protein required for type 1 exopolysaccharide export in Escherichia coli, had a superbinding phenotype. In WT cultures, 1.2× BG11 medium induced aggregation to the same degree as 0.8× BG11 medium.

This study investigates the role of biofilm biomass in A. baumannii susceptibility to exposure to a kilohertz-driven, in-house-designed, cold plasma jet, through the examination of cold plasma treatment efficacy in A. baumannii biofilms grown over various times for up to 72 h. For biofilms grown for 24, 48 and 72 h, D values were 19·32 ± 2·71, 29·18 ± 3·15 and 24·70 ± 3·07 s respectively. Monitoring A. baumannii biofilm biomass over these time periods revealed that the greatest biomass was observed at 48 h with the lowest biofilm biomass at 24 h growth. Enumeration of viable biofilm colony counts at each time point was comparable. Scanning electron microscopy images of plasma-treated biofilms revealed extensive surface damage of A. baumannii cells. These results describe the role of biomass in mediating A. baumannii biofilm susceptibility to cold plasma treatment, implicating the biofilm matrix as a protective barrier to the antimicrobial effects of cold plasma. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm formation results in increased environmental and antimicrobial tolerance and resistance compared to the planktonic phenotype. Cold plasma technology is increasingly investigated as a new tool for decontamination of biofilm-contaminated surfaces, especially those found in the clinical setting. This new technology presents a promising approach to the remediation of surfaces contaminated by biofilms. This study identifies the role played by A. baumannii biofilm biomass in mediating tolerance and susceptibility to cold plasma treatment. This work demonstrates that increased biofilm biomass reduces the efficacy of antimicrobial species generated by cold plasma, resulting in greater tolerance to plasma exposure.","authors":[{"name":"P B Flynn"},{"name":"W G Graham"},{"name":"B F Gilmore"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobials"},{"word":"biocides"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"disinfection"},{"word":"nonthermal processes"}]},"article370":{"pmid":"30706705","title":"Tetrameric Charge-Zipper Assembly of the TisB Peptide in Membranes-Computer Simulation and Experiment.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"TisB is a short amphiphilic α-helical peptide from Escherichia coli that induces a breakdown of the pH gradient across the inner membrane when the bacteria are under stress and require to form persister cells to turn into a biofilm.

N-acyl homoserine lactone acylase PvdQ from human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a quorum-quenching enzyme that can hydrolyze the amide bond of the quorum signaling N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) thereby degrading the signaling molecules, turning off the biofilm phenotype and resulting in a reduction of bacterial virulence. Previous studies demonstrated that PvdQ has different preferences for N-acyl substrates with different acyl chain lengths and substituents. However, the substrate binding specificity determinants of the quorum-quenching enzyme PvdQ with the different bacterial ligands are unknown and unintuitive. Further, elucidation of these determinants can lead to mutants with efficiency and broader substrate promiscuity. To investigate this question, a computational study was carried out combining multiple molecular docking methods, molecular dynamics simulations, residue interaction network analysis, and binding free energy calculations. The main findings are: firstly, the results from pKa predictions support that the pKa of the N-terminus of Serβ1 was depressed due to the surrounding residues. Multiple molecular docking studies provide useful information about the detailed binding modes and binding affinities. Secondly, 300 ns molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to analyze the overall molecular motions of substrate-bound and substrate-free PvdQ. The specific interactions between the active site of PvdQ and different ligands revealed the determinants for the preference among the ligands. A systematic comparison and analysis of the protein dynamic fingerprint of each complex demonstrated that binding of the most favorable ligand, C12-homoserine lactone (C12-HSL), reduced the global motions of the complex and maintained the correct arrangement of the catalytic site. Further, the residue interaction network analysis of each system illustrated that there are more communication contacts and pathways between the residues in the C12-HSL complex as compared to complexes with the other ligands. The binding of the C12-HSL ligand facilitates structural communication between the two knobs and the active site. While the binding of the other ligands tend to impair specific communication pathways between the two knobs and the active site, and lead to a catalytically inefficient state.

The enzymes hydrolyze phosphate residues from nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives. In some pathobiontic bacteria, 5'-nucleotidases contribute to immune evasion by dephosphorylating adenosine mono-, di-, or tri-phosphates, thereby either decreasing the concentration of pro-inflammatory ATP or increasing the concentration of anti-inflammatory adenosine, both acting on purinergic receptors of phagocytic cells. The strict human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes expresses a surface-associated 5'-nucleotidase (S5nA) under infection conditions that has previously been discussed as a potential virulence factor. Here we show that deletion of the S5nA gene does not significantly affect growth in human blood, evasion of phagocytosis by neutrophils, formation of biofilms and virulence in an infection model with larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella in S. pyogenes serotypes M6, M18 and M49. Hence, the surface-associated 5'-nucleotidase S5nA seems dispensable for evasion of phagocytosis and biofilm formation in S. pyogenes.","authors":[{"name":"Marcel-Lino Dangel"},{"name":"Johann-Christoph Dettmann"},{"name":"Steffi Haßelbarth"},{"name":"Martin Krogull"},{"name":"Miriam Schakat"},{"name":"Bernd Kreikemeyer"},{"name":"Tomas Fiedler"}],"keywords":[]},"article383":{"pmid":"30703114","title":"Dual role of iodine, silver, chlorhexidine and octenidine as antimicrobial and antiprotease agents.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"The majority of human chronic wounds contain bacterial biofilms, which produce proteases and retard the resolution of inflammation.

In the meat industry, biofilms remain a serious concern because many foodborne pathogens can form biofilms in areas at meat plants that are difficult to sanitize properly, and biofilm cells are more tolerant to sanitization than their planktonic counterparts. Furthermore, nearly all biofilms in commercial environments consist of multiple species of microorganisms, and the complex interactions within the community significantly influence the architecture, activity, and sanitizer tolerance of the biofilm society. This review focuses on the effect of microbial coexistence on mixed biofilm formation with foodborne pathogens of major concern in the fresh meat industry and their resultant sanitizer tolerance. The factors that would affect biofilm cell transfer from contact surfaces to meat products, one of the most common transmission routes that could lead to product contamination, are discussed as well. Available results from recent studies relevant to the meat industry, implying the potential role of bacterial persistence and biofilm formation in meat contamination, are reviewed in response to the pressing need to understand the mechanisms that cause high event period contamination at commercial meat processing plants. A better understanding of these events would help the industry to enhance strategies to prevent contamination and improve meat safety.","authors":[{"name":"Rong Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":" O157:H7"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Meat contamination"},{"word":"Sanitizer"}]},"article385":{"pmid":"30702944","title":"Characterization of Biofilm Formation by Cronobacter spp. Isolates of Different Food Origin under Model Conditions.","date":"2019-11-14","abs":"Cronobacter spp. are opportunistic human pathogens that cause serious diseases in neonates and immunocompromised people.

Diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet established for treatment of therapy-resistant epilepsy in children. Its efficacy in reducing seizures has been confirmed, but the mechanisms remain elusive. The diet has also shown positive effects in a wide range of other diseases, including Alzheimer's, depression, autism, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. We collected fecal samples from 12 children with therapy-resistant epilepsy before starting KD and after 3 months on the diet. Parents did not start KD and served as diet controls. Applying shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing, both taxonomic and functional profiles were established. Here we report that alpha diversity is not changed significantly during the diet, but differences in both taxonomic and functional composition are detected. Relative abundance of bifidobacteria as well as E. rectale and Dialister is significantly diminished during the intervention. An increase in relative abundance of E. coli is observed on KD. Functional analysis revealed changes in 29 SEED subsystems including the reduction of seven pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Decomposition of these shifts indicates that bifidobacteria and Escherichia are important contributors to the observed functional shifts. As relative abundance of health-promoting, fiber-consuming bacteria becomes less abundant during KD, we raise concern about the effects of the diet on the gut microbiota and overall health. Further studies need to investigate whether these changes are necessary for the therapeutic effect of KD.","authors":[{"name":"Marie Lindefeldt"},{"name":"Alexander Eng"},{"name":"Hamid Darban"},{"name":"Annelie Bjerkner"},{"name":"Cecilia K Zetterström"},{"name":"Tobias Allander"},{"name":"Björn Andersson"},{"name":"Elhanan Borenstein"},{"name":"Maria Dahlin"},{"name":"Stefanie Prast-Nielsen"}],"keywords":[]},"article396":{"pmid":"30700643","title":"Inhibitory Effects of Lingonberry Extract on Oral Streptococcal Biofilm Formation and Bioactivity.","date":"2019-07-24","abs":"Phenolic compounds in fruits such as cranberries have been shown to promote a number of biological activities.

Water-soluble and polyphenol-rich fractions (Fractions I and II, respectively) were isolated from cranberries and lingonberries. The effects of those fractions on the biofilm formation ability and bioactivity of Streptococcus mutans MT8148R, Streptococcus sobrinus 6715, and Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556 were then evaluated. Cranberry or lingonberry Fraction II (at 0.5-1 mg/ml) significantly reduced biofilm formation by S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and S. sanguinis. In contrast, cranberry or lingonberry Fraction I (at 0.5-2 mg/ml) increased biofilm formation by S. mutans and S. sobrinus, but not by S. sanguinis. Fractions I and II (at 1-2 mg/ml) also reduced the bioactivity of S. mutans, while Fraction II (at 0.5 mg/ml) enhanced the bioactivity of all tested strains. The results revealed that lingonberries contained a larger amount of polyphenol than cranberries and that they showed almost the same level of activity against the biofilm formation ability and bioactivity of oral streptococci.

The prepared microwebs have structural similarity to NETs at the nanometer to micrometer dimensions but with well-defined molecular compositions. Microwebs prepared with different DNA to histone ratios show that microwebs trap pathogenic Escherichia coli in a manner similar to NETs when the zeta potential of the microwebs is positive. The DNA nanofiber networks and the bactericidal histone constituting the microwebs inhibit the growth of E. coli. Moreover, microwebs work synergistically with colistin sulfate, a common and a last-resort antibiotic, by targeting the cell envelope of pathogenic bacteria.
