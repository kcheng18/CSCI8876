Porphyromonas gingivalis forms aggregates with T. denticola through its adhesion/hemagglutinin domain (Hgp44). In this study, we investigated the specific domain of P. gingivalis Hgp44 responsible for adhesion to T. denticola using expression vectors harboring P. gingivalis Hgp44 DNA sequences encoding amino acid residues 1-419. Six plasmids harboring fragments in this region were generated by PCR amplification and self-ligation, and recombinant proteins r-Hgp44 (residues 1-419), r-Hgp441 (residues 1-124), r-Hgp442 (1-199), r-Hgp443 (1-316), r-Hgp444 (199-419), r-Hgp445 (124-198) and r-Hgp446 (199-316) were produced, as confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. r-Hgp44, r-Hgp443 and r-Hgp446 showed greater adhesion to T. denticola sonicates than the control, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. r-Hgp446 reduced the coaggregation of P. gingivalis and T. denticola. Scanning electron and confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses revealed that r-Hgp446 reduced dual-species biofilm formation. Our results indicate that residues 199-316 of P. gingivalis Hgp44 are mainly responsible for adhesion to T. denticola; inhibiting this domain could potentially disrupt periodontopathic biofilm formation and maturation.","authors":[{"name":"Kouki Yoshikawa"},{"name":"Yuichiro Kikuchi"},{"name":"Eitoyo Kokubu"},{"name":"Kentaro Imamura"},{"name":"Atsushi Saito"},{"name":"Kazuyuki Ishihara"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"29771236","title":"Can dalbavancin be used as a catheter lock solution?","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Cristina Díaz-Ruíz"},{"name":"Beatriz Alonso"},{"name":"Emilia Cercenado"},{"name":"Raquel Cruces"},{"name":"Emilio Bouza"},{"name":"Patricia Muñoz"},{"name":"María Guembe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Catheter-related bloodstream infection"},{"word":"dalbavancin"},{"word":"lock therapy"},{"word":"vancomycin"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"29771131","title":"Mouthwash containing Croton doctoris essential oil: in vitro study using a validated model of caries induction.","date":"2018-12-18","abs":"To validate an in vitro caries model and to evaluate an experimental mouthwash containing Croton doctoris essential oil.  Materials & methods: To validate the experimental model, we used McBain medium and polymicrobial biofilms.

Baseline patient factors (location of ulcer, presence of osteomyelitis, preoperative prealbumin), surgical factors (type of flap, use of antibiotic beads, bone culture results) and postoperative outcomes (ulcer recurrence at 1 year, dehiscence, seroma, cellulitis) were collected. Outcomes of patients who received antibiotic-impregnated beads were compared to those who did not. Eighty-six patients with 120 stage IV pressure ulcers underwent excision and flap coverage. This included 16 ulcers where antibiotic beads were used and 104 where they were not. The overall ulcer recurrence rate at 12 months was 35.8%. The recurrence rate in the group treated with antibiotic beads was significantly lower than the group without beads (12.5% vs. 39.4%, p = 0.03). Overall, complication rates between the two groups were similar (43.8% vs. 51.9%, p = 0.54). No systemic or local toxicity from antibiotic beads occurred.

In this study, lytic bacteriophages were isolated and applied to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa in planktonic mode at different temperature, pH, and salinity. Bacteriophages showed optimal infectivity at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in saline conditions, and demonstrated lytic abilities over all tested temperature (25, 30, 37, and 45°C) and pH 6-9. Planktonic P. aeruginosa exhibited significantly longer lag phase and lower specific growth rates upon exposure to bacteriophages. Bacteriophages were subsequently applied to P. aeruginosa-enriched biofilm and were determined to lower the relative abundance of Pseudomonas-related taxa from 0.17 to 5.58% in controls to 0.01-0.61% in treated microbial communities. The relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria, Pseudoalteromonas, and Planococcaceae decreased, possibly due to the phage-induced disruption of the biofilm matrix. Lastly, when applied to mitigate biofouling of ultrafiltration membranes, bacteriophages were determined to reduce the transmembrane pressure increase by 18% when utilized alone, and by 49% when used in combination with citric acid. The combined treatment was more effective compared with the citric acid treatment alone, which reported ca. 30% transmembrane pressure reduction. Collectively, the findings demonstrated that bacteriophages can be used as a biocidal agent to mitigate undesirable P. aeruginosa-associated problems in seawater applications.","authors":[{"name":"Giantommaso Scarascia"},{"name":"Scott A Yap"},{"name":"Anna H Kaksonen"},{"name":"Pei-Ying Hong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"biofilm removal"},{"word":"green biocides"},{"word":"planktonic cells"},{"word":"ultrafiltration membrane"}]},"article6":{"pmid":"29769768","title":"Application of bioelectric effect to reduce the antibiotic resistance of subgingival plaque biofilm: An in vitro study.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilms are known for their antimicrobial resistance, and so is the subgingival plaque biofilm, the primary etiologic factor for periodontal infections.","authors":[{"name":"Padmini Hari"},{"name":"Kranthi Raja Kacharaju"},{"name":"Naveen Anumala"},{"name":"Krishnanjaneya Reddy Pathakota"},{"name":"Jayakumar Avula"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"doxycycline"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article7":{"pmid":"29769381","title":"TosR-Mediated Regulation of Adhesins and Biofilm Formation in Uropathogenic Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-06-10","abs":"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains utilize a variety of adherence factors that assist in colonization of the host urinary tract.

The profound clinical success of SDF has drawn many clinicians and researchers to study the mechanism of SDF in arresting dentine caries. This critical review discusses how silver and fluoride contribute to caries arrest, in terms of their effects on bacteria as well as on the mineral and organic content of dentine. Silver interacts with bacterial cell membrane and bacterial enzymes, which can inhibit bacterial growth. Silver can also dope into hydroxyapatite and have an antibacterial effect on silver-doped hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, silver is also a strong inhibitor of cathepsins and inhibits dentine collagen degradation. Early studies proposed that silver hardened caries lesions by forming silver phosphate. However, recent studies found that little silver phosphate remained on the arrested dentine lesion. The principal silver precipitate was silver chloride, which could not contribute to the significant hardening of the arrested lesions. On the other hand, fluoride enhances mineral formation by forming fluorohydroxyapatite with reduced solubility. A significant increase in microhardness occurs with an elevated level of calcium and phosphorus but not silver on the surface layer of the arrested dentine caries lesion following SDF treatment. Fluoride also inhibits matrix metalloproteinases activities and therefore inhibits dentine collagen degradation. The combination of silver and fluoride in an alkaline solution has a synergistic effect in arresting dentine caries. The alkaline property of SDF provides an unfavorable environment for collagen enzyme activation. Understanding the mechanisms of SDF in arresting dentine caries helps clinicians to develop appropriate protocols for the use of SDF in clinical care.","authors":[{"name":"M L Mei"},{"name":"E C M Lo"},{"name":"C H Chu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"apatites"},{"word":"biofilm(s)"},{"word":"collagen(s)"},{"word":"demineralization"},{"word":"hydroxyapatite"},{"word":"remineralization"}]},"article9":{"pmid":"29768936","title":"Nutrient removal and biomass production: advances in microalgal biotechnology for wastewater treatment.","date":"2018-11-27","abs":"Owing to certain drawbacks, such as energy-intensive operations in conventional modes of wastewater treatment (WWT), there has been an extensive search for alternative strategies in treatment technology. Biological modes for treating wastewaters are one of the finest technologies in terms of economy and efficiency.

Overwhelming responsiveness to treat wastewaters especially by using microalgae is due to their simplest photosynthetic mechanism and ease of acclimation to various habitats.

However, the availability of innovative approaches for maximizing the treatment efficiency, coupled with biomass productivity, remains the major bottleneck for commercialization of microalgal technology. Investment costs and invasive parameters also delimit the use of microalgae in WWT. This review critically discusses the merits and demerits of microalgal cultivation strategies recently developed for maximum pollutant removal as well as biomass productivity.

Using a model of bacterial colonization of the anterior nares, we investigate oscillatory patterns related to intermittent carriage of S. aureus. Following several studies using global sensitivity analysis techniques, various insights into the model's behaviour were made including interacting effects of the bacteria's growth rate and movement in the mucus, suggesting parameter connections associated with biofilm-like behaviour. Here the bacterial growth rate and bacterial movement are explicitly connected, leading to expanded oscillatory behaviour in the model.

Therefore, it is imperative for implants not only to depress microbial activity and biofilm colonization but also to prompt osteoblast functions and osseointegration. As part of the coating development for implants, the interest of in vitro studies on the interaction between implant substrate morphology and the coating's biological performances is growing. In this study, by harnessing the adhesion and reactivity of bioinspired polydopamine, nano-silver was successfully anchored onto micro/nanoporous as well as smooth titanium surfaces to analyse the effect of substrate morphology on biological performances of the coatings. Compared with the smooth surface, a small size of nano-silver and high silver content was found on the micro/nanoporous surface. More mineralization happened on the coating on the micro/nanoporous structure than on the smooth surface, which led to a more rapid decrease of silver release from the micro/nanoporous surface. Antimicrobial tests indicated that both surfaces with resulting coating inhibit microbial colonization on them and growth around them, indicating that the coating eliminates the shortcoming of the porous structure which render the implant extremely susceptible to BAI. Besides, the multiple osteoblast responses of nano-silver-loaded dopamine coatings on both surfaces, i.e. attachment, proliferation and differentiation, have deteriorated, however the mineralized surfaces of these coatings stimulated osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, especially for the micro/nanoporous surface. Therefore, nano-silver-loaded dopamine coatings on micro/nanoporous substratum may not only reduce the risk of infection but also facilitate mineralization during the early post-operative period and then promote osseointegration owing to the good osteoblast-biocompatibility of the mineralized surface.

In particular, the dreaded nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms microbial communities that offer an enhanced resistance to conventional antibiotics. Recently, we have described an engineered antimicrobial peptide derived from the human RNase3, also named the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), RN3 (5-36), which combines bactericidal activity with high cell agglutination and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affinity. Through a single replacement scan library using the SPOT methodology we have evaluated both the contribution of sequence positioning and amino acid singularity towards the peptide biological and physicochemical properties. Results indicate that the ECP N-terminus has already been extensively improved through evolution to provide high antimicrobial activity; hence most substitutions improving its antimicrobial performance are in detriment of safety towards host tissues. Only three positions were identified, occupied by polar residues on the first α-helix of the protein and replaceable by a hydrophobic residue, allowing an extended N-terminal patch that mediates bacterial agglutination. Among the best candidates, an Ile replacement proved best in improving the peptide therapeutic window. The novel engineered peptides encompass both the LPS-binding and aggregation-prone regions of parental ECP, providing the appropriate structural features for peptide attachment to the bacterial exopolysaccharide layer and bacterial cell membrane destabilization, thereby promoting biofilm removal at micro molar concentrations. We conclude that the novel engineered peptides are promising lead candidates against Gram-negative biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"David Pulido"},{"name":"Guillem Prats-Ejarque"},{"name":"Clara Villalba"},{"name":"Marcel Albacar"},{"name":"Mohammed Moussaoui"},{"name":"David Andreu"},{"name":"Rudolf Volkmer"},{"name":"Marc Torrent"},{"name":"Ester Boix"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Single replacement scan library"}]},"article26":{"pmid":"29763755","title":"Salmonella enterica growth and biofilm formation in flesh and peel cantaloupe extracts on four food-contact surfaces.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Salmonella enterica is responsible for the highest number of foodborne disease outbreaks pertaining to cantaloupe industry.

In addition, Salmonella is able to perform a type of cell-to-cell communication called quorum sensing, which leads to differential gene expression. The quorum sensing system mediated by AI-1, acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), is incomplete in Salmonella because the luxI homolog gene, which encodes for AI-1 synthase, is missing in the genome. However, a homologue of LuxR, known as SdiA, is present and allows the detection of signaling molecules produced by other species of bacteria, leading to regulation of gene expression, mainly related to virulence and biofilm formation. Thus, in view of the importance of quorum sensing on the physiology regulation of microorganisms, the aim of the present study was to perform a virtual screening of plant compounds and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NASIDs) for inhibition of quorum sensing by molecular docking and biofilm formation in Salmonella. In general, most plant compounds and all NSAIDs bound in, at least, one of the three modeled structures of SdiA proteins of Salmonella Enteritidis PT4 578. In addition, many tested compounds had higher binding affinities than the AHLs and the furanones which are inducers and inhibitors of quorum sensing, respectively. The Z-phytol and lonazolac molecules were good candidates for the in vitro inhibition tests of quorum sensing mediated by AI-1 and biofilm formation in Salmonella. Thus, this study directs future prospecting of plant extracts for inhibition of quorum sensing mechanism depending on AHL and biofilm formation.

Suppressor of division inhibitor (SdiA) is a QS receptor present in atypical enteropathogenic E.coli (aEPEC) that detects acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) type autoinducers.

In this study, we performed experiments to evaluate pellicle, ring-like structure and biofilm formation on wild type, sdiA mutants and complemented strains. We also evaluated the transcription of genes involved in different stages of biofilm formation, such as bcsA, csgA, csgD, fliC and fimA. The sdiA mutants were capable of forming thicker biofilm structures and showed increased motility when compared to wild type and complemented strains.

While pushers always end up trapped at the channel walls, neutral swimmers and pullers may further perform a gliding motion and maintain a stable navigation along the channel. We find that the resulting dynamical system exhibits a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation in which swimming in the mid-plane becomes unstable beyond a transition channel height while two new stable limit cycles or fixed points that are symmetrically disposed with respect to the channel mid-height emerge.

Here, the effects of the species, concentrations, and speciation of the heavy metals Cu, Pb, and Cr, and the metalloid As on the sorption of pentachlorophenol (PCP), as a model OCP, by river biofilms were investigated through batch experiments.

In addition, the impact of heavy metals on PCP sorption was attributed to differences in heavy metal speciation. Cu and Pb commonly existed as divalent cations, but Cr and As existed as anionic acid radicals under the experimental conditions. The inhibitory effects of heavy metals on PCP sorption by biofilms were enhanced as the cation valence state increased, while the effects were weakened as the anionic acid radical valence state increased. Although all four heavy metals had inhibitory effects on PCP sorption by biofilms, there were distinct differences in the mechanisms causing these effects.","authors":[{"name":"Xiuyi Hua"},{"name":"Liting Wang"},{"name":"Liwen Zhang"},{"name":"Deming Dong"},{"name":"Zhiyong Guo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anion"},{"word":"Arsenic"},{"word":"Chromium"},{"word":"Copper"},{"word":"Lead"},{"word":"Organochlorine"},{"word":"Pesticide"}]},"article60":{"pmid":"29755737","title":"Inactivation of Pure Bacterial Biofilms by Impaction of Aerosolized Consumer Products Containing Nanoparticulate Metals.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The ability of nanotechnology-enabled consumer sprays to inactivate bacteria has direct health implications.

Also, the size of silver nanoparticles in the products' suspensions was determined using single particle (sp)ICPMS. Two of the six nanoproducts inhibited growth of Escherichia coli and Bacillus atrophaeus bacteria (MICs of 40,000 and 160,000 ppm). Collection of particles aerosolized from these two products onto films of the same bacteria inhibited bacterial growth; however, the mass concentration deposited onto bacterial films was lower than the MICs.

The 16S rRNA gene high throughout sequencing analysis of anodic biofilm revealed complex microbial composition dominated by Bacteroidetes (39.4%), Firmicutes (20.1%), Proteobacteria (11.5%), Euryarchaeota (3.1%), Deferribacteres (1.3%), Spirochaetes (1.0%), Chloroflexi (0.7%), Actinobacteria (0.5%), and others (22.4%). The predominance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria demonstrated their importance for substrate degradation and simultaneous power generation. These results demonstrate that macroalgae hydrolysate can be used as a renewable carbon source of microbial electrochemical systems for various environmental applications.","authors":[{"name":"Nannan Zhao"},{"name":"Yinan Jiang"},{"name":"Merlin Alvarado-Morales"},{"name":"Laura Treu"},{"name":"Irini Angelidaki"},{"name":"Yifeng Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA microbial analysis"},{"word":"Bioelectricity"},{"word":"Laminaria digitata"},{"word":"Macroalgae hydrolysis"},{"word":"Microbial fuel cell"}]},"article68":{"pmid":"29753932","title":"Evaluating the effect of different draw solutes in a baffled osmotic membrane bioreactor-microfiltration using optical coherence tomography with real wastewater.","date":"2018-10-17","abs":"This study investigated the performance of an integrated osmotic and microfiltration membrane bioreactor for real sewage employing baffles in the reactor.

Biofilm cells appeared to be encased in a dense matrix material, and the total biomass of the biofilm increased with incubation time. To gain insight into the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between biofilm and planktonic cells, we carried out comparative transcriptomic analysis using RNA sequencing. In total, 91 genes were significantly differentially expressed, with 40 being up-regulated and 51 down-regulated. In particular, genes encoding sortase, ribosomal proteins, and ATP synthase were up-regulated in biofilms, while genes coding for clostripain and phospholipase C were down-regulated. To validate the RNA sequencing results, qRT-PCR analysis was performed using five randomly selected DEGs. Results showed that all five genes were up-regulated, which was in accordance with the RNA sequencing results. To examine the functional differences, the DEGs were characterized by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Results showed that the up-regulated genes were divided into 32 significantly enriched GO terms, with macromolecular complex being the most common. Oxidative phosphorylation was the only significantly enriched pathway, suggesting that ATP is required for biofilm stability.

The bacterial community operating in this innovative reactor was studied, and its composition and response to different operating conditions were characterized. A stable biomass, dominated by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Acidithiobacillus was selected from inside the MBBTF reactor, and temperature, pH and bed rotation were shown to be the main factors driving the community structure. Moreover, data from different approaches indicated an uneven spatial distribution of biofilm inside the studied reactor, due to the combined effect of fluid dynamics and substrate gradients within the bed volume. Despite the high removal efficiency achieved by this innovative prototype (80% on average), the data suggested that the result could be improved by adopting solutions for a more stable and even biofilm distribution. It was shown that short frequent bed rotations, rather than long scattered rotations, ensured biomass stability. Furthermore, diversifying biofilm support media as a function of expected local pollutant concentrations should be considered. Data obtained from the bacterial community can therefore provide indications for possible further improvement of MBBTF reactor design and performance.","authors":[{"name":"Cesira Giordano"},{"name":"Francesco Spennati"},{"name":"Gualtiero Mori"},{"name":"Giulio Munz"},{"name":"Claudia Vannini"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S"},{"word":"Biotrickling filter"},{"word":"Gas treatment"},{"word":"Hydrogen sulfide"},{"word":"Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria"},{"word":"Tannery"}]},"article84":{"pmid":"29751601","title":"Novel Sustainable Composites Based on Poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) and Seagrass Beach-CAST Fibers: Performance and Degradability in Marine Environments.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"In order to produce sustainable, bio-based and highly biodegradable materials, composites based on poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and fibers of Posidonia oceanica (PO), a dominant Mediterranean seagrass, were produced by simple melt mixing and characterized in terms of thermal stability, morphology and rheological/mechanical properties. In view of their potential application in marine environments, degradation of the developed composites was evaluated under simulated and real marine environmental conditions for 1 year. Using 10 wt % of acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) as a plasticizer, smooth processing was achieved for up to 30 wt % of PO fibers, despite the reduction of the melt fluidity observed with increasing fiber loading. The tensile modulus slightly increased (from 2 to 2.4 GPa) while the tensile strength and the elongation decreased (from 23.6 to 21.5 MPa and from 3.2 to 1.9%, respectively) by increasing the PO fiber content from 0 to 30 wt %. Interestingly, the impact resistance of the composites increased with the increasing of the PO content: the Charpy&rsquo;s impact energy increased from 3.6 (without fiber) to 4.4 kJ/m² for the composite with 30 wt %. The results of the aerobic biodegradation under simulated marine conditions showed that the presence of PO fibers favored the physical disintegration of the composite increasing the biodegradation rate of the polymeric matrix: after 216 days, the composite with 20 wt % PO fibers showed a biodegradability of about 30% compared to 20% of the composite without fibers. Under real marine conditions, the specimens containing PO fibers showed higher weight losses and deterioration of tensile properties compared to those without fibers. Presumably, biodegradation occurred after colonization of the specimen, and the specimens with 20 wt % PO fibers showed well-developed biofilm consisting of bacteria and fungi on the surface after only 3 months of incubation in marine sediments, unlike the no-fiber specimens. Consequently, the persistence of an adequate mechanical performance for a relatively long period (1 year), due to a moderate rate of biodegradation in the marine environment, make the developed PHBV/PO composites particularly suitable for the production of relatively low-cost and biodegradable items which are usable in the sea and/or sand dunes, increasing the market opportunities for biopolymers such as PHBV and, at the same time, finding an eco-sustainable valorization for the PO fibrous residues accumulated in large quantities on Mediterranean beaches, which represents a problem for coastal municipalities.","authors":[{"name":"Maurizia Seggiani"},{"name":"Patrizia Cinelli"},{"name":"Elena Balestri"},{"name":"Norma Mallegni"},{"name":"Eleonora Stefanelli"},{"name":"Alessia Rossi"},{"name":"Claudio Lardicci"},{"name":"Andrea Lazzeri"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PHBV"},{"word":"Posidonia oceanica"},{"word":"biocomposites"},{"word":"biodegradability"},{"word":"degradation"},{"word":"poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate)"}]},"article85":{"pmid":"29751512","title":"Screening of Natural Product Derivatives Identifies Two Structurally Related Flavonoids as Potent Quorum Sensing Inhibitors against Gram-Negative Bacteria.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"Owing to the failure of conventional antibiotics in biofilm control, alternative approaches are urgently needed.

The results demonstrated that the contents of c-di-GMP notably decreased in suspended sludge, whereas the contents of c-di-GMP in biofilm had no significant change as pH gradually increased from 7.5 to 8.5. Most of the bacteria (Blastocatella, Brevundimonas) with flagella that have been reported to be regulated by c-di-GMP were present in suspended sludge, and the microbial community structure of suspended sludge had obvious change than biofilm.

Due to protein complexity, most evaluations of protein conductivity are based on the simple estimation of protein's molecular orbital energy levels and spatial distributions without analysing its protein interaction with electrodes and the calculation of the rates of electron transfer (ET). In the present work, we included in our density functional theory (DFT) analysis an approach based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) allowing for calculation from the first principles the molecular interaction with electrodes and thus the role of electrode materials, Fermi level, the thermal distribution of electronic energy levels, and the coupling efficiency between the molecule and the electrodes. Compared to proteins studied so far, mainly artificial peptides, heme-containing cytochromes, and bacterial pili, we choose rubredoxin for our calculation. Rubredoxin contains a non-heme iron that, as we have discovered recently, can be involved in extracellular ET in electroactive bacterial biofilms (Yates et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2016, 9, 3544-3558). Our calculations show that an iron atom incorporated into the protein structure as an iron-sulfur cluster opens a transmission path at the energy corresponding to the Fermi level of the electrodes. This allows the protein to become an extremely efficient conductor at very low bias voltages (<±350 mV). Calculation of the role of protein amino acids based on the local density of states and electron transfer paths reveals that neither aromatic amino acid Tyr nor Phe at any ring orientation participates in coherent ET through the FeS cluster of the protein. Moreover, direct ET through surrounding amino acids, bypassing FeS, is possible only at biases ±1.5 to ±2 V. The polar amino acid Asn might participate in ET at these bias voltages. The conductivity of the protein core substantially depends on the polarity of the applied electric field, allowing for unidirectional ET and operation of the protein as a molecular rectifier. These results can be used for a wise de novo design of proteins for molecular electronics and cellular energy converting devices, particularly for utilization of iron doping in the construction of conductive protein wires.","authors":[{"name":"Nikolai Lebedev"},{"name":"Igor Griva"},{"name":"Anders Blom"},{"name":"Leonard M Tender"}],"keywords":[]},"article101":{"pmid":"29748556","title":"Regulatory protein SrpA controls phage infection and core cellular processes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-01-24","abs":"Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind bacteria-phage interactions remains limited.

The development of a novel bioassay to assess the activity of NP-containing and biocide-containing coatings against marine biofilm formation has been achieved using a high-throughput microplate reader and highly sensitive confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), as well as nucleic acid staining. Juglone, an isolated NP that has previously shown efficacy against bacterial attachment, was incorporated into a simple coating matrix. Biofilm formation over 48 h was assessed and compared against coatings containing the NP and the commonly used booster biocide, cuprous oxide. Leaching of the NP from the coating was quantified at two time points, 24 h and 48 h, showing evidence of both juglone and cuprous oxide being released. Results from the microplate reader showed that the NP coatings exhibited antifouling efficacy, significantly inhibiting biofilm formation when compared to the control coatings, while NP coatings and the cuprous oxide coatings performed equally well. CLSM results and COMSTAT analysis on biofilm 3D morphology showed comparable results when the NP coatings were tested against the controls, with higher biofilm biovolume and maximum thickness being found on the controls.

Here we describe a method for the development of a trifunctional coating that repels contaminating bacteria, kills those that adhere, and promotes osteoblast adhesion. To this end, titanium surfaces were functionalized by electrodeposition of an antifouling polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer and subsequent binding of a peptidic platform with cell-adhesive and bactericidal properties. The physicochemical characterization of the samples via SEM, contact angle, FTIR and XPS analysis verified the successful binding of the PEG layer and the biomolecules, without altering the morphology and topography of the samples. PEG coatings inhibited protein adsorption and osteoblast-like (SaOS-2) attachment; however, the presence of cell adhesive domains rescued osteoblast adhesion, yielding higher values of cell attachment and spreading compared to controls (p < 0.05). Finally, the antibacterial potential of the coating was measured by live/dead assays and SEM using S. sanguinis as a model of early colonizer in oral biofilms. The presence of PEG layers significantly reduced bacterial attachment on the surfaces (p < 0.05). This antibacterial potential was further increased by the bactericidal peptide, yielding values of bacterial adhesion below 0.2% (p < 0.05). The balance between the risk of infection and the optimal osteointegration of a biomaterial is often described as the race for the surface, in which contaminating bacteria and host tissue cells compete to colonize the implant.

Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.","authors":[{"name":"Bingbing Cheng"},{"name":"Yonatan Chatzinoff"},{"name":"Debby Szczepanski"},{"name":"Chenchen Bing"},{"name":"Sumbul Shaikh"},{"name":"Omar Wyman"},{"name":"Cameron E Perry"},{"name":"James A Richardson"},{"name":"Dennis K Burns"},{"name":"Bret M Evers"},{"name":"David E Greenberg"},{"name":"Rajiv Chopra"}],"keywords":[]},"article108":{"pmid":"29746527","title":"Characterization of a nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae thermonuclease.","date":"2019-07-20","abs":"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) has been shown to form biofilms, comprised of extracellular DNA (eDNA), in the middle ear and bronchus during clinical infections.

Sterile 96-well polystyrene plates inoculated with EHEC (∼6.0 log CFU per well) were treated with a subinhibitory concentration (SIC) of Se, and biofilms were allowed to mature at 4 and 25°C for 96 h. Biofilm-associated bacterial population was determined by scraping and plating, whereas the extent of EPS production was determined using ruthenium red staining assay.

The efficacy of Se in rapid inactivation of preformed, mature EHEC biofilm was investigated by treating biofilms on polystyrene plates with the MBC of Se in combination with hot water at 80°C with a contact time of 0 min, 30 s, 2 min, and 5 min. Furthermore, the effect of Se on EHEC biofilm architecture was visualized using confocal microscopy, whereas the effect of Se on EHEC biofilm genes was determined using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Finally, the potential feasibility of coating stainless steel surfaces with Se nanoparticles to inhibit EHEC biofilm formation was studied. Se reduced early attachment of planktonic cells, biofilm formation, and EPS synthesis in EHEC ( P < 0.05). Se in combination with hot water reduced biofilm-associated bacterial counts by 3 to 4 log CFU/mL at 5 min of exposure compared with the control ( P < 0.05).

Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a nonoxide biomaterial widely used in spinal implants, has shown bacteriostatic effects against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; however, the physicochemical interactions between Si3N4 and bacteria yet remain conspicuously unexplored. In situ time-lapse Raman spectroscopic experiments were conducted by exposing S. epidermidis for 12, 24, and 48 h to Si3N4 substrates to understand the evolution of bacterial metabolism and to elucidate the ceramics antimicrobial behavior. The Raman probe captured an initial metabolic response of the bacteria to the adverse chemistry of the Si3N4 surface, which included peroxidation of membrane phospholipids and protein structural modifications to adjust for survivorship. However, beyond 24 h of exposure, the Raman signals representing DNA, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates showed clear fingerprints of bacterial lysis. Bands related to biofilm formation completely disappeared or underwent drastically reduced intensity. Bacterial lysis was confirmed by conventional fluorescence microscopy methods. Spectroscopic experiments suggested that a pH change at the Si3N4's surface induced variations in the membrane structure and D-alanylation of teichoic acids in its peptidoglycan layer. Concurrent stimulation of peptidoglycan hydrolase (i.e., an enzyme involved with autolysis) ultimately led to membrane degradation and cellular death. An additional finding was that modulating the Si3N4 surface by increasing the population of amine groups improved the efficiency of the substrate against S. epidermidis, thus suggesting that optimization of the near-surface (alkaline) conditions may be a viable approach to bacterial reduction.","authors":[{"name":"Francesco Boschetto"},{"name":"Tetsuya Adachi"},{"name":"Satoshi Horiguchi"},{"name":"Danny Fainozzi"},{"name":"Fulvio Parmigiani"},{"name":"Elia Marin"},{"name":"Wenliang Zhu"},{"name":"Bryan McEntire"},{"name":"Toshiro Yamamoto"},{"name":"Narisato Kanamura"},{"name":"Osam Mazda"},{"name":"Eriko Ohgitani"},{"name":"Giuseppe Pezzotti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Raman spectroscopy"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"bacteriostatic behavior"},{"word":"silicon nitride"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"29744925","title":"Microcalorimetric detection of staphylococcal biofilm growth on various prosthetic biomaterials after exposure to daptomycin.","date":"2019-05-20","abs":"Primary aim of this in vitro study was to test the efficacy of daptomycin to eradicate staphylococcal biofilms on various orthopedic implant materials.

Biofilms of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were formed on the samples and thereafter exposed to daptomycin. Samples were subsequently sonicated in order to detect dislodged biofilm bacteria and transferred to a microcalorimeter for real-time measurement of growth-related heat flow. Minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was determined as the lowest concentration of daptomycin required to eradicate biofilm bacteria on the sample. Median MBEC of S. aureus biofilm on smooth metallic surfaces was lower than the rough metallic surfaces. In experiments with S. epidermidis, no pattern was seen in relation to the surface roughness. Regarding the quantitative estimation of staphylococcal biofilm formation on the sample, we found a significantly higher amount of biofilm growth on the rough surfaces than the smooth samples and polyethylene. In conclusion, the presented study showed that daptomycin could eradicate S. aureus biofilm at lower concentrations on the smooth surfaces compared to the rough surfaces, as well as polyethylene.

It can occur in any bone in the body, but it most often affects the long bones (leg and arm), vertebral (spine), and bones of the foot. Microbial success in osteomyelitis is due to their ability to form biofilms which inhibit the wound healing process and increases resistance to anti-infective agents. Also, biofilms do not allow easy penetration of antibiotics into their matrix making clinical treatment a challenge. The development of local antibiotic delivery systems that deliver high concentrations of antibiotics to the affected site is an emerging area of research with great potential. Standard treatment includes antibiotic therapy, either locally or systemically and refractory cases of osteomyelitis may lead to surgical intervention and a prolonged course of antibiotic treatment involving placement of antibiotic-doped beads or spacers within the wound site. There are disadvantages with this treatment modality including insufficient mixing of the antibiotic, lack of uniform bead size, resulting in lower antibiotic availability, and limitations on the antibiotics employed. Thus, a method is needed to address biofilm formations in the wound and on the surface of the surgical implants to prevent osteomyelitis.

Streptococcus mutans has an important role in oral bacterial biofilm formation in early stage biofilm before the microbiota shift to late stage and become more virulent.

Disadvantages associated with the use of antiseptics and the growing worldwide problem of antibiotic resistance have necessitated the search for alternative agents. In this study, the antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of AM404, an active metabolite of paracetamol, were tested against P. gingivalis and other bacterial pathogens. The activity of AM404 was tested against 10 bacteria, including both oral and nonoral human pathogens. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AM404 was determined by measuring optical density (OD) values. The minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) was detected by crystal violet staining. The activity of structural analogs of AM404 was tested by MIC determinations. The effect of AM404 on P. gingivalis biofilms formed on titanium disks as a model for dental implants was evaluated by colony forming unit counting. Potential cytotoxicity of AM404 towards HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney cells), HepG2 (human hepatoma cells), IEC-6 (rat intestinal cells), and Panc-1 cells (pancreatic cancer cells) was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. To get more insight in the mode of action of AM404, we used the fluorescent dyes N-phenyl-1-napthylamine and SYTOX green to investigate outer and inner membrane damage of P. gingivalis induced by AM404, respectively. Of all tested pathogens, AM404 only inhibited growth and biofilm formation of P. gingivalis. Moreover, it showed potent activity against P. gingivalis biofilms formed on titanium surfaces. A structure-activity analysis demonstrated that the unsaturated carbon chain is essential for its antibacterial activity.

Over half of the world's population is infected by H. pylori, which is a major cause of duodenal and gastric ulcers as well as gastric cancer. During chronic infection, H. pylori localizes within the gastric mucosal layer, including deep within invaginations called glands; thanks to its impressive ability to survive despite the harsh acidic environment, it can persist for the host's lifetime. This ability to survive and persist in the stomach is associated with urease production, chemotactic motility, and the ability to adapt to the fluctuating environment. Additionally, biofilm formation has recently been suggested to play a role in colonization. Biofilms are surface-associated communities of bacteria that are embedded in a hydrated matrix of extracellular polymeric substances. Biofilms pose a substantial health risk and are key contributors to many chronic and recurrent infections. This link between biofilm-associated bacteria and chronic infections likely results from an increased tolerance to conventional antibiotic treatments as well as immune system action. The role of this biofilm mode in antimicrobial treatment failure and H. pylori survival has yet to be determined. Furthermore, relatively little is known about the H. pylori biofilm structure or the genes associated with this mode of growth. In this review, therefore, we aim to highlight recent findings concerning H. pylori biofilms and the molecular mechanism of their formation. Additionally, we discuss the potential roles of biofilms in the failure of antibiotic treatment and in infection recurrence.","authors":[{"name":"Skander Hathroubi"},{"name":"Stephanie L Servetas"},{"name":"Ian Windham"},{"name":"D Scott Merrell"},{"name":"Karen M Ottemann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Helicobacter pylori"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gastritis"},{"word":"regulation"}]},"article127":{"pmid":"29742306","title":"A Defined and Flexible Pocket Explains Aryl Substrate Promiscuity of the Cahuitamycin Starter Unit-Activating Enzyme CahJ.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Cahuitamycins are biofilm inhibitors assembled by a convergent nonribosomal peptide synthetase pathway.

Objectives To evaluate the activity against S. mutans biofilm of model resin composites incorporating different concentrations of ZnO-nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) and characterize their physicochemical properties. Materials and Methods Different concentrations of ZnO-NP (wt.%): E1=0, E2=0.5, E3=1, E4=2, E5=5 and E6=10 were incorporated into a model resin composite consisting of Bis-GMA-TEGDMA and barium borosilicate particles. The activity against S. mutans biofilm was evaluated by metabolic activity and lactic acid production. The following physicochemical properties were characterized: degree of conversion (DC%), flexural strength (FS), elastic modulus (EM), hardness (KHN), water sorption (Wsp), water solubility (Wsl) and translucency (TP). Results E3, E4, E5 and E6 decreased the biofilm metabolic activity and E5 and E6 decreased the lactic acid production (p<0.05). E6 presented the lowest DC% (p<0.05). No significant difference in FS and EM was found for all resin composites (p>0.05). E5 and E6 presented the lowest values of KHN (p<0.05). E6 presented a higher Wsp than E1 (p<0.05) and the highest Wsl (p<0.05). The translucency significantly decreased as the ZnO- NP concentration increased (p<0.05).

Studied mainly in prokaryotes, polyP and its associated enzymes are vital in diverse metabolic activities, in some structural functions, and most importantly in stress responses. Bacterial species, including many pathogens, encode a homolog of a major polyP synthesis enzyme, Poly Phosphate Kinase (PPK) with 2 different genes coding for PPK1 and PPK2. Genetic deletion of the ppk1 gene leads to reduced polyP levels and the consequent loss of virulence and stress adaptation responses. This far, no PPK1 homolog has been identified in higher-order eukaryotes, and, therefore, PPK1 represents a novel target for chemotherapy. The aim of the current study is to investigate PPK1 from Escherichia coli with comprehensive understanding of the enzyme's structure and binding sites, which were used to design pharmacophores and screen a library of compounds for potential discovery of selective PPK1 inhibitors. Verification of the resultant inhibitors activities was conducted using a combination of mutagenic and chemical biological approaches.

In addition, biofilm formation ability was measured in WT, ppk1 knockout mutant, and the chemically inhibited WT.

V. cholerae is known to form biofilms on the gut epithelium, and the biofilms once formed are resistant to the action of antibiotics. Therefore agents that prevent the biofilm formation and disperse the preformed biofilms are associated with therapeutic benefits. The use of antibiotics for the treatment of cholera is associated with side effects such as gut dysbiosis due to depletion of gut microflora, and the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Thus search for safe alternative therapeutic agents is warranted. Herein, we screened the lactobacilli spp. isolated from the fecal samples of healthy children for their abilities to prevent biofilm formation and to disperse the preformed biofilms of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus by using an in vitro assay. The results showed that the culture supernatant (CS) of all the seven isolates of Lactobacillus spp. used in the study inhibited the biofilm formation of V. cholerae by more than 90%. Neutralization of pH of CS completely abrogated their antimicrobial activities against V. cholera, but had negligible effects on their biofilm inhibitory potential. Further, CS of all the lactobacilli isolates caused the dispersion of preformed V. cholerae biofilms in the range 62-85%; however, pH neutralization of CS reduced the biofilm dispersal potential of the 4 out of 7 isolates by 19-57%. Furthermore, the studies showed that CS of none of the lactobacilii isolates had antimicrobial activity against V. parahaemolyticus, but 5 out of 7 isolates inhibited the formation of its biofilm in the range 62-82%. However, none of the CS dispersed the preformed biofilms of V. parahaemolyticus. The ability of CS to inhibit the adherence of Vibrio spp. to the epithelial cell line was also determined. Thus, we conclude that the biofilm dispersive action of CS of lactobacilli is strain-specific and pH-dependent. As Vibrio is known to form biofilms in the intestinal niche having physiological pH in the range 6-7, the probiotic strains that have dispersive action at high pH may have better therapeutic potential.","authors":[{"name":"Sumanpreet Kaur"},{"name":"Preeti Sharma"},{"name":"Namarta Kalia"},{"name":"Jatinder Singh"},{"name":"Sukhraj Kaur"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio"},{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm-dispersion"},{"word":"lactobacilli"},{"word":"probiotic"}]},"article136":{"pmid":"29740417","title":"The Small Regulatory Antisense RNA PilR Affects Pilus Formation and Cell Motility by Negatively Regulating pilA11 in Synechocystis sp.

In this study, we identified the antisense RNA PilR encoded in the noncoding strand of the prepilin-encoding gene pilA11. Analysis of overexpressor [PilR(+)] and suppressor [PilR(-)] mutant strains revealed that PilR is a direct negative regulator of PilA11 protein. Although overexpression of PilR did not affect cell growth, it greatly reduced levels of pilA11 mRNA and protein and decreased both the thickness and number of pili, resulting in limited cell motility and small, distinct colonies. Suppression of PilR had the opposite effect. A hypothetical model on the regulation of pilA9-pilA10-pilA11-slr2018 operon expression by PilR was proposed.

These conventional flora compositions is often determined by factors which may not be limited to genetics, age, sex, stress and nutrition of humans. Man is constantly in contact with bacteria through media such as air, water, soil and food. This paper reviews the concept of bacterial pathogenesis from the sequential point of colonization to tissue injury. The paper in addition to examination of the factors which enhance virulence in bacterial pathogens also x-rayed the concept of pathogenicity islands and the next generation approaches or rather current trends/methods used in the bacterial pathogenicity investigations. In terms of pathogenicity which of course is the capacity to cause disease in animals, requires that the attacking bacterial strain is virulent, and has ability to bypass the host immune defensive mechanisms. In order to achieve or exhibit pathogenicity, the virulence factors required by microorganisms include capsule, pigments, enzymes, iron acquisition through siderophores. Bacterial Pathogenicity Islands as a distinct concept in bacterial pathogenesis are just loci on the chromosome or extra chromosomal units which are acquired by horizontal gene transfer within pathogens in a microbial community or biofilm. In the area of laboratory investigations, bacterial pathogenesis was initially carried out using culture dependent approaches, which can only detect about 1% of human and veterinary-important pathogens. However, in the recent paradigms shift, the use of proteomics, metagenomics, phylogenetic tree analyses, spooligotyping, and finger printing etc. have made it possible that 100% of the bacterial pathogens in nature can be extensively studied.","authors":[{"name":"Frank Anayo Orji"},{"name":"Ositadinma Chinyere Ugbogu"},{"name":"Eziuche Amadike Ugbogu"},{"name":"Alberto Barbabosa-Pliego"},{"name":"Jose Cedillo Monroy"},{"name":"Mona M M Y Elghandour"},{"name":"Abdelfattah Z M Salem"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Colonization"},{"word":"Diseases"},{"word":"Tissue injury"},{"word":"pathogenic bacteria"}]},"article147":{"pmid":"29738519","title":"Lipase-Catalyzed Synthesis of Sucrose Monolaurate and Its Antibacterial Property and Mode of Action against Four Pathogenic Bacteria.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"The aim of this work was to evaluate the antibacterial activities and mode of action of sucrose monolaurate (SML) with a desirable purity, synthesized by Lipozyme TL IM-mediated transesterification in the novel ionic liquid, against four pathogenic bacteria including L. monocytogenes, B. subtilis, S. aureus, and E. coli. The antibacterial activity was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and the time⁻kill assay. SML showed varying antibacterial activity against tested bacteria with MICs and MBCs of 2.5 and 20 mM for L. monocytogenes, 2.5 and 20 mM for B. subtilis, 10 and 40 mM for S. aureus, respectively. No dramatic inhibition was observed for E. coli at 80 mM SML. Mechanism of bacterial inactivation caused by SML was revealed through comprehensive factors including cell morphology, cellular lysis, membrane permeability, K⁺ leakage, zeta potential, intracellular enzyme, and DNA assay. Results demonstrated that bacterial inactivation against Gram-positive bacteria was primarily induced by the pronounced damage to the cell membrane integrity. SML may interact with cytoplasmic membrane to disturb the regulation system of peptidoglycan hydrolase activities to degrade the peptidoglycan layer and form a hole in the layer. Then, the inside cytoplasmic membrane was blown out due to turgor pressure and the cytoplasmic materials inside leaked out. Leakage of intracellular enzyme to the supernatants implied that the cell membrane permeability was compromised. Consequently, the release of K⁺ from the cytosol lead to the alterations of the zeta potential of cells, which would disturb the subcellular localization of some proteins, and thereby causing bacterial inactivation. Moreover, remarkable interaction with DNA was also observed. SML at sub-MIC inhibited biofilm formation by these bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Shi-Yin Shao"},{"name":"Yu-Gang Shi"},{"name":"Yu Wu"},{"name":"Li-Qing Bian"},{"name":"Yun-Jie Zhu"},{"name":"Xin-Ying Huang"},{"name":"Ying Pan"},{"name":"Lu-Yao Zeng"},{"name":"Run-Run Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"biocatalysis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"ionic liquids"},{"word":"lipase"},{"word":"sucrose monolaurate"}]},"article148":{"pmid":"29738516","title":"The Bacterial Toxin CNF1 Induces Activation and Maturation of Human Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) is a bacterial protein toxin primarily expressed by pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, causing extraintestinal infections.

The mechanisms underlying the immunostimulatory properties of CNF1 are, however, poorly characterized, and little is known about the direct effects of the toxin on immune cells. Here, we show that CNF1 induces expression of maturation markers on human immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) without compromising cell viability. Consistent with the phenotypic maturation, CNF1 further triggered secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the capacity of moDCs to stimulate proliferation of allogenic naïve CD4+ T cells. A catalytically inactive form of the toxin did not induce moDC maturation, indicating that the enzymatic activity of CNF1 triggers immature moDCs to undergo phenotypic and functional maturation. As the maturation of dendritic cells plays a central role in initiating inflammation and activating the adaptive immune response, the present findings shed new light on the immunostimulatory properties of CNF1 and may explain why the toxin functions as an immunoadjuvant.","authors":[{"name":"Laura Gall-Mas"},{"name":"Alessia Fabbri"},{"name":"Martin R J Namini"},{"name":"Michael Givskov"},{"name":"Carla Fiorentini"},{"name":"Thorbjørn Krejsgaard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CNF1"},{"word":"Rho GTPases"},{"word":"T-cell activation"},{"word":"anti-virulence immunity"},{"word":"bacterial toxins"},{"word":"cytokine expression"},{"word":"dendritic cells"},{"word":"effector-triggered immunity"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"moDCs"}]},"article149":{"pmid":"29738306","title":"The biofilm matrix polysaccharides cellulose and alginate both protect Pseudomonas putida mt-2 against reactive oxygen species generated under matric stress and copper exposure.","date":"2019-11-05","abs":"In natural environments most bacteria live in biofilms embedded in complex matrices of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS).

In particular, chronic non-healing wounds commonly harbour complex polymicrobial, pathogenic biofilm that is tolerant to systemic and topical antimicrobial therapy. Antibiotic stewardship programmes have emerged globally to improve antibiotic prescribing practices, and to curb the emergence and spread of bacterial resistance. In this regard, new antimicrobial strategies must be considered, one of which is to use antibiofilm/antimicrobial combinations to disrupt biofilm, thereby facilitating effectiveness of antimicrobial agents, and reducing the opportunity for antibiotic resistance gene transfer within biofilm. This strategy is being considered in several clinical conditions, one of which is chronic non-healing wounds, where antibiotics are used excessively and often indiscriminately.

Caspofungin (CAS), micafungin (MICA) and anidulafungin (ANID) are the three most widely used EC antifungal agents. The treatment of biofilm-associated fungal infections affecting patients in tertiary health-care facilities has been identified as a challenge, particularly in Indian Intensive Care Unit (ICU) settings. With the rising number of critically ill patients requiring invasive devices such as central venous catheters for treatment, especially in ICUs, these devices serve as a potential source of nosocomial infections. Candida spp. colonisation is a major precursor of these infections and further complicates and prolongs treatment procedures, adding to increasing costs both for hospitals and the patient. Analysing studies involving the use of these agents can help in making critical decisions for antifungal therapy in the event of a fungal infection in the ICU. In addition, the development of resistance to antifungal agents is a crucial factor for assessing the appropriate antifungals that can be used for treatment.

We show that daptomycin bactericidal activity against S. aureus varies significantly with the growth state and strain, according to the membrane fatty acid composition. Daptomycin efficacy as an antibiotic relies on its ability to oligomerize within membranes and form pores that subsequently lead to cell death. Our findings ascertain that daptomycin interacts with tolerant bacteria and reaches its membrane target, regardless of its bactericidal activity. However, the final step of pore formation does not occur in cells that are daptomycin tolerant, strongly suggesting that it is incapable of oligomerization. Importantly, membrane fatty acid contents correlated with poor daptomycin bactericidal activity, which could be manipulated by fatty acid addition. In conclusion, daptomycin failure to treat S. aureus is not due to a lack of antibiotic-target interaction, but is driven by its capacity to form pores, which depends on membrane composition. Manipulation of membrane fluidity to restore S. aureus daptomycin bactericidal activity in vivo could open the way to novel antibiotic treatment strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Rym Boudjemaa"},{"name":"Clément Cabriel"},{"name":"Florence Dubois-Brissonnet"},{"name":"Nicolas Bourg"},{"name":"Guillaume Dupuis"},{"name":"Alexandra Gruss"},{"name":"Sandrine Lévêque-Fort"},{"name":"Romain Briandet"},{"name":"Marie-Pierre Fontaine-Aupart"},{"name":"Karine Steenkeste"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"bacterial membranes"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"daptomycin"},{"word":"fatty acids"},{"word":"fluorescence"},{"word":"tolerance"}]},"article166":{"pmid":"29734815","title":"Dynamic field testing of coating chemistry candidates by a rotating disk system.","date":"2019-03-20","abs":"Quick and reliable testing is crucial for the development of new fouling release (FR) coatings.

Moreover, poor water solubility further restricts its applications on anti-infection therapy. Inulins are a group of polysaccharides produced by many types of plants, and are widely used in processed foods.

The physicochemical characterization of the inulin⁻chitosan conjugate was assayed, and the anti-biofilm activity was evaluated against S. aureus biofilm. The results indicated that, as compared to chitosan, this novel polysaccharide⁻polysaccharide conjugate significantly enhanced activities against S. aureus either in a biofilm or planktonic state. Of note, the conjugate also showed a broad spectrum anti-biofilm activity on different bacteria strains and low cellular toxicity to mammalian cells.

Gold solubilization induces Au-toxicity; however, Au-detoxifying community members ameliorates Au-toxicity by precipitating soluble Au to metallic Au. We hypothesize that Au-dissolution and re-concentration (precipitation) place selective pressures on associated microbial communities, leading to compositional changes and subsequent Au-particle transformation. We analyzed Au-particles from eight United Kingdom sites using next generation sequencing, electron microscopy and micro-analyses. Gold particles contained biofilms composed of prokaryotic cells and extracellular polymeric substances intermixed with (bio)minerals. Across all sites communities were dominated by Proteobacteria (689, 97% Operational Taxonomic Units, 59.3% of total reads), with β-Proteobacteria being the most abundant. A wide range of Au-morphotypes including nanoparticles, micro-crystals, sheet-like Au and secondary rims, indicated that dissolution and re-precipitation occurred, and from this transformation indices were calculated. Multivariate statistical analyses showed a significant relationship between the extent of Au-particle transformation and biofilm community composition, with putative metal-resistant Au-cycling taxa linked to progressive Au transformation. These included the genera Pseudomonas, Leptothrix and Acinetobacter. Additionally, putative exoelectrogenic genera Rhodoferax and Geobacter were highly abundant.

With high activity against both planktonic cells and biofilms, Lst has the potential to be used in industrial products, such as commercial cleansers, for decontamination. However, Lst is inhibited in the presence of monoethanolamine (MEA), a chemical widely used in cleaning solutions and pharmaceuticals, and the underlying mechanism of inhibition remains unknown. In this study, we examined the cell binding and killing capabilities of Lst against S. aureus ATCC 6538 in buffered salt solution with MEA at different pH values (7.5 to 10.5) and discovered that only the unprotonated form of MEA inhibited Lst binding to the cell surface, leading to low Lst activity, despite retention of its secondary structure. This reduced enzyme activity could be largely recovered via a reduction in wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis through tunicamycin treatment, indicating that the suppression of Lst activity was dependent on the presence and amount of WTA. We propose that the decreased cell binding and killing capabilities of Lst are associated with the influence of uncharged MEA on the conformation of WTA.

The activation energy for LD-EET (0.11 ± 0.01 eV) was comparable to GSB, consistent with the possible role of c-type cytochromes as LD-EET cofactors, detected in abundance by confocal resonance Raman microscopy. Taken together, the results demonstrate LD-EET for a mixed community anode-grown microbial biofilm that is remarkably similar to GSB even though it contains many different types of microorganisms and appears to utilize far fewer EET redox cofactors.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew D Yates"},{"name":"Sarah Barr Engel"},{"name":"Brian J Eddie"},{"name":"Nikolai Lebedev"},{"name":"Anthony P Malanoski"},{"name":"Leonard M Tender"}],"keywords":[]},"article215":{"pmid":"29722699","title":"Microbiological aspects of thermophile pretreatment of activated sludge inhibiting electricity generation of microbial fuel cell.","date":"2019-01-28","abs":"Thermophile pretreatment of activated sludge greatly improves the biodegradability of sludge, but whether the pretreated products are suitable for the electricity generation of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is still little known.

HrpR and HrpS form a hetero-hexamer, which activates the expression of HrpL, which induces all T3SS genes by binding to a 'hrp box' in promoters. However, the individual molecular mechanism of HrpR or HrpS has not been fully understood. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput DNA sequencing, we found that HrpR, HrpS, and HrpL had four, 47, and 31 targets on the genome, respectively. HrpS directly bound to the promoter regions of a group of T3SS genes and non-T3SS genes. HrpS independently regulated these genes in a hrpL deletion strain. Additionally, a HrpS-binding motif (GTGCCAAA) was identified, which was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and lux-reporter assay. HrpS also regulated motility and biofilm formation in P. savastanoi. The present study strongly suggests that HrpS alone can work as a global regulator on both T3SS and non-T3SS genes in P. savastanoi. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

In this study, a dynamic sessile-droplet habitat is introduced, a simple method which cultivates biofilms on micropatterns with diameters of tens to hundreds of micrometers in a microfluidic channel. Nanoliter plugs are utilized, spaced by immiscible carrier oil to initiate and support the growth of an array of biofilms, anchored on and spatially confined to the micropatterns arranged on the bottom surface of the microchannel, while planktonic or dispersal cells are flushed away by shear force of aqueous plugs. The performance of the aforementioned method of cultivating biofilms is demonstrated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and its derived mutants, and quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing of PAO1 biofilms. This method could significantly eliminate corner effects, avoid microchannel clogging, and constrain the growth of biofilms for long-term observations.

An alternative approach is provided by using fluorescent microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which enables the evaluation of fractions of cells subpopulations in a given sample. For the quantitative assessment of cell fractions in microphotographs, we suggest a simple two-step algorithm that combines single cells selection and the statistical analysis.

Based on a series of experimental measurements performed on bacterial and eukaryotic cells under various conditions, we show explicitly that the suggested approach effectively accounts for the fractions of different cell sub-populations (like the live/dead staining in our samples) in all studied cases that are in good agreement with manual cell counting on microphotographs and flow cytometry data. This algorithm is implemented as a simple software tool that includes an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface for the initial adjustment of algorithm parameters to the microphotographs analysis as well as for the sequential analysis of homogeneous series of similar microscopic images without further user intervention.

CodY DNA-binding activity is high when GTP and ILV are abundant. When GTP and ILV are limited, CodY's affinity for DNA drops, altering expression of CodY-regulated targets. In this work, we investigated the impact of guanine nucleotides (GNs) on S. aureus physiology and CodY activity by constructing a guaA null mutant (ΔguaA strain). De novo biosynthesis of guanine monophosphate is abolished due to the guaA mutation; thus, the mutant cells require exogenous guanosine for growth. We also found that CodY activity was reduced when we knocked out guaA, activating the Agr two-component system and increasing secreted protease activity. Notably, in a rich, complex medium, we detected an increase in alternative sigma factor B activity in the ΔguaA mutant, which results in a 5-fold increase in production of the antioxidant pigment staphyloxanthin. Under biologically relevant flow conditions, ΔguaA cells failed to form robust biofilms when limited for guanine or guanosine. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of the S. aureus transcriptome during growth in guanosine-limited chemostats revealed substantial CodY-dependent and -independent alterations of gene expression profiles. Importantly, these changes increase production of proteases and δ-toxin, suggesting that S. aureus exhibits a more invasive lifestyle when limited for guanosine.

In all lakes, functional diversity profiles of MP biofilms consistently differed from those in the surrounding water. However, solely in the oligo-mesotrophic lake MP biofilms had a higher functional richness compared to the ambient water. These results demonstrate that the functionality and hence the ecological role of MP-associated microbial communities are context-dependent, i.e. different environments lead to substantial changes in biomass build up and heterotrophic activities of MP biofilms. We propose that MP surfaces act as new niches for aquatic microorganisms and that the constantly increasing MP pollution has the potential to globally impact carbon dynamics of pelagic environments by altering heterotrophic activities.","authors":[{"name":"Maria Arias-Andres"},{"name":"Marie Therese Kettner"},{"name":"Takeshi Miki"},{"name":"Hans-Peter Grossart"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Functional diversity"},{"word":"Heterotrophic activity"},{"word":"Microorganisms"},{"word":"Microplastics"},{"word":"Multi-functionality index"},{"word":"Total biomass"}]},"article261":{"pmid":"29710509","title":"DNA gyrase inhibitors: Progress and synthesis of potent compounds as antibacterial agents.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"DNA gyrase is classified as topoisomerase II, an ATP-dependent enzyme that is vital in the transcription, replication of DNA and chromosome segregation processes. It plays a crucial role in all bacteria except higher eukaryotes and this makes it a desirable and viable therapeutic target for development of new antibacterial agents. Fluoroquinolones are commonly used effective antibacterial agents that target DNA gyrase, however the spectrum of side-effects and emerging bacterial resistance with no new drugs in the antibacterial pipeline has fuelled intensive research in this area. New chemical entities with varied scaffolds possessing DNA gyrase inhibiting properties have been determined by screening chemical libraries that could serve as good leads for antibacterial drug development. A wide range of natural products and protein-based compounds have been identified and studied as DNA gyrase inhibitors and this adds a huge amount of structural diversity that can be exploited and harnessed in the discovery of new antibacterial agents. The development of new chemical compounds with DNA gyrase inhibitory activity (from natural sources, random screens or rational design) will further validate/corroborate the potential of this enzyme as a useful target. This review presents an overview of the DNA gyrase inhibitors obtained from natural and synthetic sources, their syntheses schemes and spectrum of biological activity of a variety of scaffolds and their analogues. The authors hope to provide focused direction for development of new chemical entities, synthetic routes for analogue synthesis, structure activity relationships and biological activity. The most potent ones can be used as templates to design novel compounds targeting DNA gyrase and are effective against resistant bacterial strains and biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Tabassum Khan"},{"name":"Kaksha Sankhe"},{"name":"Vasanti Suvarna"},{"name":"Atul Sherje"},{"name":"Kavitkumar Patel"},{"name":"Bhushan Dravyakar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chebulinic acid"},{"word":"Coumarins"},{"word":"DNA gyrase"},{"word":"DNA gyrase inhibitors"},{"word":"Quinolones"},{"word":"Spiropyrimidinetriones"}]},"article262":{"pmid":"29709825","title":"Improvement of carbon usage for phosphorus recovery in EBPR-r and the shift in microbial community.","date":"2018-10-29","abs":"Enhanced biological phosphorus removal and recovery (EBPR-r) is a biofilm process that makes use of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) to remove and recover phosphorus (P) from wastewater.

Briefly, mature S. aureus biofilms were incubated with ALA and then exposed to light. Subsequently, the antibacterial effect of ALA-PDT on S. aureus biofilm was quantified by calculating the colony forming units (CFUs) and visualized by viability fluorescent staining via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Representative results demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect of ALA-PDT on S. aureus biofilms. This protocol is simple and can be used to develop an in vitro model to study the treatment of S. aureus biofilms with ALA-PDT.

While the pathway and kinetics of the electron flow during the EET reaction have been investigated, a whole-cell electrochemical method to examine the impact of cation transport associated with EET has not yet been established. In the present study, an example of a biochemical technique to examine the deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE) on EET through OM c-Cyts using a model microbe, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, is described. The KIE on the EET process can be obtained if the EET through OM c-Cyts acts as the rate-limiting step in the microbial current production. To that end, before the addition of D2O, the supernatant solution was replaced with fresh media containing a sufficient amount of the electron donor to support the rate of upstream metabolic reactions, and to remove the planktonic cells from a uniform monolayer biofilm on the working electrode. Alternative methods to confirm the rate-limiting step in microbial current production as EET through OM c-Cyts are also described.

Infection occurs via open wounds or ingestion, where its asymptomatic colonization of seafood, most infamously oysters, provides a gateway into the human food chain. Colonization begins with initial surface contact, which is often mediated by bacterial surface appendages called pili. Type IV Tad pili are widely distributed in the Vibrionaceae, but evidence for a physiological role for these structures is scant. The V. vulnificus genome codes for three distinct tad loci. Recently, a positive correlation was demonstrated between the expression of tad-3 and the phenotypes of a V. vulnificus descendent (NT) that exhibited increased biofilm formation, auto-aggregation, and oyster colonization relative to its parent. However, the mechanism by which tad pilus expression promoted these phenotypes was not determined. Here, we show that deletion of the tad pilin gene (flp) altered the near-surface motility profile of NT cells from high curvature, orbital retracing patterns characteristic of cells actively probing the surface to low curvature traces indicative of wandering and diminished bacteria-surface interactions. The NT flp pilin mutant also exhibited decreased initial surface attachment, attenuated auto-aggregation and formed fragile biofilms that disintegrated under hydrodynamic flow. Thus, the tad-3 locus, designated iam, promoted initial surface attachment, auto-aggregation and resistance to mechanical clearance of V. vulnificus biofilms. The prevalence of tad loci in the Vibrionaceae suggests that they may play equally important roles in other family members.","authors":[{"name":"Meng Pu"},{"name":"Dean Allistair Rowe-Magnus"}],"keywords":[]},"article272":{"pmid":"29707229","title":"Fighting biofilms with lantibiotics and other groups of bacteriocins.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilms are sessile communities of bacteria typically embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix. Bacterial cells embedded in biofilms are inherently recalcitrant to antimicrobials, compared to cells existing in a planktonic state, and are notoriously difficult to eradicate once formed. Avenues to tackle biofilms thus far have largely focussed on attempting to disrupt the initial stages of biofilm formation, including adhesion and maturation of the biofilm. Such an approach is advantageous as the concentrations required to inhibit formation of biofilms are generally much lower than removing a fully established biofilm. The crisis of antibiotic resistance in clinical settings worldwide has been further exacerbated by the ability of certain pathogenic bacteria to form biofilms. Perhaps the most notorious biofilm formers described from a clinical viewpoint have been methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Gardnerella vaginalis and Streptococcus mutans, the latter of which is found in oral biofilms. Due to the dearth of novel antibiotics in recent decades, compounded by the increasing rate of emergence of resistance amongst pathogens with a propensity for biofilm formation, solutions are urgently required to mitigate these crises. Bacteriocins are a class of antimicrobial peptides, which are ribosomally synthesised and often are more potent than their antibiotic counterparts. Here, we review a selection of studies conducted with bacteriocins with the ultimate objective of inhibiting biofilms. Overall, a deeper understanding of the precise means by which a biofilm forms on a substrate as well as insights into the mechanisms by which bacteriocins inhibit biofilms is warranted.","authors":[{"name":"Harsh Mathur"},{"name":"Des Field"},{"name":"Mary C Rea"},{"name":"Paul D Cotter"},{"name":"Colin Hill"},{"name":"R Paul Ross"}],"keywords":[]},"article273":{"pmid":"29706943","title":"Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Activities of Psychorubrin, a Pyranonaphthoquinone Isolated From Mitracarpus frigidus (Rubiaceae).","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Psychorubrin, a natural pyranonaphthoquinone found in different plants, has become an interesting compound in the search for new antimicrobial therapeutic agents.

Second, bacterial killing assay, bacterial abundance, and membrane viability were evaluated. The nucleotide leakage assay was used to verify membrane destabilization while antibiofilm activities were analyzed by the effect on established biofilm, static biofilm formation, isolation of biofilm matrix assay and scanning electron microscopy. In parallel, the combinatorial effect of psychorubrin and chloramphenicol was evaluated by the checkerboard method. Psychorubrin was active against Gram-positive bacteria, showing rapid time-dependent kinetics of bacterial killing, amplified nucleotide leakage, and greater activity against the methicillin-resistant species (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus 33591 and 33592 and Staphylococcus pyogenes 10096. Psychorubrin also interfered with the composition of the biofilm matrix by reducing the total content of carbohydrates and proteins.

Here, we address this question by examining the phenotypic and genotypic profiles of aquatic communities exposed to ciprofloxacin, also evaluating the within-species selection of resistant E. coli in complex communities. The taxonomic composition was significantly altered at ciprofloxacin exposure concentrations down to 1 μg/L. Shotgun metagenomic analysis indicated that mobile quinolone resistance determinants (qnrD, qnrS and qnrB) were enriched as a direct consequence of ciprofloxacin exposure from 1 μg/L or higher. Only at 5-10 μg/L resistant E.coli increased relative to their sensitive counterparts. These resistant E. coli predominantly harbored non-transferrable, chromosomal triple mutations (gyrA S83 L, D87N and parC S80I), which confer high-level resistance. In a controlled experimental setup such as this, we interpret effects on taxonomic composition and enrichment of mobile quinolone resistance genes as relevant indicators of risk. Hence, the lowest observed effect concentration for resistance selection in complex communities by ciprofloxacin was 1 μg/L and the corresponding no observed effect concentration 0.1 μg/L. These findings can be used to define and implement discharge or surface water limits to reduce risks for selection of antibiotic resistance in the environment.","authors":[{"name":"Nadine Kraupner"},{"name":"Stefan Ebmeyer"},{"name":"Johan Bengtsson-Palme"},{"name":"Jerker Fick"},{"name":"Erik Kristiansson"},{"name":"Carl-Fredrik Flach"},{"name":"D G Joakim Larsson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Environmental emission limits"},{"word":"LOEC"},{"word":"NOEC"}]},"article280":{"pmid":"29704774","title":"Efficacy of HLE-a multidrug efflux-pump inhibitor-as a disinfectant against surface bacteria.","date":"2019-09-06","abs":"We evaluated the efficacy of a new disinfectant product, HLE, to inhibit multiple species of planktonic and biofilm bacterial cultures.

Biofilm formation by both deletion mutants was less than that of the wild-type strain. Because Pra1 and Zrt1 are also related to the zinc homeostasis system, the effects of adding zinc on biofilm formation were also examined. Biofilm formation was increased in the presence of zinc. These data suggest that Pra1 and Zrt1 regulate biofilm formation through zinc homeostasis.","authors":[{"name":"Sanae Kurakado"},{"name":"Rika Arai"},{"name":"Takashi Sugita"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Pra1"},{"word":"Zrt1"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article282":{"pmid":"29704240","title":"Accurate O","date":"2019-07-12","abs":"Although benzene can be biodegraded when dissolved oxygen is sufficient, delivering oxygen is energy intensive and can lead to air stripping the benzene.

Campylobacter, Salmonella, as well as Yersinia enterocolitica and Listeria monocytogenes may dwell in livestock (poultry, cattle, and swine) but are also found in wild animals, pets, fish, and rodents. Animals, often being asymptomatic carriers of pathogens, excrete them with faeces, thus delivering them to the environment. Therefore, pathogens may invade new individuals, as well as reside on vegetables and fruits. Pathogenic bacteria also penetrate food production areas and may remain there in the form of a biofilm covering the surfaces of machines and equipment. A common occurrence of microbes in food products, as well as their improper or careless processing, leads to common poisonings. Symptoms of foodborne infections may be mild, sometimes flu-like, but they also may be accompanied by severe complications, some even fatal.

Recent findings have highlighted the ability of some Gram-negative bacteria to utilize exogenous fatty acids in ways that modify membrane phospholipids and influence virulence phenotypes, such as biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance. This study explores the ability of K. pneumoniae to assimilate and respond to exogenous fatty acids. The combination of thin-layer chromatography liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed adoption of numerous exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into the phospholipid species of K. pneumoniae.

This should be taken into account, because often odontogenic maxillary sinusitis is misdiagnosed with common sinusitis, and only in 77 % such patients are examined by both dental specialist and otorhynolaryngologist. Study of causes of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis revealed that now iatrogenic impact prevails over other causes, which had been previously considered as main causes of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis. Especially endodontic treatment and implantation surgery are major causes of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis in present time, due to increasing incidence of perforation and damage of sinus by filling materials, bone or tooth particles, and implants. Anatomical structure of dental-sinus border area, and volume of endodontic treatment and implanting procedures, determines last ones as causative triggers due to development of complications and inflammatory processes. Microbial flora is mostly presented by anaerobic microorganisms; at the same time aerobic and fungal organisms are found in the microscopy of histology of patients with odontogenic maxillary sinusitis. At the same time, polymicrobial associations show high resistance to wide spectrum of antimicrobial medications.

While most research has been focused on identifying one or more specific determinants of these diseases, the results have provided limited predictive value and have not been able to explain the variation in the distribution of these diseases observed in epidemiological or clinical studies. Drawing on existing knowledge about the nature of the oral microbiota, we suggest that a stochastic model based on the Weiner process provides simple and parsimonious explanations for the pathogenesis of both caries and periodontitis, making few assumptions, and providing explanations for phenomena that have hitherto proved difficult, or have required complex arguments, to explain. These diseases occur as the result of the dental hard tissues and periodontal tissues integrating the random noise caused by normal metabolic activities of commensal microorganisms in the dental biofilm. The processes that result in the progression and regression of caries and periodontitis may be considered as natural, rather than pathological, even if, when left unchecked over long periods of time, they can result in the development of pathologies. The likelihood of progression or regression can be influenced by other determinants, but these processes will nevertheless occur in the absence of such influences. The distributional characteristics of the model approximate the findings of epidemiological studies indicating that, for both caries and periodontitis, there will be few sites affected in the early period after the eruption of the permanent dentition, but in those older there is an almost linear relationship with increasing age; furthermore, the longer a site survives without being affected, the less likely that it will be affected. We discuss the clinical and public health importance of these findings.","authors":[{"name":"Firoze Manji"},{"name":"Gunnar Dahlen"},{"name":"Ole Fejerskov"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aetiology"},{"word":"Dental caries"},{"word":"Oral health"},{"word":"Periodontitis"}]},"article311":{"pmid":"29694942","title":"Growth and current production of mixed culture anodic biofilms remain unaffected by sub-microscale surface roughness.","date":"2018-07-17","abs":"Bioelectrochemical systems couple electricity demand/supply to the metabolic redox reactions of microorganisms.

Thus far, studies have reported conflicting results on the impact of the electrode surface roughness on the growth and current production of biofilms. Here, the surface roughness of the glassy carbon electrodes was successfully modified at the sub-microscale using micro electrodischarge machining, while preserving the surface chemistry of the parent glassy carbon. All microbial electrodes showed similar startup time, maximum current density, charge transport ability across the biofilm and biomass production. Interestingly, an increase in the average surface cavity depth was observed for the biofilm top layer as a function of the electrode surface roughness (from 7 μm to 16 μm for a surface roughness of 5 nm to 682 nm, respectively). These results indicated that the surface roughness at a sub-microscale does not significantly impact the attachment or current production of mixed culture anodic biofilms on glassy carbon.

The objective of this study was to characterize the in situ rumen degradability and microbiota of four barley grain varieties and to compare these to corn. Three ruminally cannulated heifers were fed a low (60% barley silage, 37% barley grain, and 3% supplement) or high grain (37% barley silage, 60% barley grain, and 3% supplement) diet. One set of bags was used to estimate dry matter (DM), starch and crude protein (CP) degradability. A second set was used to extract DNA from the adherent microbiota and visualize grain after incubation using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). DNA was subjected to amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing followed by analysis using QIIME. In the low grain diet, McGwire had the highest effective degradability (ED) of DM (P < 0.01). The ED of starch was highest (P < 0.01) for Fibar, McGwire, and Xena, but the ED of CP was not affected by variety. For the high grain diet, Xena and McGwire had the highest ED of DM (P < 0.01). The ED of starch was highest (P < 0.01) for Xena and Fibar. The ED of protein was highest (P < 0.01) for Xena and McGwire.

Biofilm research is challenging due to the high degree of biofilm heterogeneity. A method for the production of standardized, reproducible, and patterned biofilm-inspired materials could be a boon for biofilm research and allow for completely new engineering applications. Here, we present such a method, combining 3D printing with genetic engineering. We prototyped a low-cost 3D printer that prints bioink, a suspension of bacteria in a solution of alginate that solidifies on a calcium-containing substrate. We 3D-printed Escherichia coli in different shapes and in discrete layers, after which the cells survived in the printing matrix for at least 1 week. When printed bacteria were induced to form curli fibers, the major proteinaceous extracellular component of E. coli biofilms, they remained adherent to the printing substrate and stably spatially patterned even after treatment with a matrix-dissolving agent, indicating that a biofilm-mimicking structure had formed. This work is the first demonstration of patterned, biofilm-inspired living materials that are produced by genetic control over curli formation in combination with spatial control by 3D printing. These materials could be used as living, functional materials in applications such as water filtration, metal ion sequestration, or civil engineering, and potentially as standardizable models for certain curli-containing biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Dominik T Schmieden"},{"name":"Samantha J Basalo Vázquez"},{"name":"Héctor Sangüesa"},{"name":"Marit van der Does"},{"name":"Timon Idema"},{"name":"Anne S Meyer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3D printing"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"bioprinting"},{"word":"curli"},{"word":"synthetic biology"}]},"article328":{"pmid":"29690522","title":"Coping with Environmental Eukaryotes; Identification of Pseudomonas syringae Genes during the Interaction with Alternative Hosts or Predators.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the ecological success of plant pathogens is critical to develop strategies for controlling diseases and protecting crops. Recent observations have shown that plant pathogenic bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas, exist in a range of natural environments away from their natural plant host e.g., water courses, soil, non-host plants. This exposes them to a variety of eukaryotic predators such as nematodes, insects and amoebae present in the environment. Nematodes and amoeba in particular are bacterial predators while insect herbivores may act as indirect predators, ingesting bacteria on plant tissue. We therefore postulated that bacteria are probably under selective pressure to avoid or survive predation and have therefore developed appropriate coping mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that plant pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae are able to cope with predation pressure and found that three pathovars show weak, but significant resistance or toxicity. To identify the gene systems that contribute to resistance or toxicity we applied a heterologous screening technique, called Rapid Virulence Annotation (RVA), for anti-predation and toxicity mechanisms. Three cosmid libraries for P. syringae pv. aesculi, pv. tomato and pv. phaseolicola, of approximately 2000 cosmids each, were screened in the susceptible/non-toxic bacterium Escherichia coli against nematode, amoebae and an insect. A number of potential conserved and unique genes were identified which included genes encoding haemolysins, biofilm formation, motility and adhesion. These data provide the first multi-pathovar comparative insight to how plant pathogens cope with different predation pressures and infection of an insect gut and provide a foundation for further study into the function of selected genes and their role in ecological success.","authors":[{"name":"Federico Dorati"},{"name":"Glyn A Barrett"},{"name":"Maria Sanchez-Contreras"},{"name":"Tanya Arseneault"},{"name":"Mateo San José"},{"name":"David J Studholme"},{"name":"Jesús Murillo"},{"name":"Primitivo Caballero"},{"name":"Nicholas R Waterfield"},{"name":"Dawn L Arnold"},{"name":"Liz J Shaw"},{"name":"Robert W Jackson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acanthamoeba polyphaga"},{"word":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"word":"Galleria mellonella"},{"word":"Pseudomonas syringae"},{"word":"RVA"},{"word":"anti-predation"},{"word":"pathogen"},{"word":"rapid virulence annotation"}]},"article329":{"pmid":"29689455","title":"Impact of modified diamond-like carbon coatings on the spatial organization and disinfection of mixed-biofilms composed of Escherichia coli and Pantoea agglomerans industrial isolates.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This work investigated the effects of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on the architecture and biocide reactivity of dual-species biofilms mimicking food processing contaminants.

While SICON® reduced the short-term growth of E. coli in axenic conditions, both DLC surfaces increased the E. coli colonization in presence of P. agglomerans. However, both modified surfaces triggered a significantly higher log reduction of E. coli cells within mixed-species biofilms, thus the use of SICON® and SICAN surfaces may be a good approach to facilitate the disinfection process in critical areas of food processing plants.

In all three geometries considered, hypoxia at the biofilm-neutrophil interface or within the biofilm was predicted for a subset of plausible parameter values.

Evaluation of their antimicrobial properties and anti-biofilm activities.","date":"2018-09-20","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides, also called Host Defence Peptides (HDPs), are effectors of innate immune response found in all living organisms. In a previous report, we have identified by chemical fragmentation, and characterized the first cryptic antimicrobial peptide in PD-L4, a type 1 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) from leaves of Phytolacca dioica L. We applied a recently developed bioinformatic approach to a further member of the differently expressed pool of type 1 RIPs from P. dioica (PD-L1/2), and identified two novel putative cryptic HDPs in its N-terminal domain. These two peptides, here named IKY31 and IKY23, exhibit antibacterial activities against planktonic bacterial cells and, interestingly, significant anti-biofilm properties against two Gram-negative strains. Here, we describe that PD-L1/2 derived peptides are able to induce a strong dose-dependent reduction in biofilm biomass, affect biofilm thickness and, in the case of IKY31, interfere with cell-to-cell adhesion, likely by affecting biofilm structural components. In addition to these findings, we found that both PD-L1/2 derived peptides are able to assume stable helical conformations in the presence of membrane mimicking agents (SDS and TFE) and intriguingly beta structures when incubated with extracellular bacterial wall components (LPS and alginate). Overall, the data collected in this work provide further evidence of the importance of cryptic peptides derived from type 1 RIPs in host/pathogen interactions, especially under pathophysiological conditions induced by biofilm forming bacteria. This suggests a new possible role of RIPs as precursors of antimicrobial and anti-biofilm agents, likely released upon defensive proteolytic processes, which may be involved in plant homeostasis.","authors":[{"name":"Elio Pizzo"},{"name":"Katia Pane"},{"name":"Andrea Bosso"},{"name":"Nicola Landi"},{"name":"Sara Ragucci"},{"name":"Rosita Russo"},{"name":"Rosa Gaglione"},{"name":"Marcelo D T Torres"},{"name":"Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez"},{"name":"Angela Arciello"},{"name":"Alberto Di Donato"},{"name":"Eugenio Notomista"},{"name":"Antimo Di Maro"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Circular dichroism"},{"word":"Phytolacca dioica"},{"word":"Ribosome inactivating proteins"}]},"article348":{"pmid":"29684195","title":"A confocal microscopy based method to monitor extracellular pH in fungal biofilms.","date":"2019-04-03","abs":"pH in fungal biofilms is important for a variety of fungal infections and industrial applications involving fungal biofilms, but to date, it has never been measured directly inside the biofilm matrix.

As a proof of concept, pH developments at the biofilm-substratum interface were monitored for 1 h after exposure to glucose. Observed pH drops differed considerably between the different species and also between replicate biofilms of the same species. Candida albicans biofilms showed the highest acidogenicity, with pH drops occurring much faster than in planktonic culture. pH ratiometry with C-SNARF-4 is a valuable tool to get insight into fungal biofilm metabolism and may shed new light on both disease-related and industrially relevant processes in fungal biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Schlafer"},{"name":"Anja Kamp"},{"name":"Javier E Garcia"}],"keywords":[]},"article349":{"pmid":"29684116","title":"Biofilm-forming ability and infection potential of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from animals and humans.","date":"2018-10-08","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been amongst the top 10 'superbugs' worldwide and is causing infections with poor outcomes in both humans and animals.

The production, modification, and export of PNAG in Escherichia coli and Bordetella species require the protein products encoded by the pgaABCD operon. PgaB is a two-domain periplasmic protein that contains an N-terminal deacetylase domain and a C-terminal PNAG binding domain that is critical for export. However, the exact function of the PgaB C-terminal domain remains unclear. Herein, we show that the C-terminal domains of Bordetella bronchiseptica PgaB (PgaBBb) and E. coli PgaB (PgaBEc) function as glycoside hydrolases. These enzymes hydrolyze purified deacetylated PNAG (dPNAG) from Staphylococcus aureus, disrupt PNAG-dependent biofilms formed by Bordetella pertussis, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and E. coli, and potentiate bacterial killing by gentamicin. Furthermore, we found that PgaBBb was only able to hydrolyze PNAG produced in situ by the E. coli PgaCD synthase complex when an active deacetylase domain was present. Mass spectrometry analysis of the PgaB-hydrolyzed dPNAG substrate showed a GlcN-GlcNAc-GlcNAc motif at the new reducing end of detected fragments. Our 1.76 Å structure of the C-terminal domain of PgaBBb reveals a central cavity within an elongated surface groove that appears ideally suited to recognize the GlcN-GlcNAc-GlcNAc motif. The structure, in conjunction with molecular modeling and site directed mutagenesis led to the identification of the dPNAG binding subsites and D474 as the probable catalytic acid. This work expands the role of PgaB within the PNAG biosynthesis machinery, defines a new glycoside hydrolase family GH153, and identifies PgaB as a possible therapeutic agent for treating PNAG-dependent biofilm infections.","authors":[{"name":"Dustin J Little"},{"name":"Roland Pfoh"},{"name":"François Le Mauff"},{"name":"Natalie C Bamford"},{"name":"Christina Notte"},{"name":"Perrin Baker"},{"name":"Manita Guragain"},{"name":"Howard Robinson"},{"name":"Gerald B Pier"},{"name":"Mark Nitz"},{"name":"Rajendar Deora"},{"name":"Donald C Sheppard"},{"name":"P Lynne Howell"}],"keywords":[]},"article351":{"pmid":"29683648","title":"Fabrication and Release Behavior of Microcapsules with Double-Layered Shell Containing Clove Oil for Antibacterial Applications.","date":"2019-02-28","abs":"In this study, double-layer polyurethane/poly(urea-formaldehyde) (PU/PUF) shell microcapsules containing clove oil with antibacterial properties were successfully synthesized via in situ and interfacial polymerization reactions in an oil-in-water emulsion.

This observation left some open questions about the whole behavior of the CoDiRO strain and its actual role in OQDS pathogenesis. In order to evaluate the extent of bacterial infection in olive trees and the role of bacterial aggregates in vessel occlusions, we tested a specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe (KO 210) for X. fastidiosa and quantified the level of infection and vessel occlusion in both petioles and branches of naturally infected and non-infected olive trees. All symptomatic petioles showed colonization by X. fastidiosa, especially in the larger innermost vessels. In several cases, the vessels appeared completely occluded by a biofilm containing bacterial cells and extracellular matrix and the frequent colonization of adjacent vessels suggested a horizontal movement of the bacteria. Infected symptomatic trees had 21.6 ± 10.7% of petiole vessels colonized by the pathogen, indicating an irregular distribution in olive tree xylem. Thus, our observations point out the primary role of the pathogen in olive vessel occlusions.

First, susceptibility tests were performed on 49 isolates of L. monocytogenes with selected antibiotics. Next, we tested DNA of suspected isolates for the presence of resistance genes in both planktonic cells and the eDNA of biofilms. Finally, fluorescent confocal microscopy was used to observe the eDNA pattern of selected isolates under conditions that mimicked the food processing environment and the human body. Susceptibility tests found isolates intermediate resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin as well as isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin. For all suspected isolates, PCR confirmed the presence of the gene lde encoding efflux pump in both types of DNA. When the biofilm was observed using confocal laser scanning microscope, the eDNA distribution patterns varied considerably according to the culture conditions. Furthermore, the food and clinical isolates varied in terms of the amount of eDNA detected. The presence of an efflux pump in both types of DNA suggests that the eDNA might serve as a reservoir of resistance genes. Surprising differences were observed in the eDNA pattern.

In streams, phototrophic biofilms dominate benthic microbial life and harbour an immense prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial biodiversity with biotic interactions across domains and trophic levels. Here, we examine how community structure and function of these biofilms respond to varying light availability, as the crucial energy source for phototrophic biofilms. Using metatranscriptomics, we found that under light limitation-dominant phototrophs, including diatoms and cyanobacteria, displayed a remarkable plasticity in their photosynthetic machinery manifested as higher abundance of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involved in photosynthesis and chloroplast ribosomal RNA. Under higher light availability, bacterial mRNAs involved in phosphorus metabolism, mainly from Betaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, increased, likely compensating for nutrient depletion in thick biofilms with high biomass. Consumers, including diverse ciliates, displayed community shifts indicating preferential grazing on algae instead of bacteria under higher light. For the first time, we show that the functional integrity of stream biofilms under variable light availability is maintained by structure-function adaptations on several trophic levels. Our findings shed new light on complex biofilms, or microbial jungles, where in analogy to forests, diverse and multitrophic level communities lend stability to ecosystem functioning. This multitrophic level perspective, coupling metatranscriptomics to process measurements, could advance understanding of microbial-driven ecosystems beyond biofilms, including planktonic and soil environments.","authors":[{"name":"Mia M Bengtsson"},{"name":"Karoline Wagner"},{"name":"Clarissa Schwab"},{"name":"Tim Urich"},{"name":"Tom J Battin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"rRNA"},{"word":"diatoms"},{"word":"freshwater"},{"word":"mRNA"},{"word":"metatranscriptomics"},{"word":"microbial eukaryotes"}]},"article375":{"pmid":"29679078","title":"Fluorophore labeling of a cell-penetrating peptide significantly alters the mode and degree of biomembrane interaction.","date":"2019-11-04","abs":"The demand for highly efficient macromolecular drugs, used in the treatment of many severe diseases, is continuously increasing. However, the hydrophilic character and large molecular size of these drugs significantly limit their ability to permeate across cellular membranes and thus impede the drugs in reaching their target sites in the body. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) have gained attention as promising drug excipients, since they can facilitate drug permeation across cell membranes constituting a major biological barrier. Fluorophores are frequently covalently conjugated to CPPs to improve detection, however, the ensuing change in physico-chemical properties of the CPPs may alter their biological properties. With complementary biophysical techniques, we show that the mode of biomembrane interaction may change considerably upon labeling of the CPP penetratin (PEN) with a fluorophore. Fluorophore-PEN conjugates display altered modes of membrane interaction with increased insertion into the core of model cell membranes thereby exerting membrane-thinning effects. This is in contrast to PEN, which localizes along the head groups of the lipid bilayer, without affecting the thickness of the lipid tails. Particularly high membrane disturbance is observed for the two most hydrophobic PEN conjugates; rhodamine B or 1-pyrene butyric acid, as compared to the four other tested fluorophore-PEN conjugates.","authors":[{"name":"Sofie Fogh Hedegaard"},{"name":"Mohammed Sobhi Derbas"},{"name":"Tania Kjellerup Lind"},{"name":"Marina Robertnova Kasimova"},{"name":"Malene Vinther Christensen"},{"name":"Maria Høtoft Michaelsen"},{"name":"Richard A Campbell"},{"name":"Lene Jorgensen"},{"name":"Henrik Franzyk"},{"name":"Marité Cárdenas"},{"name":"Hanne Mørck Nielsen"}],"keywords":[]},"article376":{"pmid":"29678918","title":"Impact of Currently Marketed Tampons and Menstrual Cups on Staphylococcus aureus Growth and Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin 1 Production In Vitro.","date":"2019-09-25","abs":"Fifteen currently marketed intravaginal protection products (11 types of tampon and 4 types of menstrual cup) were tested by the modified tampon sac method to determine their effect on Staphylococcus aureus growth and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) production.

Therefore, µCT can be employed in clinical settings to predict the permeability of the biofilms.

The members which drive the concerned MENs are referred to as key drivers.","authors":[{"name":"Mengxuan Lyu"},{"name":"Jiaxing Chen"},{"name":"Yiqi Jiang"},{"name":"Wei Dong"},{"name":"Zhou Fang"},{"name":"Shuaicheng Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Delegated phenotype"},{"word":"Disease"},{"word":"Key driver"},{"word":"Microbiome"},{"word":"Molecular ecological network"}]},"article398":{"pmid":"29670843","title":"Bacteriophage Isolated from Sewage Eliminates and Prevents the Establishment of Escherichia Coli Biofilm.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Karla Veloso Gonçalves Ribeiro"},{"name":"Cleberson Ribeiro"},{"name":"Roberto Sousa Dias"},{"name":"Silvia Almeida Cardoso"},{"name":"Sergio Oliveira de Paula"},{"name":"Jose Cola Zanuncio"},{"name":"Leandro Licursi de Oliveira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocontrol"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"E. coli"},{"word":"Phage"}]},"article399":{"pmid":"29670380","title":"Emerging treatment options for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections: focus on intravenous delafloxacin.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The increase in hospitalization due to acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by resistant pathogens supports the need for new treatment options. Antimicrobial options for ABSSSI that provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-negative pathogens and multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are limited. Delafloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone available as intravenous and oral formulations and is characterized by an increased efficacy in acidic environments and activity on bacterial biofilm. Delafloxacin displays enhanced in vitro activity against MRSA, and enterococci, while maintaining efficacy against gram-negative pathogens and anaerobes. Delafloxacin has been studied for the treatment of ABSSSI and respiratory infections. Phase III studies have demonstrated noninferiority of delafloxacin compared to vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and the combination of vancomycin plus aztreonam in the treatment of ABSSSI. Due to its favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, the wide spectrum of action, and the potential for sequential therapy, delafloxacin represents a promising option in the empirical and targeted treatment of ABSSSI, both in hospital- and in community-based care.","authors":[{"name":"Elda Righi"},{"name":"Alessia Carnelutti"},{"name":"Antonio Vena"},{"name":"Matteo Bassetti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial skin and skin structure infections"},{"word":"delafloxacin"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"multidrug-resistant bacteria"}]}}
