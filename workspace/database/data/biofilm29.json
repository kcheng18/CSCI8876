Frequent dietary carbohydrate intake can lead to dysbiosis of the microbial community from overproduction of acid with selection for increases in acidogenic, acid-tolerant bacteria. Knowledge of the caries-associated microbiome is key in planning approaches to reverse the dysbiosis to achieve health. For risk assessment and treatment studies, it would be valuable to establish whether microbial monitoring requires assay of multiple species or whether selected key species would suffice. Early investigations of the oral microbiota relied on culture-based methods to determine the major bacteria in health and disease. Microbial monitoring using gene probes facilitated study of larger populations. DNA probe methods confirmed and expanded the importance of transmission of bacteria from mother to infant and association of preselected species, including mutans streptococci and lactobacilli with caries in larger populations. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) probes confirmed the wide diversity of species in oral and caries microbiomes. Open-ended techniques provide tools for discovery of new species, particularly when strain/clone identification includes gene sequence data. Anaerobic culture highlighted the caries association of Actinomyces and related species. Scardovia wiggsiae, in the Actinomyces/Bifidobacterium family, and several Actinomyces species have the cariogenic traits of acid production and acid tolerance. Next-generation sequencing combined with polymerase chain reaction methods revealed a strong association with mutans streptococci in a high caries population with poor oral hygiene and limited access to care. A population with a lower caries experience generally had lower or no Streptococcus mutans detection but harbored other acidogenic taxa in the microbiome. Study of the microbiome suggests a role for the assay of selected putative cariogenic species in more aggressive diseases. For many populations with caries progression, however, assay of multiple species will likely be warranted to determine the caries profile of the population and/or individuals under study.","authors":[{"name":"A C R Tanner"},{"name":"C A Kressirer"},{"name":"S Rothmiller"},{"name":"I Johansson"},{"name":"N I Chalmers"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Actinomyces"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"pediatric dentistry"},{"word":"risk assessment"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"29355411","title":"Potential Uses of Arginine in Dentistry.","date":"2019-02-01","abs":"Carious lesions develop in tooth surfaces where there is an imbalance of the processes of acid and alkali production by supragingival biofilms. Since low pH is the main driving factor in the development of carious lesions, most efforts to identify an effective anticaries therapy have focused on targeting the acid-producing bacteria and their mechanisms of acid production. An expanding area of oral microbiology has now been devoted to explore microbial metabolic activities that help to neutralize biofilm pH and thus inhibit the caries process. Arginine metabolism via the arginine deiminase pathway (ADS) produces alkali in the form of ammonia that counteracts the effects of biofilm acidification from bacterial glycolysis. ADS also functions as an adaptive strategy used by certain bacteria to thrive in oral biofilms. Substantial evidence accumulated from laboratory and clinical observations supports the hypotheses that measurements of arginine metabolism via ADS may serve as an important caries risk assessment criterion and that providing arginine regularly to supragingival biofilms can be an effective therapy for caries intervention.

In oral health, a dynamic balance is reached between the host, the environment, and the microbiome. However, the frequent intake of sugar and/or reductions in saliva flow results in extended periods of low pH in the biofilm, which disrupts this symbiotic relationship. Such conditions inhibit the growth of beneficial species and drive the selection of bacteria with an acid-producing/acid-tolerating phenotype, thereby increasing the risk of caries (dysbiosis). A more detailed understanding of the interdependencies and interactions that exist among the resident microbiota in dental biofilms, and an increased awareness of the relationship between the host and the oral microbiome, is providing new insights and fresh opportunities to promote symbiosis and prevent dysbiosis. These include modifying the oral microbiome (e.g., with prebiotics and probiotics), manipulating the oral environment to selectively favor the growth of beneficial species, and moderating the growth and metabolism of the biofilm to reduce the likelihood of dysbiosis. Evidence is provided to suggest that the regular provision of interventions that deliver small but relevant benefits, consistently over a prolonged period, can support the maintenance of a symbiotic oral microbiome.","authors":[{"name":"P D Marsh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"dysbiosis"},{"word":"ecology"},{"word":"symbiosis"}]},"article4":{"pmid":"29355056","title":"Anti-inflammatory effects of trans-cinnamaldehyde on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage activation via MAPKs pathway regulation.","date":"2018-09-26","abs":"Inflammation is a primary response of the innate immune system against various infections.

S. epidermidis surface protein I (SesI) is considered to be the major virulence factor of S. epidermidis infection, but its pathogenesis is not clear. Here, we demonstrated that the prevalence of sesI among S. epidermidis invasive isolates (20.8%, 26/125) was significantly higher than that among colonizing isolates (3.8%, 4/106). The positive rates of biofilm-associated genes (aap, icaA, IS256) and resistance-associated genes mupA among the sesI-positive isolates were significantly higher than those among sesI-negative isolates (p < 0.05). And antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the resistance rates of sesI-positive isolates to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were significantly higher than those among sesI-negative isolates. Interestingly, 80.8% (21/26) of sesI-positive isolates belong to ST2 determined by MLST, while ST2 was not found among any of the 99 sesI-negative invasive isolates, indicating that there is a strong association between carriage of sesI and ST2 clone. In order to further study the role of sesI gene in pathogenesis, the sesI gene mutant (S. epidermidis RP62AΔsesI) and complementary expression strain (S. epidermidis RP62AΔsesI-C) were successfully constructed. All experimental data indicated that sesI may promote S. epidermidis to adhere and aggregate, but it had no obvious effect on the mature stage of biofilm formation.

Among biofilm-forming strains the highest autoaggregation index was observed for Mycobacterium brumae and Bacillus alcalophilus. Noteworthy, that some strains capable of biofilm formation showed no aggregation abilities or were characterized by low autoaggregative properties. The results of visual autoaggregation assay showed no visible flocs after given time of incubation. The results from motility test demonstrated that most of the analyzed strains were motile.

The kinetics of biofilm formation were evaluated for the isolates for 144 h. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs), and biofilm removal activities for melittin and combinations with antibiotics were determined. Inhibition of biofilm-associated protein (bap) expression by melittin was evaluated with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used to visualize the effect of synergism on the inhibition of biofilm production. The geometric means of the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICi) for melittin-colistin, melittin-imipenem, and melittin-ciprofloxacin combinations were calculated as 0.31, 0.24, and 0.94, respectively.

This bacterium is frequently related to nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bacteriaemia especially in immunocompromised patients.

Biofilms are communities of microorganisms in which cells stick to each other and often adhere to a surface. These adherent cells are usually embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Pel, psl and alg operons present in P. aeruginosa are responsible for the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharide which plays an important role in cell surface interactions during biofilm formation. Recent studies suggested that cAMP signalling pathway, quorum-sensing pathway, Gac/Rsm pathway and c-di-GMP signalling pathway are the main mechanism that leads to the biofilm formation. Understanding the bacterial virulence depends on a number of cell-associated and extracellular factors and is very essential for the development of potential drug targets. Thus, the review focuses on the major genes involved in the biofilm formation, the state of art update on the biofilm treatment and the dispersal approaches such as targeting adhesion and maturation, targeting virulence factors and other strategies such as small molecule-based inhibitors, phytochemicals, bacteriophage therapy, photodynamic therapy, antimicrobial peptides and natural therapies and vaccines to curtail the biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Sinosh Skariyachan"},{"name":"Vaishnavi Sneha Sridhar"},{"name":"Swathi Packirisamy"},{"name":"Supreetha Toplar Kumargowda"},{"name":"Sneha Basavaraj Challapilli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alginate"},{"word":"Biofilm dispersal"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"Gac/Rsm pathway"},{"word":"Pel"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Psl"},{"word":"Quorum-sensing pathway"},{"word":"Treatment advancement"},{"word":"c-di-GMP signalling pathway"}]},"article15":{"pmid":"29352083","title":"Polyphosphate-Accumulating Bacteria: Potential Contributors to Mineral Dissolution in the Oral Cavity.","date":"2019-08-02","abs":"Bacteria that accumulate polyphosphates have previously been shown to dynamically influence the solubility of phosphatic minerals in marine settings and wastewater.

Metal(loid) excess is a constraint for plant establishment and development, and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) mitigate plant stress under these conditions. However, mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. The effect of toxic metal(loid)s on activity and gene expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes in roots of the halophyte Spartina densiflora grown on real polluted sediments in a greenhouse experiment was investigated. Sediments of the metal-polluted joint estuary of Tinto and Odiel rivers and control, unpollutred samples from the Piedras estuary were collected and submitted to ICP-OES. Seeds of S. densiflora were collected from the polluted Odiel marshes and grown in polluted and unpolluted sediments. Rhizophere biofilm-forming bacteria were selected based on metal tolerance and inoculated to S. densiflora and grown for 4 months. Fresh or frozen harvested plants were used for enzyme assays and gene expression studies, respectively. Metal excess induced SOD (five-fold increase), whereas CAT and ascorbate peroxidase displayed minor induction (twofold). A twofold increase of TBARs indicated membrane damage. Our results showed that metal-resistant PGPR (P. agglomerans RSO6 and RSO7 and B. aryabhattai RSO25) contributed to alleviate metal stress, as deduced from lower levels of all antioxidant enzymes to levels below those of non-exposed plants.

Three concentrations w/v of Manuka honey (40%, 60% and 80%) were used, each one at 24, 48 and 72 hours. The most effective concentration (80% w/v) was repeated on two sets of gallstones. Biofilm mass was re quantified by crystal violet assay and was examined by scanning electron microscope. S. typhi formed uniform biofilm on cholesterol gallstone surface. The optical density measurements exhibited a rising pattern with time thereby indicating an increase in biofilm mass. It was 0.2 on day 1 and 0.9 on day 12. With 80% w/v Manuka honey, biofilm mass decreased most effectively with 0.5 OD after 72 hours. Biofilm formation by S, typhi on gallstones is surface specific and bile dependant. Either increasing the duration (beyond 72 hours) of the effective concentration (80% w/v) of honey or increasing the concentration (above 80%) of honey for a specific duration (72 hour) may cause complete disruption of the S. typhi biofilm on gallstone.

EPS are formed by the bacteria in their late exponential or stationary phase of growth under special situations for specific purposes. They take part in the formation of bacterial biofilms. There is a great diversity in the types of EPS. Strikingly enough, a same species of bacterium can produce different types of EPS under different situations. The importance of EPS is largely because of their different applications in various industries. Now that the bacterial EPS has got the potentiality to become an upcoming tool in various futuristic applications of human benefit, the focus currently develops towards how better they can be produced in the laboratory by promoting the favorable factors for their production. While studying with different EPS forming bacteria, both the intrinsic factors like genetic configuration of the bacteria and the extrinsic factors like culture conditions under the influence of different physico-chemical parameters in order to maximize the EPS production have been taken into consideration. Both the factors have proved their worth. Hence, towards a better outcome for EPS production, it is indicated that a genetic manipulation of the bacteria should be synchronized with a proper selection of its culture condition by controlling different physico-chemical parameters.","authors":[{"name":"Dipanjan Sengupta"},{"name":"Sriparna Datta"},{"name":"Dipa Biswas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Culture conditions"},{"word":"Exopolysaccharides (EPS)"},{"word":"Genetic manipulation"},{"word":"Physico-chemical parameters"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"}]},"article49":{"pmid":"29343818","title":"A surfactant polymer dressing potentiates antimicrobial efficacy in biofilm disruption.","date":"2019-03-12","abs":"A 100% water-soluble surfactant polymer dressing (SPD) that is bio-compatible and non-ionic has been reported to improve wound closure in preliminary clinical studies.

The objective of this study was to characterize the mechanism of action of SPD inhibition of bacterial biofilm development.

Here, we show that wood falls are converted into sulfidic hotpots, before the colonization by xylophagaid bivalves. Less than a month after immersion at a depth of 520 m in oxygenated seawater the sulfide concentration increased to millimolar levels inside immersed logs. From in situ experiments combining high-frequency chemical and video monitoring, we document the rapid development of a microbial sulfur biofilm at the surface of wood. These findings highlight the fact that sulfide is initially produced from the labile components of wood and supports chemosynthesis as an early pathway of energy transfer to deep-sea wood colonists, as suggested by recent aquarium studies. The study furthermore reveals that woodborers promote sulfide-oxidation at the periphery of their burrows, thus, not only facilitating the development of sulfidic zones in the surrounding of degraded wood falls, but also governing sulfur-cycling within the wood matrix.","authors":[{"name":"D Kalenitchenko"},{"name":"E Péru"},{"name":"L Contreira Pereira"},{"name":"C Petetin"},{"name":"P E Galand"},{"name":"N Le Bris"}],"keywords":[]},"article51":{"pmid":"29343729","title":"Drug self-assembly for synthesis of highly-loaded antimicrobial drug-silica particles.","date":"2019-01-17","abs":"Antimicrobial drug release from biomaterials for orthopedic repair and dental restorations can prevent biofilm growth and caries formation.

We assessed competitive interaction between S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in biofilm cultured for 24-72 h and bacterial aggregates analogous to those observed in early (<24 h) biofilm formation, and interaction with human keratinocytes. We observed that S. aureus predominated in biofilm and non-attached bacterial aggregates, acting as a pioneer for the attachment of P. aeruginosa. We report for the first time that S. aureus mediates a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the attachment of P. aeruginosa to human keratinocytes, and that P. aeruginosa promotes an invasive phenotype in S. aureus. We show that co-infected keratinocytes exhibit an intermediate inflammatory response concurrent with impaired wound closure that is in keeping with a sustained proinflammatory response which allows for persistent microbial colonisation.

We previously demonstrated that indole, a microbial metabolite of tryptophan, reduces enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 attachment to intestinal epithelial cells and biofilm formation, suggesting that indole may be an effector/attenuator of colonization for a number of enteric pathogens. Here, we report that indole attenuates Salmonella Typhimurium (Salmonella) virulence and invasion as well as increases resistance to colonization in host cells. Indole-exposed Salmonella colonized mice less effectively compared to solvent-treated controls, as evident by competitive index values less than 1 in multiple organs. Indole-exposed Salmonella demonstrated 160-fold less invasion of HeLa epithelial cells and 2-fold less invasion of J774A.1 macrophages compared to solvent-treated controls. However, indole did not affect Salmonella intracellular survival in J774A.1 macrophages suggesting that indole primarily affects Salmonella invasion. The decrease in invasion was corroborated by a decrease in expression of multiple Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 (SPI-1) genes. We also identified that the effect of indole was mediated by both PhoPQ-dependent and independent mechanisms. Indole also synergistically enhanced the inhibitory effect of a short chain fatty acid cocktail on SPI-1 gene expression. Lastly, indole-treated HeLa cells were 70% more resistant to Salmonella invasion suggesting that indole also increases resistance of epithelial cells to colonization. Our results demonstrate that indole is an important microbiota metabolite that has direct anti-infective effects on Salmonella and host cells, revealing novel mechanisms of pathogen colonization resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Nandita Kohli"},{"name":"Zeni Crisp"},{"name":"Rebekah Riordan"},{"name":"Michael Li"},{"name":"Robert C Alaniz"},{"name":"Arul Jayaraman"}],"keywords":[]},"article57":{"pmid":"29342119","title":"Novel Hybrid Formulations Based on Thiourea Derivatives and Core@Shell Fe₃O₄@C","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The continuously increasing global impact of fungal infections is requiring the rapid development of novel antifungal agents.

Additionally, PL patches exhibited an antibacterial effect by preventing the adhesion, proliferation and biofilm formation by S. aureus, a common pathogen in orthopaedic surgical site infections. Furthermore, these patches supported the activity of human tendon-derived cells (hTDCs). Cells were able to proliferate over time and an up-regulation of tenogenic genes (SCX, COL1A1 and TNC) was observed, suggesting that PL patches may modify the behavior of hTDCs. Accordingly, hTDCs deposited tendon-related extracellular matrix proteins, namely collagen type I and tenascin C. In summary, PL patches can act as a reservoir of biomolecules derived from PL and support the activity of native tendon cells, being proposed as bioinstructive patches for tendon regeneration.","authors":[{"name":"Raquel Costa-Almeida"},{"name":"Albina R Franco"},{"name":"Tamagno Pesqueira"},{"name":"Mariana B Oliveira"},{"name":"Pedro S Babo"},{"name":"Isabel B Leonor"},{"name":"João F Mano"},{"name":"Rui L Reis"},{"name":"Manuela E Gomes"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial efficacy"},{"word":"Controlled release"},{"word":"Endogenous regeneration"},{"word":"Tendon patch"},{"word":"Tenogenic genes"}]},"article59":{"pmid":"29341381","title":"Effect of ethanol on the antimicrobial properties of chlorhexidine over oral biofilm.","date":"2018-08-24","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 95% ethanol irrigation, with 5 or 10 min of action, on the antibacterial properties of 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), on oral biofilm, evaluated with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).

We have characterized the outcome of the interaction of two minerals, birnessite and kaolinite, with two disaccharides, cellobiose and trehalose. These results show that birnessite reacts with and degrades the carbohydrates, while kaolinite does not. The reaction of disaccharides with birnessite produces Mn(II), indicating that degradation of the disaccharides is the result of their oxidation by birnessite. Furthermore, we find that both sugars can inhibit the degradation of a model protein by birnessite, demonstrating that the presence of one organic constituent can impact abiotic degradation of another. Therefore, both the reactivity of the mineral matrix and the presence of certain organic constituents influence the outcomes of abiotic degradation.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this work, we have investigated the interactions between the host, the microbiome, and chemotherapeutic treatments in more detail. The effect of 5-fluorouracil, commonly inducing mucositis, was assessed on a co-culture model that consists of an epithelial cell layer and a biofilm derived from oral microbiota from different types of samples (saliva, buccal swabs and tongue swabs) and donors (healthy individuals and patients suffering from mucositis). After 24 h co-incubation, all oral microbial samples were found to reduce wound healing capacity with 26 ± 15% as compared with untreated condition. Compared with saliva and tongue samples, buccal samples were characterized by lower bacterial cell counts and hence higher wound healing capacity. For samples from healthy individuals, an inverse correlation was observed between bacterial cell counts and wound healing capacity, whereas for patients suffering from mucositis no correlation was observed. Moreover, patient-derived samples had a less diverse microbial community and higher abundances of pathogenic genera. No major impact of 5-fluorouracil on wound healing capacity or the composition of the microbiome was seen at physiologically relevant concentrations in the mouth. In conclusion, bacterial cell count is inversely correlated with wound healing capacity, which emphasizes the importance of oral hygiene during oral wound healing in healthy individuals. However, future research on extra measures besides oral hygiene is needed to assure a good wound healing during mucositis, as for patients the bacterial composition seems also crucial. The direct effect of 5-fluorouracil on both the microbiome and wound healing is minimal, pointing to the importance of the host and its immune system in chemotherapy-induced microbial shifts. Impact statement Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis has a major impact on the quality of life of patients. The additional costs and treatment time associated with this pathology are significant. Although the pathology of the disease is well understood, the role and importance of oral microbiota currently are less clear. In this study, we focused on the effect of oral microbiota on wound healing, the final phase of oral mucositis, during 5-FU exposure. We show that the bacterial load and composition have a major impact on the healing process in contrast to 5-FU which only marginally slows down healing. This emphasizes the importance of good oral health care during oral mucositis to minimize bacterial load around the oral lesions. However, since we show that also the composition of the oral microbiome plays a role in wound recovery, the identification of specific pathogenic species or their metabolites might be worthwhile to allow proper treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Eline Vanlancker"},{"name":"Barbara Vanhoecke"},{"name":"Tom Sieprath"},{"name":"Janie Bourgeois"},{"name":"Annelore Beterams"},{"name":"Barbara De Moerloose"},{"name":"Winnok H De Vos"},{"name":"Tom Van de Wiele"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"chemotherapy"},{"word":"host–microbe interactions"},{"word":"in vitro model"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"oral mucositis"}]},"article71":{"pmid":"29338076","title":"Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, HIF1A and HIF2A, increase in aging mucosal tissues.","date":"2019-07-01","abs":"Hypoxia (i.e. oxygen deprivation) activates the hypoxia-signalling pathway, primarily via hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) for numerous target genes, which mediate angiogenesis, metabolism and coagulation, among other processes to try to replenish tissues with blood and oxygen. Hypoxia signalling dysregulation also commonly occurs during chronic inflammation. We sampled gingival tissues from rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta; 3-25 years old) and total RNA was isolated for microarray analysis. HIF1A, HIF1B and HIF2A were significantly different in healthy aged tissues, and both HIF1A and HIF3A were positively correlated with aging. Beyond these transcription factor alterations, analysis of patterns of gene expression involved in hypoxic changes in tissues showed specific increases in metabolic pathway hypoxia-inducible genes, whereas angiogenesis pathway gene changes were more variable in healthy aging tissues across the animals. With periodontitis, aging tissues showed decreases in metabolic gene expression related to carbohydrate/lipid utilization (GBE1, PGAP1, TPI1), energy metabolism and cell cycle regulation (IER3, CCNG2, PER1), with up-regulation of transcription genes and cellular proliferation genes (FOS, EGR1, MET, JMJD6) that are hypoxia-inducible. The potential clinical implications of these results are related to the epidemiological findings of increased susceptibility and expression of periodontitis with aging. More specifically the findings describe that hypoxic stress may exist in aging gingival tissues before documentation of clinical changes of periodontitis and, so, may provide an explanatory molecular risk factor for an elevated capacity of the tissues to express destructive processes in response to changes in the microbial biofilms characteristic of a more pathogenic microbial challenge.","authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey L Ebersole"},{"name":"Michael John Novak"},{"name":"Luis Orraca"},{"name":"Janis Martinez-Gonzalez"},{"name":"Sreenatha Kirakodu"},{"name":"Kuey C Chen"},{"name":"Arnold Stromberg"},{"name":"Octavio A Gonzalez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"aging"},{"word":"hypoxia"},{"word":"mucosal tissues"},{"word":"non-human primates"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article73":{"pmid":"29337088","title":"Cross-regulatory network in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm genes and TiO","date":"2018-02-09","abs":"A systems biology approach was used to study all the biofilm related genes of P. aeruginosa PAO1, and the interaction of titanium dioxide (TiO","authors":[{"name":"Rani Anupama"},{"name":"S Sajitha Lulu"},{"name":"Amitava Mukherjee"},{"name":"Subramanian Babu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Gene network"},{"word":"Protein interaction"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Titanium dioxide"}]},"article74":{"pmid":"29336882","title":"Histobacteriologic Conditions of the Apical Root Canal System and Periapical Tissues in Teeth Associated with Sinus Tracts.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"This histobacteriologic study described the pattern of intraradicular and extraradicular infections in teeth with sinus tracts and chronic apical abscesses.","authors":[{"name":"Domenico Ricucci"},{"name":"Simona Loghin"},{"name":"Lucio S Gonçalves"},{"name":"Isabela N Rôças"},{"name":"José F Siqueira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Apical periodontitis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronic apical abscess"},{"word":"endodontic infection"},{"word":"extraradicular infection"},{"word":"sinus tract"}]},"article75":{"pmid":"29336679","title":"Arcobacter butzleri Ciprofloxacin Resistance: Point Mutations in DNA Gyrase A and Role on Fitness Cost.","date":"2018-12-14","abs":"Arcobacter butzleri is a widely distributed emerging pathogen resistant to various classes of antimicrobial agents, namely fluoroquinolones.

No differences in growth kinetics were recorded between parental and mutant strains; however, fitness cost was variable, according to the genetic background of the strains, and independently of ciprofloxacin resistance. Overall, the ciprofloxacin resistance development did not significantly affect stress tolerance, motility, or biofilm-forming ability.

This pro-apoptotic effect of BG3 was only partially due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in C. albicans, as only twofold MIC and higher concentrations of BG3 caused depolarization of mitochondrial membrane which was accompanied by the decrease of the activity of fungal mitochondrial dehydrogenases, while the activity of oxidative stress response enzymes glutathione reductase and catalase was not significantly affected. BG3 showed synergistic activity with amphotericin B with a fractional inhibitory concentration index of 0.5. It also exerted low cytotoxicity and the ability to inhibit epithelial cell (TR146) invasion and damage by virulent C. albicans SC5314. With further developments, BG3 may further progress in the antifungal pipeline as a DNA-targeting agent.","authors":[{"name":"Jelena Lazić"},{"name":"Vladimir Ajdačić"},{"name":"Sandra Vojnovic"},{"name":"Mario Zlatović"},{"name":"Marina Pekmezovic"},{"name":"Selene Mogavero"},{"name":"Igor Opsenica"},{"name":"Jasmina Nikodinovic-Runic"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungal activity"},{"word":"Bis-guanylhydrazone"},{"word":"Candida spp."},{"word":"DNA interaction"},{"word":"ROS generation"},{"word":"Synergy"}]},"article95":{"pmid":"29330591","title":"Changes in the lipopolysaccharide of Proteus mirabilis 9B-m (O11a) clinical strain in response to planktonic or biofilm type of growth.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The impact of planktonic and biofilm lifestyles of the clinical isolate Proteus mirabilis 9B-m on its lipopolysaccharide (O-polysaccharide, core region, and lipid A) was evaluated.

However, the use of fluorescent markers, like green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mCherry, is limited by environmental constraints, such as oxygen availability and pH levels, that affect the correct maturation of their fluorophores. Few studies have characterized the effects of such environmental conditions in a systematic way, and the sheer amount of distinct protein variants requires each system to be examined in an individual fashion.

Heterogeneous phenotype development has been amply studied with respect to gene expression and genotypic changes, but 'biofilm genes' responsible for preprogrammed development of heterogeneous microenvironments in biofilms have never been discovered. Moreover, the question of what triggers the development of phenotypically heterogeneous microenvironments has never been addressed. The definition of biofilms as 'surface-adhering and surface-adapted' microbial communities contains the word 'surface' twice. This leads us to hypothesize that phenotypically heterogeneous microenvironments in biofilms develop as an adaptive response of initial colonizers to their adhering state, governed by the forces through which they adhere to a substratum surface. No surface is entirely homogeneous, while adhering bacteria can substantially contribute to stochastically occurring surface heterogeneity. Accordingly, bacterial adhesion forces sensed by initial colonizers differ across a substratum surface, leading to differential mechanical deformation of the cell wall and membrane, where many environmental sensors are located. Bacteria directly adhering to heterogeneous substratum domains therewith formulate their own local responses to their adhering state and command non-conformist behavior, leading to phenotypically heterogeneous microenvironments in biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Yijin Ren"},{"name":"Can Wang"},{"name":"Zhi Chen"},{"name":"Elaine Allan"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"}],"keywords":[]},"article115":{"pmid":"29325106","title":"Transcriptomic profiling of interacting nasal staphylococci species reveals global changes in gene and non-coding RNA expression.","date":"2019-09-12","abs":"Interspecies interactions between bacterial pathogens and the commensal microbiota can influence disease outcome.

Biofilm-forming activity, which is critical for C. albicans virulence, probably contributed to the dominance of antifungal sensitive isolates in hospital. Both in vitro membrane weighting and in vivo zebrafish egg infection assays were used to evaluate the biofilm-forming activity of DST659 and DST693 genotypes. Medical records of the patients infected by these two genotypes were retrospectively reviewed. High biofilm-forming activity of DST659 isolates was demonstrated in vitro and further proved with the zebrafish egg infection model, which showed a positive correlation between the biofilm-forming extent on chorion and the in vitro biofilm activity. Moreover, significantly less embryos survived when infected with DST659 isolates than those with DST693 (1.25% vs. 11.43%), and the high-biofilm subset of DST659 showed a greater reduction in survival of embryos at 48 h post-infection than the low-biofilm subset (0 vs. 1.92%). Patients infected with DST659 seemed to survive slightly worse than those infected with DST693, although the difference was insignificant. It is noteworthy that DST659-infected patients were associated with a higher incidence in renal insufficiency as compared to those with DST693, the low biofilm genotype. We suggest that a strong biofilm activity of DST659 contributed to a high mortality rate in zebrafish hosts and poor renal function in patients, as well as gaining the dominance in the northern Taiwan.","authors":[{"name":"Jang-Jih Lu"},{"name":"Hsiu-Jung Lo"},{"name":"Yen-Mu Wu"},{"name":"Jia-Yuan Chang"},{"name":"Yin-Zhi Chen"},{"name":"Shao-Hung Wang"}],"keywords":[]},"article117":{"pmid":"29324833","title":"Evidence for PMAT- and OCT-like biogenic amine transporters in a probiotic strain of Lactobacillus: Implications for interkingdom communication within the microbiota-gut-brain axis.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The ability of prokaryotic microbes to produce and respond to neurochemicals that are more often associated with eukaryotic systems is increasingly recognized through the concept of microbial endocrinology. Most studies have described the phenomena of neurochemical production by bacteria, but there remains an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms by which microbe- or host-derived neuroactive substances can be recognized by bacteria. Based on the evolutionary origins of eukaryotic solute carrier transporters, we hypothesized that bacteria may possess an analogous uptake function for neuroactive biogenic amines. Using specific fluorescence-based assays, Lactobacillus salivarius biofilms appear to express both plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT)- and organic cation transporter (OCT)-like uptake of transporter-specific fluorophores. This phenomenon is not distributed throughout the genus Lactobacillus as L. rhamnosus biofilms did not take up these fluorophores. PMAT probe uptake into L. salivarius biofilms was attenuated by the protonophore CCCP, the cation transport inhibitor decynium-22, and the natural substrates norepinephrine, serotonin and fluoxetine. These results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, for the existence of PMAT- and OCT-like uptake systems in a bacterium. They also suggest the existence of a hitherto unrecognized mechanism by which a probiotic bacterium may interact with host signals and may provide a means to examine microbial endocrinology-based interactions in health and disease that are part of the larger microbiota-gut-brain axis.","authors":[{"name":"Mark Lyte"},{"name":"David R Brown"}],"keywords":[]},"article118":{"pmid":"29324387","title":"A novel photoactive and three-dimensional stainless steel anode dramatically enhances the current density of bioelectrochemical systems.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This study reports a high-performance 3D stainless-steel photoanode (3D SS photoanode) for bioelectrochemical systems (BESs).

We develop a mathematical model for ooid growth, inspired by work on avascular brain tumours, that assumes mineralisation in a biofilm to form a central core which then nucleates the progressive growth of concentric laminations. The model predicts a limiting size with the sequential width variation of growth rings comparing favourably with those observed in experimentally grown ooids generated from biomicrospheres. In reality, this model pattern may be complicated during growth by syngenetic aggrading neomorphism of the unstable mineral phase, followed by diagenetic recrystallisation that further complicates the structure. Our model provides a potential key to understanding the genetic archive preserved in the internal structures of some ooids.","authors":[{"name":"Murray T Batchelor"},{"name":"Robert V Burne"},{"name":"Bruce I Henry"},{"name":"Fei Li"},{"name":"Josef Paul"}],"keywords":[]},"article124":{"pmid":"29322563","title":"Microfluidics-based LC-MS MRM approach for the relative quantification of Burkholderia cenocepacia secreted virulence factors.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen that is commonly isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

These clustered communities are often characterized by metabolic differentiation among their constituting cells as a result of heterogeneous environmental conditions in the cellular surroundings. This paper focuses on the role of metabolic differentiation due to oxygen gradients in the development of Escherichia coli cell communities, whereby low local oxygen concentrations lead to cellular secretion of weak acid products. For this reason, a metabolic model has been developed for the facultative anaerobe E. coli covering the range of aerobic, microaerobic, and anaerobic environmental conditions. This metabolic model is expressed as a multiparametric programming problem, in which the influence of low extracellular pH values and the presence of undissociated acid cell products in the environment has been taken into account. Furthermore, the developed metabolic model is incorporated in MICRODIMS, an in-house developed individual-based modeling framework to simulate microbial colony and biofilm dynamics. Two case studies have been elaborated using the MICRODIMS simulator: (i) biofilm growth on a substratum surface and (ii) submerged colony growth in a semi-solid mixed food product. In the first case study, the acidification of the biofilm environment and the emergence of typical biofilm morphologies have been observed, such as the mushroom-shaped structure of mature biofilms and the formation of cellular chains at the exterior surface of the biofilm. The simulations show that these morphological phenomena are respectively dependent on the initial affinity of pioneer cells for the substratum surface and the cell detachment process at the outer surface of the biofilm. In the second case study, a no-growth zone emerges in the colony center due to a local decline of the environmental pH. As a result, cellular growth in the submerged colony is limited to the colony periphery, implying a linear increase of the colony radius over time. MICRODIMS has been successfully used to reproduce complex dynamics of clustered microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Ignace L M M Tack"},{"name":"Philippe Nimmegeers"},{"name":"Simen Akkermans"},{"name":"Ihab Hashem"},{"name":"Jan F M Van Impe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"E. coli"},{"word":"biofilm dynamics"},{"word":"individual-based modeling"},{"word":"metabolomics"},{"word":"multiscale modeling"}]},"article127":{"pmid":"29321771","title":"Dual Regulation of Bacillus subtilis kinB Gene Encoding a Sporulation Trigger by SinR through Transcription Repression and Positive Stringent Transcription Control.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"It is known that transcription of kinB encoding a trigger for Bacillus subtilis sporulation is under repression by SinR, a master repressor of biofilm formation, and under positive stringent transcription control depending on the adenine species at the transcription initiation nucleotide (nt).

We first addressed the frequency of spontaneous mutations in two genes (lmo2549 and lmo2550) responsible for the GlcNAcylation in 93 serotype 1/2a strains that were mainly isolated from seafood industries. We studied the impact of mutations in lmo2549 or lmo2550 genes on biofilm formation by using one mutant carrying a natural mutation inactivating the lmo2550 gene (DSS 1130 BFA2 strain) and two EGD-e mutants that lack respective genes by in-frame deletion of lmo2549 or lmo2550 using splicing-by-overlap-extension PCR, followed by allelic exchange mutagenesis. The lmo2550 gene mutation, occurring in around 50% isolates, caused a decrease in bacterial adhesion to stainless steel compared to wild-type EGD-e strain during the adhesion step. On the other hand, bacterial population weren't significantly different after 24h-biofilm formation. The biofilm architecture was different between the wild-type strain and the two mutants inactivated for lmo2549 or lmo2550 genes respectively with the presence of bacterial micro-colonies for mutants which were not observed in the wild-type EGD-e strain biofilm. These differences might account for the stronger hydrophilic surface exhibited by the mutant cells. Upon a water flow or to a cleaning procedure at a shear stress of 0.16 Pa, the mutant biofilms showed the higher detachment rate compared to wild-type strain. Meanwhile, an increase in the amount of residual viable but non-culturable population on stainless steel was recorded in two mutants. Our data suggests that the GlcNAc residue of WTA played a role in adhesion and biofilm formation of Listeria monocyctogenes.","authors":[{"name":"Thomas Brauge"},{"name":"Christine Faille"},{"name":"Irina Sadovskaya"},{"name":"Alain Charbit"},{"name":"Thierry Benezech"},{"name":"Yang Shen"},{"name":"Martin J Loessner"},{"name":"Jean Romain Bautista"},{"name":"Graziella Midelet-Bourdin"}],"keywords":[]},"article139":{"pmid":"29320462","title":"Unsaturated Fatty Acids Affect Quorum Sensing Communication System and Inhibit Motility and Biofilm Formation of Acinetobacter baumannii.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The increasing threat of Acinetobacter baumannii as a nosocomial pathogen is mainly due to the occurrence of multidrug-resistant strains that are associated with the real problem of its eradication from hospital wards. The particular ability of this pathogen to form biofilms contributes to its persistence, increases antibiotic resistance, and promotes persistent/device-related infections. We previously demonstrated that virstatin, which is a small organic compound known to decrease virulence of Vibrio cholera via an inhibition of T4-pili expression, displayed very promising activity to prevent A. baumannii biofilm development. Here, we examined the antibiofilm activity of mono-unsaturated chain fatty acids, palmitoleic (PoA), and myristoleic (MoA) acids, presenting similar action on V. cholerae virulence. We demonstrated that PoA and MoA (at 0.02 mg/mL) were able to decrease A. baumannii ATCC 17978 biofilm formation up to 38% and 24%, respectively, presented a biofilm dispersing effect and drastically reduced motility. We highlighted that these fatty acids decreased the expression of the regulator abaR from the LuxIR-type quorum sensing (QS) communication system AbaIR and consequently reduced the N-acyl-homoserine lactone production (AHL). This effect can be countered by addition of exogenous AHLs. Besides, fatty acids may have additional non-targeted effects, independent from QS. Atomic force microscopy experiments probed indeed that PoA and MoA could also act on the initial adhesion process in modifying the material interface properties. Evaluation of fatty acids effect on 22 clinical isolates showed a strain-dependent antibiofilm activity, which was not correlated to hydrophobicity or pellicle formation ability of the tested strains, and suggested a real diversity in cell-to-cell communication systems involved in A. baumannii biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Marion Nicol"},{"name":"Stéphane Alexandre"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Luizet"},{"name":"Malena Skogman"},{"name":"Thierry Jouenne"},{"name":"Suzana P Salcedo"},{"name":"Emmanuelle Dé"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"myristoleic acid"},{"word":"palmitoleic acid"},{"word":"pellicle"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article140":{"pmid":"29319934","title":"Identification and functional characterization of type II toxin/antitoxin systems in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Type II toxin/antitoxin (TA) systems contribute to the formation of persister cells and biofilm formation for many organisms.

The identity of specific genes carrying out these functions is usually determined by single mutant genetic analysis. However, to understand how the individual genes/gene products function, it is necessary to determine how they interact with other components of the larger network; one approach to this is to use genetic interaction analysis. The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans regulates biofilm formation through an interconnected set of transcription factor hubs and is, therefore, an example of this type of complex network. Here, we describe experiments and analyses designed to understand how the C. albicans biofilm transcription factor hubs interact and to explore the role of network structure in its overall function. To do so, we analyzed published binding and genetic interaction data to characterize the topology of the network. The hubs are best characterized as a small world network that functions with high efficiency and low robustness (high fragility). Highly efficient networks rapidly transmit perturbations at given nodes to the rest of the network. Consistent with this model, we have found that relatively modest perturbations, such as reduction in the gene dosage of hub transcription factors by one-half, lead to significant alterations in target gene expression and biofilm fitness. C. albicans biofilm formation occurs under very specific environmental conditions and we propose that the fragile, small world structure of the genetic network is part of the mechanism that imposes this stringency.","authors":[{"name":"Virginia E Glazier"},{"name":"Damian J Krysan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Epistasis"},{"word":"Genetic networks"},{"word":"Transcription factors"}]},"article155":{"pmid":"29318048","title":"Evaluation of CAMP-Like Effect, Biofilm Formation, and Discrimination of Candida africana from Vaginal Candida albicans Species.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Candida africana as a species recovered from female genital specimens is highly close to C. albicans.

New strategies for disrupting the formation of the EPS matrix can therefore lead to a more efficient use of existing antimicrobials.

Our results suggest that RMF as an adjunct to antiseptic wound care can significantly improve antibiofilm activity, which has important translational potential for clinical applications.","authors":[{"name":"A F Junka"},{"name":"R Rakoczy"},{"name":"P Szymczyk"},{"name":"M Bartoszewicz"},{"name":"P P Sedghizadeh"},{"name":"K Fijałkowski"}],"keywords":[]},"article158":{"pmid":"29317704","title":"Biofilm Formation Protects Salmonella from the Antibiotic Ciprofloxacin In Vitro and In Vivo in the Mouse Model of chronic Carriage.","date":"2018-11-15","abs":"Typhoid fever is caused by the human-restricted pathogen Salmonella enterica sv.

This is believed to be caused by the inherent antibiotic resistance conferred by Salmonella biofilms growing on gallstones. The gallstone mouse model with S.

In this study, we test the hypothesis that the biofilm state confers Salmonella with the increased resistance to antibiotics observed in cases of chronic carriage. We found that, in the biofilm state, Salmonella is significantly more resistant to ciprofloxacin, a common antibiotic used for the treatment of Salmonella, both in vitro (p < 0.001 for both S.

The interactions between S. pneumoniae and S. aureus in the context of colonization and the transition to invasive disease have not been characterized. In this report, we show that S. pneumoniae and S. aureus form stable dual-species biofilms on epithelial cells in vitro When these biofilms are exposed to physiological changes associated with viral infection, S. pneumoniae disperses from the biofilm, whereas S. aureus dispersal is inhibited. These findings were supported by results of an in vivo study in which we used a novel mouse cocolonization model. In these experiments, mice cocolonized in the nares with both bacterial species were subsequently infected with influenza A virus. The coinfected mice almost exclusively developed pneumococcal pneumonia. These results indicate that despite our previous report that S. aureus disseminates into the lungs of mice stably colonized with these bacteria following influenza A virus infection, cocolonization with S. pneumoniae in vitro and in vivo inhibits S. aureus dispersal and transition to disease.

Given the pivotal role of EI in bacterial metabolism, an improved understanding of the mechanisms controlling its activity could inform future strategies for bioengineering and antimicrobial design. Here, we report an enzymatic assay, based on Selective Optimized Flip Angle Short Transient (SOFAST) NMR experiments, to investigate the effect of the small-molecule metabolite α-ketoglutarate (αKG) on the kinetics of the EI-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer reaction. We show that at experimental conditions favoring the monomeric form of EI, αKG promotes dimerization and acts as an allosteric stimulator of the enzyme. However, when the oligomerization state of EI is shifted toward the dimeric species, αKG functions as a competitive inhibitor of EI. We developed a kinetic model that fully accounted for the experimental data and indicated that bacterial cells might use the observed interplay between allosteric stimulation and competitive inhibition of EI by αKG to respond to physiological fluctuations in the intracellular environment.

In this study, the P. lactiflora extract was found to significantly reduce the initial stage of C. albicans biofilms from 12 clinical isolates by 38.4%. Thus, to assess the action mechanism, the effect of the P. lactiflora extract on the adhesion of C. albicans cells to polystyrene and germ tube formation was investigated using a microscopic analysis. The density of the adherent cells was diminished following incubation with the P. lactiflora extract in an acidic medium. Additionally, the P. lactiflora-treated C. albicans cells were mostly composed of less virulent pseudohyphae, and ruptured debris was found in the serum-containing medium. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that P. lactiflora downregulated the expression of C. albicans hypha-specific genes: ALS3 by 65% (p = 0.004), ECE1 by 34.9% (p = 0.001), HWP1 by 29.2% (p = 0.002), and SAP1 by 37.5% (p = 0.001), matching the microscopic analysis of the P. lactiflora action on biofilm formation.

A novel organotypic model of chemotherapy-induced mucositis was developed based on a human oral epithelial cell line and a fibroblast-embedded collagen matrix. Treatment of organotypic constructs with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) reproduced major histopathologic characteristics of oral mucositis, such as DNA synthesis inhibition, apoptosis and cytoplasmic vacuolation, without compromising the three-dimensional structure of the multilayer organotypic mucosa. Although structural integrity of the model was preserved, 5-FU treatment resulted in a widening of epithelial intercellular spaces, characterized by E-cadherin dissolution from adherens junctions. In a neutrophil transmigration assay we discovered that this treatment facilitated transport of neutrophils through epithelial layers. Moreover, 5-FU treatment stimulated key proinflammatory cytokines that are associated with the pathogenesis of oral mucositis. 5-FU treatment of mucosal constructs did not significantly affect fungal or bacterial biofilm growth under the conditions tested in this study; however, it exacerbated the inflammatory response to certain bacterial and fungal commensals.

Resolution of inflammation constitutes an active sequence of overlapping events mediated by specialized proresolving mediators, such as lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, which originate from the enzymatic conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). An unresolved acute inflammatory response results in chronic inflammation, which is a leading cause of several common pathological conditions. Periodontitis is a biofilm-induced chronic inflammatory disease, which results in loss of periodontal connective tissue and alveolar bone support around the teeth, leading to tooth exfoliation. An inadequate proresolving host response may constitute a mechanism explaining the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. An emerging body of clinical and experimental evidence has focused on the underlying molecular mechanisms of resolvins and particularly Resolvin E1 (RvE1) in periodontitis. Recently, RvE1 has been directly correlated with the resolution of inflammation in periodontal disease. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the literature regarding the role and possible mechanisms of action of RvE1 on different cell populations recruited in periodontal inflammation as well as its potential therapeutic implications.

In this study, community variability within microbial mats from the Camargue wetlands (Rhone Delta, southern France) were analyzed over 3 years during two different seasons (spring and autumn) and at different layers of the mat (0-2, 2-4, and 4-6 mm). To assess bacterial diversity in the mats, amplicons of the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. The community's functionality was characterized using two approaches: (i) inferred functionality through 16S rRNA amplicons genes according to PICRUSt, and (ii) a shotgun metagenomic analysis. Based on the reads distinguished, microbial communities were dominated by Bacteria (∼94%), followed by Archaea (∼4%) and Eukarya (∼1%). The major phyla of Bacteria were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria, which together represented 70-80% of the total population detected. The phylum Euryarchaeota represented ∼80% of the Archaea identified. These results showed that the total bacterial diversity from the Camargue microbial mats was not significantly affected by seasonal changes at the studied location; however, there were differences among layers, especially between the 0-2 mm layer and the other two layers. PICRUSt and shotgun metagenomic analyses revealed similar general biological processes in all samples analyzed, by season and depth, indicating that different layers were functionally stable, although some taxa changed during the spring and autumn seasons over the 3 years. Several gene families and pathways were tracked with the oxic-anoxic gradient of the layers. Genes directly involved in photosynthesis (KO, KEGG Orthology) were significantly more abundant in the top layer (0-2 mm) than in the lower layers (2-4 and 4-6 mm). In the anoxic layers, the presence of ferredoxins likely reflected the variation of redox reactions required for anaerobic respiration. Sulfatase genes had the highest relative abundance below 2 mm. Finally, chemotaxis signature genes peaked sharply at the oxic/photic and transitional oxic-anoxic boundary. This functional differentiation reflected the taxonomic diversity of the different layers of the mat.","authors":[{"name":"Mercedes Berlanga"},{"name":"Montserrat Palau"},{"name":"Ricardo Guerrero"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA amplicon sequencing"},{"word":"Camargue microbial mats"},{"word":"diversity"},{"word":"functionality"},{"word":"shotgun metagenome"}]},"article189":{"pmid":"29312270","title":"A Disulfide Bond in the Membrane Protein IgaA Is Essential for Repression of the RcsCDB System.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"IgaA is an integral inner membrane protein that was discovered as repressor of the RcsCDB phosphorelay system in the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

Envelope stress has also been reported to be sensed by a surface exposed domain of RcsF. These observations support a tight control of the RcsCDB system by RcsF and IgaA via mechanisms that, however, remain unknown. Interestingly, RcsF and IgaA have four conserved cysteine residues in loops exposed to the periplasmic space. Two non-consecutive disulfide bonds were shown to be required for RcsF function. Here, we report mutagenesis studies supporting the presence of one disulfide bond (C404-C425) in the major periplasmic loop of IgaA that is essential for repression of the RcsCDB phosphorelay.

This study investigated the genetic diversity, antimicrobial susceptibility, and biofilm formation of Cronobacter isolates (n = 40) recovered from spices and cereals in China during 2014-2015. Based on the fusA sequencing analysis, we found that the majority (23/40, 57.5%) of Cronobacter isolates in spices and cereals were C. sakazakii, while the remaining strains were C. dublinensis (6/40, 15.0%), C. malonaticus (5/40, 12.5%), C. turicensis (4/40, 10.0%), and C. universalis (2/40, 5.0%). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis produced 30 sequence types (STs) among the 40 Cronobacter isolates, with 5 STs (ST4, ST13, ST50, ST129, and ST158) related to neonatal meningitis. The pattern of the overall ST distribution was diverse; in particular, it was revealed that ST148 was the predominant ST, presenting 12.5% within the whole population. MLST assigned 12 isolates to 7 different clonal complexes (CCs), 4, 13, 16, 17, 72, 129, and 143, respectively. The results of O-antigen serotyping indicated that C. sakazakii serotype O1 and O2 were the most two prevalent serotypes. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the 40 Cronobacter isolates were susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested except for ceftriaxone, meropenem, and aztreona. Of the 40 Cronobacter strains tested, 13 (32.5%) were assessed as weak bioflim producers, one (2.5%) was a moderate biofilm producer, one (2.5%) was strong biofilm producer, and the others (62.5%) were non-biofilm producers. MLST and O-antigen serotyping have indicated that Cronobacter strains recovered from spices and cereals were genetically diverse. Isolates of clinical origin, particularly the C. sakazakii ST4 neonatal meningitic pathovar, have been identified from spices and cereals.

Chlorine disinfection significantly influenced the microbial community structure, while other treatment processes were synergetic. Bacterial communities in water and biofilms were distinct, and distinctions of bacterial communities also existed between different biofilms. By contrast, the functional composition of biofilms on different filters were similar. Some functional genes related to pollutant degradation were found widely distributed throughout the treatment processes. The distributions of Mycobacterium spp. and Legionella spp. in water and biofilms were revealed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Most bacteria, including potential pathogens, could be effectively removed by chlorine disinfection. However, some bacteria presented great resistance to chlorine. qPCRs showed that Mycobacterium spp. could not be effectively removed by chlorine. These resistant bacteria and, especially potential pathogens should receive more attention. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that turbidity, ammonia nitrogen and total organic carbon (TOC) exerted significant effects on community profiles. Overall, this study provides insight into variations of microbial communities in the treatment processes and aids the optimization of drinking water treatment plant design and operation for public health.","authors":[{"name":"Qi Li"},{"name":"Shuili Yu"},{"name":"Lei Li"},{"name":"Guicai Liu"},{"name":"Zhengyang Gu"},{"name":"Minmin Liu"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Liu"},{"name":"Yubing Ye"},{"name":"Qing Xia"},{"name":"Liumo Ren"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Illumina MiSeq sequencing"},{"word":"aquatic pathogens"},{"word":"chlorine resistant bacterial populations"},{"word":"drinking water treatment processes"},{"word":"function prediction"},{"word":"microbial community"}]},"article198":{"pmid":"29312161","title":"Glutathione Enhances Antibiotic Efficiency and Effectiveness of DNase I in Disrupting Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms While Also Inhibiting Pyocyanin Activity, Thus Facilitating Restoration of Cell Enzymatic Activity, Confluence and Viability.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Pyocyanin secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a virulence factor that damages epithelial cells during infection through the action of reactive oxygen species, however, little is known about its direct effect on biofilms.

Addition of DNase I and reduced glutathione (GSH) significantly reduced biofilm biomass of pyocyanin-producing strains (P < 0.05) compared to non-pyocyanin producers. Subsequently we showed that a combined treatment comprising: GSH + DNase I + antibiotic, disrupted and reduced biofilm biomass up to 90% in cystic fibrosis isolates AES-1R, AES-2, LESB58, and LES431 and promoted lung epithelial cell (A549) recovery and growth. We also showed that exogenously added GSH restored A549 epithelial cell glutathione reductase activity in the presence of pyocyanin through recycling of GSSG to GSH and consequently increased total intracellular GSH levels, inhibiting oxidative stress, and facilitating cell growth and confluence. These outcomes indicate that GSH has multiple roles in facilitating a return to normal epithelial cell growth after insult by pyocyanin.

Previously, we showed that many biofilm-forming bacteria preferentially spread in the direction of aligned and densely packed polysaccharide fibers in compressed substrates, a behavior we referred to as polymertropism. This arrangement of polysaccharide fibers is likely to be similar to that found in the slime trails deposited by many biofilm-forming bacteria and would explain previous observations that bacteria tend to follow these trails of polysaccharides. Here, we show that groups of cells or flares spread more rapidly on substrates containing aligned and densely packed polysaccharide fibers. Flares also persist longer, tend to hold their trajectories parallel to the long axes of polysaccharide fibers longer, and ultimately show an increase in displacement away from their origin. On the basis of these findings and others, we propose a model for polymertropism. Namely, we suggest that the packing of the aligned polymers increases the efficiency of surface spreading in the direction of the polymer's long axes; therefore, bacteria tend to spread more rapidly in this direction. Additional work suggests that bacteria can leverage polymertropism, and presumably more efficient surface spreading, for a survival advantage. In particular, when two bacterial species were placed in close proximity and in competition with each other, the ability of one species to move rapidly and directly away from the other by utilizing the aligned polymers of compressed agar substrates led to a clear survival benefit.","authors":[{"name":"David J Lemon"},{"name":"Derek A Schutzman"},{"name":"Anthony G Garza"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"elasticotaxis"},{"word":"polymertropism"}]},"article202":{"pmid":"29311276","title":"Species-Specific Interactions of Arr with RplK Mediate Stringent Response in Bacteria.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Bacteria respond to stressful growth conditions through a conserved phenomenon of stringent response mediated by synthesis of stress alarmones ppGpp and pppGpp [referred to as (p)ppGpp].

Determination of ibuprofen's in vitro antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia species strains through measurements of the endpoint number of CFU and growth kinetics showed that ibuprofen reduced the growth rate and bacterial burden of the tested strains in a dose-dependent fashion. In an in vitroPseudomonas biofilm model, a reduction in the rate of biomass accumulation over 8 h of growth with ibuprofen treatment was observed. Next, an acute Pseudomonas pneumonia model was used to test this antimicrobial activity after the oral delivery of ibuprofen. Following intranasal inoculation, ibuprofen-treated mice exhibited lower CFU counts and improved survival compared with the control animals. Preliminary biodistribution studies performed after the delivery of ibuprofen to mice by aerosol demonstrated a rapid accumulation of ibuprofen in serum and minimum retention in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Therefore, ibuprofen-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles (Ibu-NPs) were formulated to improve the pharmacokinetic profile. Ibu-NPs formulated for aerosol delivery inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro and may provide a convenient dosing method.

Based on our previous observations, we hypothesized that mucin, a glycoprotein secreted by lung epithelial cells, particularly during respiratory infections, significantly alters A. baumannii's physiology and its interaction with the surrounding environment. Biofilm, virulence and growth assays showed that mucin enhances the interaction of A. baumannii ATCC 19606T with abiotic and biotic surfaces and its cytolytic activity against epithelial cells while serving as a nutrient source. The global effect of mucin on the physiology and virulence of this pathogen is supported by RNA-Seq data showing that its presence in a low nutrient medium results in the differential transcription of 427 predicted protein-coding genes. The reduced expression of ion acquisition genes and the increased transcription of genes coding for energy production together with the detection of mucin degradation indicate that this host glycoprotein is a nutrient source. The increased expression of genes coding for adherence and biofilm biogenesis on abiotic and biotic surfaces, the degradation of phenylacetic acid and the production of an active type VI secretion system further supports the role mucin plays in virulence. Taken together, our observations indicate that A. baumannii recognizes mucin as an environmental signal, which triggers a response cascade that allows this pathogen to acquire critical nutrients and promotes host-pathogen interactions that play a role in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Emily J Ohneck"},{"name":"Brock A Arivett"},{"name":"Steven E Fiester"},{"name":"Cecily R Wood"},{"name":"Maeva L Metz"},{"name":"Gabriella M Simeone"},{"name":"Luis A Actis"}],"keywords":[]},"article210":{"pmid":"29308789","title":"Corrigendum: Successful treatment of biofilm infections using shock waves combined with antibiotic therapy.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"This corrects the article DOI: 10.1038/srep17440.","authors":[{"name":"Divya Prakash Gnanadhas"},{"name":"Monalisha Elango"},{"name":"S Janardhanraj"},{"name":"C S Srinandan"},{"name":"Akshay Datey"},{"name":"Richard A Strugnell"},{"name":"Jagadeesh Gopalan"},{"name":"Dipshikha Chakravortty"}],"keywords":[]},"article211":{"pmid":"29308671","title":"Synergistic and antibiofilm properties of ocellatin peptides against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2018-11-23","abs":"To test ocellatin peptides (ocellatins-PT2-PT6) for antibacterial and antibiofilm activities and synergy with antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Lucinda J Bessa"},{"name":"Peter Eaton"},{"name":"Anderson Dematei"},{"name":"Alexandra Plácido"},{"name":"Nuno Vale"},{"name":"Paula Gomes"},{"name":"Cristina Delerue-Matos"},{"name":"José Roberto Sa Leite"},{"name":"Paula Gameiro"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AMPs"},{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"ocellatin peptides"},{"word":"ocellatin-PT3"},{"word":"synergy"}]},"article212":{"pmid":"29308237","title":"Energy recovery from tubular microbial electrolysis cell with stainless steel mesh as cathode.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"In comparison to the transportation and storage of hydrogen, methane has advantages in the practical application, while the emerging product termed as 'biohythane' could be an alternative to pure hydrogen or methane in a new form of energy recovery from microbial electrolysis cell (MEC).

Antibiotic resistance pro ling demonstrated that 45/51 S. pseudintermedius isolates had a multi drug resistant (MDR) phenotype, exhibiting simultaneous resistance to at least 3 antibiotics categories; whereas 6 isolates showed a non-MDR phenotype. Thirty strains (59%) were resistant in oxacillin resistant screening agar, the same strains were also positive for mecA by PCR assay. All S. pseudintermedius isolates showed bio lm production by MtP method. Seventeen out of 51 isolates were classi ed as weakly adherent, 26 as moderately adherent, and 8 as strongly adherent. Moreover, no di erence in bio lm formation between meticillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) and meticillin-suscebtible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP) (P value > 0.05) was noted. The antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and bio lm formation could explain the di culty in treating S. pseudintermedius canine infections, chemotherapeutic failure, and consequently persistent infections.","authors":[{"name":"Valentina Stefanetti"},{"name":"Annalisa Bietta"},{"name":"Luisa Pascucci"},{"name":"Maria Luisa Marenzoni"},{"name":"Mauro Coletti"},{"name":"Maria Pia Franciosini"},{"name":"Fabrizio Passamonti"},{"name":"Patrizia Casagrande Proietti"}],"keywords":[]},"article219":{"pmid":"29306935","title":"Quaternized Zn(II) phthalocyanines for photodynamic strategy against resistant periodontal bacteria.","date":"2019-10-21","abs":"Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) has been featured as an effective strategy in the treatment of acute drug-resistant infections.

Here, we characterized V. cholerae genomic diversity at a micro-epidemiological level within and between individual patients from Bangladesh and Haiti. To capture within-patient diversity, we isolated multiple (8 to 20) V. cholerae colonies from each of eight patients, sequenced their genomes and identified point mutations and gene gain/loss events. We found limited but detectable diversity at the level of point mutations within hosts (zero to three single nucleotide variants within each patient), and comparatively higher gene content variation within hosts (at least one gain/loss event per patient, and up to 103 events in one patient). Much of the gene content variation appeared to be due to gain and loss of phage and plasmids within the V. cholerae population, with occasional exchanges between V. cholerae and other members of the gut microbiota. We also show that certain intra-host variants have phenotypic consequences. For example, the acquisition of a Bacteroides plasmid and non-synonymous mutations in a sensor histidine kinase gene both reduced biofilm formation, an important trait for environmental survival.

Las, RhI, and PQS, via natural quenchers is a new ray of hope for combating the persistent behavior of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the bacterial chemical vocabulary pyocyanin, N-AHLs and rhamnolipids are the main keywords, which are responsible for the social and nomadic behavior of P. aeruginosa. In the present work, LC-MS based real-time qualitative and quantitative analysis of pyocyanin, green phenazine, N-AHLs, and rhamnolipids were performed on P. aeruginosa PAO1. The quantitative analysis indicates that the production of pyocyanin and NHSLs increases with time while the production of rhamnolipids discontinued after 16 h. This indicates the emergence of persisters in the medium instead of planktonic cells. Rhamnolipids acting as a surfactant enhances the motility of the bacterial cells, whereas the pyocyanin is responsible for the biofilm formation. In a microtiter plate based assay, an effect of capsaicin and 6-gingerol was recorded. In the presence of capsaicin and 6-gingerol, a substantial decrease in the production of rhamnolipids, phenazine, quinolone, and N-AHLs was observed. Most interestingly, the 6-gingerol treatment led to a drastic decrease of rhamnolipids, phenazine, quinolone, and N-AHLs versus capsaicin. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the capsaicin and 6-gingerol on Las, PQS, and Rhl circuits in a bacterium in order to understand the persistent and social behavior. Here, we are reporting LC-MS/MS based qualitative and quantitative analysis of QS molecules by taking a low volume of culture (up to 200 μL).

Selenium bioavailability depends on its speciation in the soil environment, which is mainly influenced by the prevailing pH, redox potential, and organic matter content of the soil. The selenium cycle in the environment is primarily mediated through chemical and biological selenium transformations. Interactions of selenium with microorganisms and plants in the soil environment have been studied in order to understand the underlying interplay of selenium conversions and to develop environmental technologies for efficient bioremediation of seleniferous soils. In situ approaches such as phytoremediation, soil amendment with organic matter and biovolatilization are promising for remediation of seleniferous soils. Ex situ remediation of contaminated soils by soil washing with benign leaching agents is widely considered for removing heavy metal pollutants. However, it has not been applied until now for remediation of seleniferous soils. Washing of seleniferous soils with benign leaching agents and further treatment of Se-bearing leachates in bioreactors through microbial reduction will be advantageous as it is aimed at removal as well as recovery of selenium for potential re-use for agricultural and industrial applications.

UP-5, a novel penta-peptide, displayed significant antimicrobial activities against various standard and clinical isolates of MDRB. UP-5 displayed MICs values within the range of (10-15 μM) and (55-65 μM) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Furthermore, UP-5 displayed antibiofilm activity with minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) value as equal to twofold higher than MIC value. At the same inhibitory concentrations, UP-5 exhibited very low or negligible toxicity toward human erythrocytes and mammalian cells. Combining UP-5 with conventional antibiotics led to a synergistic or additive mode of action that resulted in the reduction of the MIC values for some of the antibiotics by 99.7% along a significant drop in MIC values of the peptide. The stability profile of UP-5 was evaluated in full mouse plasma and serum with results indicating a more stable pattern in plasma.

Analysis of other ϕKMV-like genomes revealed that spaninless lysis cassettes are a feature of phages infecting Acinetobacter within this subfamily of bacteriophages. The observed halo surrounding Petty's large clear plaques indicated the presence of a phage-encoded depolymerase capable of degrading capsular exopolysaccharides (EPS). The product of gene 39, a putative tail fiber, was hypothesized to possess depolymerase activity based on weak homology to previously reported phage tail fibers. The 101.4-kDa protein gene product 39 (gp39) was cloned and expressed, and its activity against Acinetobacter EPS in solution was determined. The enzyme degraded purified EPS from its host strain A. nosocomialis AU0783, reducing its viscosity, and generated reducing ends in solution, indicative of hydrolase activity.

This screen led to the identification of 50 mutants impaired in twitching ability due to transposon insertions into 20 different genes. Representative mutants with disruptions in these genes were further characterized. All mutants were compromised in their virulence in seed transmission and stem inoculation assays and had reduced biofilm formation ability relative to wild-type M6.

PCAE had the same effect for E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Both PC extracts were able to eliminate E. faecalis biofilms and only the PCHE eliminated P. aeruginosa biofilms. The positive controls inhibited the growth of all tested strains in MIC and MLC essays, but no CHX tested concentrations were able to eliminate A. israelii biofilm. PCAE caused a discrete increase in the edema over time, while PCHE caused a higher initial edema, which decreased progressively.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of peptidic drugs, such as peptide p1025, analogous to the fragments 1025-1044 of S. mutans cellular adhesin, responsible for the adhesion and formation of dental biofilm. However, peptides have physicochemical characteristics that may affect their biological action, limiting their clinical performance. Therefore, drug-delivery systems, such as a bioadhesive liquid-crystalline system (LCS), may be attractive strategies for peptide delivery. Potentiation of the action of LCS can be achieved with the use of bioadhesive polymers to prolong their residence on the teeth. In line with this, three formulations - polyoxypropylene-(5)-polyoxyethylene-(20)-cetyl alcohol, oleic acid, and Carbopol C974P in different combinations (F1C, F2C, and F3C) were developed to observe the influence of water in the LCS, with the aim of achieving in situ gelling in the oral environment. These formulations were assessed by polarized light microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, rheological analysis, and in vitro bioadhesion analysis. Then, p1025 and a control (chlorhexidine) were incorporated into the aqueous phase of the formulation (F + p1025 and F + chlorhexidine), to determine their antibiofilm effect and toxicity on epithelial cells. Polarized light microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering showed that F1C and F2C were LCS, whereas F3C was a microemulsion. F1C and F2C showed pseudoplastic behavior and F3C Newtonian behavior. F1C showed the highest elastic and bioadhesive characteristics compared to other formulations. Antibiofilm effects were observed for F + p1025 when applied in the surface-bound salivary phase. The p1025-loaded nanostructured LCS presented limited cytotoxicity and effectively reduced S. mutans biofilm formation, and could be a promising p1025-delivery strategy to prevent the formation of S. mutans dental biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Giovana Maria Fioramonti Calixto"},{"name":"Cristiane Duque"},{"name":"Kelly Limi Aida"},{"name":"Vanessa Rodrigues Dos Santos"},{"name":"Loiane Massunari"},{"name":"Marlus Chorilli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterium"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"formulation"},{"word":"liquid crystal"},{"word":"peptide"},{"word":"polymer"}]},"article250":{"pmid":"29295912","title":"Role of Heat Shock Proteases in Quorum-Sensing-Mediated Regulation of Biofilm Formation by Vibrio Species.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is essential for the dispersal of biofilms formed by the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus CPS production is induced by the quorum-sensing (QS) master regulator SmcR when biofilms mature.

Under nutritionally deficient conditions, where biofilm and pyoverdine are decoupled, PqsA is dispensable for pyoverdine production. Interestingly, although PqsA-dependent pyoverdine production does not rely upon Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) biosynthesis, exogenous PQS can also trigger biofilm-independent production of pyoverdine. Adding PQS rapidly induced planktonic cell aggregation. Moreover, these clumps of cells exhibit strong expression of pyoverdine biosynthetic genes and show substantial production of this siderophore.

This yeast has the ability to form biofilms which favors the persistence of the infection. Furthermore, the innate immune response has a critical role in the control of these infections and macrophages (Mø) are vital to this process. An important fungicidal mechanism employed by Mø involves the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI). The interaction between biofilms and these immune cells, and the contribution of oxidative and nitrosative stress, that is determinant to the course of the infection, remains elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate this interaction. To this purpose, two models of Mø-biofilms contact, early (model 1) and mature (model 2) biofilms, were used; and the production of ROS, RNI and the oxidative stress response (OSR) were evaluated. We found that the presence of Mø decreased the biofilm formation at an early stage and increased the production of ROS and RNI, with activation of ORS (enzymatic and nonenzymatic). On the other hand, the interaction between mature biofilms and Mø resulted in an increasing biofilm formation, with low levels of RNI and ROS production and decrease of OSR. Dynamic interactions between Mø and fungal biofilms were also clearly evident from images obtained by confocal scanning laser microscopy. The prooxidant-antioxidant balance was different depending of C. albicans biofilms stages and likely acts as a signal over their formation in presence of Mø.

An approach to overcome this reduced susceptibility is the use of antibiotic adjuvants, also known as potentiators. These are compounds that have little or no antibacterial effect on their own but increase the susceptibility of bacterial cells towards antimicrobial agents. Baicalin hydrate, previously described as a quorum sensing inhibitor, is such a potentiator that increases the susceptibility of Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 biofilms towards tobramycin. The goal of the present study is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the potentiating activity of baicalin hydrate and related flavonoids. We first determined the effect of multiple flavonoids on susceptibility of B. cenocepacia J2315 towards tobramycin. Increased antibiotic susceptibility was most pronounced in combination with apigenin 7-O-glucoside and baicalin hydrate. For baicalin hydrate, also other B. cepacia complex strains and other antibiotics were tested. The potentiating effect was only observed for aminoglycosides and was both strain- and aminoglycoside-dependent. Subsequently, gene expression was compared between baicalin hydrate treated and untreated cells, in the presence and absence of tobramycin. This revealed that baicalin hydrate affected cellular respiration, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species production in the presence of tobramycin. We subsequently showed that baicalin hydrate has an impact on oxidative stress via several pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, glucarate metabolism and by modulating biosynthesis of putrescine. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that the influence of baicalin hydrate on oxidative stress is unrelated to quorum sensing. Our data indicate that the potentiating effect of baicalin hydrate is due to modulating the oxidative stress response, which in turn leads to increased tobramycin-mediated killing.","authors":[{"name":"Lisa Slachmuylders"},{"name":"Heleen Van Acker"},{"name":"Gilles Brackman"},{"name":"Andrea Sass"},{"name":"Filip Van Nieuwerburgh"},{"name":"Tom Coenye"}],"keywords":[]},"article258":{"pmid":"29293434","title":"Activity of maltodextrin and vancomycin against staphylococcus aureus biofilm.","date":"2019-11-13","abs":"We aimed to assess the anti-biofilm activity of vancomycin, maltodextrin, and their combination against vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) strains based on an in vitro static model.

The majority of the literature considers stationary benthic biofilms and hyporheic biofilms to dominate uptake and processing of tDOC. Here, we argue for expanding this viewpoint to planktonic bacteria, which are transported downstream together with tDOC pulses, and thus perceive them as a less variable resource relative to stationary benthic bacteria. We show that pulse DOC can contribute significantly to the annual DOC export of streams and that planktonic bacteria take up considerable labile tDOC from such pulses in a short time frame, with the DOC uptake being as high as that of benthic biofilm bacteria. Furthermore, we show that planktonic bacteria efficiently take up labile tDOC which strongly increases planktonic bacterial production and abundance. We found that the response of planktonic bacteria to tDOC pulses was stronger in smaller streams than in larger streams, which may be related to bacterial metacommunity dynamics. Furthermore, the response of planktonic bacterial abundance was influenced by soluble reactive phosphorus concentration, pointing to phosphorus limitation. Our data suggest that planktonic bacteria can efficiently utilize tDOC pulses and likely determine tDOC fate during downstream transport, influencing aquatic food webs and related biochemical cycles.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Graeber"},{"name":"Jane Rosenstand Poulsen"},{"name":"Marlen Heinz"},{"name":"Jes J Rasmussen"},{"name":"Dominik Zak"},{"name":"Björn Gücker"},{"name":"Brian Kronvang"},{"name":"Norbert Kamjunke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Agricultural catchment"},{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Flood pulse"},{"word":"Hydrology"},{"word":"Terrestrial DOC"}]},"article262":{"pmid":"29291559","title":"Spatiotemporal changes in bacterial community and microbial activity in a full-scale drinking water treatment plant.","date":"2018-10-11","abs":"To gain insight into the bacterial dynamics present in drinking water treatment (DWT) systems, the microbial community and activity in a full-scale DWT plant (DWTP) in Guangzhou, South China, were investigated using Illumina Hiseq sequencing analyses combined with cultivation-based techniques during the wet and dry seasons. Illumina sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes revealed a large shift in the proportion of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes during the treatment process, with the proportion of Actinobacteria decreased sharply, whereas that of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes increased and predominated in treated water. Both microbial activity and bacterial diversity during the treatment process showed obvious spatial variation, with higher levels observed during the dry season and lower levels during the wet season. Clustering analysis and principal component analysis indicated dramatic shifts in the bacterial community after chlorination, suggesting that chlorination was highly effective at influencing the bacterial community. The bacterial community structure of finished water primarily comprised Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, and Acinetobacter, and interestingly showed high similarity to biofilms on granular activated carbon. Additionally, the abundance of bacterial communities was relatively stable in finished water and did not change with the season. A large number of unique operational taxonomic units were shared during treatment steps, indicating the presence of a diverse core microbiome throughout the treatment process. Opportunistic pathogens, including Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, Mycobacterium, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Legionella, Streptococcus and Enterococcus, were detected in water including finished water, suggesting a potential threat to drinking-water safety. We also detected bacteria isolated from each treatment step using the pure-culture method. In particular, two isolates, identified as Mycobacterium sp. and Blastococcus sp., which belong to the phylum Actinobacteria, were obtained from finished water during the dry season.

Proteins dominated the interactions between the EPS and the STZ and the EPS from a moving bed biofilm reactor exhibited the strongest interaction with the STZ. The EPS served as important reservoirs for the STZ and the tested biofilms all showed reduced sorption capacities for the STZ after the EPS were extracted. The respiratory rates and typical enzymatic activities were reduced after the EPS were extracted. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing results confirmed that the bacterial community in the biofilm without the EPS was more vulnerable to antibiotic shock as indicated by the community diversity and richness indices. A greater increase in the abundance of susceptible species was observed in the natural biofilm. The results comprehensively suggested that the EPS played important role in biosorption of STZ and alleviated the direct damage of the antibiotic to the cells; in addition the extent of the bacterial community response was associated with the origins of the biofilms.

This study aims to investigate the microbial community metabolic function of different types of CWs used to treat ibuprofen via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis. We studied the interactions between three CW designs (unsaturated, saturated and aerated) and six types of mesocosms (one unplanted and five planted, with Juncus, Typha, Berula, Phragmites and Iris) treating synthetic wastewater. Results show that the microbial activity and metabolic richness found in the interstitial water and biofilm of the unsaturated designs were lower than those of the saturated and aerated designs. Compared to other CW designs, the aerated mesocosms had the highest microbial activity and metabolic richness in the interstitial water, but similar levels of biofilm microbial activity and metabolic richness to the saturated mesocosms. In all three designs, biofilm microbial metabolic richness was significantly higher (p < .05) than that of interstitial water. Both the interstitial water and biofilm microbial community metabolic function were influenced by CW design, plant presence and species, but design had a greater influence than plants. Moreover, canonical correlation analysis indicated that biofilm microbial communities in the three designs played a key role in ibuprofen degradation. The important factors identified as influencing ibuprofen removal were microbial AWCD (average well color development), microbial metabolic richness, and the utilization of amino acids and amine/amides. The enzymes associated with co-metabolism of l-arginine, l-phenyloalanine and putrescine may be linked to ibuprofen transformations.

Key factors to achieving good results are a successful cleaning procedure and a method to check the cleanliness of milking equipment surfaces. Adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence is a fast and easy method for investigating bacterial contamination of surfaces. However, previous studies on the potential of ATP bioluminescence to assess the hygiene status of milking equipment have been hampered by lack of a validated test procedure. The aim of this work was therefore to establish a test procedure for assessing the cleanliness of milking equipment using ATP bioluminescence, and apply the method on-farm to study the hygiene status of aging rubber material in milking equipment. In developing the test procedure, the effects of sampling location in tubes and liners, sampling of dry versus wet barrels, milking point in the parlor, and acid or alkali detergent on ATP values were investigated. The results showed that, to obtain reproducible results, replicate sampling from the same milking points in the parlor is important. For milk tubes, samples should preferably be taken from the milk meter side, for liners on the inside of the barrel. For best results, sampling should be performed after use of alkali detergent. No beneficial effect was observed of sampling dry liner barrels, so sampling in the standardized test procedure is performed directly after cleaning. The standardized test procedure was used on 3 different commercial farms and sampling was initiated after replacement of old rubber parts. On one of the farms, additional sampling was performed to evaluate total bacteria count and determine the association with ATP level. The results suggest that, provided an efficient cleaning procedure is used, the hygiene quality of milking equipment can be maintained during the recommended lifetime of the rubberware. However, due to occasional variation in cleaning efficiency between milking points and liner barrels, random sampling on single occasions can lead to incorrect conclusions. Replicate sampling over time is therefore important for correct interpretation of ATP bioluminescence data. If ATP levels are very high, complementary sampling for total bacteria count should be used to verify that the level is due to bacterial contamination, and not other organic ATP-contributing material (e.g., milk residues).","authors":[{"name":"Ida Clemensson Lindell"},{"name":"Åse Lundh"},{"name":"Kerstin Svennersten Sjaunja"},{"name":"Marika Cederholm"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ageing rubber material"},{"word":"field study"},{"word":"milking equipment"},{"word":"standardized test procedure"}]},"article268":{"pmid":"29289920","title":"Achieving high-level nitrogen removal in mainstream by coupling anammox with denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation in a membrane biofilm reactor.","date":"2018-10-15","abs":"To achieve energy neutral wastewater treatment, mainstream anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) has attracted extensive attention in the past decade.

Invasive alien decapods were responsible for higher leaf litter decomposition than the native. In comparison with native crayfish, invasive alien crab and crayfish showed higher rates of litter consumption, increased production of smaller leaf fragments, fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) and dissolved organic carbon. Nutrients (ammonia and soluble reactive phosphorous) derived from excretion (measured separately in the absence of biofilms) varied among decapod species, being lower for P. leniusculus. However, nutrient concentrations did not vary among species in the detritivory experiments with biofilm, implying nutrients were utilised for biofilm production and respiration as no differences in biomass were evident among decapod treatments.

We studied epilithic diatom assemblages from the shallow margins of 19 lakes from three areas (coast-inland-ice sheet margin) along a climate gradient in Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland during two periods; shortly after ice-off (spring) and in the middle of the growth season (summer). We aimed to understand the distribution of Arctic epilithic diatoms in relation to water chemistry gradients during the two seasons, to investigate their incorporation into lake sediments and to assess their applicability as palaeoenvironmental indicators. Diatoms were correlated with nutrients in the spring and alkalinity/major ions in the summer, when nutrients were depleted; approximately half of the variance explained was independent of spatial factors. When categorised by functional attributes, diatom seasonal succession differed among regions with the most obvious changes in inland lakes where summer temperatures are warmer, organic nutrient processing is prevalent and silicate is limiting. These conditions led to small, motile and adnate diatoms being abundant in inland lakes during the summer (Nitzschia spp., Encyonopsis microcephala), as these functional attributes are suited to living within complex mats of non-siliceous microbial biofilms. Seasonal succession in silica-rich lakes at the coast was less pronounced and assemblages included Tabellaria flocculosa (indicating more acidic conditions) and Hannaea arcus (indicating input from inflowing rivers). The nitrogen-fixing diatom Epithemia sorex increased from the coast to the ice sheet, negatively correlating with a gradient of reactive nitrogen. The presence of this diatom in Holocene sediment records alongside cyanobacterial carotenoids during arid periods of low nitrogen delivery, suggests that it is a useful indicator of nitrogen limitation. Nitzschia species appear to be associated with high concentrations of organic carbon and heterotrophy, but their poor representation in West Greenland lake sediments due to taphonomic processes limits their palaeoenvironmental application in this region. Proportions of epilithic taxa in lake sediment records of coastal lakes increased during some wetter periods of the Holocene, suggesting that snowpack-derived nutrient delivery may offer diatom taxa living at lake margins a competitive advantage over planktonic diatoms during the moating ice melt period. Thus, further research investigating linkages between epilithic diatoms, snowpack and nutrient delivery in seasonally frozen lakes is recommended as these taxa live on the 'front-line' during the spring and may be especially sensitive to changes in snowmelt conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Suzanne McGowan"},{"name":"Hazel V Gunn"},{"name":"Erika J Whiteford"},{"name":"N John Anderson"},{"name":"Vivienne J Jones"},{"name":"Antonia C Law"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Arctic"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Climate"},{"word":"Nitrogen-limitation"},{"word":"Seasons"},{"word":"Snowmelt"},{"word":"Taphonomy"}]},"article274":{"pmid":"30956389","title":"Longitudinal distribution of macroinvertebrates in snowmelt streams in northeast Greenland: understanding biophysical controls.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"In a changing climate, Arctic streams are expected to show more influence from snowmelt, rainfall and groundwater, and less domination from glacial meltwater sources.

This study characterised longitudinal patterns of macroinvertebrate communities in snowmelt streams in northeast Greenland to provide novel insights into Arctic stream communities as dominant water sources shift with climate change. Benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables were sampled at three sites along five streams. Taxa diversity, evenness and abundance were expected to increase with distance from the stream source due to enhanced channel stability and warmer water temperature. This expectation for diversity and evenness was found in two streams, but abundance was up to ten times higher at the upstream sites compared to downstream, where biofilm biomass and ionic load were also highest. Here communities were largely dominated by the genus Eukiefferiella (Chironomidae). In the other three streams, no clear pattern in longitudinal macroinvertebrate community composition was evident due to low channel stability along the entire stream length.

The objective of this study was to characterize oral and circulatory PMNs during induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. Healthy volunteers were recruited to undergo experimental gingivitis. Clinical assessment of pocket depths, bleeding on probing, gingival index, and plaque index, as well as flow cytometric analysis of CD (cluster of differentiation) activation markers on blood and oral PMNs, was performed weekly. All clinical parameters increased significantly during the induction period and returned to baseline levels during the resolution phase. During the induction phase, while oral PMN counts increased, oral PMN activation state based on surface expression of CD63, CD11b, CD16, and CD14 was diminished compared to those seen in health and during the resolution phase. PMNs in circulation during onset showed increased activation based on CD55, CD63, CD11b, and CD66a. Using clinical parameters and oral PMN counts assessed at day 21, we noted 2 unique disease patterns where one-third of subjects displayed an exaggerated influx of oral PMNs with severe inflammation compared to the majority of the population who experienced a moderate level of inflammation and PMN influx. This supports the notion that PMN influx and severe inflammatory changes during gingivitis could identify subjects at risk for the development of severe gingival inflammation and progression toward destructive periodontitis. This study demonstrates that oral PMN activation states are reduced in gingivitis and suggest that only in periodontitis do PMNs become hyperactivated and tissue damaging.

This observation implicates the presence of dead or dormant bacteria in the bdlA mutant MFCs, which increases biofilm internal resistance as confirmed by electrochemical measurements.","authors":[{"name":"Devesh D Shreeram"},{"name":"Warunya Panmanee"},{"name":"Cameron T McDaniel"},{"name":"Susan Daniel"},{"name":"Dale W Schaefer"},{"name":"Daniel J Hassett"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm dispersion"},{"word":"Microbial fuel cell"},{"word":"Power density"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Twitching motility"}]},"article283":{"pmid":"29288300","title":"Biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Piper betle aqueous extract and evaluation of its anti-quorum sensing and antibiofilm potential against uropathogens with cytotoxic effects: an in vitro and in vivo approach.","date":"2019-02-21","abs":"Urinary tract infections are the utmost common bacterial infections caused by Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. These uropathogens resist the action of several antibiotics due to their ability to form biofilms. Most of these bacterial pathogens use the quorum sensing (QS) machinery to co-ordinate their cells and regulate several virulence factors and biofilm formation. On the other hand, the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS) and antibiofilm potential of silver nanoparticles have been well reported against certain bacterial pathogens, but to the best of our knowledge, no report is available against the pathogenicity of uropathogens in particular S. marcescens and P. mirabilis. Therefore, the present study is primarily focused on the anti-QS and antibiofilm potential of Piper betle-based synthesized silver nanoparticles (PbAgNPs) against S. marcescens and P. mirabilis. Initially, the silver nanoparticles were synthesized by the aqueous extract of P. betle and characterized by UV-absorbance spectroscopy, XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and DLS. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were assessed for their anti-QS activity and the obtained results revealed that the PbAgNPs inhibited the QS-mediated virulence factors such as prodigiosin, protease, biofilm formation, exopolysaccharides and hydrophobicity productions in uropathogens. The gene expression analysis divulged the downregulation of fimA, fimC, flhD, and bsmB genes in S. marcescens and flhB, flhD, and rsbA genes in P. mirabilis, respectively. The in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans assays revealed the non-toxic and anti-adherence efficiency of PbAgNPs. Furthermore, the non-toxic effect of PbAgNPs was also confirmed through peripheral blood mononuclear cells and normal lung epithelial cells. Therefore, the contemporary study demonstrates the use of PbAgNPs as a possible alternative toward conventional antibiotics in controlling QS and biofilm-related uropathogen infections.","authors":[{"name":"Ramanathan Srinivasan"},{"name":"Loganathan Vigneshwari"},{"name":"Tamilselvam Rajavel"},{"name":"Ravindran Durgadevi"},{"name":"Arunachalam Kannappan"},{"name":"Krishnaswamy Balamurugan"},{"name":"Kasi Pandima Devi"},{"name":"Arumugam Veera Ravi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-quorum sensing"},{"word":"Antibiofilm"},{"word":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"word":"Cytotoxicity"},{"word":"Piper betle"},{"word":"Proteus mirabilis"},{"word":"Serratia marcescens"},{"word":"Silver nanoparticles"}]},"article284":{"pmid":"29288072","title":"Scanning electron microscopy and microbiological approaches for the evaluation of salivary microorganisms behaviour on anatase titanium surfaces: In vitro study.","date":"2018-09-10","abs":"Implantology research framed the implant surface as a key element for a good and sustainable osseointegration of an implant fixture.

To do this, the best class of drugs are Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), however, the presence of side effects, especially at the gastrointestinal tract, limits their use for long-term therapy.

C. albicans biofilms can form on host tissues, such as mucosal layers, and on medical devices, such as catheters, pacemakers, dentures, and joint prostheses. Biofilms pose significant clinical challenges because they are highly resistant to physical and chemical perturbations, and can act as reservoirs to seed disseminated infections. Various in vitro assays have been utilized to study C. albicans biofilm formation, such as microtiter plate assays, dry weight measurements, cell viability assays, and confocal scanning laser microscopy. All of these assays are single end-point assays, where biofilm formation is assessed at a specific time point. Here, we describe a protocol to study biofilm formation in real-time using an automated microfluidic device under laminar flow conditions. This method allows for the observation of biofilm formation as the biofilm develops over time, using customizable conditions that mimic those of the host, such as those encountered in vascular catheters.

Kinetic models using the Bayesian statistics method were developed to simulate biomarkers transformation in reactors. Furthermore, a field-scale study was conducted in a real pressure sewer pipe with the systematical spiking and sampling of biomarkers and flow tracers. In-sewer degradation was observed for some spiked biomarkers over typical hydraulic retention time (i.e., a few hours). Results indicated that sewer biofilms prominently influenced biomarker stability with the retention time in wastewater. The fits between the measured and the simulated biomarkers transformation demonstrated that the lab-based model could be extended to estimate the changes of biomarkers in real sewers. Results also suggested that the variabilities of biotransformation and analytical accuracy are the two major contributors to the overall estimation uncertainty.

The present study investigated the relevance of the CRISPR in E. faecalis strains isolated from retreated root canals on biofilms, periapical lesions and drug resistance. A total of 20 E. faecalis strains were extracted from the root canals of teeth referred for root canal retreatment.

In view of the growing demand for high-quality textiles, much research is focused on the creation of antimicrobial finishings for fabrics, in order to protect customers from pathogenic or odorgenerating microorganisms. We present coatings from inorganic, organic and biochemical nanoparticles (NPs) on surfaces that impart the ability to kill bacteria, avoid biofilm formation and speed up the recovery of wounds. In all three cases, sonochemistry is used for immobilizing the nanoparticles on the surfaces. The Introduction broadly covers the progress of nanotechnology in the fields of wound and skin care. The first section of this review outlines the mechanism of the ultrasound-assisted deposition of nanoparticles on textiles. The coating can be performed by an in-situ process in which the nanoparticles are formed and subsequently thrown onto the surface of the fabrics at a very high speed. This approach was used in depositing metal-oxide NPs such as ZnO, CuO and Zn-CuO or the organic NPs of tannic acid, chitosan, etc. on textiles. In addition, the sonochemical process can be used as a throwing stone technique, namely, previously synthesized or commercially purchased NPs can be placed in the sonication bath and sonicated in the presence of the fabric. The collapse of the acoustic bubble in the solution causes the throwing of the immersed commercial NPs onto the textiles. This section will also outline why sonochemical deposition on textiles is considered the best coating technique. The second section will discuss new applications of the sonochemically- coated textiles in killing bacteria, avoiding biofilm formation and more. Two points should be noted: 1) the review will primarily report results obtained at Bar-Ilan University and 2) since for all textiles tested in our experiments (cotton, polyester, nylon, nonwoven) similar results were obtained, the type of textile used in a specific experiment will not be mentioned - textiles will be discussed in general.

From 2882 potential articles found in the initial searches, only 18 met the eligible criteria and were included in this review (12 with in vitro design, four with in situ design, and two clinical trials).

Risk bias analysis showed that only two studies presented low risk (whereas 11 showed high and five showed medium risk). Thus, only descriptive analyses considering study design, materials, intervention (finishing/polishing), surface characteristics (roughness and surface free energy), and protocol for biofilm formation (bacterial adhesion) could be performed. Some conclusions could be drawn: the impact of roughness on bacterial adhesion seems to be related not to a roughness threshold (as previously believed) but rather to a range, the range of surface roughness among different polishing methods is wide and material dependent, finishing invariably creates a rougher surface and should always be followed by a polishing method, each dental material requires its own treatment modality to obtain and maintain as smooth a surface as possible, and in vitro designs do not seem to be powerful tools to draw relevant conclusions, so in vivo and in situ designs become strongly recommended.","authors":[{"name":"Dam Dutra"},{"name":"Gkr Pereira"},{"name":"K Z Kantorski"},{"name":"L F Valandro"},{"name":"F B Zanatta"}],"keywords":[]},"article298":{"pmid":"29283323","title":"Phage Therapy against Streptococcus pneumoniae: Modern Tool to Control Pneumonia.","date":"2019-04-18","abs":"Phage therapy is important for treatment of drug-resistant pathogens as compared to antibiotics in this modern era.

Antibiotics, the mainstay treatments of bacterial infections, have often proven ineffective in the fight against microbes when growing as biofilms, and to date, no antibiotic has been developed for use against biofilm infections. Antibiotic resistance is rising, but biofilm-mediated multidrug resistance transcends this in being adaptive and broad spectrum and dependent on the biofilm growth state of organisms. Therefore, the treatment of biofilms requires drug developers to start thinking outside the constricted antibiotics box and to find alternative ways to target biofilm infections.

Here, we present data on 27 Salmonella serogroup C1 strains that were isolated during this previous study. The strains were typed by serum agglutination and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Sixteen strains were Salmonella Paratyphi C, four were Salmonella Colindale, and two were Salmonella Virchow. Interestingly, five strains were identified as the very rare Salmonella Brazzaville using a combination of serum agglutination and flagellin gene typing. Phenotypic characterization showed that Salmonella Brazzaville produced biofilm and exhibited catalase activity, which were not statistically different from the gastroenteritis-associated Salmonella Typhimurium sequence type (ST) 19. All tested Salmonella Paratyphi C strains were poor biofilm producers and showed significantly less catalase activity than Salmonella Typhimurium ST19.

The invasion of the wound by the hosts' resident microbiome and exogenous microorganisms can lead to biofilm formation. Biofilms have increased tolerance to antimicrobial interventions and constitute a concern to chronic wound healing. Consequently, anti-biofilm technologies with proven efficacy in areas outside of wound care need evaluation to determine whether their efficacy could be relevant to the control of biofilms in wounds. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-biofilm capabilities of tetrasodium EDTA (t-EDTA) as a stand-alone liquid and when incorporated in low concentrations into wound dressing prototypes. Results demonstrated that a low concentration of t-EDTA (4%) solution was able to kill Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis within in vitro biofilms after a 24-h contact time. The incorporation of low levels of t-EDTA into prototype fibrous wound dressings resulted in a 3-log reduction of bacteria demonstrating its microbicidal ability. Furthermore, hydrogels incorporating only a 0.2% concentration of t-EDTA (at preservative levels) caused a small reduction in biofilm. In conclusion, these studies show that t-EDTA as a stand-alone agent is an effective anti-biofilm agent in vitro. We have demonstrated that t-EDTA is compatible with numerous wound dressing platforms. EDTA could provide an essential tool to manage biofilm-related infections and should be considered as an anti-biofilm agent alone or in combination with other antimicrobials or technologies for increased antimicrobial performance in recalcitrant wounds.","authors":[{"name":"S L Percival"},{"name":"A-M Salisbury"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"EDTA"},{"word":"Infection"},{"word":"Wound Dressing"},{"word":"Wounds"}]},"article312":{"pmid":"29280076","title":"Clinical and laboratory evaluation of the effects of different treatment modalities on titanium healing caps: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.","date":"2018-12-21","abs":"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of treatment modalities on titanium surface characteristics and surrounding tissues.","authors":[{"name":"Kristina Emily Schmidt"},{"name":"Thorsten Mathias Auschill"},{"name":"Christian Heumann"},{"name":"Roland Frankenberger"},{"name":"Sigrun Eick"},{"name":"Anton Sculean"},{"name":"Nicole Birgit Arweiler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Attachment of fibroblasts"},{"word":"Biocompatibility"},{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"Bleeding on probing"},{"word":"Healing caps"},{"word":"Instrumentation"},{"word":"Matrix metalloproteinase-8"},{"word":"Probing depths"},{"word":"Surface roughness"},{"word":"Titanium dental implants"}]},"article313":{"pmid":"29280044","title":"Hydrogels Containing Antibiofilm and Antimicrobial Agents Beneficial for Biofilm-Associated Wound Infection: Formulation Characterizations and In vitro Study.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Bacterial biofilm which adheres onto wound surface is shown to be impervious to antibiotics and this in turn delays wound healing. Previous studies showed that antibiofilm agents such as xylitol and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) prevent bacterial adherence onto surfaces. Formulation of a wound dressing containing antibiofilm agents may be a plausible strategy in breaking the biofilm on wound surfaces and at the same time increase the efficacy of the antibiotic. The purpose of this study was to develop hydrogel formulations containing antibiofilm agents along with antibiotic (gentamicin) for bacterial biofilm-associated wound infection. Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) hydrogels loaded with antibiofilm agents and antibiotic were prepared. The hydrogels were characterized for their physical properties, rheology, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), drug content uniformity, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and in vitro drug release study. The antibiofilm (Crystal Violet staining and XTT assay) and antibacterial performances of the hydrogels against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli were assessed in vitro. The formulated hydrogels showed adequate release of both antibiofilm agents (xylitol and EDTA). Both antimicrobial and antibiofilm tests showed promising results and demonstrated that the combination of xylitol, EDTA, and gentamicin had an additive effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In summary, NaCMC (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) hydrogels containing the combination of antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents were successfully developed and this can be a new strategy in combating biofilm in wound infection which in turn accelerate wound healing.","authors":[{"name":"Anam Anjum"},{"name":"Cai-Hong Sim"},{"name":"Shiow-Fern Ng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EDTA"},{"word":"antibiofilm agent"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"hydrogel"},{"word":"xylitol"}]},"article314":{"pmid":"29279769","title":"Biofilm formation on denture base resin including ZnO, CaO, and TiO","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"This laboratory study aimed to investigate the effect of doping an acrylic denture base resin material with nanoparticles of ZnO, CaO, and TiO","authors":[{"name":"Melissa Anwander"},{"name":"Martin Rosentritt"},{"name":"Sibylle Schneider-Feyrer"},{"name":"Sebastian Hahnel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Denture"},{"word":"Nanoparticles"},{"word":"PMMA"}]},"article315":{"pmid":"29279728","title":"A Comparison of Er:YAG Laser with Photon-Initiated Photoacoustic Streaming, Nd:YAG Laser, and Conventional Irrigation on the Eradication of Root Dentinal Tubule Infection by Enterococcus faecalis Biofilms: A Scanning Electron Microscopy Study.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"This study evaluated the antimicrobial efficacy of Er:YAG laser activation with photon-initiated photoacoustic streaming (PIPS), Nd:YAG laser disinfection, and conventional irrigation on Enterococcus faecalis biofilms using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Taking this into account, the methods to modify urinary catheters to control microbial infections with relevance to clinical drug resistance are systematically evaluated in this review. Technologies to restrict biofilm formation at initial stages by using functional nanomaterials are elucidated. The conventional methodology of using single therapeutic intervention for developing an antimicrobial catheter lacks clinically meaningful benefit. Therefore, catheter modification using naturally derived antimicrobials such as essential oils, curcumin, enzymes, and antimicrobial peptides in combination with synthetic antibiotics/nanoantibiotics is likely to exert sufficient inhibitory effect on uropathogens and is extensively discussed.

This work presents insights into the proceedings triggering E. coli biofilm control with phage, honey, and their combination, achieved through standard antimicrobial activity assays, zeta potential and flow cytometry studies and further visual insights sought by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Two Portuguese honeys (PF2 and U3) with different floral origin and an E. coli-specific phage (EC3a), possessing depolymerase activity, were tested against 24- and 48-h-old biofilms. Synergic and additive effects were perceived in some phage-honey experiments. Combined therapy prompted similar phenomena in biofilm cells, visualized by electron microscopy, as the individual treatments. Honey caused minor membrane perturbations to complete collapse and consequent discharge of cytoplasmic content, and phage completely destroyed cells leaving only vesicle-like structures and debris. Our experiments show that the addition of phage to low honey concentrations is advantageous, and that even fourfold diluted honey combined with phage, presents no loss of antibacterial activity toward E. coli. Portuguese honeys possess excellent antibiofilm activity and may be potential alternative therapeutic agents in biofilm-related wound infection. Furthermore, to our knowledge this is the first study that assessed the impacts of phage-honey combinations in bacterial cells. The synergistic effect obtained was shown to be promising, since the antiviral effect of honey limits the emergence of phage resistant phenotypes.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Oliveira"},{"name":"Henrique G Ribeiro"},{"name":"Ana C Silva"},{"name":"Maria D Silva"},{"name":"Jessica C Sousa"},{"name":"Célia F Rodrigues"},{"name":"Luís D R Melo"},{"name":"Ana F Henriques"},{"name":"Sanna Sillankorva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"E. coli"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"honey"},{"word":"synergy"}]},"article323":{"pmid":"29276044","title":"Intraclonal variations of resistance and phenotype in Pseudomonas aeruginosa epidemic high-risk clone ST308: A key to success within a hospital?","date":"2018-08-16","abs":"Most multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa strains belonged to epidemic high-risk (EHR) clones that succeeded worldwide in the context of hospital outbreaks.

Unexpectedly, resistance phenotype was very diverse within the population, independently of the origin (environmental or human) and the period of isolation (during or after outbreaks). Most MDR/XDR strains belonged to clusters in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) while singleton strains instead displayed susceptible or moderately resistant phenotypes. High diversity was observed for motility and biofilm formation without correlation with the origin and the period. Resistance to biocides was not linked to epidemic success or to environmental persistence. Finally, the EHR clone ST308 did not display common adaptive traits, nor traits related to an origin or a period of isolation in the hospital. The major character of this EHR clone ST308 is its intraclonal diversity that probably warrants its adaptation and persistence in hospital whatever the conditions and therefore its epidemic behaviour.

In Pseudomonas putida biofilms, nutrient starvation triggers c-di-GMP hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase BifA, releasing inhibition of protease LapG by the c-di-GMP effector protein LapD, and resulting in proteolysis of the adhesin LapA and the subsequent release of biofilm cells. Here we demonstrate that the stringent response, a ubiquitous bacterial stress response, is accountable for relaying the nutrient stress signal to the biofilm dispersal machinery. Mutants lacking elements of the stringent response - (p)ppGpp sythetases [RelA and SpoT] and/or DksA - were defective in biofilm dispersal. Ectopic (p)ppGpp synthesis restored biofilm dispersal in a ∆relA ∆spoT mutant. In vivo gene expression analysis showed that (p)ppGpp positively regulates transcription of bifA, and negatively regulates transcription of lapA and the lapBC, and lapE operons, encoding a LapA-specific secretion system. Further in vivo and in vitro characterization revealed that the PbifA promoter is dependent on the flagellar σ factor FliA, and positively regulated by ppGpp and DksA.

Thus, genes encoding traits that potentially  confer fungal interactivity were found, such as type 4 pili, type 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 secretion systems, and biofilm formation (PGA, alginate and pel) and glycerol uptake systems. Furthermore, the three genomes also revealed the presence of a highly conserved five-gene cluster that had previously been shown to be upregulated upon contact with fungal hyphae. Moreover, a considerable number of prophage-like and CRISPR spacer sequences was found, next to genetic systems responsible for secondary metabolite production. Overall, the three 10.1601/nm.27008 strains possess the genetic repertoire necessary for adaptation to diverse soil niches, including those influenced by soil fungi.","authors":[{"name":"Akbar Adjie Pratama"},{"name":"Irshad Ul Haq"},{"name":"Rashid Nazir"},{"name":"Maryam Chaib De Mares"},{"name":"Jan Dirk van Elsas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Fungal-interactive"},{"word":"Genome"},{"word":"Mycosphere"},{"word":"Paraburkholderia terrae"}]},"article352":{"pmid":"29269847","title":"Biodegradation of weathered polystyrene films in seawater microcosms.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"A microcosm experiment was conducted at two phases in order to investigate the ability of indigenous consortia alone or bioaugmented to degrade weathered polystyrene (PS) films under simulated marine conditions.

Contrary to most expectations, these cultures are not homogeneous mixtures of single-cell bacteria, because free-floating bacterial aggregates eventually develop in most liquid batch cultures. These aggregates share characteristics with biofilms, such as increased antibiotic tolerance. We investigated how aggregates develop and what influences this development in liquid batch cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa We focused on how the method of inoculation affected aggregation by assessing aggregate frequency and size using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Several traditional methods of initiating an overnight bacterial culture, i.e., inoculation directly from frozen cultures, inoculation using agar-grown cells, or inoculation using cells grown in liquid cultures, were investigated. We discovered a direct link between the inoculation method and the size and frequency of biofilm aggregates in liquid batch cultures, with inoculation directly from a plate resulting in the most numerous and largest aggregates. These large aggregates had an overall impact on the cultures' subsequent tolerance toward tobramycin, indicating that the inoculation method has a profound impact on antibiotic tolerance. We also observed a mechanism whereby preformed aggregates recruited single cells from the surrounding culture in a snowball effect, building up aggregated biomass in the culture. This recruitment was found to rely heavily on the exopolysaccharide Psl. Additionally, we found that both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus produced aggregates in liquid batch cultures. Our results stress the importance of inoculation consistency throughout experiments and the substantial impact aggregate development in liquid batch cultures may have on the outcomes of microbiological experiments.","authors":[{"name":"Kasper Nørskov Kragh"},{"name":"Maria Alhede"},{"name":"Morten Rybtke"},{"name":"Camilla Stavnsberg"},{"name":"Peter Ø Jensen"},{"name":"Tim Tolker-Nielsen"},{"name":"Marvin Whiteley"},{"name":"Thomas Bjarnsholt"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"aggregation"},{"word":"biofilms"}]},"article354":{"pmid":"29269493","title":"Environmental Stress-Induced Bacterial Lysis and Extracellular DNA Release Contribute to Campylobacter jejuni Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"Campylobacter jejuni is a microaerophilic bacterium and is believed to persist in a biofilm to antagonize environmental stress.

The eDNA was determined to represent a major form of constitutional material of C. jejuni biofilms and to be closely associated with bacterial lysis. Deletion mutation of the stress response genes spoT and recA enhanced the aerobic influence by stimulating lysis and increasing eDNA release.

However, biofilms are often not completely dispersed after exposure to NO. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigated the response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm cells to successive NO treatments. When biofilms were first pretreated with a low, noneffective dose of NO, a second dose of the signal molecule at a concentration usually capable of inducing dispersal did not have any effect. Amperometric analysis revealed that pretreated P. aeruginosa cells had enhanced NO-scavenging activity, and this effect was associated with the production of the flavohemoglobin Fhp. Further, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that fhp expression increased by over 100-fold in NO-pretreated biofilms compared to untreated biofilms. Biofilms of mutant strains harboring mutations in fhp or fhpR, encoding a NO-responsive regulator of fhp, were not affected in their dispersal response after the initial pretreatment with NO. Overall, these results suggest that FhpR can sense NO to trigger production of the flavohemoglobin Fhp and inhibit subsequent dispersal responses to NO. Finally, the addition of imidazole, which can inhibit the NO dioxygenase activity of flavohemoglobin, attenuated the prevention of dispersal after NO pretreatment and improved the dispersal response in older, starved biofilms. This study clarifies the underlying mechanisms of impaired dispersal induced by repeated NO treatments and offers a new perspective for improving the use of NO in biofilm control strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Xinyi Zhu"},{"name":"Hyun-Suk Oh"},{"name":"Yu Chiu Beverly Ng"},{"name":"Pei Yi Peggy Tang"},{"name":"Nicolas Barraud"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"dispersal"},{"word":"flavohemoglobin"},{"word":"nitric oxide"}]},"article373":{"pmid":"29262785","title":"Radiation used for head and neck cancer increases virulence in Candida tropicalis isolated from a cancer patient.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Studies have shown that radiation from radiotherapy increases the yeast colonization of patients.

Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one such environment which is extremely acidic containing copious amounts of heavy metals and poses a major threat to the ecosystem. Despite its extreme conditions, AMD is the habitat for several microbes and their activities. The use of various chemicals in prevention of AMD formation and conventional treatment in a larger scale is not feasible under different geological conditions. It implies that microbe-mediated approach is a viable and sustainable alternative technology for AMD remediation. Microalgae in biofilms play a pivotal role in such bioremediation as they maintain mutualism with heterotrophic bacteria. Synergistic approach of using microalgae-bacteria biofilms provides supportive metabolites from algal biomass for growth of bacteria and mediates remediation of AMD. However, by virtue of their physiology and capabilities of metal removal, non-acidophilic microalgae can be acclimated for use in AMD remediation. A combination of selective acidophilic and non-acidophilic microalgae together with bacteria, all in the form of biofilms, may be very effective for bioremediation of metal-contaminated waters. The present review critically examines the nature of mutualistic interactions established between microalgae and bacteria in biofilms and their role in removal of metals from AMDs, and consequent biomass production for the yield of biofuel. Integration of microalgal-bacterial consortia in fuel cells would be an attractive emerging approach of microbial biotechnology for AMD remediation.","authors":[{"name":"Sudharsanam Abinandan"},{"name":"Suresh R Subashchandrabose"},{"name":"Kadiyala Venkateswarlu"},{"name":"Mallavarapu Megharaj"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acid mine drainages"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Bioremediation"},{"word":"Microalgae–bacteria"},{"word":"Microbial fuel cells"}]},"article377":{"pmid":"29259923","title":"Exploring the Anti-quorum Sensing and Antibiofilm Efficacy of Phytol against Serratia marcescens Associated Acute Pyelonephritis Infection in Wistar Rats.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Quorum Sensing (QS) mechanism, a bacterial density-dependent gene expression system, governs the Serratia marcescens pathogenesis through the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation. The present study demonstrates the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS), antibiofilm potential and in vivo protective effect of phytol, a diterpene alcohol broadly utilized as food additive and in therapeutics fields. In vitro treatment of phytol (5 and 10 μg/ml) showed decreasing level of biofilm formation, lipase and hemolysin production in S. marcescens compared to their respective controls. More, microscopic analyses confirmed the antibiofilm potential of phytol. The biofilm related phenomenons such as swarming motility and exopolysccharide productions were also inhibited by phytol. Furthermore, the real-time analysis elucidated the molecular mechanism of phytol which showed downregulation of fimA, fimC, flhC, flhD, bsmB, pigP, and shlA gene expressions. On the other hand, the in vivo rescue effect of phytol was assessed against S. marcescens associated acute pyelonephritis in Wistar rat. Compared to the infected and vehicle controls, the phytol treated groups (100 and 200 mg/kg) showed decreased level of bacterial counts in kidney, bladder tissues and urine samples on the 5th post infection day. As well, the phytol treatment showed reduced level of virulence enzymes such as lipase and protease productions compared to the infected and vehicle controls. Further, the infected and vehicle controls showed increasing level of inflammatory markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) productions. In contrast, the phytol treatment showed decreasing level of inflammatory markers. In histopathology, the uninfected animal showed normal kidney and bladder structure, wherein, the infected animals showed extensive infiltration of neutrophils in kidney and bladder tissues. In contrast, the phytol treatment showed normal kidney and bladder tissues. Additionally, the toxic effect of phytol (200 mg/kg) was assessed by single dose toxicity analysis. No changes were observed in hematological, biochemical profiles and histopathological analysis of vital organs in phytol treated animals compared to the untreated controls.

Studies of PAO1 mutants show that, unlike solid-supported biofilms, elastic interfacial film formation occurs in the absence of flagella, pili, or certain polysaccharides. Highly induced genes identified in transcriptional profiling include those for putative enzymes and a carbohydrate metabolism enzyme, alkB2; this latter gene is not upregulated in PA14 cells. Notably, PAO1 mutants lacking the alkB2 gene fail to form an elastic layer. Rather, they form an active film like that formed by PA14.

Our analysis of confocal images of biofilms formed by NTHI strain 86-028NP using pair correlations of local bacterial densities within sequential planes parallel to the substrate showed the presence of fractal structures of short length scales (≤10 μm). The in silico modeling revealed that extracellular DNA (eDNA) and type IV pilus (Tfp) expression played important roles in giving rise to the fractal structures and allowed us to predict a substantial reduction of these structures for an isogenic mutant (ΔcomE) that was significantly compromised in its ability to release eDNA into the biofilm matrix and had impaired Tfp function. This prediction was confirmed by analysis of confocal images of in vitro ΔcomE strain biofilms. The fractal structures potentially generate niches for NTHI survival in the hostile middle ear microenvironment by dramatically increasing the contact area of the biofilm with the surrounding environment, facilitating nutrient exchange, and by generating spatial positive feedback to quorum signaling.","authors":[{"name":"Jayajit Das"},{"name":"Elaine Mokrzan"},{"name":"Vinal Lakhani"},{"name":"Lucia Rosas"},{"name":"Joseph A Jurcisek"},{"name":"William C Ray"},{"name":"Lauren O Bakaletz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"agent-based modeling"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"otitis media"},{"word":"pair correlation"}]},"article383":{"pmid":"29258641","title":"Denture Stomatitis: Causes, Cures and Prevention.","date":"2020-01-03","abs":"Removable dentures are worn by 20% of the UK population and two thirds of these individuals have denture stomatitis.

Pyruvate oxidase was the dominant pathway for H2O2 production by arginolytic strains, but lactate oxidase activity was also detected in some strains of S. gordonii and S. cristatus.

Our results showed that heat, UV, and hydrogen peroxide did not effectively change populations of attached Salmonella Typhimurium.

We also compared physicochemical changes of Salmonella Typhimurium after application of lactic acid and used hydrogen peroxide as a positive control because only lactic acid showed a decreased tendency for attachment and hydrogen peroxide induced slightly higher numbers of attached bacteria cells. Extracellular polymeric substance produced by Salmonella Typhimurium was not detected in any treatment. Significant differences in hydrophobicity were not observed. Surface charges of cell membranes did not show relevant correlation with numbers of attached cells, whereas autoaggregation showed a positive correlation with attachment to stainless steel. Our results highlight that when lactic acid is applied in a food processing facility, it can effectively interfere with adhesion of injured Salmonella Typhimurium cells onto food contact surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Woo-Ju Kim"},{"name":"Ki-Ok Jeong"},{"name":"Dong-Hyun Kang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Attachment inhibition"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Inactivation"},{"word":"Injured cell"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"29257002","title":"Capsular Biofilm Formation at the Interface of Textured Expanders and Human Acellular Dermal Matrix: A Comparative Scanning Electron Microscopy Study.","date":"2018-09-05","abs":"Despite benefits in reducing capsular contractures, textured implants have been associated with significant pitfalls, such a propensity for biofilm formation.

We studied the significance of the presence of S. maltophilia in final effluents and receiving rivers of pig farm wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The loads and antibiotic resistance profiles of S. maltophilia in final effluents were assessed. Antibiotic resistance determinants and biofilm formation genes were detected by PCR, and genetic similarity to clinical isolates was investigated using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). S. maltophilia was recovered from final effluents at two of three farms and one corresponding receiving river. Tests of resistance to antibiotics recommended for S. maltophilia infection revealed that for each agent, at least one isolate was classified as resistant or intermediate, with the exception of minocycline. Furthermore, multidrug resistant S. maltophilia susceptible to antibiotics of only two categories was isolated and found to carry the sul2 gene, conferring trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance. All isolates carried spgM, encoding a major factor in biofilm formation. MLST revealed that isolates of the same sequence type (ST; ST189) were present in both effluent and receiving river samples, and phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the STs identified in this study clustered with clinical isolates. Moreover, one isolate (ST192) recovered in this investigation demonstrated 99.61% sequence identity with a clinical isolate (ST98) associated with a fatal infection in South Korea. Thus, the pathogenicity of the isolates reported here is likely similar to that of those from clinical environments, and WWTPs may play a role as a source of S. maltophilia from which this bacterium spreads to human communities. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of S. maltophilia in pig farm WWTPs. Our results indicate that nationwide epidemiological investigations are needed to examine the possible link between WWTP-derived S. maltophilia and hospital- and community-acquired infections.","authors":[{"name":"Young-Ji Kim"},{"name":"Jin-Hyeong Park"},{"name":"Kun-Ho Seo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pig farm"},{"word":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"},{"word":"Waste water treatment plant"}]},"article399":{"pmid":"29254815","title":"Validation of Biofilm Assays to Assess Antibiofilm Efficacy in Instrumented Root Canals after Syringe Irrigation and Sonic Agitation.","date":"2018-10-10","abs":"Different methods to characterize bacterial biofilms have been established, each presenting with distinct advantages and shortcomings.
