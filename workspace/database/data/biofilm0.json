These MSC antimicrobial properties have primarily been studied in the context of the planktonic phenotype, and thus, information on the effects on bacteria in biofilms is largely lacking. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vitro efficacy of the MSC secretome against various biofilm-forming wound pathogens, including the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and to explore the mechanisms that affect bacterial biofilms. To this end, we used equine MSC, because the horse represents a physiologically relevant model for human wound healing and offers a readily translatable model for MSC therapies in humans. Our salient findings were that the equine MSC secretome inhibits biofilm formation and mature biofilms of various bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that equine MSC secrete cysteine proteases that destabilize MRSA biofilms, thereby increasing the efficacy of antibiotics that were previously tolerated by the biofilms. In light of the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains as an increasing global health threat, our results provide the rationale for using the MSC secretome as a complementary treatment for bacterial skin infections in both humans and horses.","authors":[{"name":"Charlotte Marx"},{"name":"Sophia Gardner"},{"name":"Rebecca M Harman"},{"name":"Gerlinde R Van de Walle"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cutaneous wounds"},{"word":"mesenchymal stromal cells, MRSA"},{"word":"secretome"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"32216092","title":"Mineral-hosted biofilm communities in the continental deep subsurface, Deep Mine Microbial Observatory, SD, USA.","date":"2020-03-27","abs":"Deep subsurface biofilms are estimated to host the majority of prokaryotic life on Earth, yet fundamental aspects of their ecology remain unknown. An inherent difficulty in studying subsurface biofilms is that of sample acquisition.

The recently established Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) is a long-term monitoring network at which we can explore the ecological role of biofilms in fluid-filled fractures to depths of 1.5 km. We carried out in situ cultivation experiments with single minerals representative of DeMMO host rock to explore the ecological drivers of biodiversity and biomass in biofilm communities in the continental subsurface. Coupling cell densities to thermodynamic models of putative metabolic reactions with minerals suggests a metabolic relationship between biofilms and the minerals they colonize. Our findings indicate that minerals can significantly enhance biofilm cell densities and promote selective colonization by taxa putatively capable of extracellular electron transfer. In turn, minerals can drive significant differences in biodiversity between fluid and biofilm communities. Given our findings at DeMMO, we suggest that host rock mineralogy is an important ecological driver in deep continental biospheres.","authors":[{"name":"Caitlin P Casar"},{"name":"Brittany R Kruger"},{"name":"Theodore M Flynn"},{"name":"Andrew L Masterson"},{"name":"Lily M Momper"},{"name":"Magdalena R Osburn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DeMMO"},{"word":"biodiversity"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biomass"},{"word":"continental subsurface"},{"word":"extracellular electron transfer"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"32216024","title":"Characterization of biopolymers produced by planktonic and biofilm cells of Herbaspirillum lusitanum P6-12.","date":"2020-03-27","abs":"The goal of this study was to characterize the Herbaspirillum lusitanum P6-12 biopolymers under various environmental conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Natalya S Velichko"},{"name":"Vyacheslav S Grinev"},{"name":"Yulia P Fedonenko"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Herbaspirillum"},{"word":"FTIR"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biopolymers"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"lipopolysaccharide"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"32215705","title":"Expression of Meiothermus ruber luxS in E. coli alters the antibiotic susceptibility and biofilm formation.","date":"2020-03-27","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) and signal molecules used for interspecies communication are well defined in mesophiles, but there is still a plethora of microorganisms in which existence and mechanisms of QS need to be explored, thermophiles being among them.

In an attempt to increase the biocompatibility and antibacterial activities of AuNRs against organisms in both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes, polymethacrylate with pendant carboxyl betaine groups was decorated on AuNRs (PCB-AuNRs) to afford AuNRs with pH-induced surface charge-transformable activities. The zwitterion-modified AuNRs demonstrated a pH-responsive transition from negative charge to positive charge; this confers the AuNRs with a change in functionality from biocompatible zwitterionic nanocomposites in healthy tissues (pH = ∼7.4) to enhanced antimicrobial cationic nanocomposites at acidic bacterial infection sites (pH = ∼5.5). AuNRs coated by polymethacrylate with pendant mPEG (PPEGMA-AuNRs) without surface charge transition activities were used for comparison. PCB-AuNRs presented better antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus) and their drug-resistant strains (MRSA and EBSL E. coli) than PPEGMA-AuNRs as a result of their pH-responsive surface charge transition activities.

Consequently, expression of flagellar genes, as well as genes involved in biofilm formation and virulence, can be regulated by the surface contact. In a few bacterial species, flagella themselves are known to serve as mechanosensors, where an increased load on flagella experienced during surface contact or swimming in viscous media controls gene expression. In this study, we show that gene regulation by motility-dependent mechanosensing is common among pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. This regulatory mechanism requires flagellar rotation, and it enables pathogenic E. coli to repress flagellar genes at low loads in liquid culture, while activating motility in porous medium (soft agar) or upon surface contact. It also controls several other cellular functions, including metabolism and signaling. The mechanosensing response in pathogenic E. coli depends on the negative regulator of motility, RflP (YdiV), which inhibits basal expression of flagellar genes in liquid. While no conditional inhibition of flagellar gene expression in liquid and therefore no upregulation in porous medium was observed in the wild-type commensal or laboratory strains of E. coli, mechanosensitive regulation could be recovered by overexpression of RflP in the laboratory strain.

We show that motile cells of Pseudomonas putida disperse more efficiently than non-motile mutants through a designed heterogeneous porous system. Motile cells can evade flow-imposed trajectories, enabling them to explore larger pore areas than non-motile cells. While transported cells exhibited a rotation in response to hydrodynamic shear, motile cells were less susceptible to the torque, maintaining their body oriented towards the flow direction and thus changing the population velocity distribution with a significant impact on the overall transport properties. We also found, in a separate set of experiments, that if the suspension flows through a porous system already colonized by a biofilm, P. putida cells are channelled into preferential flow paths and the cell attachment rate is increased. These two effects were more pronounced for non-motile than for motile cells. Our findings suggest that motility coupled with heterogeneous flows can be beneficial to motile bacteria in confined environments as it enables them to actively explore the space for resources or evade regions with unfavourable conditions.

In addition, we examined all bacterial targets involved in their antimicrobial activity reporting, when described, their spontaneous frequencies of resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Stella Maria Cascioferro"},{"name":"Barbara Parrino"},{"name":"Daniela Carbone"},{"name":"Domenico Schillaci"},{"name":"Elisa Giovannetti"},{"name":"Girolamo Cirrincione"},{"name":"Patrizia Diana"}],"keywords":[]},"article23":{"pmid":"32208520","title":"Stratified Microbial Structure and Activity within Anode Biofilm during Electrochemically Assisted Brewery Wastewater Treatment.","date":"2020-03-25","abs":"In a bioelectrochemical system (BES), microbial community of anode biofilm are crucial to BES performance.

However, the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on spatiotemporal deposition patterns of bacteria during the initial stages of biofilm formation remain unclear. Large field epifluorescence microscopy enabled in situ and real-time tracking of Bacillus subtilis in a forward osmosis system with spacers during the first four hours of biofilm formation. This study quantitatively compares the spatiotemporal deposition patterns between different hydrodynamic conditions: high and low permeate water flux (6 or 30 L m-2 h-1) as well as high and low crossflow velocity (1 or 14 cm s 1). Low crossflow velocity and high permeate water flux maximized bacterial attachment to the membrane surface, which was 60 times greater (6 x 103 cells mm 2) than at high crossflow velocity and low permeate water flux (< 100 cells mm 2). Imaging at 30 s intervals revealed three phases (i.e., lag, exponential, and linear) in the development of deposition over time. Quantification of spatial deposition patterns showed that an increase in the ratio of permeate water flux to crossflow velocity led to a homogeneous deposition, while a decrease had the opposite effect. The insights of this research indicate that an appropriate choice of hydrodynamic conditions can minimize bacteria accumulation prior to biofilm formation in new and cleaned FO membrane systems treating water of high fouling propensity.","authors":[{"name":"Andreas Kastl"},{"name":"Anne Bogler"},{"name":"Markus Spinnler"},{"name":"Thomas Sattelmayer"},{"name":"Avraham Be'er"},{"name":"Edo Bar-Zeev"}],"keywords":[]},"article27":{"pmid":"32207608","title":"A Rapid, Non-Invasive, and Non-Destructive Method for Biofilm Imaging on Metallic Surfaces Using Active Thermography.","date":"2020-03-24","abs":"A simple, rapid, low-cost method is proposed for the imaging of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on metallic surfaces using an infrared camera.

It severely affects oral health and yet closely links to systemic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis as a 'keystone' periodontopathogen drives the shift of microbe-host symbiosis to dysbiosis, and critically contributes to the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Persisters are a tiny subset of biofilm-associated microbes highly tolerant to lethal treatment of antimicrobials, and notably metronidazole-tolerant P. gingivalis persisters have recently been identified by our group. This study further explored the interactive profiles of metronidazole-treated P. gingivalis persisters (M-PgPs) with human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs). P. gingivalis cells (ATCC 33277) at stationary phase were treated with lethal dosage of metronidazole (100 μg/ml, 6 hours) for generating M-PgPs. The interaction of M-PgPs with HGECs was assessed by microscopy, flow cytometry, cytokine profiling and qPCR. We demonstrated that the overall morphology and ultra-cellular structure of M-PgPs remained unchanged. Importantly, M-PgPs maintained the capabilities to adhere to and invade into HGECs. Moreover, M-PgPs significantly suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in HGECs at a comparable level with the untreated P. gingivalis cells, through the thermo-sensitive components. The present study reveals that P. gingivalis persisters induced by lethal treatment of antibiotics could maintain their capabilities to adhere to and invade into human gingival epithelial cells, and perturb the innate host responses. Novel strategies and approaches need to be developed for tackling P. gingivalis and favourably modulating the dysregulated immuno-inflammatory responses for oral/periodontal health and general wellbeing.","authors":[{"name":"Chuan Wang"},{"name":"Tianfan Cheng"},{"name":"Xuan Li"},{"name":"Lijian Jin"}],"keywords":[]},"article32":{"pmid":"32205191","title":"Antibacterial activity of salvia officinalis l. against periodontopathogens: An in vitro study.","date":"2020-03-24","abs":"Being aware of the remarkable antimicrobial potential of S. officinalis L., we aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the S. officinalis dichloromethane crude extract (SOD), dichloromethane-soluble fractions (SODH and SODD), SODD subfractions (SODD1 and SODD2), and pure substances (manool, salvigenin, and viridiflorol) against periodontopathogens.

Commercially pure titanium (cpTi) discs were divided into four groups: (1) machined samples without UV light application [cpTi UV-]; (2) plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) treated samples without UV light application [PEO UV-]; (3) machined samples with UV light application [cpTi UV+]; and (4) PEO-treated samples with UV light application [PEO UV+].

For the microbiological assay, Streptococcus sanguinis was grown on the disc surfaces for 1 h and 6 h, and the colony forming units and bacterial organization were evaluated. In addition, to confirm the non-cytotoxic effect of PEO UV +, human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells were cultured in a monolayer onto each material surface and the cells viability and proliferation evaluated by a fluorescent cell staining method. PEO treatment increased the Ti surface roughness and wettability (p < 0.05). Photofunctionalization reduced the hydrocarbon concentration and enhanced human blood plasma proteins and albumin adsorption mainly for the PEO-treated surface (p < 0.05). PEO UV+ also maintained higher wettability values for a longer period and provided microbial reduction at 1 h of bacterial adhesion (p = 0.012 vs. PEO UV-). Photofunctionalization did not increase the photocatalytic activity of Ti (p > 0.05). Confocal microscopy analyses demonstrated that PEO UV+ had no cell damage effect on HGF cells growth even after 24 h of incubation.

Symbiolites encase the calcifying community as endolithic cells, pointing at an autoendolithic niche of symbiotic dinoflagellates, and provide a rare opportunity to study the role of bacteria in bacterial-algal calcification, as symbiodiniacean cultures display either distinct symbiolite-producing (SP) or non-symbiolite-producing (NP) phenotypes. Using Illumina sequencing, we found that the bacterial communities of SP and NP cultures differed significantly in the relative abundance of 23 genera, 14 families, and 2 phyla. SP cultures were rich in biofilm digesters from the phylum Planctomycetes and their predicted metagenomes were enriched in orthologs related to biofilm formation. In contrast, NP cultures were dominated by biofilm digesters from the Bacteroidetes, and were inferred as enriched in proteases and nucleases. Functional assays confirmed the potential of co-cultures and bacterial isolates to produce biofilms and point at acidic polysaccharides as key stimulators for mineral precipitation.

Therefore, new drugs to treat fungal infections are urgently needed. In this line, our study aimed to determine the anticandidal activity and the synergistic effect of essential oil fractions from Syzygium aromaticum, Cymbopogon citratus and Aeollanthus heliotropioides harvested in Cameroon using a combination approach. Essential oils have been obtained by hydrodistillation and their chemical composition was analysed by GC/MS. Antifungal activity was evaluated by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using a micro-dilution method. The sorbitol and ergosterol binding ability and anti-biofilm activity were also assessed in order to evaluate the mode of action. The crude essential oils showed a good anticandidal activity, most probably due to the eugenol, linalool and citral content. The combination of two fractions F7 and F10 showed an improved growth inhibition of Candida spp compared to the crude essential oils. The inhibitory effect could be related with the presence of γ-dodecalactone and citronellol as main compounds. The best synergistic combination F7F10 inhibited biofilm formation at ten time reduced combination MIC. The active fractions targeted different fungal cell structures, including cell wall and membrane. Our study showed that the combination of selected essential oils fractions exhibited an increased antifungal activity against Candida spp compared to the crude essential oils. The combination approach of inner compound groups may be used as a promising strategy for the development of efficient recombined micro-essential oils as antifungal agents to face Candida resistance.","authors":[{"name":"M N L Ngo-Mback"},{"name":"C Babii"},{"name":"P M Jazet Dongmo"},{"name":"M R Kouipou Toghueo"},{"name":"M Stefan"},{"name":"F Fekam Boyom"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aeollanthus"},{"word":"Anti-Candida"},{"word":"Anti-biofilm activity"},{"word":"Cymbopogon"},{"word":"Fractionation"},{"word":"Synergism"},{"word":"Syzygium essential oils"}]},"article50":{"pmid":"32201214","title":"Hypericin-mediated photoinactivation in polymeric nanoparticles against Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"Photoinactivation is a promising technique for Staphylococcus aureus control.

The treatment times for planktonic cells were proposed by a mixture design, and bacterial photoinactivation was observed in concentrations of 12.5 to 3.12 μmol/L for HYP/P123-2.5 and reductions of ∼ 4.0 log CFU/mL in 12.5 to 0.78 μmol/L for HYP/P123-10. For biofilms, 30 minutes of darkness and 30 minutes of illumination were used. Maximum reductions were similar for both formulations and corresponded to approximately 0.9 log CFU/cm².

These conditions are conducive to poly-microbial infections, like chronic lung infection, in which Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is the major pathogenic bacterium colonizing CF lungs at the end of the lifetime of CF patients. This in vitro study uses a P. aeruginosa biofilm model under partly cystic fibrosis conditions, with a sampling of volatile extracellular metabolites. The gas sampling was done with thin-film microextraction (TFME) and commercial polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films, whereas the analysis of loaded films was done by gas chromatography coupled to quadrupole mass spectrometry and thermodesorption (TD-GC-qMS). For this purpose, two commercially available films were characterized by means of thermogravimetry coupled to a qMS with atmospheric pressure photo ionization (TG-APPI-qMS), regarding homogeneity and temperature stability. The selected film was cleaned using a method developed in this study. The TD-GC-qMS method was successfully used for standards of volatile metabolites which were known to be produced by P. aeruginosa. Limits of detection and quantification of the method for middle and less polar compounds in low nanomolar range (0.5 nM and 1.5 nM) were achieved. The developed method was finally applied to investigate the extracellular volatile metabolites produced by biofilms of the strain P. aeruginosa DSM 50071 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In sum, eleven metabolites could be found under both conditions. Furthermore, it was shown in this study that different oxygen conditions (aerobic and anaerobic) resulted in emitting different extracellular volatile metabolites. Specific metabolites, like 1-undecene (aerobic) and 2-undecanone (anaerobic), could be identified. The results are promising, in that the biofilm model may be applicable for the identification of P. aeruginosa under clinical conditions. Furthermore, the model could be the basis for studying extracellular volatile metabolites from different mono- or co-cultures of various bacteria, as well as the implementation of pulmonary conditions, like these in CF lungs.

In this study, bacterial community composition and the response of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) to ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, tetracycline, penicillin, and cephalosporin in overnight stagnant water were analyzed. With increases in heterotrophic bacteria plate count (HPC) during water stagnation, the numbers of ARB and the ARB/HPC ratios for the five antibiotics in resident water were observed to increase, which illustrated that the prevalence of ARB rose in the pipe network water during stagnation time (ST). Furthermore, during water stagnation for 12 h, an increase in bacteria related to fermentation was also observed. When the ST rose to 48 h, the fermentation bacteria become non-significant, and this was related to the exchange of pipe network water during daytime stagnation within the 48-h period. The antibiotic resistance index (ARI) showed that tetracycline had the highest resistance level in fresh water, and then decreased during water stagnation. When ST increased to 12 h, all ARI values of the five antibiotics were low, which was associated with changes in parameters during water retention and reduced resistance during short-term stagnation. When the ST increased to 24 and 48 h, the resistance to most antibiotics (except for tetracycline) increased, which showed that increasing antibiotic resistance is caused by the formation of biofilms in the pipeline during water stagnation.","authors":[{"name":"Minglu Zhang"},{"name":"Mengyao Xu"},{"name":"Shaofeng Xu"},{"name":"Lingyue Zhang"},{"name":"Kaizong Lin"},{"name":"Lei Zhang"},{"name":"Miao Bai"},{"name":"Can Zhang"},{"name":"He Zhou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"bacterial community composition"},{"word":"drinking water"},{"word":"heterotrophic plate count (HPC)"},{"word":"overnight stagnation"},{"word":"pipeline water"}]},"article64":{"pmid":"32197295","title":"Hyaluronic Acid Reduces Bacterial Fouling and Promotes Fibroblasts' Adhesion onto Chitosan 2D-Wound Dressings.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"Wound healing is a dynamic process that can be seriously delayed by many factors including infectious complications.

Then, we investigated the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PB against 100 S. mutans strains. The MIC range of PB was 9.8-312.5 µg/mL. PB suppressed the growth kinetics of S. mutans in a dose-dependent manner, even at sub-MICs of PB. Then, we investigated the effect of PB on S. mutans virulence. PB suppressed biofilm formation at high concentrations, although PB did not affect the expression of glucosyltransferase genes. Additionally, PB suppressed the decrease in pH from adding excess of glucose. The expression of genes responsible for acid production was increased by the addition of excess glucose without PB, whereas their expression levels were not increased in the presence of 1× and 2× MIC of PB.

The biofilm formation initiated by protein adsorption on surfaces limits the lifetime and safety of medical implants and tissue regenerative scaffolds. The development of biofouling resistant surfaces is therefore a major goal for the widespread uptake of nanomedicine. Here, we provide a relatively simple computational screening method based on the rational physically grounded criteria that may suffice in selection of surface grafted ligands for protein rejection, and test whether these criteria can be extrapolated from a specific protein to generic protein-resistant surfaces. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations we characterise four types of ligand functionalised surfaces at aqueous interfaces in terms of the surface hydrophobicity and ligand dynamics. We demonstrate how our hypothesised interfacial design based on the select physical characteristics of the ligated surfaces can enable the rejection of a protein from the surface. The ligand screening procedure and the detailed atomistic characterisation of the protein rejection process presented suggest that minimizing the adsorption of surface active proteins requires specific surface topographies and ligand chemistries that are able to maximise the entropic penalty associated with the restriction of the ligand dynamics and trapping interfacial water by adsorbed proteins.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Penna"},{"name":"Irene Yarovsky"}],"keywords":[]},"article72":{"pmid":"32195889","title":"Increased Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Formation on Biodegradable Poly(3-Hydroxybutyrate)-Implants Compared with Conventional Orthopedic Implants: An In Vitro Analysis.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"To compare the biofilm formation on a biodegradable material, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), with that on conventional titanium (Ti) and steel (St) implant material.","authors":[{"name":"Peter W Ferlic"},{"name":"Michael Liebensteiner"},{"name":"Michael Nogler"},{"name":"Annelie M Weinberg"},{"name":"Klaus-Dieter Kühn"},{"name":"Débora Coraça-Huber"}],"keywords":[]},"article73":{"pmid":"32195571","title":"Vancomycin Derivative Inactivates Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Induces Autophagy.","date":"2020-03-28","abs":"Vancomycin is a standard drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections.

Notoriously, some MDR microorganisms generate complex structures or biofilms, which adhere to surfaces and confer extraordinary resistance properties that are fundamental challenges to control infections. One of the promising strategies for the control of MDR bacteria is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), which takes advantage of suitable photosensitizers (PS), oxygen and radiation to eradicate microorganisms by the generation of highly reactive species, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause cytotoxic damage and cell death. Habitual aPDT treatments use only methylene blue (MB), but MDR microorganism eradication is not completely achieved. The key result of this study revealed that a combination of two known PSs, 6-carboxypterin (Cap, 100 μM) and MB (2.5-10 μM) exposed to ultraviolet and visible radiation, presents a synergistic effect on the eradication of a MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae strain. Similar effect was observed when the treatment was performed either with planktonic or biofilm growing cells. Moreover, it was found that after treatment the killing action continues in the absence of irradiation leading to the eradication of the microorganisms growing in biofilm.

A hallmark of BV is the presence of a highly structured polymicrobial biofilm on the vaginal epithelium, presumably initiated by facultative anaerobes of the genus Gardnerella, which then becomes a scaffold for other species to adhere to. One of the species often found incorporated in Gardnerella mediated biofilms is Atopobium vaginae. Interestingly, A. vaginae is very rarely found without the presence of Gardnerella. However, not much is known regarding the interactions between A. vaginae and Gardnerella species. This study assessed biological interactions between Gardnerella vaginalis and A. vaginae. In our in vitro model, by using specific Gardnerella and A. vaginae Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) probes, we confirmed that A. vaginae was able to incorporate a pre-formed G. vaginalis biofilm, accounting for up to 20% of the total number of biofilm cells. However, our findings showed that almost 92% of A. vaginae cells lost viability after 48 h of mono-species planktonic growth, but were able to maintain viability when co-cultured with Gardnerella or after pre-conditioning with cell-free supernatant of Gardnerella cultures. While the in vitro conditions are very different from the in vivo microenvironment, this study contributes to a better understanding of why A. vaginae vaginal colonization rarely occurs in the absence of Gardnerella.

However, bacteria growing in patients can encounter micro-environmental conditions that are different from aerated nutrient-rich broth used to grow planktonic cultures for MIC assays. These in vivo conditions may include oxygen and nutrient limitation which should arrest growth. Furthermore, Mab was shown to grow as biofilms in vivo. Here, we show Mab Bamboo, a clinical isolate we use for Mab drug discovery, can survive oxygen deprivation and nutrient starvation for extended periods of time in non-replicating states and developed an in vitro model where the bacterium grows as biofilm. Using these culture models, we show that non-replicating or biofilm-growing bacteria display tolerance to clinically used anti-Mab antibiotics, consistent with the observed persistence of infection in patients. To demonstrate the utility of the developed persister assays for drug discovery, we determined the effect of novel agents targeting membrane functions against these physiological forms of the bacterium and find that these compounds show anti-persister activity.

The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities strongly depend on the membrane permeation and self-assembling structure of these peptide amphiphiles. Gemini peptide amphiphile with highly polar arginine as spacer, 12-(Arg)4-12, self-assembles into short rods which are prone to dissociate into monomers to permeate and lysis membrane, leading to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and high efficiency in eradicating biofilm. Long rods formed by relatively weaker polar 12-(Lys)4-12 are less prone to disassemble into monomers for further membrane permeation, which make it selectively kill more negatively charged bacteria and endow it medium anti-biofilm activity. Low polar 12-(His)4-12 aggregates into long fibers which are very difficult to dissociate and they mainly electrostatically bind on the negative microbial surface, resulting in its weakest antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity.

Expanding biofilms are initially flat but later undergo a mechanical instability and become wrinkled. To gain mechanistic insights into this dynamic pattern-formation process, we developed a model that considers diffusion of nutrients and their uptake by bacteria, bacterial growth/biofilm matrix production, mechanical deformation of both the biofilm and the substrate, and the friction between them. Our model shows quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of biofilm expansion dynamics, and it accurately predicts two distinct spatiotemporal patterns observed in the experiments-the wrinkles initially appear either in the peripheral region and propagate inward (soft substrate/low friction) or in the central region and propagate outward (stiff substrate/high friction). Our results, which establish that nonuniform growth and friction are fundamental determinants of stress anisotropy and hence biofilm morphology, are broadly applicable to bacterial biofilms with similar morphologies and also provide insight into how other bacterial biofilms form distinct wrinkle patterns. We discuss the implications of forming undulated biofilm morphologies, which may enhance the availability of nutrients and signaling molecules and serve as a bet hedging strategy.","authors":[{"name":"Chenyi Fei"},{"name":"Sheng Mao"},{"name":"Jing Yan"},{"name":"Ricard Alert"},{"name":"Howard A Stone"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"},{"name":"Ned S Wingreen"},{"name":"Andrej Košmrlj"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio cholerae"},{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"chemomechanical model of growth"},{"word":"wrinkling instability"}]},"article83":{"pmid":"32193348","title":"Switching fatty acid metabolism by an RNA-controlled feed forward loop.","date":"2020-03-20","abs":"Hfq (host factor for phage Q beta) is key for posttranscriptional gene regulation in many bacteria.

Using colony-forming unit (CFU) assays, over 7 logs of inhibition (100%) was found for all the bacterial strains on the material of the OS-coated wound dressing and in the tissue under that dressing. Confocal laser scanning microscopy along with IVIS spectrum in vivo imaging confirmed the CFU results. Thus, the dressing acts as a reservoir for a biofilm, which causes wound infection. The same results were obtained after soaking the dressing in PBS at 37 °C for three months before use. These results suggest that an OS coating on polyester dressing is both effective and durable in blocking wound infection.","authors":[{"name":"Phat Tran"},{"name":"Tyler Enos"},{"name":"Keaton Luth"},{"name":"Abdul Hamood"},{"name":"Coby Ray"},{"name":"Kelly Mitchell"},{"name":"Ted W Reid"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-biofilm formation"},{"word":"dressing technology"},{"word":"organo-selenium"},{"word":"wound healing"}]},"article93":{"pmid":"32191760","title":"Adjunctive rifampin for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with deep infections: A meta-analysis.","date":"2020-03-25","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteremia (SAB) has high morbidity and mortality, with the development of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and the recognized shortcomings of vancomycin, its management is becoming more complicated.

Moreover, the ability to use extracellular electron transfer pathways is positively correlated with the number of cells within the conductive synthetic biofilm matrix. The Shewanella-containing composite remains stable for several days and shows electrochemical activity, indicating that the conductive backbone is capable of extracting the metabolic electrons produced by the bacteria under strictly anoxic conditions and conducting them to the anode.

We investigated Se concentrations in stream and riparian organisms to determine whether mining extent increased Se uptake in stream biofilms and insects and if these insects were effective Se biovectors to riparian spiders. Biofilm Se concentration increased (p = 0.006) with mining extent, reaching a maximum value of 16.5 μg/g of dw.

Even though Se concentrations in aquatic insects were significantly and positively related to mining extent, aquatic insect Se flux was not associated with mining extent because the mass of emerging insects did not change appreciably over the mining gradient. Insect and spider Se concentrations were among the highest reported in the literature, regularly exceeding the bird Se dietary risk threshold of 5 μg/g of dw.

Here, we report a whole-genome analysis of 233 V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from humans, diseased shrimp, and environmental samples collected between 2008 and 2017, providing unprecedented insight into the historical spread of AHPND. The results show that V. parahaemolyticus is genetically diverse and can be divided into 84 sequence types (STs). However, genomic analysis of three STs of V. parahaemolyticus identified seven transmission routes in Asia since 1996, which promoted the transfer of an AHPND-associated plasmid. Notably, the insertion sequence (ISVal1) from the plasmid subsequently mediated the genetic exchange among V. parahaemolyticus STs and resulted in the deletion of an 11-kb region regulating cell mobility and the production of capsular polysaccharides. Phenotype assays confirmed that this deletion enhanced biofilm formation, providing a novel mechanism for environmental adaptation. We conclude that the transmission mode of AHPND consists of two steps, the transmission of V. parahaemolyticus and the subsequent horizontal transfer of the AHPND-associated plasmid. This plasmid allows ISVal1 to mediate genetic exchange and improve pathogen fitness in shrimp ponds. Current shrimp farming practices promoted such genetic exchanges, which highlighted a risk of the emergence of new virulent populations, with potentially devastating consequences for both aquaculture and human health.

In these structures, the fungal milieu can play a protective function for bacteria as has recently been reported for C. albicans and a periodontal pathogen-Porphyromonas gingivalis. Our current study aimed to determine how this type of mutual microbe protection within the mixed biofilm affects the contacting host cells. To analyze C. albicans and P. gingivalis persistence and host infection, several models for host-biofilm interactions were developed, including microbial exposure to a representative monocyte cell line (THP1) and gingival fibroblasts isolated from periodontitis patients. For in vivo experiments, a mouse subcutaneous chamber model was utilized. The persistence of P. gingivalis cells was observed within mixed biofilm with C. albicans. This microbial co-existence influenced host immunity by attenuating macrophage and fibroblast responses. Cytokine and chemokine production decreased compared to pure bacterial infection. The fibroblasts isolated from patients with severe periodontitis were less susceptible to fungal colonization, indicating a modulation of the host environment by the dominating bacterial infection. The results obtained for the mouse model in which a sequential infection was initiated by the fungus showed that this host colonization induced a milder inflammation, leading to a significant reduction in mouse mortality. Moreover, high bacterial counts in animal organisms were noted on a longer time scale in the presence of C. albicans, suggesting the chronic nature of the dual-species infection.","authors":[{"name":"Dominika Bartnicka"},{"name":"Miriam Gonzalez-Gonzalez"},{"name":"Joanna Sykut"},{"name":"Joanna Koziel"},{"name":"Izabela Ciaston"},{"name":"Karina Adamowicz"},{"name":"Grazyna Bras"},{"name":"Marcin Zawrotniak"},{"name":"Justyna Karkowska-Kuleta"},{"name":"Dorota Satala"},{"name":"Andrzej Kozik"},{"name":"Edyta Zyla"},{"name":"Katarzyna Gawron"},{"name":"Katarzyna Lazarz-Bartyzel"},{"name":"Maria Chomyszyn-Gajewska"},{"name":"Maria Rapala-Kozik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Porphyromonas gingivalis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"fibroblasts"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"macrophages"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article118":{"pmid":"32183203","title":"Fate and Biofilm Formation of Wild-Type and Pressure-Stressed Pathogens of Public Health Concern in Surface Water and on Abiotic Surfaces.","date":"2020-03-18","abs":"Since the historic outbreak near Broad Street in London, which serves as cornerstone of modern epidemiology, infectious diseases spread in surface and sub-surface water has been a persisting public health challenge.

Cooperative biofilm formation by Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis was documented in vitro using growth models and scanning electron microscopy. Analysis of growth rates by species-specific 16s rRNA probes revealed distinct, early advantages to consortium growth for S. gordonii and F. nucleatum with P. gingivalis, while P. gingivalis upregulated its short mfa1 fimbriae, leading to increased invasion of DCs.

Pathogenesis in A. baumannii infections is an outcome of multiple virulence factors, including porins, capsules, and cell wall lipopolysaccharide, enzymes, biofilm production, motility, and iron-acquisition systems, among others. Such virulence factors help the organism to resist stressful environmental conditions and enable development of severe infections.

Through a wide array of antibiotic-hydrolyzing enzymes, efflux pump changes, impermeability, and antibiotic target mutations, A. baumannii models a unique ability to maintain a multidrug-resistant phenotype, further complicating treatment.

The role of HSPs in P. aeruginosa, however, remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we report the unique role of HSP DnaJ in biofilm formation and pathogenicity in P. aeruginosa. A dnaJ mutant produced hardly any pyocyanin and formed significantly less biofilms, which contributed to decreased pathogenicity as demonstrated by reduced mortality rate in a Drosophila melanogaster infection model. The reduced pyocyanin production in the dnaJ mutant was a result of the decreased transcription of phenazine synthesis operons including phzA1, phzA2, phzS, and phzM. The reduction of biofilm formation and initial adhesion in the dnaJ mutant could be reversed by exogenously added pyocyanin or extracellular DNA (eDNA). Consistent with such observations, absence of dnaJ significantly reduced the release of eDNA in P. aeruginosa and addition of exogenous pyocyanin could restore eDNA release. These results indicate dnaJ mutation caused reduced pyocyanin production, which in turn caused the decreased eDNA, resulting in decreased biofilm formation. DnaJ is required for pyocyanin production and full virulence in P. aeruginosa; it affects biofilm formation and initial adhesion via pyocyanin, inducing eDNA release.","authors":[{"name":"Bo Zeng"},{"name":"Chong Wang"},{"name":"Pansong Zhang"},{"name":"Zisheng Guo"},{"name":"Lin Chen"},{"name":"Kangmin Duan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"extracellular DNA (eDNA)"},{"word":"heat shock protein (HSP)"},{"word":"pyocyanin (PYO)"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article141":{"pmid":"32178236","title":"A Rapid Lysostaphin Production Approach and a Convenient Novel Lysostaphin Loaded Nano-emulgel; As a Sustainable Low-Cost Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Combating Platform.","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that is capable of infecting almost every organ in the human body.

Motility and biofilm formation are inversely regulated by the second messenger molecule cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). Therefore, we sought to define the flagellum-associated c-di-GMP-mediated signaling pathways that regulate the transition from a motile to a sessile state. Here we report that elimination of the flagellum, via loss of the FlaA flagellin, results in a flagellum-dependent biofilm regulatory (FDBR) response, which elevates cellular c-di-GMP levels, increases biofilm gene expression, and enhances biofilm formation. The strength of the FDBR response is linked with status of the flagellar stator: it can be reversed by deletion of the T ring component MotX, and reduced by mutations altering either the Na+ binding ability of the stator or the Na+ motive force. Absence of the stator also results in reduction of mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) pilus levels on the cell surface, suggesting interconnectivity of signal transduction pathways involved in biofilm formation. Strains lacking flagellar rotor components similarly launched an FDBR response, however this was independent of the status of assembly of the flagellar stator. We found that the FDBR response requires at least three specific diguanylate cyclases that contribute to increased c-di-GMP levels, and propose that activation of biofilm formation during this response relies on c-di-GMP-dependent activation of positive regulators of biofilm production. Together our results dissect how flagellum assembly activates c-di-GMP signaling circuits, and how V. cholerae utilizes these signals to transition from a motile to a sessile state.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel C Wu"},{"name":"David Zamorano-Sánchez"},{"name":"Fernando A Pagliai"},{"name":"Jin Hwan Park"},{"name":"Kyle A Floyd"},{"name":"Calvin K Lee"},{"name":"Giordan Kitts"},{"name":"Christopher B Rose"},{"name":"Eric M Bilotta"},{"name":"Gerard C L Wong"},{"name":"Fitnat H Yildiz"}],"keywords":[]},"article143":{"pmid":"32176550","title":"Porphyromonas gingivalis Induces Insulin Resistance by Increasing BCAA Levels in Mice.","date":"2020-03-16","abs":"Insulin resistance is one of the critical pathogeneses of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Elevated levels of plasma branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with insulin resistance. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the development of insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms by which P. gingivalis induces insulin resistance are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether P. gingivalis induces insulin resistance through BCAA biosynthesis. We established a murine model of periodontitis by infecting mice with P. gingivalis. Alveolar bone loss, insulin sensitivity, and the plasma level of BCAAs were measured. A P. gingivalis BCAA aminotransferase-deficient strain (∆bcat) was constructed, and its kinetic growth, biofilm formation, and in vivo colonization were compared with its wild-type strain. Alveolar bone loss, insulin sensitivity, and the plasma level of BCAAs of the mice infected with either wild-type strain or ∆bcat strain were further measured. We found that periodontal infection with P. gingivalis significantly upregulated the plasma level of BCAAs and aggravated the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance. Bcat deletion did not alter the growth, biofilm formation, and in vivo colonization of P. gingivalis. More important, the ∆bcat strain was unable to upregulate the plasma level of BCAAs and induce insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. These findings suggest that the BCAA biosynthesis of P. gingivalis plays a critical role in the development of insulin resistance in the HFD-fed mice. The BCAA biosynthesis pathways may provide a potential target for the disruption of linkage between periodontitis and T2DM.","authors":[{"name":"J Tian"},{"name":"C Liu"},{"name":"X Zheng"},{"name":"X Jia"},{"name":"X Peng"},{"name":"R Yang"},{"name":"X Zhou"},{"name":"X Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"alveolar bone loss"},{"word":"blood glucose"},{"word":"branched-chain amino acids"},{"word":"diabetes mellitus"},{"word":"high-fat diet"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article144":{"pmid":"32176238","title":"Microbiological study of the subgingival biofilm in HIV+/HAART patients at a specialized dental service.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"The aim of this study was to describe the microbiological profile of HIV patients under highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART).

Clinical dental examination was performed by a calibrated researcher using standard dental instruments to determine probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BOP).

The present investigation aimed to quantify the impact of hyperglycemia on host-bacterial interactions in established periodontitis and to map shifts in these dynamics following mechanical nonsurgical therapy. Seventeen T2DM and 17 non-T2DM subjects with generalized severe chronic periodontitis were recruited along with 20 periodontally healthy individuals. Subjects with periodontitis were treated with scaling and root planing (SRP). Samples of subgingival biofilm and gingival crevicular fluid were collected at baseline and at 1-, 3-, and 6 mo postoperatively. Correlations were generated between 13.7 million 16S ribosomal DNA sequences and 8 immune mediators. Intermicrobial and host-microbial interactions were modeled using differential network analysis. Periodontal health was characterized by a sparse interbacterial and highly connected cytokine-bacterial network, while both normoglycemics and T2DM subjects with periodontitis demonstrated robust congeneric and intergeneric hubs but significantly fewer cytokine-bacterial connections. Following SRP, the cytokine-bacterial edges demonstrated a 2-fold increase 1 mo postoperatively and a 10-fold increase at 6 mo in normoglycemics. In hyperglycemics, there was a doubling at 1 mo but no further changes thereafter. These shifts accompanied an increasingly sparse interbacterial network. In normoglycemics, the nodes anchored by interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and IL-10 demonstrated greatest rewiring, while in hyperglycemics, IL-1β, IL-6, INF-γ, and IL-17 exhibited progressive rewiring. Thus, the present investigation points to a breakdown in host-bacterial mutualism in periodontitis, with interbacterial interactions rather than host-bacterial interactions primarily determining community assembly. Hyperglycemia further exacerbates this uncoupled mutualism. Our data also demonstrate that while nonsurgical therapy might not consistently alter microbial abundances or lower proinflammatory molecules, it reboots the interaction between the immunoinflammatory system and the newly colonizing microbiome, restoring a role for the immune system in determining bacterial colonization. However, this outcome is lower and delayed in hyperglycemics.","authors":[{"name":"P S Kumar"},{"name":"M F Monteiro"},{"name":"S M Dabdoub"},{"name":"G L Miranda"},{"name":"M Z Casati"},{"name":"F V Ribeiro"},{"name":"F R Cirano"},{"name":"S P Pimentel"},{"name":"R C V Casarin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S"},{"word":"cytokine"},{"word":"diabetes"},{"word":"interactome"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article146":{"pmid":"32175636","title":"A multi-model regime for evaluating effectiveness of antimicrobial wound care products in microbial biofilms.","date":"2020-03-16","abs":"Microbial biofilms have become increasingly recognized as a cause of wound chronicity. There are several topical antimicrobial wound care products available for use, however their effectiveness has routinely been demonstrated with planktonic microorganisms. There is no target reference value for antimicrobial effectiveness of wound care products in biofilm models. In addition, data on antimicrobial activity of products in biofilm models is scattered across many test methods in a variety of studies. The aim of this work is to directly compare commercial products containing the commonly used topical antimicrobial agents iodine, silver, PHMB, octenidine, hypochlorous acid, benzalkonium chloride, and a surfactant based topical containing poloxamer 188. Five different in vitro biofilm models of varied complexity were used, incorporating several bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. The fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Candida auris were also evaluated. A multispecies bacterial biofilm model was also used to evaluate the products. Additionally, C. albicans was used in combination with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in a multikingdom version of the polymicrobial biofilm model. Statistically significant differences in antimicrobial performance were observed between treatments in each model and changing microbial growth conditions or combinations of organisms resulted in significant performance differences for some treatments. The iodine and benzalkonium chloride containing products were overall the most effective in vitro and were then selected for in vivo evaluation in an infected immunocompromised murine model. Unexpectedly, the iodine product was statistically (P > 0.05) no different than the untreated control, while the benzalkonium chloride containing product significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the biofilm compared to untreated control. This body of work demonstrates the importance of not only evaluating antimicrobial wound care products in biofilm models, but also the importance of using several different models to gain a comprehensive understanding of products' effectiveness.

To understand how the acidic environment (pH 4) and progesterone (either alone and in combination) modulate C. albicans response during formation of biofilm, a transcriptomic analysis was performed together with characterization of the biofilm properties. Compared to planktonic cells, acidic biofilm-cells exhibited major changes in their transcriptome, including modifications in the expression of 286 genes that were not previously associated with biofilm formation in C. albicans. The vast majority of the genes up-regulated in the acidic biofilm cells (including those uniquely identified in our study) are known targets of Sfl1, and consistently, Sfl1 deletion is herein shown to impair the formation of acidic biofilms (pH 4). Under the acidic conditions used, the presence of progesterone reduced C. albicans biofilm biomass and structural cohesion. Transcriptomic analysis of biofilms developed in the presence of progesterone led to the identification of 65 down-regulated genes including, among others, the regulator Tec1 and several of its target genes, suggesting that the function of this transcription factor is inhibited by the presence of the hormone. Additionally, progesterone reduced the susceptibility of biofilm cells to fluconazole, consistent with an up-regulation of efflux pumps. Overall, the results of this study show that progesterone modulates C. albicans biofilm formation and genomic expression under acidic conditions, which may have implications for C. albicans pathogenicity in the vaginal environment.","authors":[{"name":"Bruna Gonçalves"},{"name":"Ruben Bernardo"},{"name":"Can Wang"},{"name":"Markus S Schröder"},{"name":"Nuno A Pedro"},{"name":"Geraldine Butler"},{"name":"Joana Azeredo"},{"name":"Mariana Henriques"},{"name":"Nuno Pereira Mira"},{"name":"Sónia Silva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm regulators"},{"word":"Expression profile"},{"word":"Vaginal environment"},{"word":"Vulvovaginal candidiasis"}]},"article156":{"pmid":"32172878","title":"Controlled size green synthesis of bioactive silver nanoparticles assisted by chitosan and its derivatives and their application in biofilm preparation.","date":"2020-03-16","abs":"The aim of this work was to explore the effect of various molecular weight (Mw) chitosan depolymerization products (CDP) on the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and chitosan/AgNPs blend films production.

Physical-chemical properties of dental material surfaces can affect salivary pellicle formation and bacteria attachment, but relationships between these properties have been understudied. We aimed to assess the effects of surface properties and adsorbed salivary pellicle on Streptococcus gordonii adhesion to traditional dental materials. Adsorption of salivary pellicle from one donor on gold, stainless steel, alumina and zirconia was monitored with a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and water contact angles measurement before and after pellicle adsorption. Visualization and quantification of Live/Dead stained bacteria and scanning electron microscopy were used to study S. gordonii attachment to materials with and without pellicle. The work of adhesion between surfaces and bacteria was also determined. Adsorption kinetics and the final thickness of pellicle formed on the four materials were similar. Pellicle deposition on all materials increased surface hydrophilicity, surface energy and work of adhesion with bacteria. Surfaces with pellicle had significantly more attached bacteria than surfaces without pellicle, but the physical-chemical properties of the dental material did not significantly alter bacteria attachment. Our findings suggested that the critical factor increasing S. gordonii attachment was the salivary pellicle formed on dental materials. This is attributed to increased work of adhesion between bacteria and substrates with pellicle.

Our main objective is to dope PK on ZnONPs to reduced zinc-oxide toxicity but increased anti-bacterial and anti-biofilms activity. In present study, we showed that, functions of zinc oxide nanoparticles with pancreatin enzyme (ZnONPs-PK) have anti-bacterial, anti-biofilms, anti-motility and anti-virulence properties against MRSA. Moreover, ZnONPs-PK were more potent to eradicate MRSA than only ZnONPs and PK. Application of the produced nano-composites as treatment on infected swine dermis predominantly reflects the potential treatment property of it. The vancomycin sensitivity of MRSA was significantly increased on application with ZnONPs-PK. Further study revealed cell membrane was the target of the ZnONPs-PK and that leads to oxidative damage of the cells.

Intimate coupling of photocatalysis and biodegradation (ICPB) as a novel wastewater treatment method, which combines the advantages of biological treatment and photocatalytic reactions, has shown a great potential as a low-cost, environmental friendly and sustainable treatment technology. The system mainly consists of photocatalytic materials, porous carriers and biofilm. The key principle of ICPB is to transform bio-recalcitrant pollutants into biodegradable products by photocatalysis on the surface of porous carriers. The biodegradable products were mineralized simultaneously through the biofilm inside the carriers. Because of the protection of the carriers, the microorganism can remain active even under the UV-light, the mechanical force of water flow or the attack of free radicals. ICPB breaks the traditional concept that photocatalytic reaction and biodegradation must be separated in different reactors, improves the purification capacity of sewage and saves the cost.

Previous studies have highlighted Candida albicans host tissue infection as a risk factor in the initiation and progression of oral cancer. C. albicans invasion induces several cancerous hallmarks, such as activation of proto-oncogenes, induction of DNA damage and overexpression of inflammatory signalling pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these responses remain unclear. A recently discovered fungal toxin peptide, candidalysin has been reported as an essential molecule in epithelial damage and host recognition of C. albicans infection. Candidalysin has a clear role in inflammasome activation and induction of cell damage. Several inflammatory molecules such as IL-6, IL-17, NLRP3 and GM-CSF have been linked to carcinogenesis. Candidalysin is encoded by the ECE1 gene, which has been linked to virulence factors of C. albicans such as adhesion, biofilm formation and filamentation properties. This review discusses the recent epidemiological burden of oral cancer and highlights the significance of the ECE1 gene and the ECE1 protein breakdown product, candidalysin in oral malignancy. The immunological and molecular mechanisms behind oral malignancy induced by inflammation and the role of the toxic fungal peptide candidalysin in oral carcinogenesis are explored.

In this context, the aim of our study was to evaluate the extent to which biofouling affects the properties and toxicity of microplastics. Cosmetic polyethylene microbeads were incubated in stream water for four weeks resulting in biofouling and aging. Subsequently, the changes in properties (sinking, particle size, adsorption, and leaching of model metal - silver) and the microplastics toxicity to daphnids Daphnia magna and duckweed Lemna minor were evaluated. Pristine microplastics did not affect daphnids but they significantly affected the root growth of duckweed. On the other hand, reference natural particles (beech sawdust) did not show any negative effects. We observed significant differences in the properties of aged versus pristine microplastics. When compared to pristine microplastics, aged microplastics adsorbed more silver and the subsequent leaching of silver was more intensive, especially in the medium with an acidic pH. Microplastics with adsorbed silver had a high ecotoxicological potential and at environmentally relevant concentrations affected both daphnids and duckweed. This study suggests that biofouling is an important parameter that affects microplastics properties, pollutant adsorption and release into the environment, and toxicity. Overall, there are significant alterations of the microplastics properties, behaviour, and fate in the environment.","authors":[{"name":"Gabriela Kalčíková"},{"name":"Tina Skalar"},{"name":"Gregor Marolt"},{"name":"Anita Jemec Kokalj"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adsorption"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Leaching"},{"word":"Macrophytes"},{"word":"Metals"},{"word":"Microbeads"}]},"article180":{"pmid":"32169685","title":"A synergistic association between adhesion-related genes and multidrug resistance patterns of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from different patients and healthy individuals.","date":"2020-03-14","abs":"Biofilm -forming capacity of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as a commensal opportunistic bacterial species induce a growth in antibiotic resistance in chronic diseases.

The bio-ecology of this species remains to be elucidated in several dimensions, including gut microbiota that is nowadays recognized as a fundamental component of mammals. In this work, we investigated the gut microbiota of this herpestid by single-molecule real-time sequencing of twenty paired male (n = 10) and female (n = 10) intestinal samples. This culture-independent approach enabled microbial profiling based on 16S rDNA and investigation of taxonomical and functional features. The core gut microbiome of the adult subpopulation was dominated by Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Eight genera were uniquely found in adults and five in non-adults. When comparing gut bacterial communities across sex, four genera were exclusive of females and six uniquely found in males. Despite these compositional distinctions, alpha- and beta-diversity analyses showed no statistically significant differences across sex or between adult and non-adult specimens. However, when function was inferred, males presented a significantly higher abundance of amino acid and citrate cycle metabolic pathways, compared to the significant overrepresentation in females of galactose metabolic pathways. Additionally, adults exhibited a significantly higher abundance of cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance pathways, while non-adults bared a significant overrepresentation of two-component systems associated with antibiotic synthesis, flagellin and biofilm production, and chemotaxis control. This study adds new insights into the mongoose bio-ecology palette, highlighting taxonomical and functional microbiome dissimilarities across sex and age classes, possibly related to primary production resources and life-history traits that impact on behavior and diet.","authors":[{"name":"André C Pereira"},{"name":"Victor Bandeira"},{"name":"Carlos Fonseca"},{"name":"Mónica V Cunha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Egyptian mongoose"},{"word":"Mediterranean wild carnivores"},{"word":"bio-ecology"},{"word":"gut microbiota"},{"word":"microbial profiling"}]},"article186":{"pmid":"32168960","title":"Variation in the Occurrence of fimA Genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis in Periodontal Health and Disease.","date":"2020-03-16","abs":"Porphyromonas gingivalis is regarded as a keystone pathogen in periodontitis.

Next, the tertiary amine groups of the polymer brushes were modified via a quaternization reaction, using alkyl halides, to obtain the cationic polymers. The polymer films were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, and water contact angle measurements. The effect of the ACL of the quaternary ammonium groups on the physicochemical properties of the films as well as the contact killing efficiency of the surfaces against representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was investigated. A hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition of the surfaces and a significant decrease of the degree of quaternization of the DMAEMA moieties was found upon increasing the ACL of the quaternization agent above six carbon atoms, allowing the wettability, the thickness, and the pH-response of the brushes to be tuned via a facile postpolymerization, quaternization reaction. At the same time, antimicrobial tests revealed that the hydrophilic polymer brushes exhibited enhanced bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus, whereas the hydrophobic surfaces showed a significant deterioration of the in vitro bactericidal performance.

Given its novelty, uncertainties exist regarding processes responsible for the pollutant removal and microbial activity within the systems. Genetic characterization of microbial communities of METlands is desirable, but it is a time and resource consuming. An alternative, is the functional analysis based on community-level physiological profile (CLPP), which allows to evaluate the diversity of microbial communities based on the carbon consumption patterns and derived indexes (average well color development - AWCD -, richness, and diversity). This study aimed to characterize the microbial community function of laboratory-scale METlands using the CLPP method. It encompassed the analysis of planted and non-planted set-ups of two carbon-based electroconductive materials (Coke-A and Coke-LSN) colonized with electroactive biofilms, and compared to Sand-filled columns. Variations in the microbial metabolic activity were found to depend on the characteristics of the material rather than to the presence of plants. Coke-A systems showed lower values of AWCD, richness, and diversity than Sand and Coke-LSN systems. This suggests that Coke-A systems provided more favorable conditions for the development of relatively homogeneous microbial biofilms. Additionally, typical parameters of water quality were measured and correlations between utilization of carbon sources and removal of pollutants were established.

In this study, biogenic AgNPs were synthesized with extracellular metabolites secreted by the soil fungal strain Fusarium scirpi (Ag0.5-5) by an ecofriendly, simple and efficient method. The antimicrobial activity of the biosynthesized AgNPs against UPEC was evaluated. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of biogenic AgNPs over planktonic UPEC cells was 25 mg/mL, whereas a sub-MIC concentration (7.5 mg/L) was sufficient to inhibit the UPEC-biofilm formation about a 97%, or produce the disruption of an 80% of mature UPEC-biofilms demonstrating the potential of fungal-derived AgNPs to prevent UPEC infections.","authors":[{"name":"Candelario Rodríguez-Serrano"},{"name":"Jesús Guzmán-Moreno"},{"name":"Carlos Ángeles-Chávez"},{"name":"Vicente Rodríguez-González"},{"name":"José Juan Ortega-Sigala"},{"name":"Rosa María Ramírez-Santoyo"},{"name":"Luz Elena Vidales-Rodríguez"}],"keywords":[]},"article207":{"pmid":"32163399","title":"[In silico Screening of Flavones and its Derivatives as Potential Inhibitors of Quorum-Sensing Regulator LasR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa].","date":"2020-03-12","abs":"Antibiotic resistance is a global problem nowadays and in 2017 the World Health Organization published the list of bacteria for which treatment are urgently needed, where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is of critical priority. Current therapies lack efficacy because this organism creates biofilms conferring increased resistance to antibiotics and host immune responses. The strategy is to not kill, but disarm the pathogen and resistance will be developed slowly. It has been shown that LasI/LasR system is the main component of the quorum sensing system in P. aeruginosa. LasR is activated by the interaction with its native autoinducer. A lot flavones and their derivatives are used as antibacterial drug compounds. The purpose is to search compounds that will inhibit LasR. This leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of virulence factors thus the bacteria will be vulnerable and not virulent. We performed virtual screening using AutoDock Vina, rDock, LeDock for obtaining consensus predictions. The results of virtual screening suggest benzamides which are synthetical derivatives of flavones as potential inhibitors of transcriptional regulator LasR. These are consistent with recently published experimental data, which demonstrate the high antibacterial activity of benzamides. The compounds interact with the ligand binding domain of LasR with higher binding affinity than with DNA binding domain. Among the selected compounds, by conformational analysis, it was found that there are compounds that bind to the same amino acids of ligand binding domain as the native autoinducer. This could indicate the possibility of competitive interaction of these compounds. A number of compounds that bind to other conservative amino acids ligand binding domain have also been discovered, which will be of interest for further study. Selected compounds meet the criteria necessary for their consideration as drugs and can serve as a basis for conducting further in vitro/in vivo experiments.

Linkages between skin microbes, biofilms and disease have not been well established although single-species biofilm formation by skin microbiota in vitro has been extensively studied. Consequently, the purpose of this work was to optimize and validate a simple polymicrobial biofilm keratinocyte model for investigating commensal, pathogen and keratinocyte interactions and for evaluating therapeutic agents or health promoting interventions. The model incorporates the commensals (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus) and pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) which form robust polymicrobial biofilms on immortalized keratinocytes (HaCat cells). We observed that the commensals reduce the damage caused to the keratinocyte monolayer by either pathogen. When the commensals were combined with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, much thinner biofilms were observed than those formed by the pathogens alone. When P. aeruginosa was inoculated with S. epidermidis in the presence or absence of M. luteus, the commensals formed a layer between the keratinocytes and pathogen. Although S. aureus completely inhibited the growth of M. luteus in dual-species biofilms, inclusion of S. epidermidis in triple or quadruple species biofilms, enabled M. luteus to retain viability. Using this polymicrobial biofilm keratinocyte model, we demonstrate that a quorum sensing (QS) deficient S. aureus agr mutant, in contrast to the parent, failed to damage the keratinocyte monolayer unless supplied with the exogenous cognate autoinducing peptide. In addition, we show that treatment of the polymicrobial keratinocyte model with nanoparticles containing an inhibitor of the PQS QS system reduced biofilm thickness and P. aeruginosa localization in mono- and polymicrobial biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Elena Jordana-Lluch"},{"name":"Vanina Garcia"},{"name":"Alexander D H Kingdon"},{"name":"Nishant Singh"},{"name":"Cameron Alexander"},{"name":"Paul Williams"},{"name":"Kim R Hardie"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Micrococcus luteus"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Staphylococcus"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"keratinocyte"},{"word":"polymicrobial biofilm"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"skin infections"}]},"article212":{"pmid":"32161474","title":"The Battle of Probiotics and Their Derivatives Against Biofilms.","date":"2020-03-15","abs":"Biofilm-related infections have been a major clinical problem and include chronic infections, device-related infections and malfunction of medical devices.

Biofilms have enormous medical and environmental impact; consequently, the factors that influence biofilm formation are an important area of study. In this investigation, the roles of two cold shock proteins (CSP) during biofilm formation were investigated in Salmonella Typhimurium, which is a major foodborne pathogen. Among all CSP transcripts studied, the expression of cspE (STM14_0732) was higher during biofilm growth. The cspE deletion strain (ΔcspE) did not form biofilms on a cholesterol coated glass surface; however, complementation with WT cspE, but not the F30V mutant, was able to rescue this phenotype. Transcript levels of other CSPs demonstrated up-regulation of cspA (STM14_4399) in ΔcspE. The cspA deletion strain (ΔcspA) did not affect biofilm formation; however, ΔcspEΔcspA exhibited higher biofilm formation compared to ΔcspE. Most likely, the higher cspA amounts in ΔcspE reduced biofilm formation, which was corroborated using cspA over-expression studies. Further functional studies revealed that ΔcspE and ΔcspEΔcspA exhibited slow swimming but no swarming motility.

Despite efficient host immune system, the implant surface can be rapidly occupied by bacteria, resulting in infection persistence, implant failure, and even death of the patients. It is difficult to cope with these problems because bacteria exhibit complex adhesion mechanisms to the implants that vary according to bacterial strains. Different biomaterial coatings have been produced to release antibiotics to kill bacteria. However, antibiotic resistance occurs very frequently. Stimuli-responsive biomaterials have gained much attention in recent years ​but are not effective enough in killing the pathogens because of the complex mechanisms in bacteria. This review is focused on the development of highly efficient and specifically targeted biomaterials that release the antimicrobial agents or respond to bacteria on demands in body. The mechanisms of bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance are discussed, and the released substances accounting for implant infection are described. Strategies that have been used in past for the eradication of bacterial infections are also discussed. Different types of stimuli can be triggered only upon the existence of bacteria, leading to the release of antibacterial molecules that in turn kill the bacteria. In particular, the toxin-triggered, pH-responsive, and dual stimulus-responsive adaptive antibacterial biomaterials are introduced.

Therefore, the current investigation introduced a new mouse model of periodontal disease to examine the effects of a polymicrobial infection on periodontal ligament (PDL) properties, changes in bone loss, the host immune response, and the microbiome/virome using shotgun sequencing. Periodontal pathogens, namely Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were used as the polymicrobial oral inoculum in BALB/cByJ mice. The polymicrobial infection triggered significant alveolar bone loss, a heightened antibody response, an elevated cytokine immune response, a significant shift in viral diversity and virome composition, and a widening of the PDL space; the latter two findings have not been previously reported in periodontal disease models. Changes in the PDL space were present at sites far away from the site of insult, indicating that the polymicrobial radius of effect extends beyond the bone loss areas and site of initial infection and wider than previously appreciated. Associations were found between bone loss, specific viral and bacterial species, immune genes, and PDL space changes.

LecB has a tetrameric structure with four opposing binding sites and has been shown to act as a cross-linker. Here, we demonstrate that LecB strongly binds to the glycosylated moieties of β1-integrins on the basolateral plasma membrane of epithelial cells and causes rapid integrin endocytosis. Whereas internalized integrins were degraded via a lysosomal pathway, washout of LecB restored integrin cell surface localization, thus indicating a specific and direct action of LecB on integrins to bring about their endocytosis. Interestingly, LecB was able to trigger uptake of active and inactive β1-integrins and also of complete α3β1-integrin-laminin complexes. We provide a mechanistic explanation for this unique endocytic process by showing that LecB has the additional ability to recognize fucose-bearing glycosphingolipids and causes the formation of membrane invaginations on giant unilamellar vesicles. In cells, LecB recruited integrins to these invaginations by cross-linking integrins and glycosphingolipids. In epithelial wound healing assays, LecB specifically cleared integrins from the surface of cells located at the wound edge and blocked cell migration and wound healing in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the wild-type P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 was able to loosen cell-substrate adhesion in order to crawl underneath exposed cells, whereas knockout of LecB significantly reduced crawling events. Based on these results, we suggest that LecB has a role in disseminating bacteria along the cell-basement membrane interface.","authors":[{"name":"Roland Thuenauer"},{"name":"Alessia Landi"},{"name":"Anne Trefzer"},{"name":"Silke Altmann"},{"name":"Sarah Wehrum"},{"name":"Thorsten Eierhoff"},{"name":"Britta Diedrich"},{"name":"Jörn Dengjel"},{"name":"Alexander Nyström"},{"name":"Anne Imberty"},{"name":"Winfried Römer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial infection"},{"word":"epithelial cells"},{"word":"fucose"},{"word":"glycosphingolipids"},{"word":"glycosylation"},{"word":"integrins"},{"word":"laminin"},{"word":"membrane invagination"}]},"article230":{"pmid":"32156823","title":"Cyclic di-GMP Signaling in Bacillus subtilis Is Governed by Direct Interactions of Diguanylate Cyclases and Cognate Receptors.","date":"2020-03-20","abs":"Bacillus subtilis contains two known cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP)-dependent receptors, YdaK and DgrA, as well as three diguanylate cyclases (DGCs): soluble DgcP and membrane-integral DgcK and DgcW. DgrA regulates motility, while YdaK is responsible for the formation of a putative exopolysaccharide, dependent on the activity of DgcK. Using single-molecule tracking, we show that a majority of DgcK molecules are statically positioned in the cell membrane but significantly less so in the absence of YdaK but more so upon overproduction of YdaK. The soluble domains of DgcK and of YdaK show a direct interaction in vitro, which depends on an intact I-site within the degenerated GGDEF domain of YdaK. These experiments suggest a direct handover of a second messenger at a single subcellular site. Interestingly, all three DGC proteins contribute toward downregulation of motility via the PilZ protein DgrA. Deletion of dgrA also affects the mobility of DgcK within the membrane and also that of DgcP, which arrests less often at the membrane in the absence of DgrA. Both, DgcK and DgcP interact with DgrA in vitro, showing that divergent as well as convergent direct connections exist between cyclases and their effector proteins. Automated determination of molecule numbers in live cells revealed that DgcK and DgcP are present at very low copy numbers of 6 or 25 per cell, respectively, such that for DgcK, a part of the cell population does not contain any DgcK molecule, rendering signaling via c-di-GMP extremely efficient.","authors":[{"name":"Sandra Kunz"},{"name":"Anke Tribensky"},{"name":"Wieland Steinchen"},{"name":"Luis Oviedo-Bocanegra"},{"name":"Patricia Bedrunka"},{"name":"Peter L Graumann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"cyclic-di-GMP signaling"},{"word":"second messenger"},{"word":"signal transduction"},{"word":"single-molecule dynamics"},{"word":"single-molecule tracking"}]},"article231":{"pmid":"32156820","title":"A Shift in Central Metabolism Accompanies Virulence Activation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"The availability of energy has significant impact on cell physiology.

The innovation points of the study were as follows: (1) To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the few to investigate the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics in mariculture environments along the Yellow Sea coast; (2) Biofilms, a focus of the study, might act as a sink for antibiotics in the aquaculture ecosystem; and (3) The correlation of heavy metals and antibiotic concentrations was proved, which could correspondingly be used as an indicator for antibiotic concentrations in the studied area. The levels of antibiotics in water were observed to be relatively low, at the ng/L level. Trimethoprim was the most prevalent antibiotic, and was detected in all water samples. Oxytetracycline was detected at high concentrations in biofilms (up to 1478.29 ng/g). Moreover, biofilms exhibited a higher antibiotic accumulation capacity compared to sediments. Concentrations of oxytetracycline and doxycycline were high in feed, while other antibiotics were almost undetected. Tetracycline was widely detected and the concentration of enrofloxacin was highest in organisms. Correlation analysis demonstrated that environmental parameters and other coexisting contaminants (e.g. heavy metals) significantly affected antibiotic concentrations. In addition, the concentration of Zn was significantly correlated with the total antibiotic concentration and was proportional to several antibiotics in water and sediment (biofilm) samples (p < 0.01). High Mn concentrations were closely related to total and individual (e.g. sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine and enrofloxacin) antibiotic levels, which may result in the combined contamination of the environment. Antibiotics in estuaries and groundwater generally originated from aquaculture wastewater and untreated/treated domestic sewage. Most of the detected antibiotics posed no risk to the environment. Ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin found in water may present high ecological and resistance risks, while the two antibiotics observed to accumulate in fish may pose a considerable risk to human health through diet consumption.

Morphology of the pathogenic cells was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Anti-biofilm was investigated using crystal violet assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).

APC inhibited biofilm formation of C. albicans more efficiently than that of the bacterial cells. Cell morphology from SEM indicated that APC caused bacterial cell membrane destruction and inhibited fungal budding or tubing formation. CLSM images confirmed the killing potential of APC and suggested that bacterial dead cells could be easier washed out than the fungal dead cells.

Highly adhesive strains are resistant to a wide range of antibacterial preparations used clinically. Penicillins were the most effective preparations when analyzing antibioticograms obtained for highly adhesive strains, for medium adhesive strains - penicillins, aminoglycosides and carbapenems, for low adhesive ones - aminoglycosides, penicillins, carbapenems, monobactams, quinolones. P. aeruginosa multi-resistance is a serious problem in the treatment of patients with chronic osteomyelitis. Spreading antibiotic-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa is associated with the presence of bacteria in the biofilm. Since adhesion is the first step in the biofilm formation, it is important to identify strains having high adhesive ability timely.","authors":[{"name":"I V Shipitsyna"},{"name":"E V Osipova"},{"name":"E N Ovchinnikov"},{"name":"D S Leonchuk"}],"keywords":[{"word":"P. aeruginosa (pyocyanic) infection"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chronic osteomyelitis"}]},"article242":{"pmid":"32154728","title":"Resistance to Long-Term Bacterial Biofilm Formation Based on Hydrolysis-Induced Zwitterion Material with Biodegradable and Self-Healing Properties.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"Long-term resistance of biomaterials to the bacterial biofilm formation without antibiotic or biocide is highly demanded for biomedical applications.

Although the current recommended Lyme antibiotic treatment is effective for the majority of Lyme disease patients, about 10-20% of patients continue to suffer from persisting symptoms. There have been various anecdotal reports on the use of herbal extracts for treating patients with persisting symptoms with varying degree of improvements. However, it is unclear whether the effect of the herb products is due to their direct antimicrobial activity or their effect on host immune system. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial effects of 12 commonly used botanical medicines and three other natural antimicrobial agents for potential anti-Borrelia burgdorferi activity in vitro. Among them, 7 natural product extracts at 1% were found to have good activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi culture compared to the control antibiotics doxycycline and cefuroxime. These active botanicals include Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, Juglans nigra (Black walnut), Polygonum cuspidatum (Japanese knotweed), Artemisia annua (Sweet wormwood), Uncaria tomentosa (Cat's claw), Cistus incanus, and Scutellaria baicalensis (Chinese skullcap). In contrast, Stevia rebaudiana, Andrographis paniculata, Grapefruit seed extract, colloidal silver, monolaurin, and antimicrobial peptide LL37 had little or no activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of Artemisia annua, Juglans nigra, and Uncaria tomentosa were quite high for growing B. burgdorferi, despite their strong activity against the non-growing stationary phase B. burgdorferi. On the other hand, the top two active herbs, Cryptolepis sanguinolenta and Polygonum cuspidatum, showed strong activity against both growing B. burgdorferi (MIC = 0.03-0.06% and 0.25-0.5%, respectively) and non-growing stationary phase B. burgdorferi. In subculture studies, only 1% Cryptolepis sanguinolenta extract caused complete eradication, while doxycycline and cefuroxime and other active herbs could not eradicate B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells as many spirochetes were visible after 21-day subculture. Further studies are needed to identify the active constituents of the effective botanicals and evaluate their combinations for more effective eradication of B. burgdorferi in vitro and in vivo.

However, depletion of the intestinal microbiota (Dysbiosis) following antibiotic treatment facilitates the colonization of the intestinal tract by Multidrug-Resistant P. aeruginosa. One possible strategy is based on the use of functional foods with prebiotic activity. The bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin and its hydrolyzed form (fructooligosaccharide: FOS) is well established since they promote the growth of specific beneficial (probiotic) gut bacteria such as bifidobacteria. Previous studies of the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 have shown that inulin and to a greater extent FOS reduce growth and biofilm formation, which was found to be due to a decrease in motility and exotoxin secretion. However, the transcriptional basis for these phenotypic alterations remains unclear. To address this question we conducted RNA-sequence analysis. Changes in the transcript level induced by inulin and FOS were similar, but a set of transcript levels were increased in response to inulin and reduced in the presence of FOS. In the presence of inulin or FOS, 260 and 217 transcript levels, respectively, were altered compared to the control to which no polysaccharide was added. Importantly, changes in transcript levels of 57 and 83 genes were found to be specific for either inulin or FOS, respectively, indicating that both compounds trigger different changes. Gene pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEG) revealed a specific FOS-mediated reduction in transcript levels of genes that participate in several canonical pathways involved in metabolism and growth, motility, biofilm formation, β-lactamase resistance, and in the modulation of type III and VI secretion systems; results that have been partially verified by real time quantitative PCR measurements. Moreover, we have identified a genomic island formed by a cluster of 15 genes, encoding uncharacterized proteins, which were repressed in the presence of FOS. The analysis of isogenic mutants has shown that genes of this genomic island encode proteins involved in growth, biofilm formation and motility. These results indicate that FOS selectively modulates bacterial pathogenicity by interfering with different signaling pathways.","authors":[{"name":"José Manuel Rubio-Gómez"},{"name":"Carlos Molina Santiago"},{"name":"Zulema Udaondo"},{"name":"Mireia Tena Garitaonaindia"},{"name":"Tino Krell"},{"name":"Juan-Luis Ramos"},{"name":"Abdelali Daddaoua"}],"keywords":[{"word":"RNA sequencing"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"developmental process"},{"word":"molecular transducer"},{"word":"pathogenicity"},{"word":"rt-qPCR"}]},"article247":{"pmid":"32153513","title":"Stress Response of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes Biofilms to Different Modified Atmospheres.","date":"2020-03-16","abs":"The sessile biofilms of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes have increasingly become a critical threat in seafood safety.

Some of the possible mechanisms for ginseng-mediated viral inhibition suggested are improvements in systemic and mucosa-specific antibody responses, serum hemagglutinin inhibition, lymphocyte proliferation, cell survival rate, and viral clearance in the lungs. In addition, ginseng reduces the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8) and chemokines produced by airway epithelial cells and macrophages, thus preventing weight loss. In case of bacterial infections, ginseng acts by alleviating inflammatory cytokine production, increasing survival rates, and activating phagocytes and natural killer cells.

Sewers are now facing emerging challenges, such as receiving food waste (FW) to relieve the burdens on solid waste treatment. However, the knowledge of the direct impact of FW addition on sulfide and methane production in and emission from sewers is still lacking. In this study, two lab-scale sewer reactors, one without and one with FW addition, were continuously operated to investigate the production of sulfide and methane and microbial communities arising from FW discharge to freshwater sewerage system. The 190-day long-term monitoring and the batch tests on days 69 and 124 suggest that the FW addition has little impact on sulfide production possibly due to the limited sulfate concentration (40 mg S/L) but enhanced methane production by up to 60%. Moreover, cryosection-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that the FW addition significantly stimulated the accumulation of methanogenic archaea (MA) in sewer biofilms and altered the spatial distributions of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and MA. Moreover, the relative abundance of MA in biofilms with FW addition was higher than that without FW addition, whereas the relative abundance of SRB was similar. Metabolic pathway analysis for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis indicates that sufficient substrates derived from the FW addition were biodegraded during fermentation to produce acetate and hydrogen, and consequently facilitate methanogenesis. These findings shed light on the impacts of changes in wastewater compositions (e.g., FW addition) on sulfide and methane production in the freshwater sewerage system for improved policy-making on sewer management.","authors":[{"name":"Feixiang Zan"},{"name":"Ji Dai"},{"name":"Feng Jiang"},{"name":"George A Ekama"},{"name":"Guanghao Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Food waste"},{"word":"Methane"},{"word":"Sewer"},{"word":"Sewer biofilm"},{"word":"Sulfide"}]},"article270":{"pmid":"32145339","title":"Silver Oxynitrate Gel Formulation for Enhanced Stability and Antibiofilm Efficacy.","date":"2020-03-07","abs":"Topical semi-solid formulations are ubiquitous in personal care and pharmaceutical applications.

The need to understand the response of intermittent river biota to water intermittency led us to conduct this study using benthic diatoms collected in southern Portugal. Benthic diatoms were explored in terms of assemblages, diversity indices, the Specific Pollution Sensitivity (SPI) Index, functional metrics (i.e. ecological guilds and life-forms) and conservation status. We verified that changes in water physico-chemical characteristics were highly controlled by flow intermittency, which in turn is directly linked to meteorological variables (air temperature and precipitation). Changes in diatom assemblages reflect the aquatic regime of sites, changes in aquatic states through time and mesohabitats (dry biofilm, samples collected in pools or under flowing conditions). Species richness, on the other hand, did not reflect these differences, whilst Shannon diversity and Pielou's Evenness indices only reflected mesohabitat differences. The SPI distinguished sampling periods, and mesohabitats. The relative abundance of ecological guilds changed with aquatic states, with the low-profile guild dominating in eurheic and arheic conditions (except during Summer), being replaced by motile taxa in summer arheic conditions, reflecting increases in nutrient and siltation. The hypothesis that benthic diatom assemblages in dry biofilm can be used as an indicator of ecological status during the dry-phase was validated, since no differences between the Ecological Quality Ratio determined in dry biofilm collected in Summer 2017 and the previous Spring 2017 in flowing water.

We previously demonstrated that S. aureus biofilm-associated monocytes are polarized to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and the adoptive transfer of pro-inflammatory macrophages attenuated biofilm burden, highlighting the critical role of monocyte/macrophage inflammatory status in dictating biofilm persistence. The inflammatory properties of leukocytes are linked to their metabolic state, and here we demonstrate that biofilm-associated monocytes exhibit a metabolic bias favoring oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and less aerobic glycolysis to facilitate their anti-inflammatory activity and biofilm persistence. To shift monocyte metabolism in vivo and reprogram cells to a pro-inflammatory state, a nanoparticle approach was utilized to deliver the OxPhos inhibitor oligomycin to monocytes. Using a mouse model of S. aureus PJI, oligomycin nanoparticles were preferentially internalized by monocytes, which significantly reduced S. aureus biofilm burden by altering metabolism and promoting the pro-inflammatory properties of infiltrating monocytes as revealed by metabolomics and RT-qPCR, respectively.

Using multiple length scale imaging and computational analysis, we discovered unique spatial designs comprising mixed interbacterial species and interkingdom communities within intact biofilms formed on teeth of toddlers with caries. Intriguing structural patterns ranging from intermixed communities with extensive coaggregation (including bacterial-fungal clustering) to spatially segregated species forming a multilayered architecture were found. Among them, a distinctive 3-dimensional structure exhibited densely clustered cariogenic pathogens that were surrounded by outer layers of mixed bacterial communities in juxtaposition, forming a highly ordered spatial organization.

We show that an irregular three-dimensional layer of silicone nanofilaments suppresses bacterial adhesion, both in the presence and absence of an air cushion. We hypothesize that a 3D topography can delay biofilm formation (i) if bacteria do not fit into the pores of the coating or (ii) if bending of the bacteria is required to adhere. Thus, such a 3D topography offers an underestimated possibility to design antibacterial surfaces that do not require biocides or antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Noemí Encinas"},{"name":"Ching-Yu Yang"},{"name":"Florian Geyer"},{"name":"Anke Kaltbeitzel"},{"name":"Philipp Baumli"},{"name":"Jonas Reinholz"},{"name":"Volker Mailänder"},{"name":"Hans-Jürgen Butt"},{"name":"Doris Vollmer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antifouling"},{"word":"bacterial size"},{"word":"biofouling"},{"word":"roughness"},{"word":"silicone nanofilaments"}]},"article287":{"pmid":"32141848","title":"INVESTIGATION OF STRAINS OF MICROORGANISMS ISOLATED FROM CHILDREN WITH RECURRENT TONSILLITIS.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Chronic and recurrent tonsillitis associated with tonsillitis recurrence, which can greatly affect the quality of life of the patient.

Here, we show that CSM5-K5 exhibits rapid bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MDR Escherichia coli, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Combinatorial therapy of CSM5-K5 with antibiotics to which each organism is otherwise resistant restores sensitivity to the conventional antibiotic. CSM5-K5 alone significantly reduced preformed bacterial biofilm by 2-4 orders of magnitude and, in combination with conventional antibiotics, reduced preformed biofilm by more than 2-3 orders of magnitude at subinhibitory concentrations. Moreover, using a mouse excisional wound infection model, CSM5-K5 treatment reduced bacterial burdens by 1-3 orders of magnitude and acted synergistically with oxacillin, vancomycin, and streptomycin to clear MRSA, VRE, and MDR E. coli, respectively. Importantly, little to no resistance against CSM5-K5 arose for any of the three MDR bacteria during 15 days of serial passage. Furthermore, low level resistance to CSM5-K5 that did arise for MRSA conferred increased susceptibility (collateral sensitivity) to the β-lactam antibiotic oxacillin. This work demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of using this synthetic cationic peptide as an alternative to, or in combination with, traditional antibiotics to treat infections caused by MDR bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Kishore R V Thappeta"},{"name":"Yogesh S Vikhe"},{"name":"Adeline M H Yong"},{"name":"Mary B Chan-Park"},{"name":"Kimberly A Kline"}],"keywords":[{"word":"E. coli"},{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"VRE"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"biofilm therapeutics"},{"word":"biofilm-associated infection"}]},"article292":{"pmid":"32138375","title":"Yeast Associated with Rice Phylloplane and Their Contribution to Control of Rice Sheath Blight Disease.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"The phylloplane is an important habitat for yeasts and these yeasts may have antagonistic activities against pathogens and could be used as biocontrol agents.

Twenty-one clinical S. maltophilia strains were recovered from cultures of blood and urine samples from 10 pediatric patients at the emergency department, and nine environmental S. maltophilia strains recovered from faucets in the same area were also included. Two of the 10 patients were related with health care-associated infections (HCAIs), and the other eight patients (8/10) were infected with environmental S. maltophilia strains. The outbreak was controlled by monthly disinfection of the faucets in the emergency department. Typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed a 52% genetic diversity with seven pulsotypes denoted P1-P7 among all S. maltophilia strains. Three pulsotypes (P2, P3, and P7) were identified among both the clinical and environmental S. maltophilia strains and associated with two type sequences (STs), namely, ST304 and ST24. Moreover, 80% (24/30) of the strains exhibited resistance mainly to tetracycline, 76.66% (23/30) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 23.33% (7/30) to the extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype. The main resistance genes identified by multiplex PCR were sul1 in 100% (30/30), qnr in 86.66% (26/30), and intl1 in 80% (24/30) of the samples, respectively. Furthermore, the pilU, hlylII, and rmlA genes were identified in 96.6% (29/30), 90% (27/30), and 83.33% (25/30) of the samples, respectively.

This study aimed to describe the prevalence and caries treatment needs in first permanent molars of pre-school children, based on a caries lesion activity assessment, and in relation to participants' ages, dental plaque levels and toothbrushing habits. Materials and Methods: Large cross-sectional dental caries survey using multistage cluster sampling was conducted among Lithuanian 4-6-year-old children attending kindergartens. For the present study purpose, all individuals presenting erupted permanent molars were selected. Thus, only 5-6-year-olds (n = 453) took part in this study. They were examined for caries by one calibrated examiner using Nyvad clinical diagnostic criteria that differentiate between active and inactive caries lesions. Dental plaque was assessed by the Silness-Löe index, and parents' reports about toothbrushing frequency were collected. Results: Overall, 41% of permanent molars were affected by caries; 6-year-olds had more caries lesions than 5-year-olds (p <0.05). Mean number of decayed and filled surfaces (DF-S) of all participants was 1.79 (SD 2.93), half of lesions were noncavitated, more than one-third were cavitated and fillings comprised less than one surface per child. Majority of lesions were active; prevalence of inactive lesions (all noncavitated) was 1% and 6% in 5- and 6-year-olds, respectively. Prevalence of active lesions increased with age; it correlated with plaque levels and with toothbrushing frequency (<0.001). Likelihood to detect active lesions was up to nine times higher in teeth with abundant plaque (odds ratio (OR) 8.73; confidence interval (CI) 5.35-14.25), and up to seven times higher in individuals brushing teeth irregularly (OR 6.88; CI 2.21-21.41). Conclusions: The obtained data indicate high treatment needs in the erupted permanent molars of the Lithuanian pre-school population and imply that caries management should primarily focus on improved biofilm removal, accompanied with regular use of fluoridated toothpaste.","authors":[{"name":"Vita Mačiulskienė"},{"name":"Jaunė Razmienė"},{"name":"Vilija Andruškevičienė"},{"name":"Eglė Bendoraitienė"}],"keywords":[{"word":"active caries lesions"},{"word":"caries prevalence"},{"word":"children"},{"word":"dental plaque levels"},{"word":"first permanent molars"},{"word":"toothbrushing frequency"}]},"article305":{"pmid":"32131413","title":"Antibacterial and Antivirulence Activity of Glucocorticoid PYED-1 against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.","date":"2020-03-05","abs":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an environmental Gram-negative bacterium, is an emerging nosocomial opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients and chronic pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis patients.

The largest community of human microbiota resides in the gastrointestinal tract where commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms interact with the intestinal barrier and gut mucosal lymphoid tissue, creating a tumor microenvironment in which cancer cells thrive or perish. Aberrant composition and function of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) has been associated with tumorigenesis by inducing inflammation, promoting cell growth and proliferation, weakening immunosurveillance, and altering food and drug metabolism or other biochemical functions of the host. However, recent research has also identified several mechanisms through which gut microbiota support the host in the fight against cancer. These mechanisms include the use of antigenic mimicry, biotransformation of chemotherapeutic agents, and other mechanisms to boost anti-cancer immune responses and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Further research in this rapidly advancing field is expected to identify additional microbial metabolites with tumor suppressing properties, map the complex interactions of host-microbe 'transkingdom network' with cancer cells, and elucidate cellular and molecular pathways underlying the impact of specific intestinal microbial configurations on immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.","authors":[{"name":"Gyorgy Baffy"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Butyrate paradox"},{"word":"Dysbiosis"},{"word":"Fecal microbiota transplantation"},{"word":"Holobiont"},{"word":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors"},{"word":"Intestinal barrier"},{"word":"Transkingdom network"}]},"article309":{"pmid":"32130597","title":"Insights into the pH-dependent, extracellular sucrose utilization and concomitant levan formation by Gluconobacter albidus TMW 2.1191.","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"Many bacteria and archaea produce the polydisperse fructose polymer levan from sucrose upon biofilm formation via extracellular levansucrases (EC 2.4.1.10).

A buffer system was established enabling the recovery of levansucrase-containing supernatants from preincubated cell suspensions at pH 4.3-pH 5.7. The enzyme solutions were used to produce levans at different pH values and sucrose concentrations. Finally, the amounts and size distributions of the produced levans as well as the corresponding levansucrase activities were determined and correlated with each other. The data revealed that the levansucrase was released into the environment independently of its substrate sucrose, and that more levansucrase was released at pH ≥ 5.0. The glucose release and formation of high molecular weight levans (> 3.5 kDa) from 0.1 M initial sucrose was comparable between pH ~ 4.3-5.7 using equal amounts of released levansucrase. Hence, this type of levansucrase appears to be structurally adapted to changes in the extracellular pH and to exhibit a similar total activity over a wide acidic pH range, while it produced higher amounts of larger levan molecules at higher production pH and sucrose concentrations. These findings indicate the physiological adaptation of G. albidus TMW 2.1191 to efficient colonisation of sucrose-rich habitats via released levansucrases despite changing extracellular pH conditions in course of acid formation.","authors":[{"name":"Frank Jakob"},{"name":"Clara Gebrande"},{"name":"Regina M Bichler"},{"name":"Rudi F Vogel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Gluconobacter"},{"word":"Levan"},{"word":"Levansucrase"},{"word":"Sucrose"},{"word":"pH"}]},"article310":{"pmid":"32130272","title":"Correction: Sealing agent reduces formation of single and dual-species biofilms of Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis on screw joints at the abutment/implant interface.","date":"2020-03-20","abs":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0223148.].","authors":[{"name":"Cecília Alves de Sousa"},{"name":"Jadison Junio Conforte"},{"name":"Karina Sampaio Caiaffa"},{"name":"Cristiane Duque"},{"name":"Wirley Gonçalves Assunção"}],"keywords":[]},"article311":{"pmid":"32128090","title":"The prevalence of exotoxins, adhesion, and biofilm-related genes in Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the main burn center of Tehran, Iran.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"The present study investigated the prevalence of genes encoding for exotoxins, adhesion and biofilm factors in Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from samples in a referral burn hospital in Tehran, Iran.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Mir"},{"name":"Narges Nodeh Farahani"},{"name":"Sara Abbasian"},{"name":"Faranak Alinejad"},{"name":"Mahboubeh Sattarzadeh"},{"name":"Ramin Pouriran"},{"name":"Mostafa Dahmardehei"},{"name":"Mehdi Mirzaii"},{"name":"Seyed Sajjad Khoramrooz"},{"name":"Davood Darban-Sarokhalil"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adhesin and biofilm genes"},{"word":"Burn"},{"word":"Iran"},{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"Virulence factors"}]},"article312":{"pmid":"32128040","title":"Candida biome of severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) and its cariogenic virulence traits.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"The protected niche of deep-caries lesions is a distinctive ecosystem.

The non-O157 STEC strain adhered to leaf surface and inside the stomata forming several bacterial aggregates. The number of adherent bacteria per square millimeter of leaf was eightfold higher compared with an O157 STEC strain. Deletion of the STEC autotransporter protein contributing to biofilm (Sab) reduced the adherence ability of the non-O157 strain in almost 50%, and deletion of antigen 43 (Ag43) almost abolished this interaction. Very few bacteria were seen on the leaf surface, and these differences were statistically significant, suggesting the role of both proteins and especially Ag43 in the interaction of the non-O157 STEC strain with leaves.

In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo biofilm treatment models with single bacteriophages or phage cocktails have been compared. A combined use of bacteriophages with antibiotics in vitro or in vivo confirms earlier reports of the synergistic effect of these agents in improving biofilm removal. Furthermore, studies on the application of phage-derived lysins in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo against biofilm-related infections are encouraging. The strategy of combined use of phage and antibiotics seems to be different from using lysins and antibiotics. These findings suggest that phages and lysins alone or in combination with antibiotics may be an efficient weapon against biofilm formation in vivo and ex vivo, which could be useful in formulating novel strategies to combat bacterial infections. Those findings proved to be relevant in the prevention and destruction of biofilms occurring during urinary tract infections, orthopedic implant-related infections, periodontal and peri-implant infections.

We previously found that a type of quaternary ammonium salts, dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM), incorporated in dental materials inhibited the growth and hyphal development of C. albicans. However, how the quaternary ammonium salts inhibited the fungal pathogens and whether the oral condition, such as salivary pH variation under different diseases, can affect the antimicrobial capacity of quaternary ammonium salts is unknown. This study evaluated the antifungal effects of DMADDM at different pH in vitro and in vivo. A pH-dependent antifungal effect of DMADDM was observed in planktonic and biofilm growth. DMADDM enhanced antifungal activity at alkaline pH. Two pH-regulated genes (PHR1/PHR2) of C. albicans were correlated with the pH-dependent antifungal effects of DMADDM. The PHR1/PHR2 genes and pH values regulated the zeta potential of C. albicans, which then influenced the binding between C. albicans cells and DMADDM. The pH-dependent antifungal activity of DMADDM was then substantiated in a murine oropharyngeal candidiasis model. We directly demonstrated that the antifungal abilities of quaternary ammonium salts relied on the cell zeta potential which affected the binding between fungal cells and quaternary ammonium salts. These findings suggest a new antifungal mechanism of quaternary ammonium under different pH and that DMADDM can be a potential antifungal agent applied in dental materials and stomatitis therapy.Key Points • DMADDM has stronger antifungal activity in alkaline than in acidic pH conditions. • The pH values and pH-regulated genes can affect the zeta potential of fungal cells. • Zeta potential of fungal cells directly affect the binding between DMADDM and cells.

Ecological connectivity is one factor that might influence community structure and ecosystem functioning post drought, by facilitating the recovery of sensitive species via dispersal at both local (e.g. a nearby habitat patch) and regional (from other systems within the same region) scales. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we investigated how impacts of drought on boreal stream ecosystems are altered by the spatial arrangement of local habitat patches within stream channels, and variation in ecological connectivity with a regional species pool. We measured basal ecosystem processes underlying carbon and nutrient cycling: (i) algal biomass accrual, (ii) microbial respiration and (iii) decomposition of organic matter, and sampled communities of aquatic fungi and benthic invertebrates. An eight-day drought event had strong impacts on both community structure and ecosystem functioning, including algal accrual, leaf decomposition and microbial respiration, with many of these impacts persisting even after water levels had been restored for 3.5 weeks. Enhanced connectivity with the regional species pool and increased aggregation of habitat patches also affected multiple response variables, especially those associated with microbes, and in some cases reduced the effects of drought to a small extent. This indicates that spatial processes might play a role in the resilience of communities and ecosystem functioning, given enough time.

This pervasive nutrient pollution is changing basal resource quality in food webs, thereby affecting rates of biological productivity and the pathways of energy and material flow to higher trophic levels. 2.Here, we investigate how the stoichiometric quality of basal resources modulates patterns of material flow through food webs by characterizing the effects of experimental N and P enrichment on the trophic basis of macroinvertebrate production and flows of dominant food resources to consumers in five detritus-based stream food webs. 3.After a pre-treatment year, each stream received N and P at different concentrations for two years, resulting in a unique dissolved N:P ratio (target range from 128:1 to 2:1) for each stream. We combined estimates of secondary production and gut contents analysis to calculate rates of material flow from basal resources to macroinvertebrate consumers in all five streams, during all three years of study. 4.Nutrient enrichment resulted in a 1.5× increase in basal resource flows to primary consumers, with the greatest increases from biofilms and wood. Flows of most basal resources were negatively related to resource C:P, indicating widespread P-limitation in these detritus-based food webs. Nutrient enrichment resulted in a greater proportion of leaf litter, the dominant resource flow-pathway, being consumed by macroinvertebrates, with that proportion increasing with decreasing leaf litter C:P. However, the increase in efficiency with which basal resources were channeled into metazoan food webs was not propagated to macroinvertebrate predators, as flows of prey did not systematically increase following enrichment and were unrelated to basal resource flows. 5.This study suggests that ongoing global increases in N and P supply will increase organic-matter flows to metazoan food webs in detritus-based ecosystems by reducing stoichiometric constraints at basal trophic levels. However, the extent to which those flows are propagated to the highest trophic levels likely depends on responses of individual prey taxa and their relative susceptibility to predation.","authors":[{"name":"Lee M Demi"},{"name":"Jonathan P Benstead"},{"name":"Amy D Rosemond"},{"name":"John C Maerz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"detritus"},{"word":"ecological stoichiometry"},{"word":"food webs"},{"word":"nitrogen"},{"word":"nutrient pollution"},{"word":"phosphorus"},{"word":"rivers"},{"word":"secondary production"},{"word":"streams"}]},"article326":{"pmid":"32124306","title":"Comparison of two typical regeneration methods to the spent biological activated carbon in drinking water.","date":"2020-03-03","abs":"The spent biological activated carbon (BAC) should be disposed properly; regeneration was a better choice.

The Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes the severe infectious disease melioidosis, encodes 136 putative TCSTS components. In silico analyses of these TCSTS indicated that the predicted BbeR-BbeS system (BPSL1036-BPSL1037) displayed significant amino acid sequence similarity to the Shigella flexneri virulence-associated OmpR-EnvZ osmoregulator. To assess the function of the B. pseudomallei BbeR-BbeS system, we constructed by allelic exchange a ΔbbeRS double mutant strain lacking both genes, and single ΔbbeR and ΔbbeS mutants. All three mutant strains caused disease in the BALB/c acute melioidosis model at the same rate as the wild-type strain, displayed unchanged swarming motility on semi-solid medium, and were unaffected for viability on high-osmolarity media. However, when cultured at 37 °C for at least 14 days, ΔbbeS and ΔbbeR colonies developed a distinct, hypermucoid morphology absent in similarly-cultured wild-type colonies. At both 30 °C and 37 °C, these hypermucoid strains produced wild-type levels of type I capsule but released increased quantities of extracellular DNA (eDNA). Upon static growth in liquid medium, all B. pseudomallei strains produced pellicle biofilms that contained DNA in close association with bacterial cells; however, the ΔbbeS and ΔbbeR strains produced increased biofilms with altered microscopic architecture compared to the wild-type. Unusually, while the ΔbbeS and ΔbbeR single-deletion mutants displayed clear phenotypes, the ΔbbeRS double-deletion mutant was indistinguishable from the wild-type strain.

In addition, AgNPs/CG inhibited the dimorphic transition of C. albicans and suppressed both the adhesion and the biofilm formation of C. albicans by 41% and 38%, respectively. The treatment of Candida. albicans with AgNPs/CG showed a significant inhibition of the production of several antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, AgNPs/CG did not show any cytotoxicity in animal cells, including the MCF-7 cell line and primary mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mBMSCs), at the concentration used to completely inhibit the dimorphic transition of C. albicans. In conclusion, we identified AgNPs/CG as a promising natural-product-based nanoparticle that can potentially be used as an anti-candidal drug.","authors":[{"name":"Enas M Ali"},{"name":"Basem M Abdallah"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Calotropis gigantea"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Silver nanoparticles"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dimorphism"}]},"article344":{"pmid":"32120894","title":"Allium ursinum and Allium oschaninii against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans Mono- and Polymicrobic Biofilms in In Vitro Static and Dynamic Models.","date":"2020-03-03","abs":"The present study assesses the in vitro antibiofilm potential activity of extracts of wild Alliumursinum and Alliumoschaninii.

The VOSviewer software was used to conduct global analyses of bibliographic coupling, coauthorship, cocitation, and co-occurrence. A total of 9,527 publications were included in this study. The overall number of publications and research interest in the field displayed a strongly rising trend. The USA made the greatest contributions to the field, with the highest h-index and number of citations compared with other countries, while Denmark had the highest average citation per publication. The Journal of Bacteriology had the highest number of publications in the field, while the University of Copenhagen was the institution with the highest contribution influence. Co-occurrence network maps revealed that the most prominent topics in P. aeruginosa biofilm research were mechanistic studies, in vitro/in vivo studies, and biofilm formation studies.

The abundant genera in control sample (e.g., Bosea, Sphingobium and Gemmata) exhibited poor tolerance to chlorine, while Bacillus in biofilm and Defluviimonas in water were the main chlorine-resistant genera. Moreover, the composition of rare genera in each sample was obviously different. Furthermore, a total of 18 potential pathogens were detected with Pseudomonas as the dominant genus, most of which were significantly reduced after disinfection.

The active dispersion of bacterial cells out of biofilms acts as a reservoir for infectious diseases. The formation of such biofilms is a highly complex process, which is coordinated by many regulatory mechanisms of the pathogen including quorum sensing (QS). Many bacteria coordinate the expression of key virulence factors dependent on their population density through QS. The inhibition of this system is called quorum quenching (QQ). Thus, preventing the development of biofilms is considered a promising approach to prevent the development of hard to treat infections. Enzymatic QQ is the concept of interfering with the QS system of bacteria outside the cell. PvdQ is an acylase with an N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn-hydrolase) that is a part of the pyoverdine gene cluster (pvd). It is able to cleave irreversibly the amide bond of long chain N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) rendering them inactive. Long chain AHLs are the main signaling molecule in the QS system of the gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01, which is known for surface-associated biofilms on indwelling catheters and is also the cause of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Furthermore, PA01 is a well characterized pathogen with respect to QS as well as QQ. In this study, we immobilized the acylase PvdQ on polydimethylsiloxane silicone (PDMS), creating a surface with quorum quenching properties. The goal is to control infections by minimizing the colonization of indwelling medical devices such as urinary catheters or intravascular catheters. The enzyme activity was confirmed by testing the degradation of the main auto-inducer that mediates QS in P. aeruginosa. In this article we report for the first time a successful immobilization of the quorum quenching acylase PvdQ on PDMS silicone. We could show that immobilized PvdQ retained its activity after the coating procedure and showed a 6-fold reduction of the auto-inducer 3-oxo-C12 in a biosensor setup.

If the NCAA would induce changes in the metabolic state of cells, interpretation of BONCAT studies could be challenging. To address this knowledge-gap, we have used a global metabolomics analyses to assess the intracellular effects of NCAA incorporation. Two NCAA were tested: L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) and L-homopropargylglycine (HPG); L-methionine (MET) was used as a minimal stress baseline control. Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were used to characterize intracellular metabolite profiles of Escherichia coli cultures, with multivariate statistical analysis using XCMS and MetaboAnalyst. Results show that doping with NCAA induces metabolic changes, however, the metabolic impact was not dramatic. A second set of experiments in which cultures were placed under mild stress to simulate real-world environmental conditions showed a more consistent and more robust perturbation. Pathways that changed include amino acid and protein synthesis, choline and betaine, and the TCA cycle. Globally, these changes were statistically minor, indicating that NCAA are unlikely to exert a significant impact on cells during incorporation. Our results are consistent with previous reports of NCAA doping under replete conditions and extend these results to bacterial growth under environmentally relevant conditions.

Bacterial communities within cyanobacterial assemblages can facilitate processes such as nutrient cycling and are posited to influence cyanobacterial growth and function. However, there is limited knowledge on spatial variability of bacterial communities associated with benthic cyanobacteria and anatoxin content and quotas. In this study, M. autumnalis-dominated mat samples were collected from six sites in two New Zealand streams. Associated bacterial communities were characterized using 16S rRNA metabarcoding, anatoxin content by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and anaC copies using droplet digital PCR. Bacterial assemblages differed significantly when amplicon sequence variants were compared between streams and most sites within streams. These differences were associated with conductivity, DRP, DIN, temperature, anatoxin concentration, and quota. Despite the differences in bacterial community composition; at phyla, class and order levels there was high similarity across spatial scales, with Bacteroidetes (ca. 67%) and Proteobacteria (ca. 25%) dominant. There was significant variability in total anatoxin concentrations between sites in both streams (p < 0.001). When the data were converted to anatoxin quotas variability was reduced, suggesting that the relative abundance of toxic genotypes is a key driver of total anatoxin concentrations in mats. This study demonstrates the complexity of microbial communities within M. autumnalis-dominated mats and highlights their likely important role in within-mat nutrient cycling processes.","authors":[{"name":"Georgia Thomson-Laing"},{"name":"Jonathan Puddick"},{"name":"Olivier Laroche"},{"name":"Samantha Fulton"},{"name":"Konstanze Steiner"},{"name":"Mark W Heath"},{"name":"Susanna A Wood"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA metabarcoding"},{"word":"Microcoleus"},{"word":"Phormidium"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cyanobacteria"},{"word":"droplet digital PCR"},{"word":"high-throughput sequencing"},{"word":"liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry"}]},"article369":{"pmid":"32117145","title":"Osmoregulated Periplasmic Glucans Transmit External Signals Through Rcs Phosphorelay Pathway in Yersinia enterocolitica.","date":"2020-03-05","abs":"Fast response to environmental changes plays a key role in the transmission and pathogenesis of Yersinia enterocolitica.

In this study, we investigated the role of OPGs in Y. enterocolitica by deleting the opgGH operon encoding enzymes responsible for OPGs biosynthesis. Complete loss of OPGs in the ΔopgGH mutant resulted in decreased motility, c-di-GMP production, biofilm formation and smaller cell size, whereas the overproduction of OPGs through restoration of opgGH expression promoted c-di-GMP/biofilm production and increased antibiotic resistance of Y. enterocolitica. Gene expression analysis revealed that opgGH deletion reduced transcription of flhDC, ftsAZ, hmsT and hmsHFRS genes regulated by the Rcs phosphorelay system, whereas additional deletion of rcs family genes (rcsF, rcsC, or rcsB) reversed this effect and restored motility and c-di-GMP/biofilm production but further reduced cell size. Furthermore, disruption of the Rcs phosphorelay increased the motility and promoted the induction of biofilm and c-di-GMP production regulated by OPGs through upregulating the expression of flhDC, hmsHFRS, and hmsT. However, deletion of genes encoding the EnvZ/OmpR phosphorelay downregulated the flhDC, hmsHFRS and hmsT expression, leading to the decreased motility and prevented the induction of biofilm and c-di-GMP production regulated by OPGs.

Recent reports have shown that SDSE exhibits high pathogenicity with different mechanisms from that of Streptococcus pyogenes, although the two streptococci possess some common virulence factors such as streptolysin, streptokinase, and cell-binding proteins. To date, only a few studies have examined the variety of mechanisms expressing the pathogenicity of SDSE. Among nine SDSE clinical isolates sequenced in this study, we present in vitro and in vivo analyses of KNZ01 and KNZ03, whose emm and multilocus species types (MLSTs) are prevalent in Japan and other countries. For the comparison of pathogenicity, we also utilized the ATCC 12394 strain. The whole-genome analysis showed that KNZ03 and ATCC 12394 are categorized into an identical clonal complex by MLST and are phylogenetically close. However, the three strains exhibited different characteristics for pathogenicity in vitro; ATCC 12394 showed significant cytotoxicity to human keratinocytes and release of streptolysin O (SLO) compared to KNZ01 and KNZ03; KNZ03 exhibited significantly high hemolytic activity, but did not secrete SLO. KNZ01 and KNZ03 adhered to human keratinocytes at a higher rate than ATCC 12394; KNZ03 showed a higher rate of survival after a brief (30 min) incubation with human neutrophils compared to the other two strains; also, KNZ01 grew more rapidly in the presence of human serum. In vivo subcutaneous infection commonly resulted in ulcer formation in the three strains 7 days after infection. KNZ01-infected mice showed significant body weight loss 2 days after infection. Besides, on post-infection day 2, only KNZ01 remained in the cutaneous tissues of mice. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that KNZ01 formed an extracellular structure (biofilm), which was probably composed of cell wall-anchoring proteins, in the presence of glucose and human serum. The extracellular structure of ATCC 12394 was also changed dramatically in response to culture conditions, whereas that of KNZ03 did not.

The purpose of our study was to clarify the effect of fusidic acid on the biofilm formation and α-toxin expression of S. aureus at subinhibitory concentrations [1/64, 1/32, and 1/16 × minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)]. A total of 504 genes greater than a twofold or less than twofold change in expression of S. aureus effected by subinhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid were found, including 232 up-regulated genes and 272 down-regulated genes, which were determined by transcriptome sequencing. Our results showed subinhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid significantly inhibited the expression of hla, spa, icaA, and cidA at the mRNA level in clinical S. aureus strains tested. And subinhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid can significantly reduce the hemolysis activity and α-toxin production of S. aureus. In addition, the subinhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid significantly inhibited biofilm formation, autolysis, cell aggregation, and polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) production of S. aureus. Moreover, fusidic acid effectively reduces the damage of mouse skin lesion area. Furthermore, fusidic acid reduced the expression of the two-component regulatory system saeRS and staphylococcal accessory gene regulator (sarA). In conclusion, our results suggested that the subinhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid may reduce the virulence of S. aureus by down-regulating sarA and saeRS to reduce biofilm formation and α-toxin expression, which will provide a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of S. aureus infection.

These infections can be life threatening due to limited treatment options. Copper is inherently antimicrobial and increasing evidence indicates that copper containing formulations may serve as non-traditional therapeutics against multidrug-resistant bacteria. We previously reported that A. baumannii is sensitive to high concentrations of copper. To understand A. baumannii copper resistance at the molecular level, herein we identified putative copper resistance components and characterized 21 strains bearing mutations in these genes. Eight of the strains displayed a copper sensitive phenotype (pcoA, pcoB, copB, copA/cueO, copR/cusR, copS/cusS, copC, copD); the putative functions of these proteins include copper transport, oxidation, sequestration, and regulation. Importantly, many of these mutant strains still showed increased sensitivity to copper while in a biofilm. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that many of these strains had defects in copper mobilization, as the mutant strains accumulated more intracellular copper than the wild-type strain. Given the crucial antimicrobial role of copper-mediated killing employed by the immune system, virulence of these mutant strains was investigated in Galleria mellonella; many of the mutant strains were attenuated. Finally, the cusR and copD strains were also investigated in the murine pneumonia model; both were found to be important for full virulence. Thus, copper possesses antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, and copper sensitivity is further increased when copper homeostasis mechanisms are interrupted. Importantly, these proteins are crucial for full virulence of A. baumannii and may represent novel drug targets.","authors":[{"name":"Caitlin L Williams"},{"name":"Heather M Neu"},{"name":"Yonas A Alamneh"},{"name":"Ryan M Reddinger"},{"name":"Anna C Jacobs"},{"name":"Shweta Singh"},{"name":"Rania Abu-Taleb"},{"name":"Sarah L J Michel"},{"name":"Daniel V Zurawski"},{"name":"D Scott Merrell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acinetobacter baumannii"},{"word":"Galleria"},{"word":"copper"},{"word":"metal"},{"word":"pathogenesis"}]},"article376":{"pmid":"32117086","title":"Graphene-Based Steganographic Aptasensor for Information Computing and Monitoring Toxins of Biofilm in Food.","date":"2020-03-05","abs":"Fungi-forming biofilm would produce various toxins in food.

The graphene-based steganographic aptasensor can be regarded as an information encryption and steganographic system using GO as a cover, aptamers for specific target recognition as information carriers and dual targets (ZEN and OTA) as special keys. In our work, the fluorescence of capture probes (Cy3 aptamer and Alexa Fluor 488 aptamer) was quenched by GO to realize information encryption. In the presence of dual targets in the GO-APT solution, Cy3 aptamer (APT1), and Alexa Fluor 488 aptamer (APT2) were released from the surface of GO, decrypting the hidden information. In addition, our work offers a sensor for rapid and sensitive simultaneous fluorescence determination of ZEN and OTA. The detection limit of the aptasensor was 1.797 ng/ml for ZEN and 1.484 ng/ml for OTA. In addition, the graphene-based steganographic aptasensor can be used to construct a molecular logic gate system in which GO, aptamers, and mycotoxins are employed as the input and compounds and fluorescence signals were used as the output.

Microbial burden plays an important role in the persistence of chronic wound, ultimately resulting in delayed wound healing. It is therefore important for clinicians to understand the evolution of infection science and its various etiologies. Therefore, to understand the role of bacterial biofilm in chronic wound pathogenesis various in- vitro and in-vivo models are required to investigate biofilms in wound-like settings. Infection models should be refined comprising important signet of biofilms. These models are eminent for translational research to obtain data for designing an improved wound care formulation. However, all the existing models possess limitations and do not fit properly in the model frame for developing wound care agents. Among various impediments, one of the major drawbacks of such models is that the wound they possess does not mimic the wound human develops. Therefore, a novel wound infection model is required which can imitate the human wounds.

It produces a biofilm and has intrinsic resistance to a wide array of broad-spectrum agents. Risk factors include neonate or immunocompromised states, intensive care unit admission for more than 21 days, broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, indwelling devices, and mechanical ventilation. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old cachectic man presented in the United States with community-acquired pneumonia and immediately decompensated, requiring ventilator support. Despite starting broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient developed fever, leukocytosis, and additional desaturation episodes. The patient's respiratory culture grew numerous C. gleum and few Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia. He also had a positive urine streptococcal pneumonia antigen. Broad-spectrum agents were discontinued after prolonged treatment due to a continued worsening clinical picture, and the patient was started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cover C. gleum. The patient showed rapid clinical improvement on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with resolution of symptoms on post-discharge follow-up.

Due to the high environmental prevalence of Acanthamoeba. in the Castilian Plateau (Spain), the aims of this work were to investigate the occurrence of Acanthamoeba and other FLA in water from several sampling points from four Drinking Water Treatment Plants (DWTP) and to investigate the presence of Legionella spp. and other amoeba-resisting bacteria in biofilms in raw and finished water, taking into account that no legislation exists for this protozoa control. Acanthamoeba was detected at different sampling points, and sand filters seemed to contribute to amoebic enrichment. After ozonation, a temporary decrease in viable amoebae was observed. The genotypes detected were T3, T4, and T5, revealing the first report of genotype T5 in waters from this region. Moreover, Balamuthia mandrillaris, Vermamoeba vermiformis and Paravahlkampfia sp. were detected. Regarding Legionella, PCR detection in raw and finished water was higher than by agar culture, but even higher after Acanthamoeba co-culture. Also, Legionella's presence was higher in raw water than in finished water. The decrease of free Legionella observed from raw (27.5%, by PCR) to finished water (3.4% by PCR) contrasted with the increase of Legionella-infected FLA from raw (30.7%) to finished water (52%). At biofilm, free Legionella was not detected, and the percentage of infected FLA was low (3.8%). Legionella species identified in these samples were L. drozanskii, L. donaldsonii and L. feeleii. Additionally, Acanthamoeba co-culture led to the isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, P. fluorecens, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The highly disseminated presence of Acanthamoeba and the detection of amoeba-resisting bacteria inside amoebae highlight the importance of developing methods for controlling FLA in order to limit human pathogenic amoeba-resisting bacteria survival to the water purification processes.","authors":[{"name":"Thiago Santos Gomes"},{"name":"Lucianna Vaccaro"},{"name":"Angela Magnet"},{"name":"Fernando Izquierdo"},{"name":"Dolores Ollero"},{"name":"Carmen Martínez-Fernández"},{"name":"Laura Mayo"},{"name":"María Moran"},{"name":"María José Pozuelo"},{"name":"Soledad Fenoy"},{"name":"Carolina Hurtado"},{"name":"Carmen Del Águila"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acanthamoeba"},{"word":"Amoeba-resisting bacteria"},{"word":"Drinking water"},{"word":"Free-living amoeba"},{"word":"Legionella"},{"word":"Spain"}]},"article386":{"pmid":"32114155","title":"pH-dependent inhibition of AHL-mediated quorum sensing by cell-free supernatant of lactic acid bacteria in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.","date":"2020-03-27","abs":"Antibiotic mediated therapies target the growth-related processes of the pathogen hence imparting a strong selection pressure on the pathogen to develop antibiotic resistance. Recently anti-virulence strategies have gained lots of attention amongst the scientific community, wherein instead of inhibiting the normal growth of pathogens, it interferes with the regulation of virulence factors of the pathogens and impede their pathogenesis. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the virulence mechanism accountable for various types of infections in humans depends on N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) mediated quorum sensing. So quenching of these molecules, pose as a promising tool against P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. Lactic acid bacteria cell-free supernatant (acidic and neutralized) were evaluated in quorum quenching of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (MTCC 3541) after their initial screening for anti-biofilm potential against this pathogen.Though the reduction in biofilm formation with acidic and neutralized supernatants of lactic acid bacteria revealed strain specific response but acidic fractions showed much stronger (P ≤ 0.05) inhibition of biofilm irrespective of the type of challenge given to P. aeruginosa with lactic acid bacteria. The acidic fraction of supernatants (L. lactis, L. rhamnosus and L. fermentum) not only showed a significant reduction (P ≤ 0.05) in auto-inducer AHL levels but also diminished elastase activity which was among important virulence characters directly controlled by the quorum sensing signaling.

In this study, arsenite (As(III))-oxidizing, arsenate (As(V))-reducing and As(III)-methylating bacteria were found to coexist in the phyllosphere of Hydrilla verticillata, and their relative activities were shown to determine As speciation, accumulation and efflux. When exposed to As(III), As(III) oxidation was not observed in treatment H(III)-B, whereas treatment H(III)+B showed a significant As(III) oxidation ability, thereby indicating that epiphytic bacteria displayed a substantial As(III) oxidation ability. When exposed to As(V), the medium only contained 5.89% As(III) after 48 h of treatment H(V)-B, while an As(III) content of 86.72% was observed after treatment H(V)+B, thereby indicating that the elevated As(III) in the medium probably originated from As(V) reduction by epiphytic bacteria. Our data also indicated that oxidizing bacteria decreased the As accumulation (by approximately 64.44% compared with that of treatment H(III)-B) in plants, while reducing bacteria played a critical role in increasing As accumulation (by approximately 3.31-fold compared with that of treatment H(V)-B) in plants. Regardless of whether As(III) or As(V) was supplied, As(III) was dominant in the plant tissue (over 75%). Furthermore, the presence of epiphytic bacteria enhanced As efflux by approximately 9-fold. Metagenomic analysis revealed highly diverse As metabolism genes in epiphytic bacterial community, particularly those related to energetic metabolism (aioAB), and As resistance (arsABCR, acr3, arsM). Phylogenetic analysis of As metabolism genes revealed evidence of both vertical inheritance and horizontal gene transfer, which might have contributed to the evolution of the As metabolism genes. Taken together, our research suggested that the diversity of As metabolism genes in epiphytic bacterial community is associated with aquatic submerged macrophytes which may play an important role in As biogeochemistry in aquatic environments.","authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Zhen"},{"name":"Changzhou Yan"},{"name":"Yuan Zhao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Arsenic"},{"word":"Arsenic metabolism genes"},{"word":"Metagenomic analysis"},{"word":"Phyllosphere"},{"word":"Submerged macrophyte"}]},"article388":{"pmid":"32113752","title":"Short communication: Virulence profiles of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bulk tank milk and adherences on milking equipment on Chilean dairy farms.","date":"2020-03-01","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is an important intramammary pathogen for dairy cows that also is remarkably important for public health.

This trend marked by glyphosate was also observed in the structure of eukaryotic communities. Therefore, phosphorus and glyphosate had a synergistic effect in decreasing the richness and diversity of eukaryotes species in biofilms. However, species richness and diversity in bacterial communities were not affected by glyphosate, though shifts in the structure of these communities were concomitant with the degradation of the herbicide.

Here we investigated the role of glycogen in dynamic physiological adaptation of Escherichia coli to fluctuating nutrients following carbon starvation using real-time metabolomics. We found significant metabolic activity remaining after the depletion of environmental glucose that was linked to a rapid utilization of intracellular glycogen. Glycogen was depleted by 80% within minutes of glucose starvation and similarly replenished within minutes of glucose availability. These fast timescales of glycogen utilization correspond to the short-term benefits that glycogen provided to cells undergoing various physiological transitions. Cells capable of utilizing glycogen exhibited shorter lag times than glycogen mutants when starved between different carbon sources. The ability to utilize glycogen was also important for the transition between planktonic and biofilm lifestyles and enabled increased glucose uptake during pulses of limited glucose availability. While wild-type and mutant strains exhibited comparable growth rates in steady environments, mutants deficient in glycogen utilization grew more poorly in environments that fluctuated on minute-scales between carbon availability and starvation. Altogether, these results highlight an underappreciated role of glycogen to rapidly provide carbon and energy in changing environments, thereby increasing survival and competition capabilities in fluctuating and nutrient poor conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Karthik Sekar"},{"name":"Stephanie M Linker"},{"name":"Jen Nguyen"},{"name":"Alix Grünhagen"},{"name":"Roman Stocker"},{"name":"Uwe Sauer"}],"keywords":[]},"article399":{"pmid":"32111587","title":"A Novel Tail-Associated O91-Specific Polysaccharide Depolymerase from Podophage Reveals Lytic Efficacy of Shiga Toxin-Producing E. coli.","date":"2020-02-29","abs":"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are important zoonotic foodborne pathogens, causing diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans.
