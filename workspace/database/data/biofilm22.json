Technically, it may be the source of a large number of new processes such as microbial fuel cells for powering remote sensors, autonomous sensors, microbial electrolysers and equipment for effluent treatment. Microbial electron transfers are also involved in many natural processes such as biocorrosion. In these contexts, a huge number of studies have dealt with the impact of electrode materials, coatings and surface functionalizations but very few have focused on the effect of the surface topography, although it has often been pointed out as a key parameter impacting the performance of electroactive biofilms. The first part of the review gives an overview of the influence of electrode topography on abiotic electrochemical reactions. The second part recalls some basics of the effect of surface topography on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, in a broad domain reaching beyond the context of electroactivity. On these well-established bases, the effect of surface topography is reviewed and analysed in the field of electroactive biofilms. General trends are extracted and fundamental questions are pointed out, which should be addressed to boost future research endeavours. The objective is to provide basic guidelines useful to the widest possible range of research communities so that they can exploit surface topography as a powerful lever to improve, or to mitigate in the case of biocorrosion for instance, the performance of electrode/biofilm interfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Pierre Champigneux"},{"name":"Marie-Line Delia"},{"name":"Alain Bergel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bioelectrochemical system"},{"word":"Electroactive biofilm"},{"word":"Microbial anode"},{"word":"Microbial electrochemical technology"},{"word":"Microbial fuel cell"},{"word":"Roughness"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"30098341","title":"Functional Amyloid and Other Protein Fibers in the Biofilm Matrix.","date":"2020-02-08","abs":"Biofilms are ubiquitous in the natural and man-made environment.

Its ability to form antibiotic-resistant biofilm has raised the need for the development of alternative treatment approaches. An ideal alternate can be silver nanoparticles known for their strong yet tunable bactericidal activity. However, their use in commercial in vivo medicine could not see the light of the day because of the unwanted toxicity of silver in the host cells at higher concentrations. Thus, strategies which can modulate the bacterial cell-silver nanoparticle interactions thereby reducing the amount of nanoparticles required to kill a typical number of bacterial cells are utmost welcomed. The current work showcases one such strategy by functionalizing the silver nanoparticles with l-fucose to increase their interactions with the LecB lectins present on P. aeruginosa PAO1. The advantage of this approach lies in the higher bactericidal and antibiofilm activity of fucose-functionalized silver nanoparticles (FNPs) as compared to the citrate-capped silver nanoparticles (CNPs) of similar size and concentrations. The superior bactericidal potential of FNPs as demonstrated by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analyses may be attributed to the higher reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative membrane damage. Additionally, FNPs prevented the formation of biofilms by downregulating the expression of various virulence genes at lower concentrations as compared to CNPs. The practical applicability of the approach was demonstrated by preventing bacterial colonization on artificial silicone rubber surfaces. These results can be extrapolated in the treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, the present work strongly advocates the use of antivirulence targets and their corresponding binding residues for the augmentation of the bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles.","authors":[{"name":"Arpit Bhargava"},{"name":"Vikram Pareek"},{"name":"Subhasree Roy Choudhury"},{"name":"Jitendra Panwar"},{"name":"Surajit Karmakar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"bactericidal"},{"word":"fucose-LecB"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"}]},"article13":{"pmid":"30095990","title":"Microterracettes in Sabkha Oum Dba (Western Sahara, Morocco): Physical and Biological Interactions in the Formation of a Surface Micromorphology.","date":"2019-09-27","abs":"Small-scale terracing (microterracettes) is a surface geomorphic feature that recurs under a range of environmental settings, such as those existing in high to low temperature geothermal springs and evaporitic environments, through the single or combined action of physicochemical agents and microbiological processes.

However, the efficacy of periodontal treatment during pregnancy is controversial. Two pathogenic mechanisms might explain the potential effect of periodontal diseases on pregnancy outcomes. First, periodontal bacteria originating in the gingival biofilm directly affect the feto-placental unit subsequent to bacteremia. Second, inflammatory mediators secreted by the subgingival inflammatory site are carried to the feto-placental unit, where they then cause an inflammatory response. To elucidate these mechanisms, many researchers have been investigating the use of experimental animal models and in vitro models.

Bedded black cherts, in contrast, preserve microfossils primarily within, but also between, rounded clasts of organic material that are coated by thin, convoluted carbonaceous films interpreted as preserved extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Microfossils preserved within the clasts include a wide range of unicells, both much smaller and larger than those in the nodular black chert, along with relatively short, often degraded filaments, four types of star-shaped rosettes and umbrella-like rosettes. Large, complexly branching filamentous microfossils are found between the clasts.

However, azoles are poorly active against biofilms, echinocandins do not achieve clinically useful urinary concentrations, and amphotericin B exhibits severe toxicities. Thus, novel strategies are needed to prevent Candida UTIs, which are often associated with urinary catheter biofilms. We previously demonstrated that cranberry-derived proanthocyanidins (PACs) prevent C. albicans biofilm formation in an in vitro urinary model. To elucidate functional pathways unique to urinary biofilm development and PAC inhibition, we investigated the transcriptome of C. albicans in artificial urine (AU), with and without PACs. C. albicans biofilm and planktonic cells were cultivated with or without PACs. Genome-wide expression analysis was performed by RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes were determined using DESeq2 software; pathway analysis was performed using Cytoscape. Approximately 2,341 of 6,444 total genes were significantly expressed in biofilm relative to planktonic cells. Functional pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in filamentation, adhesion, drug response and transport were up-regulated in urinary biofilms. Genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism and nutrient response were down-regulated. In PAC-treated urinary biofilms compared to untreated control biofilms, 557 of 6,444 genes had significant changes in gene expression. Genes downregulated in PAC-treated biofilms were implicated in iron starvation and adhesion pathways. Although urinary biofilms share key features with biofilms formed in other environments, many genes are uniquely expressed in urinary biofilms.

The present inhibitor was developed based on a recently reported, highly selective thiol scaffold. Using X-ray crystallography, the lack of inhibition of a range of human matrix metalloproteases could be attributed to a distinct binding mode sparing the S1' pocket. The inhibitor was shown to restore the effect of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, decrease the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilm and, for the first time for a LasB inhibitor, reduce the release of extracellular DNA. Hence, it is capable of disrupting several important bacterial resistance mechanisms.

The objective of this study was to elucidate a possible connection between natural competence and cytokine uptake in A. actinomycetemcomitans. The extramembranous domain of HofQ (emHofQ) was shown to interact with various cytokines, of which IL-8 exhibited the strongest interaction. The dissociation constant between emHofQ and IL-8 was 43 nM in static settings and 2.4 μM in dynamic settings. The moderate binding affinity is consistent with the hypothesis that emHofQ recognizes cytokines before transporting them into the cells. The interaction site was identified via crosslinking and mutational analysis. By structural comparison, relateda type I KH domain with a similar interaction site was detected in the Neisseria meningitidis secretin PilQ, which has been shown to participate in IL-8 uptake. Deletion of hofQ from the A. actinomycetemcomitans genome decreased the overall biofilm formation of this organism, abolished the response to cytokines, i.e., decreased eDNA levels in the presence of cytokines, and increased the susceptibility of the biofilm to tested β-lactams.

The pathological hallmarks of the disease are extracellular senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of pTau. These findings led to the beta-amyloid hypothesis that proposes that Aβ is the major cause of AD. Clinical trials targeting Aβ in the brain have mostly failed, whether they attempted to decrease Aβ production by BACE inhibitors or by antibodies. These failures suggest a need to find new hypotheses to explain AD pathogenesis and generate new targets for intervention to prevent and treat the disease. Many years ago, the infection hypothesis was proposed, but received little attention. However, the recent discovery that Aβ is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) acting against bacteria, fungi, and viruses gives increased credence to an infection hypothesis in the etiology of AD. We and others have shown that microbial infection increases the synthesis of this AMP. Here, we propose that the production of Aβ as an AMP will be beneficial on first microbial challenge but will become progressively detrimental as the infection becomes chronic and reactivates from time to time. Furthermore, we propose that host measures to remove excess Aβ decrease over time due to microglial senescence and microbial biofilm formation. We propose that this biofilm aggregates with Aβ to form the plaques in the brain of AD patients. In this review, we will develop this connection between Infection - Aβ - AD and discuss future possible treatments based on this paradigm.","authors":[{"name":"Tamas Fulop"},{"name":"Jacek M Witkowski"},{"name":"Karine Bourgade"},{"name":"Abdelouahed Khalil"},{"name":"Echarki Zerif"},{"name":"Anis Larbi"},{"name":"Katsuiku Hirokawa"},{"name":"Graham Pawelec"},{"name":"Christian Bocti"},{"name":"Guy Lacombe"},{"name":"Gilles Dupuis"},{"name":"Eric H Frost"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alzheimer’s disease"},{"word":"amyloid beta"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"blood–brain barrier"},{"word":"infections"},{"word":"monocytes/macrophages"},{"word":"peripheral innate immune system"},{"word":"senile plaques"}]},"article37":{"pmid":"30087323","title":"Phenotypic and molecular analysis of nontypeable Group B streptococci: identification of cps2a and hybrid cps2a/cps5 Group B streptococcal capsule gene clusters.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"The Group B streptococcus (GBS) can express a capsular polysaccharide (CPS).

An important mechanism of gene regulation in UPEC is phase variation that involves inversion of a promoter-containing DNA element via enzymatic activity of tyrosine recombinases, resulting in biphasic, ON or OFF expression of target genes. The UPEC reference strain CFT073 has five tyrosine site-specific recombinases that function at two previously characterized promoter inversion systems, fimS and hyxS Three of the five recombinases are located proximally to their cognate target elements, which is typical of promoter inversion systems. The genes for the other two recombinases, IpuA and IpuB, are located distal from these sites. Here, we identified and characterized a third phase-variable invertible element in CFT073, ipuS, located proximal to ipuA and ipuB The inversion of ipuS is catalyzed by four of the five CFT073 recombinases. Orientation of the element drives transcription of a two-gene operon containing ipuR, a predicted LuxR-type regulator, and upaE, a predicted autotransporter. We show that the predicted autotransporter UpaE is surface located and facilitates biofilm formation as well as adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins in a K-12 recombinant background. Consistent with this phenotype, the ipuS ON condition in CFT073 results in defective swimming motility, increased adherence to human kidney epithelial cells, and a positive competitive kidney colonization advantage in experimental mouse UTIs. Overall, the identification of a third phase switch in UPEC that is regulated by a shared set of recombinases describes a complex phase-variable virulence network in UPEC.","authors":[{"name":"E J Battaglioli"},{"name":"K G K Goh"},{"name":"T S Atruktsang"},{"name":"K Schwartz"},{"name":"M A Schembri"},{"name":"R A Welch"}],"keywords":[{"word":"autotransporter proteins"},{"word":"phase switch"},{"word":"tyrosine recombinases"},{"word":"urinary tract infection"},{"word":"uropathogenic E. coli"}]},"article40":{"pmid":"30086885","title":"Non-thermal plasma reduces periodontitis-induced alveolar bone loss in rats.","date":"2019-05-13","abs":"Periodontitis, a chronic infectious disease induced by microbial biofilm, is one of the most common diseases worldwide.

Non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTP) appears to be a potential tool for periodontitis due to its promising biofilm degradation and decontamination effects. In this study, we investigated the role of NTP, as an adjuvant approach for the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis in rats. Herein we showed that SRP or SRP-NTP application attenuated the periodontitis-induced alveolar bone loss, reflected by the increased BV/TV value and the decreased CEJ-AB distance, which might be related to the lower detection rate of periodontal pathogen in SRP and SRP-NTP groups. Besides, SRP-NTP rats showed less bone loss and lower CEJ-AB distance than that of SRP group at 30d post treatment, indicating a more comprehensive and long-lasting effect of SRP-NTP. A remarkable decrease of osteoclast number and lower expression of RANKL was also detected in SRP-NTP rats. In addition, expression of inflammatory-related cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β decreased significantly in SRP-NTP group, while IL-10 level increased substantially. These results together illustrated that a combination of SRP and NTP treatment was an effective way to prevent periodontitis progress, which reduced alveolar bone loss and promoted periodontium restoration in ligature-induced periodontitis rats.

Very little is known about the microbiota of the region; hence, cultivable bacteria associated with plants of its soils were investigated for their biotechnological potential. Samples were collected from nine plant species and six soils, and 65 cultivable bacterial isolates were obtained. These represent predominantly gram-positive bacilli (70%) capable of producing amylases (55%), proteases (63%), cellulases (47%), indole acetic acid (IAA) (46%), siderophores (26%), and to solubilize phosphate (9%). In addition, 65% of these were resistant to ampicillin, 100% were sensitive to tetracycline, and 97% were tolerant to high arsenic concentrations. Three isolates were studied further: the isolate FOB3 (Rosenbergiella sp.) produced high concentrations of IAA in vitro in the absence of tryptophan - shown by the significant improvement in plant germination and growth rate where the isolate was present. For isolates C25 (Acinetobacter sp.) and FG3 (Serratia sp.), plasmids were purified and inserted into Escherichia coli cells where they modified the physiological profile of the transformed strains. The E. coli::pFG3B strain showed the highest capacity for biofilm production, as well as an increase in the replication rate, arsenic tolerance and catalase activity. Moreover, this strain increased DNA integrity in the presence of arsenic, compared to the wild-type strain.

Tracking of fluorescently labeled single cells and of gas bubbles carried by fluid flow shows that swarms of C. gingivalis are layered, with cells in the upper layers moving more rapidly than those in the lower layers. Thus, cells also glide on top of one another. Cells of nonmotile bacterial species attach to the surface of C. gingivalis and are propelled as cargo. The cargo cell moves along the length of a C. gingivalis cell, looping from one pole to the other. Multicolor fluorescent spectral imaging of cells of different live but nonmotile bacterial species reveals their long-range transport in a polymicrobial community.

Inactivation of PA3177 rendered P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms susceptible to tobramycin and hydrogen peroxide. Inactivation of PA3177 also eliminated the recalcitrance of biofilms to killing by tobramycin, with multicopy expression of PA3177 but not PA3177_GGAAF harboring substitutions in the active site, restoring tolerance to wild-type levels.

In this study we investigated the role of PhoPR in two M. bovis strains with differing degrees of virulence. We found that the deletion of phoP in an M. bovis isolate reduced its capacity of inducing phagosomal arrest in bovine macrophages. By gene expression analysis, we demonstrated that, in both M. bovis strains, PhoP regulates the expression of a putative lipid desaturase Mb1404-Mb1405, a protein involved in redox stress AhpC, the sulfolipid transporter Mmpl8 and the secreted antigen ESAT-6. Furthermore, the lack of PhoP increased the sensitivity to acidic stress and alteration of the biofilm/pellicle formation of M. bovis.

We hypothesize that biofilm formation is also associated with chronic and asymptomatic avian cholera. Experimental infections of chickens with encapsulated, biofilm-deficient P. multocida strain X73, proficient biofilm forming P. multocida strain X73ΔhyaD, and proficient biofilm forming clinical strains 775 and 756 showed that virulence was inversely correlated with biofilm formation. Biofilm-proficient isolates induced chronic avian cholera in the chicken host. Histopathological analysis was used to show that biofilm-proficient isolates induced little inflammation in the lungs, heart, and liver, while biofilm-deficient isolates induced greater inflammation and induced the recruitment of heterophil granulocytes. Putative biofilm matrix material and exopolysaccharide was detected in pulmonary tissue of chickens diagnosed with chronic avian cholera using scanning electron microscopy and a fluorescently-tagged lectin, respectively, supporting a role for biofilm in chronic avian cholera. P. multocida induced Th1 and Th17 immune responses during acute and chronic avian cholera, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR of splenic cytokine genes.

Our results indicated that cell growth was reduced at 47 °C, resulting in moderate distillate water flux decline (30%). Differently, extensive growth of Anoxybacillus sp. at feedwater temperature of 55 °C caused severe distillate water flux decline (78%). Additionally, biofouling induced membrane wetting, which facilitated the passage of bacteria cells and endospores through the membrane structure into the distillate. Although bacterial growth was impaired at feedwater temperatures of 65 °C, excessive production of EPS (compared to bacterial abundance) crippled membrane separation due to severe pore wetting.

The timing of holdfast synthesis is developmentally regulated by cell cycle cues. When C. crescentusis grown in a complex medium, holdfast synthesis can also be stimulated by surface sensing, in which swarmer cells rapidly synthesize holdfast in direct response to surface contact. In contrast to growth in complex medium, here we show that when cells are grown in a defined medium, surface contact does not trigger holdfast synthesis. Moreover, we show that in a defined medium, flagellum synthesis and regulation of holdfast production are linked. In these conditions, mutants lacking a flagellum attach to surfaces over time more efficiently than either wild-type strains or strains harboring a paralyzed flagellum. Enhanced adhesion in mutants lacking flagellar components is due to premature holdfast synthesis during the cell cycle and is regulated by the holdfast synthesis inhibitor HfiA. hfiA transcription is reduced in flagellar mutants and this reduction is modulated by the diguanylate cyclase developmental regulator PleD. We also show that, in contrast to previous predictions, flagella are not necessarily required for C. crescentus surface sensing in the absence of flow, and that arrest of flagellar rotation does not stimulate holdfast synthesis. Rather, our data support a model in which flagellum assembly feeds back to control holdfast synthesis via HfiA expression in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner under defined nutrient conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Cécile Berne"},{"name":"Courtney K Ellison"},{"name":"Radhika Agarwal"},{"name":"Geoffrey B Severin"},{"name":"Aretha Fiebig"},{"name":"Robert I Morton"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"Yves V Brun"}],"keywords":[]},"article64":{"pmid":"30079549","title":"A two-way road: novel roles for fungal extracellular vesicles.","date":"2019-07-08","abs":"The biological functions of fungal extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes have been mostly determined on the basis of the assumption that they are vehicles of trans-cell wall transport and molecular export.

Ultra-dense poly(ethylene glycol) (udPEG) coating resists adsorption of proteins, polysaccharides and extracellular DNA. It is therefore uniquely resistant to attachment by Staphylococcus epidermidis, which remains loosely adhered to the surface. Our aim was to determine if S. epidermidis remains susceptible to antibiotics when adhering to udPEG, and if udPEG coatings can improve the treatment outcome for implant-associated infections. We tested the in vitro efficacy of vancomycin treatment on recently adhered S. epidermidis AUH4567 on udPEG, conventional PEG or titanium surfaces using live/dead staining and microscopy. udPEG was then applied to titanium implants and inserted subcutaneously in mice and inoculated with S. epidermidis to induce infection. Mice were given antibiotic prophylaxis or a short antibiotic treatment. One group was given immunosuppressive therapy. After five days, implants and surrounding tissue were harvested for CFU enumeration. Only few S. epidermidis cells adhered to udPEG compared to conventional PEG and uncoated titanium, and a much lower fraction of cells on udPEG survived antibiotic treatment in vitro. In vivo, the bacterial load on implants in mice receiving vancomycin treatment was significantly lower on udPEG-coated compared to uncoated implants, also in neutropenic mice. Our results suggest that the improved outcome results from the coating's anti-adhesive properties that leads to less biofilm and increased efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Thus, the combination of udPEG with antibiotics is a promising strategy to prevent acute implant-associated infections that arise due to perioperative contaminations.","authors":[{"name":"Sandra M Skovdal"},{"name":"Nis Pedersen Jørgensen"},{"name":"Eskild Petersen"},{"name":"Søren Jensen-Fangel"},{"name":"Ryosuke Ogaki"},{"name":"Guanghong Zeng"},{"name":"Mikkel Illemann Johansen"},{"name":"Mikala Wang"},{"name":"Holger Rohde"},{"name":"Rikke L Meyer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Implant-associated infection"},{"word":"PLL-g-PEG"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"Titanium"}]},"article72":{"pmid":"30077652","title":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy assessment of three indocyanine green-loaded metal-organic frameworks against Enterococcus faecalis.","date":"2019-02-01","abs":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has emerged as one of the promising non-invasive adjuvant treatments of endodontic infections.

The genus Campylobacter includes 31 species with 10 subspecies. Within the genus Campylobacter, C. jejuni subsp. jejuni and C. coli are most frequently associated with human illness. Mainly, the infection is sporadic and self-limiting, although some cases of outbreaks have been also reported and some complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome might appear sporadically. Although campylobacters are fastidious microaerophilic, unable to multiply outside the host and generally very sensitive, they can adapt and survive in the environment, exhibiting aerotolerance and resistance to starvation. Many mechanisms are involved in this, including pathogenicity, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistant pathways.

In static exposure, the PDA-coated membranes exhibited great passive anti-adhesive property, and the Ag-NP-generated membranes presented both of excellent passive anti-adhesive properties and active antibacterial performance. While in dynamic cross-flow running conditions, Ag NPs effectively mitigated the membrane water flux decline due to their inhibition of biofilm growth, the PDA coating failed because of its inability to inactivate the attached bacteria growth.

Its methicillin resistant form, MRSA, has gained attention due to the rapid increase in the last decades and worse outcomes with chronic infection. In the United States, prevalence of MRSA in CF is around 27%, but is much lower (3-18%) in most other countries. Methicillin is typically genetically encoded by the mecA gene, which encodes for an alternative penicillin binding protein (PRBa). This PRBa has low affinity to β-lactams, thereby enabling growth of S. aureus in the presence of penicillinase resistant penicillins and most other β-lactams. Non-mecA positive strains of MRSA, so-called borderline resistant (BORSA) have also been described. In addition to production of toxins, the virulence of S. aureus is conferred by its adaptability allowing persistence in face of antibiotic therapies and host defense. These adaptive growth mechanisms include small colony variants, biofilms, and growth under anaerobic conditions. Several reports have described successful eradication of MRSA, yet only two randomized trials of eradication during early infection have been conducted. A list of MRSA specific antibiotics with dosing relevant to CF patients is presented here. Many of these require special dosing in people with CF. Novel antibiotics are in trials for skin and soft tissue infections and it is unclear if and when those might be available for lung infections. Thus the best strategies for MRSA would be primary prevention.","authors":[{"name":"Nour Akil"},{"name":"Marianne S Muhlebach"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BORSA"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"outcomes"},{"word":"treatment"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article90":{"pmid":"30073749","title":"Deciphering the functions of the outer membrane porin OprBXo involved in virulence, motility, exopolysaccharide production, biofilm formation and stress tolerance in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a Gram-negative bacterium causing bacterial leaf blight disease in rice.

OprBXo shows high homology with OprB, which has been well characterized as a carbohydrate-selective porin in X. citri ssp. citri and Pseudomonas species. However, the functions of OprBXo in Xoo have not yet been documented. To elucidate the functions of OprBXo, we generated the OprBXo-overexpressing mutant, Xoo(OprBXo), and the knockout mutant, XooΔoprBXo(EV). We found that the virulence and migration of Xoo(OprBXo), but not XooΔoprBXo(EV), were markedly reduced in rice. To postulate the mechanisms affected by OprBXo, comparative proteomic analysis was performed. Based on the results of proteomics, we employed diverse phenotypic assays to characterize the functions of OprBXo. Abnormal twitching motility and reduction in swarming motility were observed in Xoo(OprBXo). Moreover, Xoo(OprBXo) decreased, but XooΔoprBXo(EV) enhanced, exopolysaccharide production and biofilm formation. The chemotactic ability of XooΔoprBXo(EV) was dramatically lower than that of Xoo(EV) in the presence of glucose and xylose.

Most trials have been carried out in vitro, on food contact materials such as polystyrene and stainless steel, while there have been few studies performed in situ to consolidate the results observed in vitro. There are strategies that can be employed for prevention and eradication of L. monocytogenes biofilms (such as the establishment of standard cleaning procedures using the available agents at proper concentrations). However, commercial cocktails using alternatives compounds recognized as safe and environmental friendly can be an alternative approach to be applied by the industries in the future.","authors":[{"name":"Anderson C Camargo"},{"name":"Svetoslav D Todorov"},{"name":"N E Chihib"},{"name":"D Drider"},{"name":"Luís A Nero"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteriocins"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Lactic acid bacteria"},{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"}]},"article92":{"pmid":"30073220","title":"Color restoration and stability in two treatments for white spot lesions.","date":"2018-10-25","abs":"This study evaluated the effectiveness of resin infiltration or enamel microabrasion for restoring color changes caused by incipient carious lesions as well as the color stability achieved by these treatments.

Myxococcus xanthus, the best-characterized member of the order, relies on the appropriate expression of 17 type IVa (T4aP) genes organized in a single cluster plus additional genes (distributed throughout the genome) for social motility and development. Here, we compared T4aP genes organization within the myxobacteria to understand their evolutionary origins and diversity. We found that T4aP genes are organized as large clusters in suborder Cystobacterineae, whereas in other two suborders Sorangiineae and Nannocystineae, these genes are dispersed throughout the genome. Based on the genomic organization, the phylogeny of conserved proteins, and synteny studies among 28 myxobacterial and 66 Proteobacterial genomes, we propose an evolutionary model for the origin of myxobacterial T4aP genes independently from other orders in class Deltaproteobacteria.

The widespread use of ENPs poses a potential risk of large scale environmental proliferation of ENPs which can impact and endanger environmental health and safety. Recent studies have shown that microbial biofilms can serve as an important biotic component for partitioning and perhaps storage of ENPs released into aqueous systems. Considering that biofilms can be one of the major sinks for ENPs in the environment, and that the field of biofilms itself is only three to four decades old, there is a recent and growing body of literature investigating the ENP-biofilm interactions. While looking at biofilms, it is imperative to consider the interactions of ENPs with the planktonic microbial cells inhabiting the bulk systems in the vicinity of surface-attached biofilms. In this review article, we attempt to establish the state of current knowledge regarding the interactions of ENPs with bacterial cells and biofilms, identifying key governing factors and interaction mechanisms, as well as prominent knowledge gaps. Since the context of ENP-biofilm interactions can be multifarious-ranging from ecological systems to water and wastewater treatment to dental/medically relevant biofilms- and includes devising novel strategies for biofilm control, we believe this review will serve an interdisciplinary audience. Finally, the article also touches upon the future directions that the research in the ENP-microbial cells/biofilm interactions could take. Continued research in this area is important to not only enhance our scientific knowledge and arsenal for biofilm control, but to also support environmental health while reaping the benefits of the 'nanomaterial revolution'.","authors":[{"name":"Sung Hee Joo"},{"name":"Srijan Aggarwal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ENP-biofilm interactions"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"Mechanisms"},{"word":"ROS generation"}]},"article102":{"pmid":"30071319","title":"MALDI mass spectrometry imaging and in situ microproteomics of Listeria monocytogenes biofilms.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"MALDI-TOF Mass spectrometry Imaging (MSI) is a surface-sampling technology that can determine spatial information and relative abundance of analytes directly from biological samples.

The diets were unsupplemented (control) or supplemented with either carbohydrase enzymes (200 U/kg xylanase and 10 U/kg β-glucanase in feed) or a probiotic (Bacillus subtilis), or both. The diets were fed to Ross 308 broilers aged 9-28 days. 3.

Feeding the pea-based diet supplemented with the probiotic compromised feed utilisation, due to higher feed intake. The addition of enzymes to the raw, but not the extruded, pea containing diet partially ameliorated this effect (pea form × additives; P < 0.002). 5. In the ileal digesta, interactions between the dietary treatments were observed for the activities of all bacterial glycolytic enzymes and for SCFA concentrations. β-glucosidase, α-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase were highest in birds fed the diet containing extruded pea supplemented with the probiotic and enzymes (pea form x additives; P = 0.018 to P < 0.006).

Cyanobacterial bloom formation could have a negative environmental impact on other community members and potentially affect overall water quality as well as recreational activities. To our knowledge, this is the first prediction for relationships between photoautotrophic eukaryotes and bacteria from an alkaline, Hungarian lake.","authors":[{"name":"Tisza A S Bell"},{"name":"Emel Sen-Kilic"},{"name":"Tamás Felföldi"},{"name":"Gabor Vasas"},{"name":"Matthew W Fields"},{"name":"Brent M Peyton"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algae"},{"word":"Alkaline lake"},{"word":"Cyanobacteria bloom"},{"word":"Eutrophication"},{"word":"Lake ecology"},{"word":"Microcystin"},{"word":"Microcystis"},{"word":"Phytoplankton"}]},"article111":{"pmid":"30069683","title":"Bactericidal efficacy of three parameters of Nd:YAP laser irradiation against Enterococcus faecalis compared with NaOCl irrigation.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The success of endodontic treatment depends on the thorough removal of microorganisms from the root canal system.

We used the Nd:YAP laser in an in vitro experiment to evaluate the bactericidal effect of three parameters of Nd:YAP laser-activated irrigation on biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis in root canals. The canals of 45 extracted human single-root teeth were prepared on a #35 Mtwo instrument and contaminated with E. faecalis for 14 days. Forty infected single-root teeth were then randomly divided into four groups according to the irrigation agitation protocols as follows: 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), Nd:YAP laser (180 mJ) + NaOCl, Nd:YAP laser (280 mJ) + NaOCl, and Nd:YAP laser (360 mJ) + NaOCl. The remaining bacteria were counted immediately using the cell count method. Teeth were firstly spilt and one half examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The other half involved examination of bacterial colonization in dentinal tubules using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Nd:YAP laser (280 mJ) + NaOCl and Nd:YAP laser (360 mJ) + NaOCl completely removed the E. faecalis biofilms from the root canal walls and made it the cleanest among the treatment groups. Bacterial reductions in the treatment groups for dentinal tubules are presented in a descending order as follows: Nd:YAP laser (360 mJ) (53.7%), Nd:YAP laser (280 mJ) (51.5%) > Nd:YAP laser (180 mJ) (45.3%) > 5.25% NaOCl (31.9%) > control (19.3%) (p < 0.05).

Surgical site infection (SSI) is a devastating complication of spine surgery. Unlike the gold-standard two-stage revision in North American hip and knee arthroplasty, there exists no standardized, accepted protocol for the management of deep SSI with instrumentation. Because removal of hardware in an unstable, instrumented spine can result in serious neurologic sequelae, retention of instrumentation with elimination of bacterial colonization on implants is the goal. Using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, institutional medical records were queried to identify all posterior spinal procedures performed by the senior surgeon from 2008 through 2014. Thirty-four patients were identified as having an implant-associated SSI. Exclusion criteria included: (I) superficial SSI, and (II) those with less than 36 months of follow-up. The study population consisted of ten patients with deep implant-associated SSI who underwent our novel protocol of operative debridement and permanent coating of exposed implants with high-dose antibiotic cement. Postoperative infection presented after an average of 41.4±57.5 days (range, 6.0-207.0 days) from the index procedure. The mean follow-up was 64.4±18.1 months (range, 44.0-98.0 months). At final follow-up, none of the ten patients (0%) in our series had evidence of continued deep infection and none required removal of hardware. Ten of the ten patients (100%) were able to clear infection with a single stage debridement and coating with antibiotic cement. Only 1 of the 10 patients (10%) developed a pseudarthrosis. In conclusion, permanent implantation of antibiotic cement over exposed instrumentation is effective in preserving spinal instrumentation during infection eradication, preventing infection recurrence, and minimizing operative debridements.","authors":[{"name":"Joseph L Laratta"},{"name":"Joseph M Lombardi"},{"name":"Jamal N Shillingford"},{"name":"Hemant P Reddy"},{"name":"Borys V Gvozdyev"},{"name":"Yong J Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Spine infection"},{"word":"antibiotic cement"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"instrumentation"},{"word":"polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)"}]},"article113":{"pmid":"30069474","title":"Effects of Fine Particulate Matter on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Adhesion and Biofilm Formation In Vitro.","date":"2019-01-07","abs":"Respiratory infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major cause of mortality and morbidity for hospitalized patients.

This increase of pH is indicative of cell death since the spontaneous rise of pH due to the presence of bicarbonate can no longer be opposed by secreted metabolic acids.

This article adds to that complexity by describing a multifunctional enzyme (LsgB) which optimally functions when the species is grown on a solid surface and which can add either a ketodeoxyoctanoate (KDO) or an N-acetylneuramic acid (Neu5Ac) moiety to a terminal N-acetyllactosamine structure of LOS.

The substrate that the enzyme utilizes is dependent upon the concentration of free Neu5Ac (between 1 and 10 µg/ml) in the environment. In environments in which Neu5Ac is below that level, the enzyme utilizes endogenous CMP-KDO as the substrate. Our studies show that during in vivo growth in an NTHi biofilm, the KDO moiety is expressed by the organism.

The biofilm-embedded bacteria were killed by less than 0.77 mg/l encapsulated Tb, whereas 1,000 mg/l of free Tb or the bulk mixtures of Tb and the particles were ineffective against the biofilms. Moreover, encapsulated Tb was even effective against biofilms of the intrinsically aminoglycoside-resistant B. cepacia, indicating a supportive effect of PEG and PLGA on Tb. No cytotoxicity was detected in vitro in human lung epithelial cells with any formulation.","authors":[{"name":"Julia Ernst"},{"name":"Mareike Klinger-Strobel"},{"name":"Kathrin Arnold"},{"name":"Jana Thamm"},{"name":"Anita Hartung"},{"name":"Mathias W Pletz"},{"name":"Oliwia Makarewicz"},{"name":"Dagmar Fischer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Burkholderia cepacia"},{"word":"Cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"Nanoparticle"},{"word":"Polyester polymer"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Tobramycin"}]},"article131":{"pmid":"30062962","title":"Functionalization of Inorganic Nanoparticles to Augment Antimicrobial Efficiency: A Critical Analysis.","date":"2018-12-31","abs":"Nanoparticles (NPs) or nanomaterials being used widely in various fields have occupied prime importance in biomedical sciences, owing to their unique size dependent properties which make them superior to bulk materials.

We employ this sensor feature to elucidate how biofilm formation is affected by different drugs, including conventional antibiotics (kanamycin and ampicillin) as well as rifapentine, a molecule preventing cell adhesion yet barely affecting bacterial viability and vitality.

Quorum sensing is a way by which bacteria coordinate gene expression in response to population density through the production, secretion, and detection of small molecules called autoinducers. Four autoinducer-mediated receptor histidine kinases have been implicated in quorum sensing through the phosphotransfer protein LuxU: CqsS, LuxP/Q, CqsR, and VpsS (Vc1445). Of these receptor kinases, VpsS is predicted to be cytosolic, and its cognate autoinducer is currently unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the nitric oxide-bound complex of a member of the recently discovered family of nitric oxide-responsive hemoproteins called NosP (VcNosP is encoded by Vc1444; this gene product is also known as VpsV) inhibits the autophosphorylation activity of VpsS and thus phosphate flow to LuxU.

Our model predicts that signal transmission becomes possible when the community is organized near a critical phase transition between a disconnected and a fully connected conduit of signaling cells. By measuring population-level signal transmission with single-cell resolution in wild-type and genetically modified communities, we confirm that the spatial distribution of signaling cells is organized at the predicted phase transition.

Unlike Upc2, Zcf32 is poorly studied in C. albicans. Here, we examined roles played by these two related transcription factors in biofilm development and virulence of C. albicans. Our data show that the null mutants of each of Zcf32 or Upc2 form better biofilms than the wild-type suggesting that both of them negatively regulate the biofilm development. While acting as negative regulators of biofilm formation, these two transcription factors target a different set of biofilm genes. A mouse model of candidiasis reveals that zcf32/zcf32 was hypervirulent, while upc2/upc2 shows compromised virulence compared to the wild-type. Notably, the absence of Zcf32 enhances detrimental inflammation brought about by TNFα, IFNβ and IFNγ. upc2/upc2 failed to generate a similar feedback, instead demonstrated an elevated anti-inflammatory (IL4 and IL10) host response.

Entering the body via surgical sites and colonizing the medical devices through formation of multi-layered biofilms leads to refractory and persistent device-related infections (DRIs). Staphylococci organized in biofilms are more tolerant to antibiotics and immune responses, and thus are difficult-to-treat. The consequent morbidity and mortality, and economic losses in health care systems has strongly necessitated the need for development of new anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm-based therapeutics. In this study, we describe the biological activity of a marine sponge-derived Streptomyces sp.

A bioassay-guided fractionation was performed to isolate the active compound (SKC3) from the crude SBT348 extract. Our results demonstrated that SKC3 effectively inhibits the growth (MIC: 31.25 μg/ml) and biofilm formation (sub-MIC range: 1.95-<31.25 μg/ml) of S. epidermidis RP62A in vitro. Chemical characterization of SKC3 by heat and enzyme treatments, and mass spectrometry (HRMS) revealed its heat-stable and non-proteinaceous nature, and high molecular weight (1258.3 Da).

This is partially due to a lack of methods that allow for a controlled extraction of the biofilms from stents. Development of an appropriate in vitro model to assess prevention of biofilm formation by antimicrobial coatings and biomaterials requires a profound understanding of the biofilm composition, including the involved microbiota. This work describes an analytical pipeline for the extraction of native biofilms from ureteral stents for both cultivation-dependent and -independent analysis, involving a novel mechanical abrasion method of passing stent samples through a tapered pinhole. The efficiency of this novel method was evaluated by quantifying the removed biofilm mass, numbers of cultivable bacteria, calcium content, and microscopic stent analysis after biofilm removal using 30 clinical stent samples. Furthermore, the extraction of in vitro formed Escherichia coli biofilms was evaluated by universal 16S quantitative PCR, a cultivation-independent method to demonstrate efficient biofilm removal by the new approach. The novel method enables effective contamination-free extraction of the biofilms formed on ureteral stents and their subsequent quantification, and it represents a useful tool for comprehensive examinations of biofilms on ureteral stents.","authors":[{"name":"Matthias T Buhmann"},{"name":"Dominik Abt"},{"name":"Stefanie Altenried"},{"name":"Patrick Rupper"},{"name":"Patrick Betschart"},{"name":"Valentin Zumstein"},{"name":"Katharina Maniura-Weber"},{"name":"Qun Ren"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biomaterial-associated infection"},{"word":"catheter-associated urinary tract infection"},{"word":"crystalline biofilm"},{"word":"universal 16S qPCR"},{"word":"ureteral stent"}]},"article185":{"pmid":"30050039","title":"Structural and Biochemical Characterization of AaL, a Quorum Quenching Lactonase with Unusual Kinetic Properties.","date":"2019-10-22","abs":"Quorum quenching lactonases are enzymes that are capable of disrupting bacterial signaling based on acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) via their enzymatic degradation.

In Aap-mediated biofilm formation, Sbp colocalizes with Domain-B of Aap, implying that Sbp directly interacts with Aap's Domain-B. However, the structure of Sbp and its interaction with Aap, as well as the molecular mechanism underlying Sbp's roles in biofilm formation, are incompletely understood. In this work, we used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), NMR, analytical size-exclusion chromatography, and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses to determine the Sbp structure and characterize its interaction with Aap's Domain-B. We found that Sbp is monomeric and partially folded in solution, and, unexpectedly, we observed no direct interactions between Sbp and Aap Domain-B. Instead, we noted that Sbp forms amyloid fibrils both in vitro and in vivo Atomic force, transmission electron, and confocal fluorescence microscopy methods confirmed the formation of Sbp amyloid fibrils and revealed their morphology.

S. desiccabilis is a desiccation-resistant, biofilm-forming microbe found in desert crusts. The viability of cells in both planktonic and biofilm forms was measured after exposure to simulated martian brines. Planktonic cells showed a loss of viability over the course of several hours in almost all of the seven brines tested. Biofilms conferred greater resistance to all the brines, including those with low water activity and pH, but even cells in biofilms showed a complete loss of viability in <6 h in the harsher brines and in <2 days in the less harsh brines. One brine, however, allowed the microbes to maintain viability over several days, despite having a water activity and pH lower and ionic strength higher than brines that reduced viability over the same timescales, suggesting important ion-specific effects.

We used analytical and experimental engineering methodologies, aligned with current international (International Standards Organisation) and European standards, to optimise drainage tube size and flow efficiency and characterise tube kinking behaviour.

Of the 1764 proteins measured by the isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantification (iTRAQ) technique, only 148 proteins showed significantly different expression between the azithromycin-treated and untreated cells. Most ribosomal proteins were markedly up-regulated, and the expression of the proteins involved in histidine biosynthesis, which, in turn, influence biofilm formation, was down-regulated, particularly imidazole glycerophosphate dehydratase (IGPD). Previously, we had observed that IGPD plays an important role in biofilm formation by S. xylosus. Therefore, hisB expression was studied by real-time PCR, and the interactions between azithromycin and IGPD were predicted by molecular docking analysis. hisB was found to be significantly down-regulated, and six bond interactions were observed between azithromycin and IGPD. Many active atoms of azithromycin did not interact with the biologically active site of IGPD. Surface plasmon resonance analysis used to further study the relationship between IGPD and azithromycin showed minimum interaction between them. Histidine content in the azithromycin-treated and untreated groups was determined. We noted a slight difference, which was not consistent with the expression of the proteins involved in histidine biosynthesis. Therefore, histidine degradation into glutamate was also studied, and we found that all proteins were down-regulated.

The motility structures type IV pili and flagella are also involved in sensing surface contact, which modulates pathogenicity. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the PilS-PilR two-component system (TCS) regulates expression of the type IV pilus (T4P) major subunit PilA, while biosynthesis of the single polar flagellum is regulated by a hierarchical system that includes the FleSR TCS. Previous studies of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Dichelobacter nodosus implicated PilR in regulation of non-T4P-related genes, including some involved in flagellar biosynthesis. Here we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to identify genes in addition to pilA with changes in expression in the absence of pilR Among the genes identified were 10 genes whose transcription increased in the pilA mutant but decreased in the pilR mutant, despite both mutants lacking T4P and pilus-related phenotypes. The products of these inversely dysregulated genes, many of which were hypothetical, may be important for virulence and surface-associated behaviors, as mutants had altered swarming motility, biofilm formation, type VI secretion system expression, and pathogenicity in a nematode model. Further, the PilSR TCS positively regulated transcription of fleSR, and thus many genes in the FleSR regulon. As a result, pilSR deletion mutants had defects in swimming motility that were independent of the loss of PilA. Together, these data suggest that in addition to controlling T4P expression, PilSR could have a broader role in the regulation of P. aeruginosa motility and surface sensing behaviors.","authors":[{"name":"Sara L N Kilmury"},{"name":"Lori L Burrows"}],"keywords":[{"word":"cell surface"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"flagellar gene regulation"},{"word":"two-component regulatory systems"},{"word":"type IV pili"}]},"article219":{"pmid":"30041870","title":"Androgen exposure potentiates formation of intratubular communities and renal abscesses by Escherichia coli.","date":"2020-02-21","abs":"Females across their lifespan and certain male populations are susceptible to urinary tract infections (UTI).

Here, we employed established and new mouse models of UTI with uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to investigate androgen influence on UTI pathogenesis. Susceptibility to UPEC UTI in both male and female hosts was potentiated with 5α-dihydrotestosterone, while males with androgen receptor deficiency and androgenized females treated with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide were protected from severe pyelonephritis. In androgenized females and in males, UPEC formed dense intratubular, biofilm-like communities, some of which were sheltered from infiltrating leukocytes by the tubular epithelium and by peritubular fibrosis. Abscesses were nucleated by small intratubular collections of UPEC first visualized at five days postinfection and briskly expanded over the subsequent 24 hours. Male mice deficient in Toll-like receptor 4, which fail to contain UPEC within abscesses, were susceptible to lethal dissemination. Thus, androgen receptor activation imparts susceptibility to severe upper-tract UTI in both female and male murine hosts. Visualization of intratubular UPEC communities illuminates early renal abscess pathogenesis and the role of abscess formation in preventing dissemination of infection. Additionally, our study suggests that androgen modulation may represent a novel therapeutic route to combat recalcitrant or recurrent UTI in a range of patient populations.","authors":[{"name":"Patrick D Olson"},{"name":"Lisa K McLellan"},{"name":"Teri N Hreha"},{"name":"Alice Liu"},{"name":"Kelleigh E Briden"},{"name":"Keith A Hruska"},{"name":"David A Hunstad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"androgen receptor"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"pyelonephritis"},{"word":"testosterone"}]},"article220":{"pmid":"30041533","title":"The effects of a probiotic milk drink on bacterial composition in the supra- and subgingival biofilm: a pilot study.","date":"2019-09-30","abs":"Probiotics can convert a dysbiotic bacterial environment into a healthy one.

Therefore, in the present review we focus on the emerging issues of bacterial infection and AD, including the existence of antimicrobial peptides having pore-forming properties that act in a similar way to pores formed by Aβ in a variety of cell membranes. Special focus is placed on oral bacteria and biofilms, and on the potential mechanisms associating bacterial infection and toxin production in AD. The role of bacterial outer membrane vesicles on the transport and delivery of toxins as well as porins to the brain is also discussed.

The intracellular levels of this dinucleotide are finely tuned by the opposite activity of dedicated diguanylate cyclases (GGDEF signature) and phosphodiesterases (EAL and HD-GYP signatures), which are usually allosterically controlled by a plethora of environmental and metabolic clues. Among the genes putatively involved in controlling c-di-GMP levels in P. aeruginosa, we found that the multidomain transmembrane protein PA0575, bearing the tandem signature GGDEF-EAL, is an l-arginine sensor able to hydrolyse c-di-GMP.

Although the role of nutrients such as l-arginine in controlling the cellular fate in P. aeruginosa (including biofilm, pathogenicity and virulence) is already well established, we identified the first l-arginine sensor able to link environment sensing, c-di-GMP signaling and biofilm formation in this bacterium.","authors":[{"name":"A Paiardini"},{"name":"F Mantoni"},{"name":"G Giardina"},{"name":"A Paone"},{"name":"G Janson"},{"name":"L Leoni"},{"name":"G Rampioni"},{"name":"F Cutruzzolà"},{"name":"S Rinaldo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C-di-GMP"},{"word":"arginine"},{"word":"hybrid"},{"word":"phosphodiesterase"},{"word":"protein"},{"word":"venus fly trap"}]},"article226":{"pmid":"30040137","title":"Pathogenic characteristics of Aeromonas veronii isolated from the liver of a diseased guppy (Poecilia reticulata).","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Despite the significant development on their diagnoses and control, aeromonad infection is still a problem in aquaculture.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a strong biofilm forming organism, often causes several human diseases. Microorganism-based diseases become more difficult to manage when the causative organism develops biofilm during the course of disease progression as the organism attains alarming drug resistance in biofilm form. Agents inhibiting microbial biofilm formation could be considered as a potential tool to weaken the extent of microbial pathogenesis. Tryptophan has already been reported as a promising agent against the biofilm development by P. aeruginosa. In the current study, we had focused on the underlying mechanism of microbial biofilm inhibition of P. aeruginosa under the influence of tryptophan. The expression level of the mRNA of the genes (lasR, lasB and lasI) associated with quorum sensing was compared between tryptophan treated and untreated cells under similar conditions using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that the tested concentrations of tryptophan considerably reduced the expression of those genes (lasR, lasB and lasI) that are required during the occurrence of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa. Molecular docking also revealed that tryptophan can interact with the proteins responsible for the occurrence of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa. The cytotoxicity assay was carried out wherein we observed that the tested concentration of tryptophan did not show any considerable cytotoxicity against the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. From this study, it may be concluded that the tryptophan-mediated inhibition of biofilm formation is associated with interference of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa. Hence, tryptophan could be used as a potential agent against the microbial biofilm mediated pathogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Poulomi Chakraborty"},{"name":"Akshay Vishnu Daware"},{"name":"Monika Kumari"},{"name":"Ahana Chatterjee"},{"name":"Disha Bhattacharyya"},{"name":"Garbita Mitra"},{"name":"Yusuf Akhter"},{"name":"Surajit Bhattacharjee"},{"name":"Prosun Tribedi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Microbial biofilm"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"Tryptophan"}]},"article231":{"pmid":"30039186","title":"Identification and Characterization of Novel Antimicrobial Peptide from Hippocampus comes by In Silico and Experimental Studies.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted attentions as a novel antimicrobial agent because of their unique activity against microbes.

Antibacterial assay indicated that gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to moronecidin and moronecidin-like compared with gram-negative bacteria.

The higher stiffness of biofilms developed from the water containing high divalent ions was attributed to the high content of calcium carbonate, suggested by biofilm composition examination. In addition, by examining the biofilm structure using optical coherence tomography (OCT), the highest biofilm thickness was found for biofilms developed from the water containing the polyphosphate.

After NLC encapsulation, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of oxacillin decreased from 250 to 62.5 μg/ml. The combined NLC and oxacillin reduced the MRSA biofilm thickness from 31.2 to 13.0 μm, which was lower than the effect of NLC (18.2 μm) and antibiotic (25.2 μm) alone. The oxacillin-loaded NLC showed significant reduction in the burden of intracellular MRSA in differentiated THP-1 cells. This reduction was greater than that achieved with individual treatment. The mechanistic study demonstrated the ability of cationic NLC to disrupt the bacterial membrane, leading to protein leakage. The cell surface disintegration also increased oxacillin delivery into the cytoplasm, activating the bactericidal process. Topical NLC treatment of MRSA abscess in the skin decreased the bacterial load by log 4 and improved the skin's architecture and barrier function. Our results demonstrated that a combination of nanocarriers and an antibiotic could synergistically inhibit MRSA growth.","authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Alalaiwe"},{"name":"Pei-Wen Wang"},{"name":"Po-Liang Lu"},{"name":"Ya-Ping Chen"},{"name":"Jia-You Fang"},{"name":"Shih-Chun Yang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"cationic surfactant"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"nanostructured lipid carriers"},{"word":"oxacillin"},{"word":"skin"}]},"article253":{"pmid":"30034372","title":"Tunicamycin Mediated Inhibition of Wall Teichoic Acid Affects Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes Cell Morphology, Biofilm Formation and Virulence.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The emergence of bacterial resistance to therapeutic antibiotics limits options for treatment of common microbial diseases. Subinhibitory antibiotics dosing, often aid in the emergence of resistance, but its impact on pathogen's physiology and pathogenesis is not well understood. Here we investigated the effect of tunicamycin, a cell wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis inhibiting antibiotic at the subinhibitory dosage on Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes physiology, antibiotic cross-resistance, biofilm-formation, and virulence. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tunicamycin to S. aureus and L. monocytogenes was 20-40 μg/ml and 2.5-5 μg/ml, respectively, and the subinhibitory concentration was 2.5-5 μg/ml and 0.31-0.62 μg/ml, respectively. Tunicamycin pre-exposure reduced cellular WTA levels by 18-20% and affected bacterial cell wall ultrastructure, cell membrane permeability, morphology, laser-induced colony scatter signature, and bacterial ability to form biofilms. It also induced a moderate level of cross-resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, erythromycin, and meropenem for S. aureus, and ampicillin, erythromycin, vancomycin, and meropenem for L. monocytogenes. Pre-treatment of bacterial cells with subinhibitory concentrations of tunicamycin also significantly reduced bacterial adhesion to and invasion into an enterocyte-like Caco-2 cell line, which is supported by reduced expression of key virulence factors, Internalin B (InlB) and Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) in L. monocytogenes, and a S. aureus surface protein A (SasA) in S. aureus. Tunicamycin-treated bacteria or the bacterial WTA preparation suppressed NF-κB and inflammatory cytokine production (TNFα, and IL-6) from murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) indicating the reduced WTA level possibly attenuates an inflammatory response. These results suggest that at the subinhibitory dosage, tunicamycin-mediated inhibition of WTA biosynthesis interferes with cell wall structure, pathogens infectivity and inflammatory response, and ability to form biofilms but promotes the development of antibiotic cross-resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Xingyue Zhu"},{"name":"Dongqi Liu"},{"name":"Atul K Singh"},{"name":"Rishi Drolia"},{"name":"Xingjian Bai"},{"name":"Shivendra Tenguria"},{"name":"Arun K Bhunia"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"bacterial virulence"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"optical scatter patterns"},{"word":"tunicamycin"},{"word":"wall teichoic acid"}]},"article254":{"pmid":"30033670","title":"Selective chemoattraction of the benthic diatom Seminavis robusta to phosphate but not to inorganic nitrogen sources contributes to biofilm structuring.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Diatoms frequently dominate marine and freshwater biofilms as major primary producers.

Here, we show that the behavioral response of diatoms is more complex and selective as cells are also responding to gradients of dissolved phosphate (dP) when starved in this nutrient. In contrast, neither nitrate nor ammonium (dN) triggers an attractive response under nitrogen limitation. Video monitoring and movement pattern analysis of the model diatom Seminavis robusta revealed that dP attraction is mediated by a combined chemokinetic and chemotactic response. After locating nutrient hotspots, the microalgae slow down and recover from the limitation. The fastest recovery in terms of growth was observed after dSi limitation. In agreement with the lack of directional response, recovery from dN limitation was slowest, indicating that no short-term benefit would be drawn by the algae from the location of transient hotspots of this resource.

Nevertheless, for long deployment times, the biofilm formed on the filter of the DGT devices restricts trace metal uptake and hence interferes with the DGT measurements. In this work, we design different experiments to evaluate the potential of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in preventing the formation of biofilms on in-house manufactured mercury-specific DGTs. Laboratory tests were carried out by a microcosm system in independent glass containers, where biofilms obtained from field inocula were grown for weeks. Afterward, several experiments were performed with Hg-spiked river water, biofilms and DGTs treated and untreated with AgNPs to better understand biofilm colonization, inhibition and Hg uptake. The results showed that the treatment is very useful, since the mass of the biofilm accumulated at the surface of the treated DGT is significantly (p < 0.05) lower than in control (untreated) devices. Tests in colonized environments and Hg-spiked river water showed that the Hg uptake by the treated DGT matched the theoretical values and prevented biofilm formation up to 24 days post-deployment. Conversely, in deployments longer than two weeks using the untreated DGT, measurements could be underestimated by 35%. The results in the field reveal that in sampling stations with high levels of suspended matter, the filter becomes clogged despite there being no biofilm, thereby explaining its low efficiency for the uptake of Hg. In summary, the use of AgNPs inhibits biofilm formation and their use is especially recommended in eutrophic freshwaters with low amounts of suspended particulate matter.","authors":[{"name":"Sergi Díez"},{"name":"Riccardo Giaggio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algal growth"},{"word":"Diffusive gradients in thin films"},{"word":"Freshwater"},{"word":"Hg"},{"word":"Silver nanoparticles"}]},"article266":{"pmid":"30031912","title":"Antimicrobial polymers as therapeutics for treatment of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection.","date":"2019-06-21","abs":"Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is one of the most common pathogens in hospital-acquired infections.

Expression of TLOβ2 resulted in a hyperfilamentous phenotype, while overexpression of TLOγ11 and TLOα12 resulted in enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. Expression of all three TLO genes from the ACT1 promoter resulted in increased virulence in the Galleria infection model. In order to further investigate if individual TLO genes exhibit differences in function we expressed six representative C. albicans TLO genes in a C. dubliniensis Δtlo1/Δtlo2 double mutant. Differences were observed in the ability of the expressed CaTLOs to complement the various phenotypes of the mutant. All TLO genes with the exception of TLOγ7 could restore filamentation, however only TLOα9, γ11 and α12 could restore chlamydospore formation. Differences in the ability of CaTLO genes to restore growth in the presence of H2O2, calcofluor white, Congo red and at 42°C were observed. Only TLOα3 restored wild-type levels of virulence in the Galleria infection model. These data show that expansion of the TLO gene family in C. dubliniensis results in gain of function and that there is functional diversity amongst members of the gene family. We propose that this expansion of the TLO family contributes to the success of C. albicans as a commensal and opportunistic pathogen.","authors":[{"name":"Peter R Flanagan"},{"name":"Jessica Fletcher"},{"name":"Hannah Boyle"},{"name":"Razvan Sulea"},{"name":"Gary P Moran"},{"name":"Derek J Sullivan"}],"keywords":[]},"article273":{"pmid":"30028508","title":"The Different Physical and Chemical Composition of Grape Juice and Marc Influence Saccharomyces cerevisiae Strains Distribution During Fermentation.","date":"2018-10-25","abs":"During white-grape winemaking, grape marc is separated from juice immediately after crushing.

However, little is known about the pathogenic factors of P. melaninogenica. The periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tanerella forsythia secrete virulence factors such as protease and bacterial cell surface proteins via a type IX secretion system (T9SS) that are involved in pathogenicity. P. melaninogenica also possesses all known orthologs of T9SS. In this study, a P. melaninogenica GAI 07411 mutant deficient in the orthologue of the T9SS-encoding gene, porK, was constructed. Hemagglutination and biofilm formation were decreased in the porK mutant. Furthermore, following growth on skim milk-containing medium, the diameters of the halos surrounding the porK mutant were smaller than those of the wild-type strain, suggesting a decrease in secretion of proteases outside the bacterium. To investigate this in detail, culture supernatants of wild-type and porK mutant strains were purified and compared by two-dimensional electrophoresis. In the mutant strain, fewer spots were detected, indicating fewer secreted proteins. In infection experiments, the mortality rate of mice inoculated with the porK mutant strain was significantly lower than in the wild-type strain.

Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to target auxiliary pathways for the discovery of new drugs. Metabolism-related and stress-associated pathways are ideal in this regard. The stringent response pathway regulated by the signaling nucleotides (p)ppGpp is an attractive target as inhibition of the pathway would in turn decrease the persistence and long-term survival of pathogenic bacteria. In this perspective, we focus on the recent design of small molecule analogues of (p)ppGpp that have yielded promising results in terms of growth and biofilm inhibition. Additionally, we discuss how targeting small RNAs and riboswitches, as well as antimicrobial peptides, would help combat drug-resistant infections in the near future.","authors":[{"name":"Anushya Petchiappan"},{"name":"Dipankar Chatterji"}],"keywords":[]},"article298":{"pmid":"30022971","title":"GlnR Activation Induces Peroxide Resistance in Mycobacterial Biofilms.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Mycobacteria spontaneously form surface-associated multicellular communities, called biofilms, which display resistance to a wide range of exogenous stresses. A causal relationship between biofilm formation and emergence of stress resistance is not known. Here, we report that activation of a nitrogen starvation response regulator, GlnR, during the development of Mycobacterium smegmatis biofilms leads to peroxide resistance. The resistance arises from induction of a GlnR-dependent peroxide resistance (gpr) gene cluster comprising of 8 ORFs (MSMEG_0565-0572). Expression of gpr increases the NADPH to NADP ratio, suggesting that a reduced cytosolic environment of nitrogen-starved cells in biofilms contributes to peroxide resistance. Increased NADPH levels from gpr activity likely support the activity of enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation, as suggested by a higher threshold of nitrogen supplement required by a gpr mutant to form biofilms. Together, our study uniquely interlinks a nutrient sensing mechanism with emergence of stress resistance during mycobacterial biofilm development. The gpr gene cluster is conserved in several mycobacteria that can cause nosocomial infections, offering a possible explanation for their resistance to peroxide-based sterilization of medical equipment.","authors":[{"name":"Yong Yang"},{"name":"Jacob P Richards"},{"name":"Jennifer Gundrum"},{"name":"Anil K Ojha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"GlnR"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"mycobacteria"},{"word":"peroxide"},{"word":"starvation"}]},"article299":{"pmid":"30022542","title":"Biofilm production and antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from Hidradenitis Suppurativa lesions.","date":"2019-05-10","abs":"An aberrant interaction between commensal skin bacteria and the host skin immune system is considered important in the pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).","authors":[{"name":"C B Ardon"},{"name":"E P Prens"},{"name":"K Fuursted"},{"name":"R N Ejaz"},{"name":"J Shailes"},{"name":"H Jenssen"},{"name":"G B E Jemec"}],"keywords":[]},"article300":{"pmid":"30022302","title":"Environmental proteomic studies: closer step to understand bacterial biofilms.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"Advancement in proteome analytical techniques and the development of protein databases have been helping to understand the physiology and subtle molecular mechanisms behind biofilm formation in bacteria.

The stiffness of the bacteria-hydrogel artificial biofilm cannot be simply attributed by the summation of the contribution from the bacteria and hydrogel based on the mathematical models and computational models. We have revealed that the tryptone component of Luria-Bertani broth medium plays an important role in stiffening effect of bacteria-hydrogel construct. Such significant stiffening effect can be explained by the following mechanism: the presence of tryptone in cell culture medium may enable the bacteria itself to crosslink the hydrogel polymer chains.

V. cholerae can produce an exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix that plays a role in adhesion and biofilm formation. In this work, we investigated the effect of EPS production on T6SS activity between cells. We found that EPS produced by V. cholerae cells functions as a unidirectional protective armor that blocks exogenous T6SS attacks without interfering with its own T6SS functionality. This EPS armor is effective against both same-species and heterologous attackers. Mutations modulating the level of EPS biosynthesis gene expression result in corresponding modulation in V. cholerae resistance to exogenous T6SS attack.

Factorial and principal component analysis revealed microbial structures in the media were significantly affected by the operation conditions, including media type (GAC versus dual media anthracite sand), EBCT (10 versus 18 min), and pre-ozonation. Detrended correspondence analysis demonstrated media materials predominantly governed the structures of the acclimated biofilm in BAFs as they provide direct attachment surface. This is in line with the higher microbial activity and better treatment performance exhibited by GAC BAFs compared to the dual media BAFs, corroborating the importance of filter media selection to promote the acclimation of active and robust biofilm for efficient CEC removal. Principal component analysis revealed the significant influence from ozonation, which does not only break down CECs, but also stimulates microbes that grow on the ozonation products. Partial canonical correlation analysis further proved the shaping of biofilm communities on the BAF media is more associated with media type and ozonation compared to EBCT. Putative CEC degraders are predicted based on their dominance in the media and degradation capabilities reported in previous literature.

Different microorganisms are associated with the disease. The capacity of pathogens to adhere to bovine mammary epithelial cells is associated with biofilm production which leads to antibiotic resistance. Research is now leading to search alternative control methods and medicinal plants constitute a natural, safe, effective and inexpensive option. Minthostachys verticillata is an autochthonous medicinal plant of Argentina with multiple ethnobotanical properties. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the essential oil (EO) of this species and limonene, one of its compounds, inhibited the growth of mastitis pathogens. The objective of the present work was to determine the inhibitory effect of the essential oil of M. verticillata and limonene, on biofilm formation and on mature biofilm produced by pathogens isolated from bovine mastitis. Time kill assay and bacterial lysis were also determined. Furthermore, RAPD-PCR assays were performed to determine changes in bacterial DNA after EO and limonene exposition. Bacterial isolates were identified as Escherichia coli (EC3 and EC9), Bacillus pumilus (BP5, BP6, and BP7) and Enterococcus faecium (EF1) by rRNA 16S sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS. All the strains were able to form biofilm. Addition of both lactose and sucrose did not affect biofilm production. MIC values for EO were 3.6 mg/ml for E. faecium; 0.9 mg/ml for E. coli (EC3), 14.5 mg/ml for E. coli (EC9), 1.8 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP7), 3.63 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP6) and 29.0 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP7). MIC values for limonene were 6.6 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP6) and 105 mg/ml for B. pumilus (BP5). These results demonstrated that EO was more effective than limonene, showing also bactericidal action against E. faecium (minimal inhibitory concentration (MBC) = 29.0 mg/ml). This result was corroborated by time of death assay, observing a cell decrease after at 6 h, and then by bacterial lysis assay. Both EO and limonene affected mature biofilm of isolated strains. The results contribute to the study of EO and limonene which may serve as a therapy against bovine mastitis pathogens inhibiting the development of pathogenic bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"María F Cerioli"},{"name":"Melina V Moliva"},{"name":"Laura N Cariddi"},{"name":"Elina B Reinoso"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Minthostachys verticillata"},{"word":"bovine mastitis"},{"word":"essential oil"},{"word":"inhibitory effect"},{"word":"limonene"}]},"article310":{"pmid":"30018849","title":"Use of design of experiments to optimize the production of microbial probiotic biofilms.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Here, we describe the production of a probiotic biofilm through three intermediate steps: (1) measurement of the adhesion capacity of 15 probiotic strains to evaluate their tendency to form biofilm on different surfaces (stainless steel, glass, and polycarbonate); (2) evaluation of the effects of pH, temperature, cellular growth phase, agitation, and presence of surfactants on probiotic biofilm formation (BF) through the Design of Experiments (DoE) approach; (3) study of the effects of pH, temperature and surfactants concentration on probiotic BF using the Central Composite Design.

Like in almost all organisms, vital cellular processes of this endophyte are iron dependent. In order to efficiently acquire iron to fulfill its requirements, this bacterium produces the siderophores serobactins. However, the presence in its genome of many others iron acquisition genes suggests that serobactins are not the only strategy used by H. seropedicae to overcome metal deficiency. The aim of this work was to identify genes and proteins differentially expressed by cells growing in low iron conditions in order to describe H. seropedicae response to iron limitation stress. For this purpose, and by using a transcriptomic approach, we searched and identified a set of genes up-regulated when iron was scarce. One of them, Hsero_2337, codes for a TonB-dependent transporter/transducer present in the serobactins biosynthesis genomic locus, with an unknown function. Another TonB-dependent receptor, the one encoded by Hsero_1277, and an inner membrane ferrous iron permease, coded by Hsero_2720, were also detected. By using a proteomic approach focused in membrane proteins, we identified the specific receptor for iron-serobactin internalization SbtR and two non-characterized TonB-dependent receptors (coded by genes Hsero_1277 and Hsero_3255). We constructed mutants on some of the identified genes and characterized them by in vitro growth, biofilm formation, and interaction with rice plants. Characterization of mutants in gene Hsero_2337 showed that the TonB-dependent receptor coded by this gene has a regulatory role in the biosynthesis of serobactins, probably by interacting with the alternative sigma factor PfrI, coded by gene Hsero_2338. Plant colonization of the mutant strains was not affected, since the mutant strain normally colonize the root and aerial part of rice plants. These results suggest that the strategies used by H. seropedicae to acquire iron inside plants are far more diverse than the ones characterized in this work.

The CsgE chaperone facilitates the secretion of CsgA through CsgG by forming a cap at the base of the nonameric CsgG outer membrane pore. We elucidated a series of finely tuned nonpolar and charge-charge interactions that facilitate the oligomerization of CsgE and its ability to transport unfolded CsgA to CsgG for translocation. CsgE oligomerization in vitro is temperature dependent and is disrupted by mutations in the W48 and F79 residues. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we identified two regions of CsgE involved in the CsgE-CsgA interaction: a head comprising a positively charged patch centered around R47 and a stem comprising a negatively charged patch containing E31 and E85. Negatively charged residues in the intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal tails were not implicated in this interaction. Head and stem residues were mutated and interrogated using in vivo measurements of curli production and in vitro amyloid polymerization assays. The R47 head residue of CsgE is required for stabilization of CsgA- and CsgE-mediated curli fiber formation. Mutation of the E31 and E85 stem residues to positively charged side chains decreased CsgE-mediated curli fiber formation but increased CsgE-mediated stabilization of CsgA. No single-amino-acid substitutions in the head, stem, or tail regions affected the ability of CsgE to cap the CsgG pore as determined by a bile salt sensitivity assay.

Growth of microfilterable bacteria in MF permeate was observed, indicating that not all MF membranes can guarantee the total rejection of bacteria.

Interkingdom microbial consortia tend to be more robust and have higher productivity compared with monocultures and intrakingdom consortia, but the control and design of these diverse artificial consortia have received limited attention.

Considering the global threat posed by the antibiotic resistance, the mechanisms involved in both the formation of such reservoirs and their remobilization are a concern of prime importance. Antibiotic resistance genes are strongly associated with mobile genetic elements that are directly involved in their dissemination. Most mobile genetic element-mediated gene transfers involve replicative mechanisms and, as such, localized gene transfers should participate in the local increase in resistance gene abundance. Additionally, the carriage of conjugative mobile elements encoding cell appendages acting as adhesins has already been demonstrated to increase biofilm-forming capability of bacteria and, therefore, should also contribute to their selective enrichment on surfaces. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence of two families of mobile genetic elements, IncP-1 plasmids and class 1 integrons, in the water column and bank sediments of the Orne River, in France. We show that these mobile elements, especially IncP-1 plasmids, are enriched in the bacteria attached on the suspended matters in the river waters, and that a similar abundance is found in freshly deposited sediments. Using the IncP-1 plasmid pB10 as a model, in vitro experiments demonstrated that local enrichment of plasmid-bearing bacteria on artificial surfaces mainly resulted from an increase in bacterial adhesion properties conferred by the plasmid rather than an improved dissemination frequency of the plasmid between surface-attached bacteria. We propose plasmid-mediated adhesion to particles to be one of the main contributors in the formation of mobile genetic element-reservoirs in sediments, with adhesion to suspended matter working as a selective enrichment process of antibiotic resistant genes and bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Magali De la Cruz Barrón"},{"name":"Christophe Merlin"},{"name":"Hélène Guilloteau"},{"name":"Emmanuelle Montargès-Pelletier"},{"name":"Xavier Bellanger"}],"keywords":[{"word":"IncP-1 plasmids"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"class 1 integrons"},{"word":"environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes"},{"word":"horizontal gene transfer"},{"word":"river water column"},{"word":"sediments"},{"word":"suspended matter"}]},"article340":{"pmid":"30013539","title":"Nano-Strategies to Fight Multidrug Resistant Bacteria-A Battle of the Titans.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Infectious diseases remain one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The WHO and CDC have expressed serious concern regarding the continued increase in the development of multidrug resistance among bacteria. Therefore, the antibiotic resistance crisis is one of the most pressing issues in global public health. Associated with the rise in antibiotic resistance is the lack of new antimicrobials. This has triggered initiatives worldwide to develop novel and more effective antimicrobial compounds as well as to develop novel delivery and targeting strategies. Bacteria have developed many ways by which they become resistant to antimicrobials. Among those are enzyme inactivation, decreased cell permeability, target protection, target overproduction, altered target site/enzyme, increased efflux due to over-expression of efflux pumps, among others. Other more complex phenotypes, such as biofilm formation and quorum sensing do not appear as a result of the exposure of bacteria to antibiotics although, it is known that biofilm formation can be induced by antibiotics. These phenotypes are related to tolerance to antibiotics in bacteria. Different strategies, such as the use of nanostructured materials, are being developed to overcome these and other types of resistance. Nanostructured materials can be used to convey antimicrobials, to assist in the delivery of novel drugs or ultimately, possess antimicrobial activity by themselves. Additionally, nanoparticles (e.g., metallic, organic, carbon nanotubes, etc.) may circumvent drug resistance mechanisms in bacteria and, associated with their antimicrobial potential, inhibit biofilm formation or other important processes. Other strategies, including the combined use of plant-based antimicrobials and nanoparticles to overcome toxicity issues, are also being investigated. Coupling nanoparticles and natural-based antimicrobials (or other repurposed compounds) to inhibit the activity of bacterial efflux pumps; formation of biofilms; interference of quorum sensing; and possibly plasmid curing, are just some of the strategies to combat multidrug resistant bacteria. However, the use of nanoparticles still presents a challenge to therapy and much more research is needed in order to overcome this. In this review, we will summarize the current research on nanoparticles and other nanomaterials and how these are or can be applied in the future to fight multidrug resistant bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Pedro V Baptista"},{"name":"Matthew P McCusker"},{"name":"Andreia Carvalho"},{"name":"Daniela A Ferreira"},{"name":"Niamh M Mohan"},{"name":"Marta Martins"},{"name":"Alexandra R Fernandes"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"multidrug resistance"},{"word":"nanomaterials"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"nanotheranostics"},{"word":"novel antimicrobial agents"},{"word":"plant-based compounds"}]},"article341":{"pmid":"30013533","title":"Experimental Warming Differentially Influences the Vulnerability of Phototrophic and Heterotrophic Periphytic Communities to Copper Toxicity.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Aquatic ecosystems are generally subjected to multiple perturbations due to simultaneous or successive combinations of various natural and anthropogenic environmental pressures.

In humans and pigs, meningitis is a major manifestation of S. suis infections. A suitable infection model is an essential tool to understand the mechanisms of diseases caused by pathogens. Several routes of infection in mice have been developed to study the pathogenesis of S. suis infection. However, the intraperitoneal, intranasal, and intravenous routes of infection are not suitable for studying the roles of S. suis surface components in meningitis directly in the brain, such as the extracellular matrix from biofilms. Although intracisternal inoculation has been used for S. suis infection, the precise injection site has not been described. Here, the intracranial subarachnoidal route of infection was described in a mouse model to investigate the roles of biofilms in S. suis meningitis. S. suis planktonic cells or biofilm state cells were directly injected into the subarachnoid space of mice through the injection site located 3.5 mm rostral from the bregma. Histopathological analysis and increased mRNA expression of TLR2 and cytokines of the brain tissue from mice injected with biofilm state cells clearly indicated that S. suis biofilm plays definitive roles in S. suis meningitis. This route of infection has obvious advantages over other routes of infection, allowing the study of the host-bacterium interaction.

During this time, bacteria can undergo changes in the physiology due to the exposure to host growth environment and the presence of the host cells. We developed an assay to rapidly measure the virulence state of bacteria that minimize the extent to which bacteria grow in the presence of host cells. Bacteria and amoebae are mixed together and immobilized on a single imaging plane using an agar pad. The procedure uses single-cell fluorescence imaging with calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) as an indicator of host cell health. The fluorescence of host cells is analyzed after 1 h of exposure of host cells to bacteria using epifluorescence microscopy. Image analysis software is used to compute a host killing index. This method has been used to measure virulence within planktonic and surface-attached Pseudomonas aeruginosa sub-populations during the initial stage of biofilm formation and may be adapted to other bacteria and other stages of biofilm growth. This protocol provides a rapid and robust method of measuring virulence and avoids many of the complexities associated with the growth and maintenance of mammalian cell lines. Virulence phenotypes measured here using amoebae have also been validated using mouse macrophages. In particular, this assay was used to establish that surface attachment upregulates virulence in P. aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Kumar Perinbam"},{"name":"Albert Siryaporn"}],"keywords":[]},"article366":{"pmid":"30010397","title":"Survival of Tomato Outbreak Associated Salmonella Serotypes in Soil and Water and the Role of Biofilms in Abiotic Surface Attachment.","date":"2019-06-18","abs":"Salmonella serotypes linked to tomato-associated outbreaks were evaluated for survival in soil and water over a 40-day period.

Biofilm production by Salmonella serotypes was measured on both quartz particles (soil surrogate) and glass coverslips, and was evaluated using a crystal violet dye assay. Salmonella populations in soil and water over 40 days indicated no significant differences between Salmonella serotypes tested (p > 0.05). Over a 40-day period, there was a 1.84 ± 0.22 log CFU/g and 1.56 ± 0.54 CFU/mL decrease in populations of Salmonella in soil and water, respectively. Enumeration indicated that Salmonella population fluctuated in water but decreased linearly in soil. All serotypes tested produced the red dry and rough morphotype on Congo Red agar. Biofilm produced by all the Salmonella serotypes tested was significantly different on quartz particles than on glass coverslips (p < 0.0001), indicating that material and surface characteristics could affect biofilm development. The ability of Salmonella serotypes to persist in soil or water and attach to abiotic surfaces through biofilm formation affirms that contact surfaces, soil, water, and sediment should be considered as possible sources of cross-contamination in the farm environment.","authors":[{"name":"Govindaraj Dev Kumar"},{"name":"Robert C Williams"},{"name":"Nammalwar Sriranganathan"},{"name":"Renee R Boyer"},{"name":"Joseph D Eifert"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella serotypes"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cell injury"},{"word":"soil"},{"word":"survival"},{"word":"water"}]},"article367":{"pmid":"30009970","title":"Bio-inspired nanomaterials in agriculture and food: Current status, foreseen applications and challenges.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Nanotechnology is a potential area that revolutionizes almost every sector of life and is predicted to become a major economic force in the near future.

Impaired streams showed significantly lower pH and increased specific conductance. Biofilm samples from the AMD impaired streams had lower fatty acid content with a decreased proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fatty acid profiles easily and rapidly separated biofilm communities into their respective categories, either as being impaired by AMD or unimpaired by AMD, using multivariate statistical approaches.

In Vibrio cholerae in vivo, the presence of c-di-GMP together with the response regulator VpsR results in transcription from PvpsL, a promoter of biofilm biosynthesis genes. VpsR shares homology with enhancer binding proteins that activate σ54-RNA polymerase (RNAP), but it lacks conserved residues needed to bind to σ54-RNAP and to hydrolyze adenosine triphosphate, and PvpsL transcription does not require σ54 in vivo. Consequently, the mechanism of this activation has not been clear. Using an in vitro transcription system, we demonstrate activation of PvspL in the presence of VpsR, c-di-GMP and σ70-RNAP. c-di-GMP does not significantly change the affinity of VpsR for PvpsL DNA or the DNase I footprint of VpsR on the DNA, and it is not required for VpsR to dimerize. However, DNase I and KMnO4 footprints reveal that the σ70-RNAP/VpsR/c-di-GMP complex on PvpsL adopts a different conformation from that formed by σ70-RNAP alone, with c-di-GMP or with VpsR.

S. mutans binds to the tooth surface, metabolizes sugars and produces acid, leading to cavity formation. S. mutans can also cause infectious endocarditis. Recent evidence suggests that S. mutans biofilms contain amyloid fibrils. Amyloids are insoluble fibrillar protein aggregates, and bacteria use functional amyloids to improve robustness of their biofilms. While the functional amyloids in bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus have been heavily investigated, little is known about the mechanism of S. mutans amyloid formation. Previous results from our laboratory with the amyloidogenic proteins and peptides from the aforementioned bacteria and other mammalian amyloid systems suggest that amyloid formation progresses via an intermediate that adopts a unique secondary structure-α-sheet. De novo designed peptides with alternating l- and d-amino acid also adopt an α-sheet secondary structure and inhibit amyloid formation by binding to soluble oligomeric species during amyloidogenesis. Inhibition of fibrillization by α-sheet peptides suggests the presence of α-sheet during amyloid formation. To investigate the mechanism of functional amyloid formation in S. mutans, α-sheet peptides were compared to epigallocatechin gallate for their ability to inhibit fibril formation in S. mutans. Inhibition was demonstrated in a biofilm plate assay and on hydroxyapatite surfaces both in S. mutans alone and in bacteria from human saliva. The observed inhibition suggests that an α-sheet mediated mechanism may be operative during functional amyloid formation.","authors":[{"name":"Natasha Paranjapye"},{"name":"Valerie Daggett"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"dental bacteria"},{"word":"functional amyloid"},{"word":"peptide inhibitors"},{"word":"α-sheet"}]},"article387":{"pmid":"30005198","title":"Influence of CeO","date":"2019-09-09","abs":"Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO","authors":[{"name":"Guoxiang You"},{"name":"Peifang Wang"},{"name":"Jun Hou"},{"name":"Chao Wang"},{"name":"Lingzhan Miao"},{"name":"Yi Xu"},{"name":"Tao Feng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CeO(2) nanoparticles"},{"word":"Dynamic sweep tests"},{"word":"Herschel-Bulkley model"},{"word":"Key organic matters"},{"word":"Stratified extracellular polymeric substances"}]},"article388":{"pmid":"30004464","title":"Host-Pathogen Interactions Mediated by MDR Transporters in Fungi: As Pleiotropic as it Gets!","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Fungal infections caused by Candida, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus species are an increasing problem worldwide, associated with very high mortality rates. The successful prevalence of these human pathogens is due to their ability to thrive in stressful host niche colonization sites, to tolerate host immune system-induced stress, and to resist antifungal drugs. This review focuses on the key role played by multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters, belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC), and the major facilitator superfamilies (MFS), in mediating fungal resistance to pathogenesis-related stresses. These clearly include the extrusion of antifungal drugs, with C. albicans CDR1 and MDR1 genes, and corresponding homologs in other fungal pathogens, playing a key role in this phenomenon. More recently, however, clues on the transcriptional regulation and physiological roles of MDR transporters, including the transport of lipids, ions, and small metabolites, have emerged, linking these transporters to important pathogenesis features, such as resistance to host niche environments, biofilm formation, immune system evasion, and virulence. The wider view of the activity of MDR transporters provided in this review highlights their relevance beyond drug resistance and the need to develop therapeutic strategies that successfully face the challenges posed by the pleiotropic nature of these transporters.","authors":[{"name":"Mafalda Cavalheiro"},{"name":"Pedro Pais"},{"name":"Mónica Galocha"},{"name":"Miguel C Teixeira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"fungal pathogens"},{"word":"host-pathogen interaction"},{"word":"multidrug transporters"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article389":{"pmid":"30004427","title":"A3, a Scorpion Venom Derived Peptide Analogue with Potent Antimicrobial and Potential Antibiofilm Activity against Clinical Isolates of Multi-Drug Resistant Gram Positive Bacteria.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Current research in the field of antimicrobials is focused on developing novel antimicrobial agents to counteract the huge dilemma that the human population is mainly facing in regards to the rise of bacterial resistance and biofilm infections. Host defense peptides (HDPs) are a promising group of molecules for antimicrobial development as they display several attractive features suitable for antimicrobial activity, including their broad spectrum of activity and potency against bacteria. AamAP1 is a novel HDP that belongs to the venom of the North African scorpion Androctonus amoeruxi. In vitro antimicrobial assays revealed that the peptide displays moderate activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the peptide proved to be highly hemolytic and displayed significantly high toxicity against mammalian cells. In our study, a novel synthetic peptide analogue named A3 was synthetically modified from AamAP1 in order to enhance its activity and toxicity profile. The design strategy depended on modifying the amino acid sequence of AamAP1 in order to alter its net positive charge, percentage helicity and modify other parameters that are involved theoretically in HDPs activity. Accordingly, A3 was evaluated for its in vitro antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity individually and in combination with four different types of conventional antibiotics against clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-positive bacteria. A3 was also evaluated for its cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. A3 managed to selectively inhibit the growth of a wide range of resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria. Our results also showed that combining A3 with conventional antibiotics caused a synergistic antimicrobial behavior that resulted in decreasing the MIC value for A3 peptide as low as 0.125 µM. At the concentrations needed to inhibit bacterial growth, A3 displayed minimal mammalian cell toxicity. In conclusion, A3 exhibits enhanced activity and selectivity when compared with the parent natural scorpion venom peptide. The combination of A3 with conventional antibiotics could provide researchers in the antimicrobial drug development field with a potential alternative for conventional antibiotics against MDR bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Ammar Almaaytah"},{"name":"Ahmad Farajallah"},{"name":"Ahmad Abualhaijaa"},{"name":"Qosay Al-Balas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"bacterial resistance"},{"word":"host defense peptides"},{"word":"scorpion venoms"},{"word":"synergism"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"30004292","title":"Reversing Antimicrobial Resistance in Multidrug-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae of Clinical Origin Using 1-(1-Naphthylmethyl)-Piperazine.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Eleven clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were tested to access the potential of adjuvant therapies to reduce antimicrobial resistance using fixed concentrations of the chemosensitizers chlorpromazine (CPZ), thioridazine (TZ), phenylalanine-arginine-β-naphthylamide (PAβN), and 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine-(NMP) with varying concentrations of antimicrobial agents nalidixic acid (NAL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), moxifloxacin (MXF), tetracycline (TET), and chloramphenicol (CHL).

NMP was assessed for its capacity to reduce the mass of biofilm alone and in combination with CIP and MXF. Of the selected chemosensitizers, NMP exhibited the greatest capacity to reverse resistance and inhibit efflux, based on the concentrations tested. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents including (fluoro)quinolones, TET, and CHL were found to be increased in the presence of NMP, in a concentration-dependent manner. PAβN also demonstrated similar effects when combined with the chemosensitizers tested. In the case of half of the isolates studied, NMP alone reduced preformed biofilm biomass. Combinations of latter along with CIP or MXF were also found to reduce the mass of preformed biofilm, in the case of only some of the bacterial isolates. The capacity of NMP to reduce antimicrobial resistance could be of relevance as a strategy to limit bacterial colonization on abiotic surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"João Anes"},{"name":"Marta Martins"},{"name":"Séamus Fanning"}],"keywords":[{"word":"1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine"},{"word":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"antimicrobial reversal"},{"word":"chemosensitizers"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"30003870","title":"Small RNA-Based Regulation of Bacterial Quorum Sensing and Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-01-22","abs":"Quorum sensing is a vital property of bacteria that enables community-wide coordination of collective behaviors. A key example of such a behavior is biofilm formation, in which groups of bacteria invest in synthesizing a protective, joint extracellular matrix. Quorum sensing involves the production, release, and subsequent detection of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. The architecture of quorum-sensing signal transduction pathways is highly variable among different species of bacteria, but frequently involves posttranscriptional regulation carried out by small regulatory RNA molecules. This review illustrates the diverse roles small trans-acting regulatory RNAs can play, from constituting a network's core to auxiliary roles in adjusting the rate of autoinducer synthesis, mediating cross talk among different parts of a network, or integrating different regulatory inputs to trigger appropriate changes in gene expression. The emphasis is on describing how the study of small RNA-based regulation in quorum sensing and biofilm formation has uncovered new general properties or expanded our understanding of bacterial riboregulation.","authors":[{"name":"Sine Lo Svenningsen"}],"keywords":[]},"article392":{"pmid":"30003536","title":"The role of the microbiome in nonhealing diabetic wounds.","date":"2019-11-19","abs":"Wound healing is a highly coordinated and complex process, and there can be devastating consequences if it is interrupted. It is believed that, in combination with host factors, microorganisms in a wound bed can not only impair wound healing but can lead to stalled, chronic wounds. It is hypothesized that the wound microbiota persists in chronic wounds as a biofilm, recalcitrant to antibiotic and mechanical intervention. Cultivation-based methods are the gold standard for identification of pathogens residing in wounds. However, these methods are biased against fastidious organisms, and do not capture the full extent of microbial diversity in chronic wounds. Thus, the link between specific microbes and impaired healing remains tenuous. This is partially because local infection and, more specifically, the formation of a biofilm, is difficult to diagnose. This has led to research efforts aimed at understanding if biofilm formation delays healing and leads to persistent and chronic infection. Circumventing challenges associated with culture-based estimations, advances in high-throughput sequencing analysis has revealed that chronic wounds are host to complex, diverse microbiomes comprising multiple species of bacteria and fungi. Here, we discuss how the use of genomic methodologies to study wound microbiomes has advanced the current understanding of infection and biofilm formation in chronic wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Lindsay R Kalan"},{"name":"Meghan B Brennan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronic wound"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"next-generation sequencing"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"30003180","title":"Antibiofilm peptides against biofilms on titanium and hydroxyapatite surfaces.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilms are the main challenges in the treatment of common oral diseases such as caries, gingival and endodontic infection and periimplantitis. Oral plaque is the origin of microbes colonizing in the form of biofilms on hydroxyapatite (tooth) and titanium (dental implant) surfaces. In this study, hydroxyapatite (HA) and titanium (Ti) disks were introduced, and their surface morphology was both qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). The average roughness of Ti disks (77.6 ± 18.3 nm) was less than that of HA (146.1 ± 38.5 nm) (p < 0.05). Oral multispecies biofilms which were cultured on Ti and HA disks for 6 h and three weeks were visualized by SEM. We investigated the ability of two new antibiofilm peptides, DJK-5 and 1018, to induce killing of bacteria in oral multispecies biofilms on Ti and HA disks. A 6-h treatment by DJK-5 and 1018 (2 or 10 μg/mL) significantly reduced biomass of the multispecies biofilms on both Ti and HA disks. DJK-5 was able to kill more bacteria (40.4-75.9%) than 1018 (30.4-67.0%) on both surfaces (p < 0.05). DJK-5 also led to a more effective killing of microbes after a 3-min treatment of 3-day-old and 3-week-old biofilms on Ti and HA surfaces, compared to peptide 1018 and chlorhexidine (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in the amount of biofilm killing between Ti and HA surfaces.

Mucus has exceptional properties including elasticity, changeable rheology and an ability to self-repair by re-annealing, and is therefore an ideal medium for trapping and immobilising pathogens and serving as a barrier to microbial infection. The ability to produce a functional surface mucosa was an important evolutionary step, which evolved first in the Cnidaria, which includes corals, and the Ctenophora. This allowed the exclusion of non-commensal microbes and the subsequent development of the mucus-lined digestive cavity seen in higher metazoans. The fundamental architecture of the constituent glycoprotein mucins is also evolutionarily conserved. Although an understanding of the biochemical interactions between bacteria and the mucus layer are important to the goal of developing new antimicrobial strategies, they remain relatively poorly understood. This review summarises the physicochemical properties and evolutionary importance of mucus, which make it so successful in the prevention of bacterial infection. In addition, the strategies developed by bacteria to counteract the mucus layer are also explored.","authors":[{"name":"Cassie R Bakshani"},{"name":"Ana L Morales-Garcia"},{"name":"Mike Althaus"},{"name":"Matthew D Wilcox"},{"name":"Jeffrey P Pearson"},{"name":"John C Bythell"},{"name":"J Grant Burgess"}],"keywords":[]},"article395":{"pmid":"30002283","title":"Effect of C/N Ratio on the Removal of Nitrogen and Microbial Characteristics in the Water Saturated Denitrifying Section of a Two-Stage Constructed Rapid Infiltration System.","date":"2019-01-16","abs":"The aim of this study was to improve the removal of nitrogen pollutants from artificial sewage by a modeled two-stage constructed rapid infiltration (CRI) system.

The concentration of nitrate and TN in effluent decreased as the abundance of denitrifying bacteria increased. Moreover, the bacterial biofilms that had formed in the sand of the second stage container were analyzed.

Successful efforts to treat these infections would be aided by additional information on the physiology of A. baumannii Toward that end, we recently reported on a small RNA (sRNA), AbsR25, in this bacterium that regulates the genes of several efflux pumps. Because sRNAs often require the RNA chaperone Hfq for assistance in binding to their cognate mRNA targets, we identified and characterized this protein in A. baumannii The homolog in A. baumannii is a large protein with an extended C terminus unlike Hfqs in other Gram-negative pathogens. The extension has a compositional bias toward glycine and, to a lower extent, phenylalanine and glutamine, suggestive of an intrinsically disordered region. We studied the importance of this glycine-rich tail using truncated versions of Hfq in biophysical assays and complementation of an hfq deletion mutant, finding that the tail was necessary for high-affinity RNA binding. Further tests implicate Hfq in important cellular processes of A. baumannii like metabolism, drug resistance, stress tolerance, and virulence. Our findings underline the importance of the glycine-rich C terminus in RNA binding, ribo-regulation, and auto-regulation of Hfq, demonstrating this hitherto overlooked protein motif to be an indispensable part of the A. baumannii Hfq.","authors":[{"name":"Atin Sharma"},{"name":"Vineet Dubey"},{"name":"Rajnikant Sharma"},{"name":"Kuldip Devnath"},{"name":"Vivek Kumar Gupta"},{"name":"Jawed Akhter"},{"name":"Timsy Bhando"},{"name":"Aparna Verma"},{"name":"Kiran Ambatipudi"},{"name":"Mihir Sarkar"},{"name":"Ranjana Pathania"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AbsR25"},{"word":"Gram negative pathogen"},{"word":"RNA binding protein"},{"word":"bacterial adhesion"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chaperone"},{"word":"gene regulation"},{"word":"intrinsically disordered protein"},{"word":"pathogen"},{"word":"resistance"},{"word":"small RNA"},{"word":"virulence factor"}]},"article397":{"pmid":"30001418","title":"Phenotypic characterization of Gardnerella vaginalis subgroups suggests differences in their virulence potential.","date":"2019-01-08","abs":"The well-known genotypic and phenotypic diversity of G. vaginalis resulted in its classification into at least four subgroups (clades) with diverse genomic properties.

Significant differences in VLY production were found (p = 0.023), but further analysis of clade pairs did not confirm this finding. The amount of biofim did not differ significantly among the clades. Analysis of sialidase activity indicated statistically significant differences among the clades (p < 0.001). Production of active recombinant G. vaginalis sialidase demonstrated the link between the sld gene and enzymatic activity, which may be differentially regulated at the transcriptional level. Statistical classification analysis (random forests algorithm) showed that G. vaginalis clades could be best defined by the profiles of two phenotypic characteristics: sialidase activity and vaginolysin production. The results of principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering suggested that all isolates can be subgrouped into three clusters, the structures of which are determined based on phenotypic characteristics of the isolates. Clade 4 was the most homogenous group, as all isolates were found in the same cluster, which is characterized by low production of all studied virulence factors. Clade 2 isolates were mainly distributed between two clusters, whereas clade 1 isolates were found in all three clusters that were characterized by a distinct profile of phenotypic characteristics.
