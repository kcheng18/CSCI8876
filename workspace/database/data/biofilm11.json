In this study, we found that 70.2 ± 0.2% of DDT disappeared in the presence of SRB and graphite powder, a model PCM, after 21 days at pH 7. Our results suggest that the observed DDT decay was due to the reaction between graphite powder and the reduced sulfur species that were produced by SRB. No biofilm formation was observed on the surface of graphite powder. Rather, the activity of SRB was inhibited by the presence of graphite powder. To understand the involvement of PCM in DDT decay, electrochemical cells and batch reactor experiments with sulfur-pretreated PCM as well as direct electrochemical reduction by a potentiostat were employed. Our results suggest that polysulfide, sulfide, sulfite, and thiosulfate could all react with PCM, forming surface-bound intermediates that subsequently led to DDT decay. The reactivity of reduced sulfur species was the highest for polysulfide, followed by sulfide, sulfite, and thiosulfate.","authors":[{"name":"Kai Ding"},{"name":"Metin Duran"},{"name":"Wenqing Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DDT decay"},{"word":"Pyrogenic carbonaceous matter"},{"word":"Reduced sulfur species"},{"word":"Remediation"},{"word":"Sulfate-reducing bacteria"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"31176043","title":"The potential of commercially available phytotherapeutic compounds as new photosensitizers for dental antimicrobial PDT: A photochemical and photobiological in vitro study.","date":"2020-02-10","abs":"The present study evaluated the effectiveness of extracts of commercially available Curcuma longa, Citrus lemon, Hamamelis virginiana and Hypericum perforatum as photosensitizers in Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT).

Hexane extracted the major lipids present in the microalgae during the stationary phase of growth, which correspond to storage lipids. Triacylglycerols (TGs) were the only storage lipids produced by Dunaliella and Chaetoceros. In contrast, T. lutea predominantly stored polyunsaturated long-chain alkenones, with sterols also detected as minor components of the hexane extract. The molecular structure of brassicasterol was determined in T. lutea and the presence of squalene in this sample was also unequivocally detected. Monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDGs) and pigments were concentrated in the AcOEt extracts. C. calcitrans and D. salina constituted an exception due to the high amount of TGs and glycerol produced, respectively, by these two strains. Chlorophylls a and b and β-carotene were the major pigments synthesized by Dunaliella and chlorophyll a and fucoxanthin were the only pigments detected in Chaetoceros and T. lutea. Information concerning the acyl chains present in TGs and MGDGs as well as the positional distribution of acyl chains on the glycerol moiety was obtained by NMR analysis of hexane and AcOEt extracts, with results consistent with those expected for the genera studied. Fatty acid composition of TGs in the two Dunaliella strains was different, with polyunsaturated acyl chains almost absent in the storage lipids produced by D. salina. Except in C. calcitrans, the polar nature of soluble compounds was inferred through the relative extraction yield using methanol as the extraction solvent. Glycerol was the major component of this fraction for the Dunaliella strains. In T. lutea 1,4/2,5-cyclohexanetetrol (CHT) and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) preponderated. CHT was also the major polyol present in the Chaetoceros strains in which DMSP was not detected, but prominent signals of 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHSP) were observed in the 1H NMR spectra of methanolic extracts. The presence of DHSP confirms the production of this metabolite by diatoms. In addition, several other minor compounds (digalactosyldiacyglycerols (DGDGs), sulphoquinovosyldiacylglycerols (SQDGs), amino acids, carbohydrates, scyllo-inositol, mannitol, lactic acid and homarine) were also identified in the methanolic extracts.

With increasing flow rates, the surface exhibited a significant reduction in attached biofilm of both the oral initial colonizer  Streptococcus oralis and an oral multispecies biofilm composed of S. oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Using single cell force spectroscopy, reduced S. oralis adhesion forces on the lubricant layer could be measured. Gene expression patterns in biofilms on SLIPS, on control surfaces, and expression patterns of planktonic cultures were also compared. For this purpose, the genome of S. oralis strain ATCC 9811 was sequenced using PacBio Sequel technology. Even though biofilm cells showed clear changes in gene expression compared to planktonic cells, no differences could be detected between bacteria on SLIPS and on control surfaces.

Indeed, hypervirulent clones colonize better the intestinal lumen and invade more intestinal tissues than hypovirulent ones, reflecting their adaption to host environment. Conversely, hypovirulent clones are adapted to food processing environments, with a higher prevalence of stress resistance and benzalkonium chloride tolerance genes and a higher survival and biofilm formation capacity in presence of sub-lethal benzalkonium chloride concentrations.

By modeling transport of single cells by flow and Brownian-like swimming, we show that the emergence of these patterns is guided by an effective Péclet number.

These antimicrobials were compared to conventional antibiotics and combination treatments with rifampin. Using a Centers for Disease Control reactor, 24 h S. aureus biofilms were formed on cobalt-chromium discs and the anti-biofilm activity was determined by quantifying the amount of colony forming units following treatments. We found that LL-37 was the most efficacious antimicrobial agent with a more than 4 log reduction in colony counts. In comparison, silver nanoparticles and conventional antibiotics were not as efficacious, with a less than 1 log reduction in colony counts. Antimicrobial combination treatments with rifampin significantly increased the log reduction for AgNPs and gentamicin, although still significantly less than LL-37 in isolation. Furthermore, kinetic studies revealed the rapid elimination of S. aureus biofilm with LL-37. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrated that LL-37 was an effective agent against S. aureus biofilms and may have potential clinical applications in the eradication of biofilms and treatment of prosthetic joint infection.","authors":[{"name":"Jason Kang"},{"name":"Matthew J Dietz"},{"name":"Bingyun Li"}],"keywords":[]},"article25":{"pmid":"31169713","title":"Invasive candidiasis: Risk factor for mortality in a pediatric tertiary care hospital in south of Brazil.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a major cause of morbimortality in children.

Although enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is used worldwide for phosphorus removal, the standard activated sludge-based EBPR process shows limitations with stability and efficiency. Recently, a new EBPR moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) process has been developed at HIAS (Hamar, Norway), enabling a phosphorus removal stability above 90% during a whole year cycle. To increase the knowledge of the HIAS (MBBR) process the aim of the current work was to characterize the MBBR microbiota and operational performance weekly for the operational year. Surprisingly, we found a major succession of the microbiota, with a five-fold increase in phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs), and major shifts in eukaryote composition, despite a stable phosphorus removal. Temperature was the only factor that significantly affected both phosphorus removal and the microbiota. There was a lower phosphor removal during the winter, coinciding with a higher microbiota alpha diversity, and a lower beta diversity. This differs from what is observed for activated sludge based EBPR. Taken together, the knowledge gained from the current microbiota study supports the efficiency and stability of MBBR-based systems, and that knowledge from activated sludge-based EBPR approaches cannot be translated to MBBR systems.","authors":[{"name":"Knut Rudi"},{"name":"Inger Andrea Goa"},{"name":"Torgeir Saltnes"},{"name":"Gjermund Sørensen"},{"name":"Inga Leena Angell"},{"name":"Sondre Eikås"}],"keywords":[]},"article29":{"pmid":"31169490","title":"Isolation and characterization of Siphoviridae phage infecting extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo.","date":"2019-09-24","abs":"Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Acinetobacter baumannii are being reported worldwide, and they are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.

The quantitative retrospective research was conducted on 2706 patients of both sexes (mostly middle-aged to elderly) with various toenail lesions, who had undergone mycological analyses in the Mycological Laboratory of our Department of Dermatovenereology in 2013 and 2014. Analysis of the results obtained revealed that there were 35.4% of positive DME results; of these, there were 39.2% of dermatophytes, 59.1% of yeasts and 1.7% of molds. The percentage of dermatophytes (Trichophyton spp.) was twice as high in men as in women. A considerable percentage (12%) of mixed isolates was also observed. Particularly worrisome was the high percentage (one-third) of suppressed and insufficiently developed dermatophytes (a possible indicator of inappropriate preparation of patients for mycological analysis). Cultivation on culture media without cycloheximide requires frequent inspections because of the fast-growing molds while not allowing sporulation for a great number of dermatophytes. However, it has certain advantages, i.e. it offers an insight into the wide range of the present fungi. As part of the biofilm, they can be potentially pathogenic in dystrophic nails under certain circumstances because, according to our results, the percentage of dermatophytes does not change substantially with aging; however, what does change is the percentage of molds, yeasts and mixed isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Sanja Mendek"},{"name":"Liborija Lugović-Mihić"},{"name":"Iva Ferček"},{"name":"Iva Japundžić"},{"name":"Mirna Šitum"},{"name":"Maja Abram"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Dermatophytes"},{"word":"Mycological examination"},{"word":"Nails"},{"word":"Non-dermatophyte fungi"},{"word":"Onychomycosis"}]},"article32":{"pmid":"31168208","title":"IRRITANT AND ALLERGIC CONTACT DERMATITIS - SKIN LESION CHARACTERISTICS.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"- Contact skin lesions may be the consequences of contact with various irritants or allergens, or due to other factors (e.g., UV radiation, microbials), intrinsic factors (e.g., in autoimmune responses), or even their combination.

Development of allergic CD skin lesions includes complex immune pathways and inflammatory mediators, influenced by both genetic (predominantly filaggrin mutations) and environmental triggers. In the pathogenesis of allergic CD, antimicrobial peptides play a prominent role; they are produced by various skin cells (e.g., keratinocytes, sebocytes) and move to inflamed lesions during an inflammation process. Also, in allergic CD skin lesions, the skin shows different types of immune responses to individual allergens, although clinical manifestations do not depend on the causative allergen type, e.g., nickel stimulates immune activation primarily of the Th1/Th17 and Th22 components.

We determined the development and succession of bacterial communities on different plastics under ambient and dim light conditions in the coastal Northern Adriatic over the course of two months using scanning electron microscopy and 16S rRNA gene analyses. Plastics used were low- and high-density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE, respectively), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride with two typical additives (PVC DEHP and PVC DINP). The bacterial communities developing on the plastics clustered in two groups; one group was found on PVC and the other group on all the other plastics and on glass, which was used as an inert control. Specific bacterial taxa were found on specific surfaces in essentially all stages of biofilm development and in both ambient and dim light conditions. Differences in bacterial community composition between the different plastics and light exposures were stronger after an incubation period of one week than at the later stages of the incubation. Under both ambient and dim light conditions, one part of the bacterial community was common on all plastic types, especially in later stages of the biofilm development, with families such as Flavobacteriaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Planctomycetaceae and Phyllobacteriaceae presenting relatively high relative abundances on all surfaces. Another part of the bacterial community was plastic-type specific. The plastic-type specific fraction was variable among the different plastic types and was more abundant after one week of incubation than at later stages of the succession.","authors":[{"name":"Maria Pinto"},{"name":"Teresa M Langer"},{"name":"Thorsten Hüffer"},{"name":"Thilo Hofmann"},{"name":"Gerhard J Herndl"}],"keywords":[]},"article36":{"pmid":"31166855","title":"Effects of a surfactant-based gel on acute and chronic paediatric wounds: a panel discussion and case series.","date":"2019-12-25","abs":"On 20 November 2018, following the International Society for Paediatric Wound Care conference, a closed panel meeting took place in which the use of a surfactant-based gel (PluroGel (PMM), Medline Industries, Illinois, US) in paediatric wound care was discussed.

In this study, the antimicrobial effect of GRA and its derivatives against the S. mutans UA159 strain were investigated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of GRA and GR-SU showed antibacterial activity against the S. mutans strain, whereas other tested derivatives did not. Because GR-SU is more soluble than GRA, GR-SU was used for further experiments. The antibacterial activity of GR-SU against 100 S. mutans strains was evaluated and it was found that all strains are susceptible to GR-SU, with MIC values below 256 µg/mL. A cell viability assay showed that GR-SU has a bacteriostatic effect on S. mutans cells. As to growth kinetics, sub-MICs of GR-SU inhibited growth. The effect of GR-SU on S. mutans virulence was then investigated. GR-SU at sub-MICs suppresses biofilm formation. Additionally, GR-SU greatly suppresses the pH drop caused by the addition of glucose and glucose-induced expression of the genes responsible for acid production (ldh and pykF) and tolerance (aguD and atpD).

Following a regular hemodialysis session (4 hours, polysulfone membrane), dialyzers were flushed and the surface biofilm eluted by acetic acid. Protein composition of the eluates was determined by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and resulting patterns compared between regimens.

The productivity reached 80% of the maximum value 10 days after start-up and no subsequent decline was observed, confirming the suitability of the system for long-term fermentation. The analysis of biofilm performance revealed that productivity increases with the flow velocity. This is explained by the reduced retention time of the liquid phase in the reactor, and, thus, a minor pH drop caused by the released lactic acid. At low flow velocities, the pH drops to a value where growth and production are significantly inhibited. The biofilm was visualized by magnetic resonance imaging to analyze biofilm thickness.

Recently, a novel method of biofilm preparation using a modified three-dimensional (3D) printer with a bacterial ink has been developed. This article describes the steps necessary to build this efficient, low-cost 3D bioprinter that offers multiple applications in bacterially-induced materials processing. The protocol begins with an adapted commercial 3D printer in which the extruder has been replaced with a bio-ink dispenser connected to a syringe pump system enabling a controllable, continuous flow of bio-ink. To develop a bio-ink suitable for biofilm printing, engineered Escherichia coli bacteria were suspended in a solution of alginate, so that they solidify in contact with a surface containing calcium. The inclusion of an inducer chemical within the printing substrate drives expression of biofilm proteins within the printed bio-ink. This method enables 3D printing of various spatial patterns composed of discrete layers of printed biofilms.

Many LOS structures are controlled by phase variation mediated by random slipped-strand base mispairing, which can reversibly switch gene expression on or off. Phase variation diversifies the LOS, however its adaptive role is not well-understood. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an important pathogen that causes a range of illnesses in the upper and lower respiratory tract. In NTHi a phase variable galactosyltransferase encoded by lic2A initiates galactose chain extension of the LOS outer core. The donor substrate for Lic2A, UDP-galactose, is generated from UDP-glucose by UDP-galactose epimerase encoded by galE. Our previous fitness profiling of H. influenzae mutants in a murine lung model showed that the galE mutant had a severe survival defect, while the lic2A mutant's defect was modest, leading us to postulate that unidentified factors act as suppressors of potential defects in a lic2A mutant. Herein we conducted a genome-wide genetic interaction screen to identify genes epistatic on lic2A for survival in the murine lung. An unexpected finding was that galE mutants exhibited restored virulence properties in a lic2A mutant background. We identified an alternative antibody epitope generated by Lic2A in the galE mutant that increased sensitivity to classical complement mediated killing in human serum. Deletion of lic2A or restoration of UDP-galactose synthesis alleviated the galE mutant's virulence defects. These studies indicate that when deprived of its galactosyl substrate, Lic2A acquires an alternative activity leading to increased recognition of NTHi by IgM and decreased survival in the lung model. Biofilm formation was increased by deletion of galE and by increased availability of UDP-GlcNAc precursors that can compete with UDP-galactose production.

In the water, an increase in Vibrio spp. diversity in the absence of a net increase in relative read abundance suggests a likely decrease in the abundance of specific pathogenic Vibrio spp., and therefore lower chances of a disease outbreak.

Typhimurium 14028s assessed in response to lettuce medium or lettuce root exudates showed an upregulation of genes associated with biofilm formation and virulence. On the other hand, lettuce inoculated with S. Typhimurium 14028s showed a strong upregulation of genes associated with plant immune response and genes related to stress response. In summary, these results showed that organic fertilizers can increase the persistence of Salmonella in soil and that soil type and plant species play a crucial role in the interactions between human pathogens and crop plants. This understanding is therefore a starting point for new strategies to provide safe food for the consumer.","authors":[{"name":"Sven Jechalke"},{"name":"Jasper Schierstaedt"},{"name":"Marlies Becker"},{"name":"Burkhardt Flemer"},{"name":"Rita Grosch"},{"name":"Kornelia Smalla"},{"name":"Adam Schikora"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella"},{"word":"crop plants"},{"word":"internalization"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"plant defense"},{"word":"soil"}]},"article94":{"pmid":"31155952","title":"Ex vivo biofilm-forming ability of dermatophytes using dog and cat hair: an ethically viable approach for an infection model.","date":"2019-11-04","abs":"The aim of this study was to establish an ex vivo model for dermatophyte biofilm growth, using hair from dogs and cats.

In this study, we show that mild heat stress causes a morphological change in hyphae during the process of biofilm formation. We found that mild heat stress extended the period of hyphal stage maintenance in C. albicans biofilm. Although the rate of hyphal change from yeast form to hyphal form reached the maximum within 3 hr, later, almost every cell quickly reverted to the yeast growth phase within 6 hr at 37°C but not at 39°C, or under mild heat stress. Electron microscopy using a smart specimen preparation technique revealed that mild heat stress significantly increased the thickness of the inner cell wall accompanied by a decrease in density of the outer cell wall in the hyphae of C. albicans biofilm. To identify the gene responsible for the morphological changes associated with mild heat stress, we performed microarray gene expression analysis. Eleven genes were upregulated and 17 genes were downregulated under mild heat stress in biofilm cells. The increased PHR1 gene expression in response to mild heat stress was confirmed in quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The mutant upregulated PHR1 expression showed the same sensitivity against antifungal drug micafungin as dependent on mild heat stress. Our findings point to possible therapeutic effects of hyperthermia as well as to the effect of fever during infections.","authors":[{"name":"Shojiro Ikezaki"},{"name":"Tamaki Cho"},{"name":"Jun-Ichi Nagao"},{"name":"Sonoko Tasaki"},{"name":"Masashi Yamaguchi"},{"name":"Ken-Ichi Arita-Morioka"},{"name":"Kanae Yasumatsu"},{"name":"Hiroji Chibana"},{"name":"Tetsuro Ikebe"},{"name":"Yoshihiko Tanaka"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"PHR1"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell wall"},{"word":"mild heat stress"}]},"article96":{"pmid":"31154192","title":"The impact of environmental parameters on the conversion of toluene to CO","date":"2019-08-15","abs":"The fraction of pollutant converted to CO","authors":[{"name":"Achinta Bordoloi"},{"name":"Daniel J Gapes"},{"name":"Peter A Gostomski"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofiltration"},{"word":"CO(2) end-points"},{"word":"Carbon balance"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"Matric potential"},{"word":"Toluene"}]},"article97":{"pmid":"31154129","title":"Disinfection byproduct formation during drinking water treatment and distribution: A review of unintended effects of engineering agents and materials.","date":"2019-11-06","abs":"Unintended effects of engineering agents and materials on the formation of undesirable disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment and distribution were comprehensively reviewed. Specially, coagulants, biologically active filtration biofilms, activated carbons, nanomaterials, ion-exchange resins, membrane materials in drinking water treatment and piping materials, deposits and biofilms within drinking water distribution systems were discussed, which may serve as DBP precursors, transform DBPs into more toxic species, and/or catalyze the formation of DBPs. Speciation and quantity of DBPs generated rely heavily on the material characteristics, solution chemistry conditions, and operating factors. For example, quaternary ammonium polymer coagulants can increase concentrations of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) to above the California notification level (10 ng/L). Meanwhile, the application of strong base ion-exchange resins has been associated with the formation of N-nitrosamines and trichloronitromethane up to concentrations of 400 ng/L and 9.0 μg/L, respectively. Organic compounds leaching from membranes and plastic and rubber pipes can generate high NDMA (180-450 ng/L) and chloral hydrate (∼12.4 μg/L) upon downstream disinfection. Activated carbon and membranes preferentially remove organic precursors over bromide, resulting in a higher proportion of brominated DBPs. Copper corrosion products (CCPs) accelerate the decay of disinfectants and increase the formation of halogenated DBPs. Chlorination of high bromide waters containing CCPs can form bromate at concentrations exceeding regulatory limits. Owing to the aforementioned concern for the drinking water quality, the application of these materials and reagents during drinking water treatment and distribution should be based on the removal of pollutants with consideration for balancing DBP formation during disinfection scenarios. Overall, this review highlights situations in which the use of engineering agents and materials in drinking water treatment and distribution needs balance against deleterious impacts on DBP formation.","authors":[{"name":"Shunke Ding"},{"name":"Yang Deng"},{"name":"Tom Bond"},{"name":"Chao Fang"},{"name":"Zhongqi Cao"},{"name":"Wenhai Chu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Agents and materials"},{"word":"Disinfection byproducts"},{"word":"Drinking water distribution"},{"word":"Drinking water treatment"},{"word":"Unintended effect"}]},"article98":{"pmid":"31153105","title":"Gene expression is influenced due to 'nano' and 'ionic' copper in pre-formed Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.","date":"2020-01-06","abs":"Today, researchers across the globe suggest the use of antimicrobial coatings containing copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) complementing the traditional protocols to prevent hospital-acquired infections (HAIs).

Thus, it needs to be supplemented to daily diet for accumulative and long-term benefits. Chemical synthesis of MK-7 produces a significant cis-isomer form of it, which has no biological activity. Fortunately, due to its key role in electron transfer in bacteria, trans-MK-7 is biosynthesized by especially Gram-positive strains mainly Bacillus genus. Concordantly, MK-7 could be produced via solid or liquid state fermentation strategies. In either regime, when static fermentation is applied in the absence of agitation and aeration, operational issues arise such as heat and mass transfer inefficiencies. Thus, scaling up the process becomes a challenge. On the other hand, studies have indicated that biofilm and pellicle formation that occur in static fermentations are key characteristics for extracellular MK-7 secretion. Therefore, this review covers the most recent discoveries of the therapeutic properties of MK-7 and optimization attempts at increasing its biosynthesis in different media compositions and effective growth parameters as well as the cutting-edge use of biofilm reactors where B. subtilis cells have the infrastructures to form mature biofilm formations on plastic composite supports. Biofilm reactors therefore can provide robust extracellular MK-7 secretion while simultaneously enduring high agitation and aeration rates, which then address the scale-up and operational issues associated with static fermentation strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Mahdinia"},{"name":"Ali Demirci"},{"name":"Aydin Berenjian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Agitated bioreactors"},{"word":"Bacillus"},{"word":"Biofilm reactors"},{"word":"MK-7"},{"word":"Menaquinone-7"},{"word":"Microbial fermentation"},{"word":"vitamin K"}]},"article105":{"pmid":"31151767","title":"Direct microbial transformation of carbon dioxide to value-added chemicals: A comprehensive analysis and application potentials.","date":"2019-09-17","abs":"Carbon dioxide storage in petroleum and other geological reservoirs is an economical option for long-term separation of this gas from the atmosphere.

Therefore, staphylococcin antimicrobial activity against six strains of S. aureus isolated from cheese was tested aiming at their industrial application in biopreservation of Minas fresh (Frescal) cheese with reduced sodium content. Three staphylococcins were selected for these tests: Pep 5, aureocin A53 and lysostaphin. All three staphylococcins proved to be bacteriolytic against all six strains of S. aureus. The antimicrobial activity of the partially purified staphylococcins was subsequently investigated against strains S. aureus Q1 and QJ3 in cheese matrices (6.0 log CFU/g) with different NaCl contents (control, a 25% reduction, and a 50% reduction), kept under refrigeration at 4 °C, for 21 days.

When used singly, Pep5, aureocin A53 and lysostaphin reduced approximately 95%, 99% and 99.99% of the viable cell counts, respectively, irrespective of the sodium content of the cheese matrix. The combined action of aureocin A53 and Pep5 resulted in an additional and significant reduction (p < 0.05) of ~1.0 log CFU/g when compared with the reduction caused by the use of either one singly.

Within the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes persistent biofilm infection that is commonly treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics such as tobramycin. However, sublethal concentrations of this aminoglycoside were previously shown to increase biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa, but the underlying adaptive mechanisms still remain elusive. Herein, we combined confocal laser scanning microscope analyses, proteomics profiling, gene expression assays and phenotypic studies to unravel P. aeruginosa potential adaptive mechanisms in response to tobramycin exposure during biofilm growth. Under this condition, we show that the modified biofilm architecture is related at least in part to increased extracellular DNA (eDNA) release, most likely as a result of biofilm cell death. Furthermore, the activity of quorum sensing (QS) systems was increased, leading to higher production of QS signaling molecules. We also demonstrate upon tobramycin exposure an increase in expression of the PrrF small regulatory RNAs, as well as expression of iron uptake systems. Remarkably, biofilm biovolumes and eDNA relative abundances in pqs and prrF mutant strains decrease in the presence of tobramycin. Overall, our findings offer experimental evidences for a potential adaptive mechanism linking PrrF sRNAs, QS signaling, biofilm cell death, eDNA release, and tobramycin-enhanced biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. These specific adaptive mechanisms should be considered to improve treatment strategies against P. aeruginosa biofilm establishment in CF patients' lungs.","authors":[{"name":"Ali Tahrioui"},{"name":"Rachel Duchesne"},{"name":"Emeline Bouffartigues"},{"name":"Sophie Rodrigues"},{"name":"Olivier Maillot"},{"name":"Damien Tortuel"},{"name":"Julie Hardouin"},{"name":"Laure Taupin"},{"name":"Marie-Christine Groleau"},{"name":"Alain Dufour"},{"name":"Eric Déziel"},{"name":"Gerald Brenner-Weiss"},{"name":"Marc Feuilloley"},{"name":"Nicole Orange"},{"name":"Olivier Lesouhaitier"},{"name":"Pierre Cornelis"},{"name":"Sylvie Chevalier"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobials"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Pathogens"}]},"article115":{"pmid":"31148964","title":"Glyceryl trinitrate blocks staphyloxanthin and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is an important nosocomial bacterium that is responsible for a number of infections that may be fatal.

In material science, it is important to detect the biofilm formed on a surface to prevent biofouling. EPSs, the major component of the biofilm, mainly consist of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Because these biomolecules have a variety of hydrophilicities or hydrophobicities, the substrate covered with the biofilm shows different wettability from the initial state. To detect the biofilm formation, this study employed a liquid-squeezing-based wettability assessment method with a simple wettability index: the liquid-squeezed diameter of a smaller value indicates higher wettability. The method is based on the liquid-squeezing behaviour of a liquid that covers sample surfaces when an air-jet is applied. To form the biofilm, polystyrene surfaces were immersed and incubated in a water-circulated bioreactor that had collected microorganisms in ambient air. After the 14-d incubation, good formation of the biofilm on the surfaces was confirmed by staining with crystal violet. Although the contact angles of captive bubbles on the surfaces with the biofilm were unmeasurable, the liquid-squeezing method could distinguish between hydrophilic and hydrophobic initial surfaces with and without biofilm formation using the diameter of the liquid-squeezed area. The surface wettability is expected to be a promising property for in-situ detection of biofilm formation on a macroscopic scale.","authors":[{"name":"Nobuyuki Tanaka"},{"name":"Takeshi Kogo"},{"name":"Nobumitsu Hirai"},{"name":"Akiko Ogawa"},{"name":"Hideyuki Kanematsu"},{"name":"Junko Takahara"},{"name":"Akane Awazu"},{"name":"Nobuko Fujita"},{"name":"Yoshihide Haruzono"},{"name":"Shunji Ichida"},{"name":"Yo Tanaka"}],"keywords":[]},"article118":{"pmid":"31147297","title":"Effects of denture adhesives on growth and morphological transformation of Candida albicans.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"We investigated the effects of denture adhesives (cream (Cr), powder (Po), and cushion (Cu)) on growth and adhesive-related morphological transformation of Candida albicans.

Still, very little is known about how the coexistence of multiple organisms impact the multispecies biofilm properties. In this study, we examined the behaviour of a dual-species biofilm at the air-liquid interface composed by two environmental bacteria: Bacillus licheniformis and a phenazine mutant of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Study of the planktonic and biofilm growths for each species revealed that P. fluorescens grew faster than B. licheniformis and no bactericidal effect from P. fluorescens was detected, suggesting that the growth kinetics could be the main factor in the dual-species biofilm composition. To validate this hypothesis, the single- and dual-species biofilm were characterized by biomass quantification, microscopy and rheology. Bacterial counts and microscale architecture analysis showed that both bacterial populations coexist in the mature pellicle, with a dominance of P. fluorescens. Real-time measurement of the dual-species biofilms' viscoelastic (i.e. mechanical) properties using interfacial rheology confirmed that P. fluorescens was the main contributor of the biofilm properties. Evaluation of the dual-species pellicle viscoelasticity at longer time revealed that the biofilm, after reaching a first equilibrium, created a stronger and more cohesive network. Interfacial rheology proves to be a unique quantitative technique, which combined with microscale imaging, contributes to the understanding of the time-dependent properties within a polymicrobial community at various stages of biofilm development.

Sharp debridement, a possible effective method for eliminating biofilms, can only be applied to the wound with visible necrotic tissue; thus, no option has been available for eliminating biofilms that are not accompanied by necrotic tissue. Wound blotting was recently developed to visualize biofilm noninvasively and quickly, and ultrasonic debridement is available for biofilm removal. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of biofilm-based wound care system (BWCS), a combination of wound blotting as a point-of-care testing and ultrasonic debridement, for promoting wound healing. Firstly, the cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the proportion of biofilm removal by ultrasonic debridement in pressure ulcers [Study 1]. Subsequently, the retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of BWCS for healing of chronic wounds [Study 2]. The proportions of wound healing between wounds treated with BWCS and those with standard care in the home-visiting clinic were compared by Kaplan-Meier curve, and the Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to assess the effect of BWCS on wound healing. In Study 1, the median of biofilm removal proportion was 38.9% (interquartile range, 12.9-68.0%) for pressure ulcers treated with standard care and 65.2% (41.1-78.8%) for those treated with ultrasonic debridement (p = 0.009). In Study 2, the proportion of wound healing within 90 days was significantly higher in wounds treated with BWCS than in those treated with standard care (p = 0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio of BWCS for wound healing was 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-15.0; p = 0.015).

Recently, two derivatives of the frog skin antimicrobial peptide esculentin-1a, i.e. Esc(1-21) and its D-amino acids containing diastereomer Esc(1-21)-1c, were characterized for their powerful anti-Pseudomonal activity against both forms. Prevention of biofilm formation already in its early stages could be even more advantageous for counteracting infections induced by this bacterium. In this work, we studied how the diastereomer Esc(1-21)-1c can inhibit Pseudomonas biofilm formation in comparison to the parent peptide and two clinically-used conventional antibiotics, i.e. colistin and aztreonam, when applied at dosages below the minimal growth inhibitory concentration. Biofilm prevention was correlated to the peptides' ability to inhibit Pseudomonas motility and to reduce the production of virulent metabolites, for example, pyoverdine and rhamnolipids. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism underlying these activities was evaluated by studying the peptides' effect on the expression of key genes involved in the virulence and motility of bacteria, as well as by monitoring the peptides' binding to the bacterial signaling nucleotide ppGpp. Our results demonstrate that the presence of only two D-amino acids in Esc(1-21)-1c is sufficient to downregulate ppGpp-mediated expression of biofilm-associated genes, presumably as a result of higher peptide stability and therefore prolonged interaction with the nucleotide. Overall, these studies should assist efficient design and optimization of new anti-infective agents with multiple pharmacologically beneficial properties.","authors":[{"name":"Bruno Casciaro"},{"name":"Qiao Lin"},{"name":"Sergii Afonin"},{"name":"Maria Rosa Loffredo"},{"name":"Valeria de Turris"},{"name":"Volker Middel"},{"name":"Anne S Ulrich"},{"name":"YuanPu Peter Di"},{"name":"Maria Luisa Mangoni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"amino acids epimerization"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"biofilm inhibition"},{"word":"virulence genes"}]},"article137":{"pmid":"31144198","title":"Efficacy of Ciprofloxacin and Its Copper Complex against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms.","date":"2019-07-22","abs":"A limitation of antibiotic treatments for P. aeruginosa (PA) chronic pulmonary infections is the reduced efficacy due to sub-therapeutic concentrations at the infection site and the development of biofilm. A novel approach to sustain ciprofloxacin (CIP) in the lungs after inhalation is to reduce its pulmonary absorption rate by its complexation with copper (CIP-Cu). This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial action of cationic CIP-Cu complex in PA biofilms in terms of drug concentration and time. Two PA strains, PA01 and PA14, were grown to form biofilm layers in equilibrium with planktonic cells. Static parameters such as pyoverdine production by planktonic cells, enzymatic activity within biofilms, and biofilm biomass 24 h after the addition of CIP or CIP-Cu were evaluated. Also, the kinetic effects of CIP and CIP-Cu on biofilms were evaluated by bioluminescence kinetics using transgenic strains. No differences were observed between CIP and CIP-Cu in terms of efficacy against biofilms, validating the potential of using this complex to treat PA biofilms. Interestingly, CIP concentrations slightly below the MIC value against planktonic bacteria stimulated both virulence and biofilm PA01 production. These results support the need to accurately achieve high CIP concentration in the lungs, which can be more easily achieved by pulmonary delivery of advanced CIP formulations (CIP-metal complexes or liposomal CIP) instead of the oral administration of free CIP.","authors":[{"name":"Frederic Tewes"},{"name":"Tania F Bahamondez-Canas"},{"name":"Hugh D C Smyth"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm infections"},{"word":"ciprofloxacin"},{"word":"copper-based antimicrobials"},{"word":"pulmonary delivery"}]},"article138":{"pmid":"31143534","title":"Cells released from S. epidermidis biofilms present increased antibiotic tolerance to multiple antibiotics.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biofilm released cells (Brc) are thought to present an intermediary phenotype between biofilm and planktonic cells and this has the potential of affecting their antimicrobial tolerance.","authors":[{"name":"Vânia Gaio"},{"name":"Nuno Cerca"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial tolerance"},{"word":"Biofilm disassembly"},{"word":"Biofilm-released cells"},{"word":"S. epidermidis"}]},"article139":{"pmid":"31143408","title":"Deep sequencing of biofilm microbiomes on dental composite materials.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Georg Conrads"},{"name":"Laura Katharina Wendt"},{"name":"Franziska Hetrodt"},{"name":"Zhi-Luo Deng"},{"name":"Dietmar Pieper"},{"name":"Mohamed M H Abdelbary"},{"name":"Andree Barg"},{"name":"Irene Wagner-Döbler"},{"name":"Christian Apel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Microbial ecology"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"bovine enamel"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"carolacton"},{"word":"composite materials"},{"word":"microbiome"}]},"article140":{"pmid":"31143407","title":"Inactivation of Streptococcus mutans genes lytST and dltAD impairs its pathogenicity in vivo.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Midian C Castillo Pedraza"},{"name":"Pedro L Rosalen"},{"name":"Aline Rogéria Freire de Castilho"},{"name":"Irlan de Almeida Freires"},{"name":"Luana de Sales Leite"},{"name":"Roberta C Faustoferri"},{"name":"Robert G Quivey"},{"name":"Marlise I Klein"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Exopolysaccharides"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"lipoteichoic acids"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"systemic infection"}]},"article141":{"pmid":"31143172","title":"Impact of Proinflammatory Cytokines on the Virulence of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The effect of a urinary tract infection on the host is a well-studied research field.

Biofilms are three-dimensional structures that confer distinct physical and biological properties to the collective of cells living within them. We used agent-based modeling to explore whether local cellular interactions were sufficient to give rise to global structural features of biofilms. Specifically, we asked whether chemorepulsion from a self-produced quorum-sensing molecule, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), was sufficient to recapitulate biofilm growth and cellular organization observed for biofilms of Helicobacter pylori, a common bacterial resident of human stomachs. To carry out this modeling, we modified an existing platform, Individual-based Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator (iDynoMiCS), to incorporate three-dimensional chemotaxis, planktonic cells that could join or leave the biofilm structure, and cellular production of AI-2. We simulated biofilm growth of previously characterized H. pylori strains with various AI-2 production and sensing capacities. Using biologically plausible parameters, we were able to recapitulate both the variation in biofilm mass and cellular distributions observed with these strains. Specifically, the strains that were competent to chemotax away from AI-2 produced smaller and more heterogeneously spaced biofilms, whereas the AI-2 chemotaxis-defective strains produced larger and more homogeneously spaced biofilms. The model also provided new insights into the cellular demographics contributing to the biofilm patterning of each strain. Our analysis supports the idea that cellular interactions at small spatial and temporal scales are sufficient to give rise to larger-scale emergent properties of biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Emily G Sweeney"},{"name":"Andrew Nishida"},{"name":"Alexandra Weston"},{"name":"Maria S Bañuelos"},{"name":"Kristin Potter"},{"name":"John Conery"},{"name":"Karen Guillemin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"autoinducer 2"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chemotaxis"},{"word":"computer modeling"}]},"article147":{"pmid":"31142260","title":"Evaluation of the interaction between polymyxin B and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm and planktonic cells: reactive oxygen species induction and zeta potential.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Although the most widely accepted mechanism of action for polymyxins is related to bacterial lysis via disruption, we hypothesized that this antimicrobial drug class could have other effects on Pseudomonas aeruginosa planktonic and sessile cells.

In this biobehaviorally focused review, we aim to elucidate the complex mechanisms that link the biological and molecular aspects of CLVUs with their PNS. Innovations in omics research have increased our understanding of important wound microenvironmental factors (e.g., inflammation, microbial pathogenic biofilm, epigenetic processes) that may adversely alter the wound bed's molecular milieu so that microbes evade immune detection. Although these molecular factors are not singularly responsible for wound healing, they are major components of wound development, nonhealing, and PNS that, until now, have not been amenable to systematic study, especially over time. Further, this review explores our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the immune activation that contributes to the development and persistence of CVLUs also leads to the development, persistence, and severity of wound-related PNS.

Microbial communities were analyzed by bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker gene sequencing. Corynebacterium was the most common bacterial taxa across biofilm communities. Clustering analysis revealed three bacterial biofilm types: one low diversity and dominated by Corynebacterium; another was polymicrobial and characterized by Staphylococcus; and the third was polymicrobial and associated with Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, and Prevotella. Biofilm type was significantly correlated with stent material: covered metal with the Staphylococcus-type biofilm, silicone with the Corynebacterium-dominated biofilm, and uncovered metal with the polymicrobial biofilm. Subjects with sequential stents had frequent transitions between community types. Fungal analysis found Candida was most prevalent, Aspergillus was common and highly enriched in two of three stents associated with airway anastomotic dehiscence, and fungal taxa not typically considered pathogens were highly enriched in some stents. Thus, molecular analysis revealed a complex and dynamic endobronchial stent biofilm with three bacterial types that associate with stent material, a central role for Corynebacterium, and that both expected and unexpected fungi inhabit this unique niche.

It is clearly illustrated how the accumulation of excreted metabolites (concomitant with the sodium build-up due to base dosing) has a severe effect on the biofilm structure and physiology. Under high accumulation (HA) conditions, some cells exhibit severe elongation while maintaining a cross-sectional diameter like the rod/cocci-shaped cells predominantly found in low accumulation (LA) conditions. The elongated cells formed at high accumulation conditions were found to be more viable than the clusters of rod/cocci-shaped cells and appear to form connections between the clusters.

This complex group has been used for decades as a hodgepodge, including many taxonomically related species. More than 60 pathovars of P. syringae have been described based on distinct host ranges and disease symptoms they cause. These pathovars cause disease relying on an array of virulence mechanisms. However, P. syringae pv. syringae (Pss) is the most polyphagous bacterium in the P. syringae complex, based on its wide host range, that primarily affects woody and herbaceous host plants. In early 1990s, bacterial apical necrosis (BAN) of mango trees, a critical disease elicited by Pss in Southern Spain was described for the first time. Pss exhibits important epiphytic traits and virulence factors, which may promote its survival and pathogenicity in mango trees and in other plant hosts. Over more than two decades, Pss strains isolated from mango trees have been comprehensively investigated to elucidate the mechanisms that governs their epiphytic and pathogenic lifestyles. In particular, the vast majority of Pss strains isolated from mango trees produce an antimetabolite toxin, called mangotoxin, whose leading role in virulence has been clearly demonstrated. Moreover, phenotypic, genetic and phylogenetic approaches support that Pss strains producers of BAN symptoms on mango trees all belong to a single phylotype within phylogroup 2, are adapted to the mango host, and produce mangotoxin. Remarkably, a genome sequencing project of the Pss model strain UMAF0158 revealed the presence of other factors that may play major roles in its different lifestyles, such as the presence of two different type III secretion systems, two type VI secretion systems and an operon for cellulose biosynthesis. The role of cellulose in increasing mango leaf colonization and biofilm formation, and impairing virulence of Pss, suggests that cellulose may play a pivotal role with regards to the balance of its different lifestyles. In addition, 62-kb plasmids belonging to the pPT23A-family of plasmids (PFPs) have been strongly associated with Pss strains that inhabit mango trees. Further, complete sequence and comparative genomic analyses revealed major roles of PFPs in detoxification of copper compounds and ultraviolet radiation resistance, both improving the epiphytic lifestyle of Pss on mango surfaces. Hence, in this review we summarize the research that has been conducted on Pss by our research group to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the epiphytic and pathogenic lifestyle on mango trees.

In this review, we discuss investigations into the functions of T1F, from the earliest work published in 1958 to operon organization, organelle structure, T1F biogenesis, and the various functions of T1F in Salmonella-host interactions. We give special attention to regulation of T1F expression and their role in binding of Salmonella to cells, cell lines, organ explants, and other surfaces with emphasis on biofilm formation and discuss T1F role as virulence factors based on work using animal models. We also discuss the importance of allelic variation in fimH to Salmonella pathogenesis, as well as role of FimH in Salmonella host specificity.","authors":[{"name":"Rafal Kolenda"},{"name":"Maciej Ugorski"},{"name":"Krzysztof Grzymajlo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"invasion"},{"word":"regulation of expression"},{"word":"type 1 fimbriae"}]},"article159":{"pmid":"31139155","title":"Curd-Peptide Based Novel Hydrogel Inhibits Biofilm Formation, Quorum Sensing, Swimming Mortility of Multi-Antibiotic Resistant Clinical Isolates and Accelerates Wound Healing Activity.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The search for a bioactive natural antibacterial agent with wound healing properties is a common practice for the development of new-generation molecules.

This work presents a newly developed hydrogel that has the potential for treating bacterial wound infections. The hydrogel formulation is based on an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), epsilon-poly-l-lysine (EPL) and catechol, which was cross-linked via mussel-inspired chemistry between the amine and phenol groups. In vitro studies showed that EPL-catechol hydrogels possess impressive antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties toward multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MRAB).

During systemic infection of host trees, pathogen cells must rapidly respond to changes in their environment as they move through different host tissues that present distinct challenges and sources of nutrition. Growing evidence indicates that small RNAs (sRNAs) play an important role in disease progression as posttranscriptional regulators. The sRNA ArcZ positively regulates the motility phenotype and transcription of flagellar genes in E. amylovora Ea1189 yet is a direct repressor of translation of the flagellar master regulator, FlhD. We utilized transposon mutagenesis to conduct a forward genetic screen and identified suppressor mutations that increase motility in the Ea1189ΔarcZ mutant background. This enabled us to determine that the mechanism of transcriptional activation of the flhDC mRNA by ArcZ is mediated by the leucine-responsive regulatory protein, Lrp. We show that Lrp contributes to expression of virulence and several virulence-associated traits, including production of the exopolysaccharide amylovoran, levansucrase activity, and biofilm formation. We further show that Lrp is regulated posttranscriptionally by ArcZ through destabilization of lrp mRNA. Thus, ArcZ regulation of FlhDC directly and indirectly through Lrp forms an incoherent feed-forward loop that regulates levansucrase activity and motility as outputs. This work identifies Lrp as a novel participant in virulence regulation in E. amylovora and places it in the context of a virulence-associated regulatory network.","authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey K Schachterle"},{"name":"George W Sundin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FlhDC"},{"word":"Hfq"},{"word":"fire blight"}]},"article162":{"pmid":"31138629","title":"Single-Cell Microscopy Reveals That Levels of Cyclic di-GMP Vary among Bacillus subtilis Subpopulations.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The synthesis of signaling molecules is one strategy bacteria employ to sense alterations in their environment and rapidly adjust to those changes. In Gram-negative bacteria, bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) regulates the transition from a unicellular motile state to a multicellular sessile state. However, c-di-GMP signaling has been less intensively studied in Gram-positive organisms. To that end, we constructed a fluorescent yfp reporter based on a c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitch to visualize the relative abundance of c-di-GMP for single cells of the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis Coupled with cell-type-specific fluorescent reporters, this riboswitch reporter revealed that c-di-GMP levels are markedly different among B. subtilis cellular subpopulations. For example, cells that have made the decision to become matrix producers maintain higher intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations than motile cells. Similarly, we find that c-di-GMP levels differ between sporulating and competent cell types. These results suggest that biochemical measurements of c-di-GMP abundance are likely to be inaccurate for a bulk ensemble of B. subtilis cells, as such measurements will average c-di-GMP levels across the population. Moreover, the significant variation in c-di-GMP levels between cell types hints that c-di-GMP might play an important role during B. subtilis biofilm formation.

While a number of known signals that trigger biofilm formation do so through the activation of one or more sensory histidine kinases, it was discovered that biofilm activation is also coordinated by sensing intracellular metabolic signals, including serine starvation. Serine starvation causes ribosomes to pause on specific serine codons, leading to a decrease in the translation rate of sinR, which encodes a master repressor for biofilm matrix genes and ultimately triggers biofilm induction. How serine levels change in different growth stages, how B. subtilis regulates intracellular serine levels, and how serine starvation triggers ribosomes to pause on selective serine codons remain unknown. Here, we show that serine levels decrease as cells enter stationary phase and that unlike most other amino acid biosynthesis genes, expression of serine biosynthesis genes decreases upon the transition into stationary phase. The deletion of the gene for a serine deaminase responsible for converting serine to pyruvate led to a delay in biofilm formation, further supporting the idea that serine levels are a critical intracellular signal for biofilm activation. Finally, we show that levels of all five serine tRNA isoacceptors are decreased in stationary phase compared with exponential phase. However, the three isoacceptors recognizing UCN serine codons are reduced to a much greater extent than the two that recognize AGC and AGU serine codons.

This opportunistic bacterial pathogen secretes alginate, a polysaccharide that is one of the main components of its biofilm. Targeting this major biofilm component has emerged as a tempting therapeutic strategy for tackling biofilm-associated bacterial infections. The enormous potential in genetic diversity of the marine microbial community make it a valuable resource for mining activities responsible for a broad range of metabolic processes, including the alginolytic activity responsible for degrading alginate. A collection of 36 bacterial isolates were purified from marine water based on their alginolytic activity. These isolates were identified based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400 showed the highest alginolytic activity and was further confirmed to produce the enzyme alginate lyase. The purified alginate lyase (AlyP1400) produced by Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400 showed a band of 23 KDa on a protein electrophoresis gel and exhibited a bifunctional lyase activity for both poly-mannuronic acid and poly-glucuronic acid degradation. A tryptic digestion of this gel band analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry confirmed high similarity to the alginate lyases in polysaccharide lyase family 18. The purified alginate lyase showed a maximum relative activity at 30 °C at a slightly acidic condition. It decreased the sodium alginate viscosity by over 90% and reduced the P. aeruginosa (strain PA14) biofilms by 69% after 24 h of incubation.

We found that compositions of the bacterial biofilms were site specific, with the greatest differences between inshore and offshore sites. Further, biofilms were highly diverse in their taxonomic and functional compositions across inshore sites, while relatively low diversity was found at offshore sites. Hydroides elegans settled on all biofilms tested, with settlement strongly correlated with bacterial abundance. Bacterial density in biofilms was positively correlated with biofilm age. Our results suggest that the localized distribution of H. elegans is not determined by 'selection' to locations by specific bacteria, but it is more likely linked to the prevailing local ecology and oceanographic features that affect the development of dense biofilms and the occurrence of larvae.","authors":[{"name":"Kimberley A Lema"},{"name":"Florentin Constancias"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"},{"name":"Michael G Hadfield"}],"keywords":[]},"article180":{"pmid":"31135913","title":"Octyl gallate triggers dysfunctional mitochondria leading to ROS driven membrane damage and metabolic inflexibility along with attenuated virulence in Candida albicans.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Recently the high incidence of worldwide Candida infections has substantially increased. The growing problem about toxicity of antifungal drugs and multidrug resistance aggravates the need for the development of new effective strategies. Natural compounds in this context represent promising alternatives having potential to be exploited for improving human health. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the antifungal effect of a naturally occurring phenolic, octyl gallate (OG), on Candida albicans and to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved. We demonstrated that OG at 25 μg/ml could effectively inhibit C. albicans. Mechanistic insights revealed that OG affects mitochondrial functioning as Candida cells exposed to OG did not grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. Dysfunctional mitochondria triggered generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which led to membrane damage mediated by lipid peroxidation. We explored that OG inhibited glucose-induced reduction in external pH and causes decrement in ergosterol levels by 45%. Furthermore, OG impedes the metabolic flexibility of C. albicans by inhibiting the glyoxylate enzyme isocitrate lyase, which was also confirmed by docking analysis. Additionally, OG affected virulence traits such as morphological transition and cell adherence. Furthermore, we depicted that OG not only prevented biofilm formation but eliminates the preformed biofilms. In vivo studies with Caenorhabditis elegans nematode model confirmed that OG could enhance the survival of C. elegans after infection with Candida. Toxicity assay using red blood cells showed only 27.5% haemolytic activity. Taken together, OG is a potent inhibitor of C. albicans that warrants further structural optimization and pharmacological investigations.","authors":[{"name":"Venkata Saibabu"},{"name":"Zeeshan Fatima"},{"name":"Kamal Ahmad"},{"name":"Luqman Ahmad Khan"},{"name":"Saif Hameed"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Candida        "},{"word":"ROS"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"glyoxylate cycle"},{"word":"membrane"},{"word":"mitochondria"},{"word":"morphogenesis"}]},"article181":{"pmid":"31135555","title":"Is Implant Coating With Tyrosol- and Antibiotic-loaded Hydrogel Effective in Reducing Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes Biofilm Formation?

These two nanostructures exhibited different antibacterial properties from BBR. NPs showed significantly enhanced bacteriostatic activity, whereas NFs displayed a much weaker effect than BBR. The distinguishing properties can be attributed to the different spatial configurations and self-assembly processes of NPs and NFs. Flavonoid glycosides and BBR first formed a one-dimensional complex unit and subsequently self-assembled into three-dimensional nanostructures. With the hydrophilic glucuronic acid toward the outside, NPs exhibited stronger affinity to bacteria, thereby inducing the collapse of the bacteria population and the decrease in biofilm. In addition, in vitro hemolysis tests, cytotoxicity tests, and in vivo zebrafish toxicity evaluation showed that the obtained self-assemblies had good biocompatibility.

In humans, it is associated with localized infections, such as onychomycosis and keratomycosis, as well as invasive infections in immunocompromised patients. One pathogenicity factor of filamentous fungi is biofilm formation. There is still only scarce information about the in vitro mechanism of the formation and composition of F. solani biofilm. In this work, we describe the biofilm formed by a clinical keratomycosis isolate in terms of its development, composition and susceptibility to different antifungals and ultraviolet light (UV) at different biofilm formation stages. We found five biofilm formation stages using scanning electron microscopy: adherence, germination, hyphal development, maturation, and cell detachment. Using epifluorescence microscopy with specific fluorochromes, it was elucidated that the extracellular matrix consists of carbohydrates, proteins, and extracellular DNA. Specific inhibitors for these molecules showed significant biofilm reductions. The antifungal susceptibility against natamycin, voriconazole, caspofungin, and amphotericin B was evaluated by metabolic activity and crystal violet assay, with the F. solani biofilm preformation to 24 h increased in resistance to natamycin, voriconazole, and caspofungin, while the biofilm preformation to 48 h increased in resistance to amphotericin B. The preformed biofilm at 24 h protected and reduced UV light mortality. F. solani isolate could produce a highly structured extra biofilm; its cellular matrix consists of carbohydrate polymers, proteins, and eDNA. Biofilm confers antifungal resistance and decreases its susceptibility to UV light. The fungal biofilm functions as a survival strategy against antifungals and environmental factors.","authors":[{"name":"Itzel Margarita Córdova-Alcántara"},{"name":"Diana Laura Venegas-Cortés"},{"name":"María Ángeles Martínez-Rivera"},{"name":"Néstor Octavio Pérez"},{"name":"Aida Verónica Rodriguez-Tovar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Fusarium solani"},{"word":"antifungal susceptibility"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"epifluorescence microscopy"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"scanning electron microscopy"},{"word":"ultraviolet light"}]},"article184":{"pmid":"31134386","title":"Efficient inhibition of Cronobacter biofilms by chitooligosaccharides of specific molecular weight.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biofilms enable Cronobacter spp. to contaminate food, infect infants and resist different environmental stresses, especially desiccation, which is the main reason why Cronobacter can survive in powdered infant formula (PIF) for a long time.

Three most active flavonoids, namely, fisetin, phloretin, and curcumin, dose-dependently inhibited biofilm formation by a reference A. baumannii strain and by several clinical isolates, including four multidrug-resistant isolates. Furthermore, the antibiofilm activity of curcumin (the most active flavonoid) was greater than that of the well-known biofilm inhibitor gallium nitrate. Curcumin inhibited pellicle formation and the surface motility of A. baumannii. Interestingly, curcumin also showed antibiofilm activity against Candida albicans and mixed cultures of C. albicans and A. baumannii. In silico molecular docking of the biofilm response regulator BfmR showed that the binding efficacy of flavonoids with BfmR was correlated with antibiofilm efficacy.

In this work, we therefore, employed both culture-based and bioinformatics approaches to understand the diversity of bacterial DNases in marine bacterioplankton. We found that 34% of 345 strains of attached and non-attached marine bacteria showed extracellular DNase activity. Most of these isolates belong to Proteobacteria (53%) and Firmicutes (34%).

Then, to further understand the wider diversity of the potential to produce DNases, sequences were compared using 2316 whole genome and 42 metagenome datasets. Thirty-nine different taxonomic groups corresponding to 10 bacterial phyla were found to encode genes responsible for DNase secretion.

This work focused on how a crenarchaeal isolate Acidianus sp. DSM 29099 interacts with elemental sulfur. Analysis by Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in combination with Epifluorescence microscopy (EFM) shows that biofilms on elemental sulfur are characterized by single colonies and a monolayer in first stage and later on 3-D structures with a diameter of up to 100 μm.

In the current study, NADH dehydrogenase II protein (NDH-2) was heterologously expressed from B. subtilis into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for enhancing electron flux through EET pathway and to understand its role in bioelectrogenesis. We found that E. coli expressing NDH-2 has increased the electron flux through EET and has shown a ninefold increase in current (4.7 μA) production when compared to wild strain with empty vector (0.52 μA). Furthermore, expression of NDH-2 also resulted in increased biofilm formation which can be corroborated with the decrease in charge transfer resistance of NDH-2 strain and increased NADH oxidation. It was also found that NDH-2 strain can reduce ferric citrate at a higher rate than wild type strain suggesting increased electron flux through electron transport chain due to NADH dehydrogenase II activity. Purified NDH-2 was found to be ∼42 kDa and has FAD as a cofactor.

Among the extracts, pimenta-malagueta methanolic extract (PMME) was chosen because it contained capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, and luteolin in greater amount than the other extracts. In general, PMME partially inhibited bacterial growth at 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL, as well as capsaicin at 100 µg/mL and luteolin at 62.5, 125, and 250 µg/mL. At lower concentrations, PMME and luteolin reduced violacein production in C. violaceum ATCC 12472 without affecting growth, a result that was not observed with capsaicin. We show that violacein inhibition by PMME is likely due to luteolin. In silico docking evaluation showed that luteolin binds to the CviR QS regulator.

QS regulates phenotypes that influence microbial activities across many areas, including Food Science.

Micro-analysis of gold particles obtained from Western Australia revealed porous textures and aggregates of pure gold nanoparticles, attributable to gold dissolution and re-precipitation, respectively. By interpreting structure and chemistry of particles, the kinetics of gold biogeochemical cycling at the site was estimated to be 1.60 × 10-9 M year-1. Bacterial communities residing on particles were composed of Proteobacteria (42.5%), Bacteroidetes (20.1%), Acidobacteria (19.1%), Firmicutes (8.2%), Actinobacteria (3.7%) and Verrucomicrobia (3.6%). A bacterial enrichment culture obtained from particles contained a similar composition. Exposure of enrichments to increasing concentrations of soluble gold decreased community diversity and selected for metal-resistant bacteria. Lower gold concentrations, which corresponded well with the concentration from the kinetic rate, provided a selective pressure for the selection of metal-resistant organisms while retaining the overall diversity. In conclusion, biogeochemical gold cycling directly influences bacterial communities on gold particles, thereby contributing to a continuum of particle transformation.","authors":[{"name":"Santonu Kumar Sanyal"},{"name":"Jeremiah Shuster"},{"name":"Frank Reith"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"bio-mineralisation"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"geomicrobiology"},{"word":"gold"},{"word":"placer"}]},"article201":{"pmid":"31131594","title":"Fosfomycin in antimicrobial stewardship programs.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Due to the increase in antimicrobial resistance, strategies such as antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) have been developed to improve the clinical results, decrease the adverse effects and the development of resistances and ensure cost-effective therapies. Fosfomycin has a unique mechanism of action against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cross-resistance is uncommon; however, fosfomycin should be used in combination in severe infections to avoid selecting resistant mutations. Fosfomycin's oral formulation facilitates sequential treatment, has low toxicity and high tissue penetration, even in the central nervous system and bone. Fosfomycin is active against resistant Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin- resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as against resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenemase-producing enterobacteria. Fosfomycin is therefore useful for cases of persistent bacteremia, skin and soft tissue infections, as a glycopeptide-sparing and carbapenem-sparing drug for healthcare-associated infections and for polymicrobial infections. Published studies have demonstrated the synergy between fosfomycin and beta-lactams, daptomycin and glycopeptides against MSSA and MRSA; with linezolid in biofilm-associated infections and with aminoglycosides and colistin against Gram-negative bacteria, providing a nephroprotective effect.","authors":[{"name":"E Múñez Rubio"},{"name":"A Ramos Martínez"},{"name":"A Fernández Cruz"}],"keywords":[]},"article202":{"pmid":"31131587","title":"New microbiological aspects of fosfomycin.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The discovery of fosfomycin more than 40 years ago was an important milestone in antibiotic therapy.

The agencies' objectives are to establish common usage criteria for Europe and authorize the sale of fosfomycin in the US, respectively. Fosfomycin's single mechanism of action results in no cross-resistance with other antibiotics. However, various fosfomycin-resistance mechanisms have been described, the most important of which, from the epidemiological standpoint, is enzymatic inactivation, which is essentially associated with a gene carrying a fosA3-harboring plasmid. Fosfomycin has been found more frequently in Asia in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales. Although fosfomycin presents lower intrinsic activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared with that presented against Escherichia coli, fosfomycin's activity has been demonstrated in biofilms, especially in combination with aminoglycosides.

P. aeruginosa causes chronic infections in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive lung disease, as well as chronic urinary tract infections in patients with permanent bladder catheter, and ventilator-associated pneumonia in intubated patients, and is also an important pathogen in chronic wounds. Antibiotic treatment cannot eradicate these biofilm infections due to their intrinsic antibiotic tolerance and the development of mutational antibiotic resistance. The tolerance of biofilms to antibiotics is multifactorial involving physical, physiological, and genetic determinants, whereas the antibiotic resistance of bacteria in biofilms is caused by mutations and driven by the repeated exposure of the bacteria to high levels of antibiotics. In this review, both the antimicrobial tolerance and the development of resistance to antibiotics in P. aeruginosa biofilms are discussed.

The biofilm biomass of P. aeruginosa was considerably reduced by 1.56-50 mg/L AgNP. However, 4NPO enhanced the ability of AgNP to inhibit P. aeruginosa biofilm formation (P < 0.05). The combination of AgNP with 4NPO could continuously inhibit biofilm development after 12 h, and 50 mg/L AgNP combined with 6.25 mg/L 4NPO thoroughly suppressed biofilm growth. The expression levels of QS genes and exopolysaccharide genes of biofilm treated with the combination of AgNP with 4NPO (AgNP-4NPO combination) were lower than those treated with AgNP alone (P < 0.05). Additional extracellular proteins and polysaccharides were determined in the samples treated with AgNP-4NPO combination. Based on proteomic analysis, this result was attributed to cell rupture caused by antimicrobial agents and intracellular materials released. The combination of the two antimicrobial agents could weaken the swimming ability of bacterial cells by damaging bacterial flagella and blocking rhlA gene expression.

Often located on rooftops, their semi-open water basins provide a suitable environment for microbial growth. They are recognized as a potential source of bacterial pathogens and have been associated with disease outbreaks such as Legionnaires' disease. While measures to minimize public health risks are in place, the general microbial and protist community structure and dynamics in these systems remain largely elusive. In this study, we analysed the microbiome of the bulk water from the basins of three cooling towers by 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing over the course of one year. Bacterial diversity in all three towers was broadly comparable to other freshwater systems, yet less diverse than natural environments; the most abundant taxa are also frequently found in freshwater or drinking water. While each cooling tower had a pronounced site-specific microbial community, taxa shared among all locations mainly included groups generally associated with biofilm formation. We also detected several groups related to known opportunistic pathogens, such as Legionella, Mycobacterium, and Pseudomonas species, albeit at generally low abundance. Although cooling towers represent a rather stable environment, microbial community composition was highly dynamic and subject to seasonal change. Protists are important members of the cooling tower water microbiome and known reservoirs for bacterial pathogens. Co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and protist taxa successfully captured known interactions between amoeba-associated bacteria and their hosts, and predicted a large number of additional relationships involving ciliates and other protists. Together, this study provides an unbiased and comprehensive overview of microbial diversity of cooling tower water basins, establishing a framework for investigating and assessing public health risks associated with these man-made freshwater environments.","authors":[{"name":"Han-Fei Tsao"},{"name":"Ute Scheikl"},{"name":"Craig Herbold"},{"name":"Alexander Indra"},{"name":"Julia Walochnik"},{"name":"Matthias Horn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Built environment"},{"word":"Chlamydia"},{"word":"Free-living amoeba"},{"word":"HVAC cooling tower"},{"word":"Legionella"},{"word":"Microbial diversity"},{"word":"Mycobacteria"},{"word":"Protists"}]},"article223":{"pmid":"31128369","title":"Simultaneous oxidation of ammonium and tetracycline in a membrane aerated biofilm reactor.","date":"2019-08-08","abs":"The membrane aerated biofilms reactor (MABR) is an emerging technology in wastewater treatment with particular advantages including high rate nitrification, and very high oxygen transfer efficiencies.

Several methods of surface modification are chronologically described bridging ordinary methods (e.g. grit blasting and etching) and advanced physicochemical approaches such as 3D-laser texturing and biomimetic modification. Functionalization procedures by using proteins, peptides, and bioactive ceramics have provided an enhancement in wettability and bioactivity of implant surfaces. Furthermore, recent findings have revealed a combined beneficial effect of micro- and nano-scale modification and biomimetic functionalization of titanium surfaces. However, some technological developments of implant surfaces are not commercially available yet due to costs and a lack of clinical validation for such recent surfaces. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to endorse the use of enhanced biomimetic implant surfaces. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Grit-blasting followed by acid-etching is currently used for titanium implant modifications, although recent technological biomimetic physicochemical methods have revealed enhanced osteoconductive and anti-microbial outcomes. An improvement in wettability and bioactivity of titanium implant surfaces has been accomplished by combining micro and nano-scale modification and functionalization with protein, peptides, and bioactive compounds. Such morphological and chemical modification of the titanium surfaces induce the migration and differentiation of osteogenic cells followed by an enhancement of the mineral matrix formation that accelerate the osseointegration process. Additionally, the incorporation of bioactive molecules into the nanostructured surfaces is a promising strategy to avoid early and late implant failures induced by the biofilm accumulation.","authors":[{"name":"Julio C M Souza"},{"name":"Mariane B Sordi"},{"name":"Miya Kanazawa"},{"name":"Sriram Ravindran"},{"name":"Bruno Henriques"},{"name":"Filipe S Silva"},{"name":"Conrado Aparicio"},{"name":"Lyndon F Cooper"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Functionalization"},{"word":"Implant"},{"word":"Implant-bone interface"},{"word":"Osseointegration"},{"word":"Titanium surface"}]},"article226":{"pmid":"31127836","title":"Farnesol increases the activity of echinocandins against Candida auris biofilms.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Candida auris biofilms exhibit decreased susceptibility to echinocandins, which is associated with poorer clinical outcomes.

Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis shows that DHA is degraded nonenzymatically into substrates known to be unfavorable to high growth rates. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that DHA promotes genes involved in biofilm formation, which may reduce the bacterial growth rate. Functional analysis of the genes involved in DHA metabolism proves that under the aerobic conditions used in this study, DHA is mainly assimilated via the dihydroxyacetone kinase pathway. In addition, these results show that the alternative routes of DHA assimilation (i.e., the glycerol and fructose-6-phosphate aldolase pathways) are not fully activated under our conditions because of anaerobically mediated hierarchical control. These pathways are therefore certainly unable to sustain fluxes as high as the ones predicted in silico for optimal aerobic growth on DHA.

Research for almost three decades has provided novel insights into environmental processes and biogeochemical reactions not previously known to be carried out by microorganisms. At the heart of the environmental roles played by Geobacter bacteria is their ability to integrate redox pathways and regulatory checkpoints that maximize growth efficiency with electron donors derived from the decomposition of organic matter while respiring metal oxides, particularly the often abundant oxides of ferric iron. This metabolic specialization is complemented by versatile metabolic reactions, respiratory chains, and sensory networks that allow specific members to adaptively respond to environmental cues to integrate organic and inorganic contaminants in their oxidative and reductive metabolism, respectively. Thus, Geobacteraceae are important members of the microbial communities that degrade hydrocarbon contaminants under iron-reducing conditions and that contribute, directly or indirectly, to the reduction of radionuclides, toxic metals, and oxidized species of nitrogen. Their ability to produce conductive pili as nanowires for discharging respiratory electrons to solid-phase electron acceptors and radionuclides, or for wiring cells in current-harvesting biofilms highlights the unique physiological traits that make these organisms attractive biological platforms for bioremediation, bioenergy, and bioelectronics application.

Although the concept of PUMPT is well established, the relationship between protein unmasking and reinstatement of bioactivity is unclear. Here, we used dextrin-colistin conjugates to study the relationship between the molecular structure (degree of unmasking) and biological activity. Size exclusion chromatography was employed to collect fractions of differentially degraded conjugates and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) employed to characterize the corresponding structures. Antimicrobial activity was studied using a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy of LIVE/DEAD-stained biofilms with COMSTAT analysis. In vitro toxicity of the degraded conjugate was assessed using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. UPLC-MS revealed that the fully unmasked dextrin-colistin conjugate composed of colistin bound to at least one linker, whereas larger species were composed of colistin with varying lengths of glucose units attached. Increasing the degree of dextrin modification by succinoylation typically led to a greater number of linkers bound to colistin. Greater antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity were observed for the fully unmasked conjugate compared to the partially degraded species (MIC = 0.25 and 2-8 μg/mL, respectively), whereas dextrin conjugation reduced colistin's in vitro toxicity toward kidney cells, even after complete unmasking.

The cells grow as a thick biofilm over the solid substrate, make scale-like structures that increase the area of the initially smooth surface of paraffin, produce biosurfactants, and become more negatively charged than ethanol- or glucose-grown cells. When paraffin wax is supplied as microparticles, to increase the cell-substrate contact area and to simulate paraffin precipitation, the cells also adjust the composition of the fatty acids of the phospholipids of the cellular membrane to decrease its fluidity and paraffin biodegradation increases considerably. The study suggests that the phenotypic adaptation of R. erythropolis cells may be used to degrade paraffin wax under real conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Carlos J C Rodrigues"},{"name":"Carla C C R de Carvalho"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biodegradation"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"microparticles"},{"word":"paraffins"},{"word":"solid substrates"},{"word":"whole cells"}]},"article243":{"pmid":"31125073","title":"Autotrophic microbial community succession from glacier terminus to downstream waters on the Tibetan Plateau.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Glaciers harbour diverse microbes and autotrophic microbes play a key role in sustaining the glacial ecosystems by providing organic carbon.

It is therefore important to identify the pathogenic potential and/or ExPEC status of E. coli strains inhabiting the aquatic environments associated with anthropogenic activities. Besides virulence-associated genes, biofilm production also helps in the survival of E. coli in environmental waterbodies. Thus, the aim of the current study was to assess the virulence potential, ExPEC status, and biofilm-producing capability of E. coli isolated from the River Yamuna, a major river traversing the National Capital Region of Delhi, India. We also tried to discern a co-relation, if any, between virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance in these strains. Our results indicated that virulence-associated genes were scarce and none of the strain qualified the molecular criteria essential for ExPEC. This suggested that E. coli strains which can presumably cause human extra-intestinal infections were not prominent in the River Yamuna. However, the fact that more than 80% of the aquatic E. coli isolates were moderate and strong biofilm producers suggests that E. coli in these environments might serve as opportunistic pathogens. Also, no unequivocal association was observed between biofilm production, virulence, and β-lactamase genes in E. coli strains.

Despite extensive research, infection remains one of the leading sources of complications in chronic wounds, resulting in improper healing, biofilm formation, and lower extremity amputation. To address the limitations of standard treatments, we have developed a hydrogel wound dressing with self-tuning moisture control that incorporates a novel antimicrobial agent to eliminate and prevent infection. 3D-printing of a hydrogel dressing with dual porosity resulted in a new dressing with greater flexibility, increased water uptake, and more rapid swelling than bulk hydrogel dressings. Additionally, gallium maltolate (GaM) was incorporated into the dressing to investigate the efficacy of this antimicrobial agent. Loading profiles, release kinetics, and the bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) of GaM were investigated in vitro to identify target profiles that supported infection control. Finally, GaM-loaded hydrogel dressings were evaluated in vivo, utilizing a murine splinted-wound model that was inoculated with S. aureus. In comparison to an untreated control, GaM dressings markedly reduced the wound bacterial load without compromising wound closure rates. Overall, this work demonstrates the utility of a 3D-printed hydrogel dressing as an antimicrobial dressing to control infection in chronic wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Stacy Cereceres"},{"name":"Ziyang Lan"},{"name":"Laura Bryan"},{"name":"Michael Whitely"},{"name":"Thomas Wilems"},{"name":"Hunter Greer"},{"name":"Ellen Ruth Alexander"},{"name":"Robert J Taylor"},{"name":"Lawrence Bernstein"},{"name":"Noah Cohen"},{"name":"Canaan Whitfield-Cargile"},{"name":"Elizabeth Cosgriff-Hernandez"}],"keywords":[]},"article247":{"pmid":"31123307","title":"Differential effects of alkyl gallates on quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Virulence factors and biofilms constitute attractive targets for the prevention of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

Ethyl gallate (EG), PG, and butyl gallate (BG) inhibited biofilm formation and virulence factors including elastase, pyocyanin, and rhamnolipid, in P. aeruginosa without affecting cell viability by antagonizing the QS receptors LasR and RhlR.

Notably, OG inhibited the production of rhamnolipid and pyocyanin but stimulated elastase production and biofilm formation. Analysis of QS signaling molecule production and QS gene expression suggested that HG inhibited RhlR, while OG activated LasR but inhibited PqsR. This mechanism was confirmed using QS mutants. Additionally, PG prevented the virulence of P. aeruginosa in Caenorhabditis elegans and a mouse model.

Specifically, AC-PB is fabricated as a multifunctional therapeutic agent via a co-precipitation approach, where PB acts as an effective photothermal agent and AC could prevent the formation of bacteria cluster in biofilms and the bacterial adhesion on tissues to reduce the secretion of mucus and improve the efficacy. AC-PB shows strong synergistic photothermal sterilization ability in a concentration-dependent manner by using 980 nm NIR laser. 50 μg/mL of AC-PB can eliminate up to 74% of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and up to 75% of Gram-negative Escherichia coli, while irradiation of 980 nm is minimally cytotoxic to mammalian cells. The NIR radiation can be efficiently converted into local heat by subcutaneous injection of AC-PB to kill bacteria effectively in vivo to treat a focal infection. The antibacterial mechanism suggests that AC can destroy bacteria-based biofilms, while the photothermal effect driven by NIR may break the lipids on cellular membrane.

Flagellin, the primary structural protein making up the flagellum, is an abundant and potent activator of innate and adaptive immunity and therefore expression of flagellin during infection could be deleterious to the infection process due to flagellin-mediated host recognition. Here, we use quantitative RT-PCR to demonstrate that expression of the flagellin locus fliC is repressed during the course of infection and subsequently up-regulated upon host mortality in a motile strain of Yersinia ruckeri. The kinetics of fliC repression during the infection process is relatively slow as full repression occurs 7-days after the initiation of infection and after approximately 3-logs of bacterial growth in vivo. These results suggests that Y. ruckeri possesses a regulatory system capable of sensing host and modulating the expression of motility in response. Examination of the master flagellar operon (flhDC) promoter region for evidence of transcriptional regulation and regulatory binding sites revealed potential interaction with the Rcs pathway through an Rcs(A)B Box. Deletion of rcsB (ΔrcsB) by marker-exchange mutagenesis resulted in overproduction of flagellin and unregulated motility, showing that the Rcs pathway negatively regulates biosynthesis of the flagellar apparatus. Experimental challenge with ΔrcsB and ΔrcsBΔfliC1ΔfliC2 mutants revealed that mutation of the Rcs pathway results in virulence attenuation which is dependent on presence of the flagellin gene. These results suggest that the inappropriate expression of flagellin during infection triggers host recognition and thus immune stimulation resulting in attenuation of virulence. In addition, RNAseq analyses of the ΔrcsB mutant strain verified the role of this gene as a negative regulator of the flagellar motility system and identified several additional genes regulated by the Rcs pathway.","authors":[{"name":"Anna K S Jozwick"},{"name":"Scott E LaPatra"},{"name":"Joerg Graf"},{"name":"Timothy J Welch"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aquaculture"},{"word":"Flagella regulation"},{"word":"Oncorhynchus mykiss (walbaum)"},{"word":"Rainbow trout"},{"word":"Rcs pathway"},{"word":"Virulence"},{"word":"Yersinia ruckeri"}]},"article255":{"pmid":"31121252","title":"Nectandra as a renewable source for (+)-α-bisabolol, an antibiofilm and anti-Trichomonas vaginalis compound.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Essential oils, mixtures of volatile compounds, are targets of research for new antimicrobial drugs.

In this study, a biotrickling filter, with its packing materials being modified by 3% sodium alginate and 5% polyvinyl alcohol (v/v = 1:3), was employed to treat intermittent VOCs. Results showed that the removal efficiencies of toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, m-xylene, and o-xylene was significantly enhanced in the BTF compared to the control one. Under relatively lower inlet loading, nearly complete removal of the five pollutants was achieved. A quantitative analysis showed that the concentration of total organic compound (TOC) in the leachate maintained at a high level, and had a strongly positive correlation with the divergence of microbial communities. The capacity of biofilm formation in the BTF was approximately four-fold higher than the control BTF, while the quantity of EPS secreted was more than ten-fold. EPS comprised largely of protein, and to less extent, polysaccharide.

One cause of this variation is circuit diversification, the alteration of gene regulatory relationships among members of a species. Circuit diversification is thought to be a starting point for the circuit divergence or rewiring that occurs during speciation. How widespread is circuit diversification? Here we address this question with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, which forms biofilms rich in distinctive hyphal cells as a prelude to infection. Our understanding of the biofilm/hyphal regulatory network comes primarily from studies of one clinical isolate, strain SC5314, and its marked derivatives. We used CRISPR-based methods to create mutations of four key biofilm transcription factor genes-BCR1, UME6, BRG1, and EFG1 -in SC5314 and four additional clinical isolates. Phenotypic analysis revealed that mutations in BCR1 or UME6 have variable impact across strains, while mutations in BRG1 or EFG1 had uniformly severe impact. Gene expression, sampled with Nanostring probes and examined comprehensively for EFG1 via RNA-Seq, indicates that regulatory relationships are highly variable among isolates. Our results suggest that genotype-phenotype relationships vary in this strain panel in part because of differences in control of BRG1 by BCR1, a hypothesis that is supported through engineered constitutive expression of BRG1. Overall, the data show that circuit diversification is the rule, not the exception, in this biofilm/hyphal regulatory network.","authors":[{"name":"Manning Y Huang"},{"name":"Carol A Woolford"},{"name":"Gemma May"},{"name":"C Joel McManus"},{"name":"Aaron P Mitchell"}],"keywords":[]},"article283":{"pmid":"31116540","title":"Characterization of a Cathelicidin from the Colubrinae Snake, Sinonatrix annularis.","date":"2019-08-20","abs":"The cathelicidins represent an important family of host defense peptides (HDPs) found exclusively in vertebrates, which serve as a critical effector in host immune response against microbial infections.

Sixteen cathelicidins have been identified from snakes in the Elapidae, Viperidae, and Biodae families. However, no cathelicidin has been discovered from a snake of the Colubrinae family. In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of a novel cathelicidin, SA-CATH, from the Colubrinae family snake, Sinonatrix annularis. The cDNA sequence encoding SA-CATH precursor is 735 bp in length, and the mature peptide (SA-CATH) is composed of 30 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment result indicated that SA-CATH precursor possesses relatively high sequence similarity with the cathelicidins from Elapidae and Viperidae family snakes. Similar as the cathelicidins from Elapidae, Viperidae, and Biodae family snakes, SA-CATH mainly assumes an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation, and possesses potent antimicrobial, biofilm inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities. The results in the present study imply that cathelicidins serve as a kind of conserved effectors with similar structures in the immune systems of Colubrinae, Boidae, Elapidae and Viperidae family snakes.

Alcian blue/Periodic acid Schiff's stain was used to differentiate between acid and neutral mucin-secreting cells while the Aldehyde fuchsin/Alcian blue stain further differentiated between two acid mucins, namely sialo-, and sulphomucins. The number of cells was quantified and statistically analysed. All species had a simple GIT morphology represented by a simple, completely glandular stomach and the absence of a cecum. The exception was R. hardwickii, where a small cecum was observed which had histological mucosal features of both the small and large intestine. In R.hardwickii, distal to the cecum, typical colonic mucosal features such as the absence of villi and an abundance of goblet cells were observed. In all four species, the total number of goblet cells increased from the proximal to the distal intestinal regions. Mixed (acid and neutral) mucins dominated the entire GIT of all species. Neutral mucin-secreting cells were observed in the gastric pylorus and proximal intestinal regions in all species. Brunner's glands stained positive for neutral mucins.

We analyzed 360 samples of carps, phytoplankton and water collected in 2017 during dry and rainy seasons in the Tanzanian basin of Lake Victoria. Samples were tested using PCR (ompW and ctxA) with DNA extracted from bacterial isolates and samples enriched in alkaline peptone water. Isolates were screened with polyvalent antiserum O1 followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools were employed to investigate the genomic characteristics of the isolates. More V. cholerae positive samples were recovered by PCR when DNA was obtained from enriched samples than from isolates (69.0% vs. 21.3%, p < 0.05), irrespectively of season. We identified ten V. cholerae O1 among 22 ctxA-positive isolates. Further studies are needed to serotype the remaining ctxA-positive non-O1 strains. Sequenced strains belonged to El Tor atypical biotype of V. cholerae O1 of MLST ST69 harboring the seventh pandemic gene. Major virulence genes, ctxA, ctxB, zot, ace, tcpA, hlyA, rtxA, ompU, toxR, T6SS, alsD, makA and pathogenicity islands VPI-1, VPI-2, VSP-1, and VSP-2 were found in all strains. The strains contained Vibrio polysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes, the mshA gene and two-component response regulator proteins involved in stress response and autoinducers for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. They carried the SXT integrative conjugative element with phenotypic and genotypic resistance to aminoglycoside, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, phenicol, and quinolones. Strains contained a multidrug efflux pump component and were resistant to toxic compounds with copper homeostasis and cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance proteins. The environmental strains belonged to the third wave of the seventh pandemic and most are genetically closely related to recent outbreak strains from Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda with as low as three SNPs difference. Some strains have persisted longer in the environment and were more related to older outbreak strains in the region. V. cholerae O1 of outbreak potential seem to persist in Lake Victoria through interactions with fish and phytoplankton supported by the optimum water parameters and intrinsic genetic features enhancing survival in the aquatic environment.","authors":[{"name":"Yaovi M Gildas Hounmanou"},{"name":"Pimlapas Leekitcharoenphon"},{"name":"Rene S Hendriksen"},{"name":"Tamegnon V Dougnon"},{"name":"Robinson H Mdegela"},{"name":"John E Olsen"},{"name":"Anders Dalsgaard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"African Great Lakes"},{"word":"Vibrio cholerae"},{"word":"aquatic reservoirs"},{"word":"genomics"},{"word":"microbial ecology"}]},"article296":{"pmid":"31114257","title":"Characterization and analysis of a novel diguanylate cyclase PA0847 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhang"},{"name":"Jiayi Guo"},{"name":"Ning Zhang"},{"name":"Wensu Yuan"},{"name":"Zhi Lin"},{"name":"Weidong Huang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"GGDEF domain"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"diguanylate cyclase"},{"word":"structure"}]},"article297":{"pmid":"31114199","title":"Long-lasting bactericidal activity through selective physical puncture and controlled ions release of polydopamine and silver nanoparticles-loaded TiO","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Ming Guan"},{"name":"Yangmengfan Chen"},{"name":"Yong Wei"},{"name":"Hao Song"},{"name":"Chenghao Gao"},{"name":"Hao Cheng"},{"name":"Yong Li"},{"name":"Kaifu Huo"},{"name":"Jijiang Fu"},{"name":"Wei Xiong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"TiO2 nanorods"},{"word":"bacterial infection"},{"word":"bactericidal activity"},{"word":"physical puncture"},{"word":"polydopamine"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"}]},"article298":{"pmid":"31113978","title":"Transcriptional profiling of coaggregation interactions between Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula by Dual RNA-Seq.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Many oral bacteria form macroscopic clumps known as coaggregates when mixed with a different species.

Here, we assessed the impact of coaggregation between two key initial colonizers of dental plaque, Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula, on gene expression in each partner. These species were shown to coaggregate in buffer or human saliva. To monitor gene regulation, coaggregates were formed in human saliva and, after 30 minutes, whole-transcriptomes were extracted for sequencing and Dual RNA-Seq analysis. In total, 272 genes were regulated in V. parvula, including 39 genes in oxidoreductase processes. In S. gordonii, there was a high degree of inter-sample variation. Nevertheless, 69 genes were identified as potentially regulated by coaggregation, including two phosphotransferase system transporters and several other genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Overall, these data indicate that responses of V. parvula to coaggregation with S. gordonii are dominated by oxidative stress-related processes, whereas S. gordonii responses are more focussed on carbohydrate metabolism.

Although the core genetic circuitry that controls biofilm formation in model bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis has been well characterized, little is known about the role that metabolism plays in this complex developmental process. Here, we performed a time-resolved analysis of the metabolic changes associated with pellicle biofilm formation and development in B. subtilis by combining metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. We report surprisingly widespread and dynamic remodeling of metabolism affecting central carbon metabolism, primary biosynthetic pathways, fermentation pathways, and secondary metabolism. Most of these metabolic alterations were hitherto unrecognized as biofilm associated. For example, we observed increased activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle during early biofilm growth, a shift from fatty acid biosynthesis to fatty acid degradation, reorganization of iron metabolism and transport, and a switch from acetate to acetoin fermentation. Close agreement between metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic measurements indicated that remodeling of metabolism during biofilm development was largely controlled at the transcriptional level. Our results also provide insights into the transcription factors and regulatory networks involved in this complex metabolic remodeling. Following upon these results, we demonstrated that acetoin production via acetolactate synthase is essential for robust biofilm growth and has the dual role of conserving redox balance and maintaining extracellular pH. This report represents a comprehensive systems-level investigation of the metabolic remodeling occurring during B. subtilis biofilm development that will serve as a useful road map for future studies on biofilm physiology.","authors":[{"name":"Tippapha Pisithkul"},{"name":"Jeremy W Schroeder"},{"name":"Edna A Trujillo"},{"name":"Ponlkrit Yeesin"},{"name":"David M Stevenson"},{"name":"Tai Chaiamarit"},{"name":"Joshua J Coon"},{"name":"Jue D Wang"},{"name":"Daniel Amador-Noguez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"acetoin"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"metabolism"},{"word":"metabolomics"},{"word":"proteomics"},{"word":"transcriptomics"}]},"article300":{"pmid":"31113860","title":"Inorganic polyphosphate accumulation suppresses the dormancy response and virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","date":"2020-03-03","abs":"Stringent response pathways involving inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) play an essential role in bacterial stress adaptation and virulence. The intracellular levels of PolyP are modulated by the activities of polyphosphate kinase-1 (PPK1), polyphosphate kinase-2 (PPK2), and exopolyphosphatases (PPXs). The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes two functional PPXs, and simultaneous deletion of ppx1 and ppx2 results in a defect in biofilm formation. We demonstrate here that these PPXs cumulatively contribute to the ability of M. tuberculosis to survive in nutrient-limiting, low-oxygen growth conditions and also in macrophages. Characterization of single (Δppx2) and double knockout (dkppx) strains of M. tuberculosis indicated that PPX-mediated PolyP degradation is essential for establishing bacterial infection in guinea pigs. RNA-Seq-based transcriptional profiling revealed that relative to the parental strain, the expression levels of DosR regulon-regulated dormancy genes were significantly reduced in the dkppx mutant strain. In concordance, we also provide evidence that PolyP inhibits the autophosphorylation activities associated with DosT and DosS sensor kinases. The results in this study uncover that enzymes involved in PolyP homeostasis play a critical role in M. tuberculosis physiology and virulence and are attractive targets for developing more effective therapeutic interventions.","authors":[{"name":"Prabhakar Tiwari"},{"name":"Tannu Priya Gosain"},{"name":"Mamta Singh"},{"name":"Gaurav D Sankhe"},{"name":"Garima Arora"},{"name":"Saqib Kidwai"},{"name":"Sakshi Agarwal"},{"name":"Saurabh Chugh"},{"name":"Deepak K Saini"},{"name":"Ramandeep Singh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"word":"bacterial pathogenesis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"dormancy-associated genes"},{"word":"exopolyphosphatases"},{"word":"hypoxia"},{"word":"inorganic polyphosphate homeostasis"},{"word":"microbial pathogenesis"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"molecular biology"},{"word":"mycobacteria"},{"word":"stress adaptation"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"31113736","title":"Effect of amyloid curli fibrils and curli CsgA monomers from Escherichia coli on in vitro model of intestinal epithelial barrier stimulated with cytokines.","date":"2019-11-21","abs":"Amyloid curli fibrils produced by Escherichia coli are well-known virulence factor influencing E. coli adhesion and biofilm formation.

Until recently, complications from biofilm-associated infection have been primarily ascribed to increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics and host immune evasion, leading to persistent infection. In this theory and hypothesis article we present a relatively new argument that biofilm formation has potential etiological role in the development of digestive tract cancer. First, we summarize recent new findings suggesting the potential link between bacterial biofilm and various types of cancer to build the foundation of our hypothesis. To date, evidence has been particularly convincing for colorectal cancer and its precursor, i.e., polyps, pointing to several key individual bacterial species, such as Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. Gallolyticus. Then, we further extend this hypothesis to one of the most common bacterial infection in humans, Helicobacter pylori (Hp), which is considered a major cause of gastric cancer. Thus far, there has been no direct evidence linking in vivo Hp gastric biofilm formation to gastric carcinogenesis. Yet, we synthesize the information to support an argument that biofilm associated-Hp is potentially more carcinogenic, summarizing biological characteristics of biofilm-associated bacteria. We also discuss mechanistic pathways as to how Hp or other biofilm-associated bacteria control biofilm formation and highlight recent findings on Hp genes that influence biofilm formation, which may lead to strain variability in biofilm formation. This knowledge may open a possibility of developing targeted intervention. We conclude, however, that this field is still in its infancy. To test the hypothesis rigorously and to link it ultimately to gastric pathologies (e.g., premalignant lesions and cancer), studies are needed to learn more about Hp biofilms, such as compositions and biological properties of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), presence of non-Hp microbiome and geographical distribution of biofilms in relation to gastric gland types and structures. Identification of specific Hp strains with enhanced biofilm formation would be helpful not only for screening patients at high risk for sequelae from Hp infection, but also for development of new antibiotics to avoid resistance, regardless of its association with gastric cancer.","authors":[{"name":"Cosmeri Rizzato"},{"name":"Javier Torres"},{"name":"Elena Kasamatsu"},{"name":"Margarita Camorlinga-Ponce"},{"name":"Maria Mercedes Bravo"},{"name":"Federico Canzian"},{"name":"Ikuko Kato"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Helicobacter pylori"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cancer"},{"word":"persistent infection"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article310":{"pmid":"31110495","title":"Biogenic Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Using Phyllanthus emblica Fruit Extract and Its Inhibitory Action Against the Pathogen Acidovorax oryzae Strain RS-2 of Rice Bacterial Brown Stripe.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using plants has become a promising substitute to the conventional chemical synthesis method.

Low concentrations of ethanol reduced P. aeruginosa swim zone area by up to 45% in soft agar. The reduction of swimming by ethanol required the flagellar motor proteins MotAB and two PilZ domain proteins (FlgZ and PilZ). PilY1 and the type 4 pilus alignment complex (comprising PilMNOP) were previously implicated in MotAB regulation in surface-associated cells and were required for ethanol-dependent motility repression. As FlgZ requires the second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) to represses motility, we screened mutants lacking genes involved in c-di-GMP metabolism and found that mutants lacking diguanylate cyclases SadC and GcbA were less responsive to ethanol. The double mutant was resistant to its effects. As published previously, ethanol also represses swarming motility, and the same genes required for ethanol effects on swimming motility were required for its regulation of swarming. Microscopic analysis of single cells in soft agar revealed that ethanol effects on swim zone area correlated with ethanol effects on the portion of cells that paused or stopped during the time interval analyzed. Ethanol increased c-di-GMP in planktonic wild-type cells but not in ΔmotAB or ΔsadC ΔgcbA mutants, suggesting c-di-GMP plays a role in the response to ethanol in planktonic cells. We propose that ethanol produced by other microbes induces a regulated decrease in P. aeruginosa motility, thereby promoting P. aeruginosa colocalization with ethanol-producing microbes.

We show that CheA and CheB proteins act in an antagonistic manner, as follows: while the two CheA proteins negatively regulate hfiA expression, the CheB proteins are positive regulators, thus providing a modulation of holdfast synthesis and surface attachment.","authors":[{"name":"Cécile Berne"},{"name":"Yves V Brun"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Caulobacter crescentus"},{"word":"bacterial adhesion"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chemotaxis"},{"word":"holdfast"}]},"article315":{"pmid":"31109991","title":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Differential Gene Expression in Synthetic Cystic Fibrosis Sputum Reveals Shared and Cystic Fibrosis Strain-Specific Responses to the Sputum Environment.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that can infect the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The highly viscous mucus in the CF lung, expectorated as sputum, serves as the primary nutrient source for microbes colonizing this site and induces virulence-associated phenotypes and gene expression in several CF pathogens. Here, we characterized the transcriptional responses of three S. maltophilia strains during exposure to synthetic CF sputum medium (SCFM2) to gain insight into how this organism interacts with the host in the CF lung. These efforts led to the identification of 881 transcripts differentially expressed by all three strains, many of which reflect the metabolic pathways used by S. maltophilia in sputum, as well as altered stress responses. The latter correlated with increased resistance to peroxide exposure after pregrowth in SCFM2 for two of the strains. We also compared the SCFM2 transcriptomes of two S. maltophilia CF isolates to that of the acute infection strain, S. maltophilia K279a, allowing us to identify CF isolate-specific signatures in differential gene expression. The expression of genes from the accessory genomes was also differentially altered in response to SCFM2. Finally, a number of biofilm-associated genes were differentially induced in SCFM2, particularly in K279a, which corresponded to increased aggregation and biofilm formation in this strain relative to both CF strains. Collectively, this work details the response of S. maltophilia to an environment that mimics important aspects of the CF lung, identifying potential survival strategies and metabolic pathways used by S. maltophilia during infections.","authors":[{"name":"Graham G Willsey"},{"name":"Korin Eckstrom"},{"name":"Annette E LaBauve"},{"name":"Lauren A Hinkel"},{"name":"Kristin Schutz"},{"name":"Robert J Meagher"},{"name":"John J LiPuma"},{"name":"Matthew J Wargo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Stenotrophomonas"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"metabolism"},{"word":"nutrient acquisition"},{"word":"transcriptional regulation"},{"word":"virulence factors"}]},"article316":{"pmid":"31109946","title":"A Protein E-PilA Fusion Protein Shows Vaccine Potential against Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae in Mice and Chinchillas.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"PE-PilA is a fusion protein composed of immunologically relevant parts of protein E (PE) and the majority subunit of the type IV pilus (PilA), two major antigens of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Here we report on the preclinical evaluation of PE-PilA as a vaccine antigen. The immunogenic potential of the PE and PilA within the fusion was compared with that of isolated PE and PilA antigens. When injected intramuscularly into mice, the immunogenicity of PE within the fusion was equivalent to that of isolated PE, except when it was formulated with alum. In contrast, in our murine models PilA was consistently found to be more immunogenic as a subentity of the PE-PilA fusion protein than when it was injected as an isolated antigen. Following immunization with PE-PilA, anti-PE antibodies demonstrated the same capacity to inhibit the binding of PE to vitronectin as those induced after PE immunization. Likewise, PE-PilA-induced anti-PilA antibodies inhibited the formation of NTHi biofilms and disrupted established biofilms in vitro These experiments support the immunogenic equivalence between fused PE-PilA and isolated PE and PilA. Further, the potential of PE-PilA immunization against NTHi-induced disease was evaluated. After intranasal NTHi challenge, colonization of the murine nasopharynx significantly dropped in animals formerly immunized with PE-PilA, and in chinchillas, signs of otitis media were significantly reduced in animals that had received anti-PE-PilA antibodies.

However, in this study, we found that the biofilm formation is decreased in the pnp mutant, which is due to a defect in rhamnolipids production. The rhamnolipids production is regulated by the RhlI-RhlR quorum sensing system. We found that PNPase influences the translation of RhlI through its 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and identified that the sRNA P27 is responsible for the translational repression. In vitro translation experiments demonstrated that P27 directly represses the translation of the rhlI mRNA through its 5'UTR in an Hfq-dependent manner.

Clinical and epidemiological studies show that different types of therapies are able to eliminate the signs and symptoms of mycotic vaginitis in the acute phase, but so far none of these has proved able to significantly reduce the risk of long-term recurrence. In this review, based on the available literature and original data from a preliminary in-vitro microbiological study on the compatibility between fluconazole, clotrimazole and metronidazole a new therapeutic approach to RVVC is discussed and presented. The treatment proposed is a combined scheme using both systemic antimicrobial drug therapy with oral fluconazole 200 mg and topical drug therapy using the association metronidazole 500 mg and clotrimazole 100 mg (vaginal ovules) with adjuvant oral probiotic therapy. In detail, at the time of diagnosis in the acute symptom phase, we propose the following treatment scheme: fluconazole 200 mg on day 1, 4, 11, 26, then 1 dose/month for 3 months at the end of the menstrual cycle; plus metronidazole/clotrimazole ovules 1/day for 6 days the first week, then 1 ovule/day for 3 days the week before the menstrual cycle for 3 months; plus probiotic 1 dose/day for 10 days for 3 months starting from the second month to the end of the menstrual cycle. This scheme aims to address the recurrent infection aggressively from the outset by attempting not only to treat acute symptoms, but also to prevent a new event by countering many of the potential risk factors of recurrence, such as the intestinal Candida reservoir, the mycotic biorhythm, the formation of biofilm, the phenotype switching and the presence of infections complicated by the presence of C. non albicans or G. Vaginalis, without interfering, but rather favoring the restoration of the vaginal lactobacillus species. Future clinical studies will be useful to confirm the proposed scheme.","authors":[{"name":"Carlo Genovese"},{"name":"Antonio Cianci"},{"name":"Salvatore Corsello"},{"name":"Giuseppe Ettore"},{"name":"Paolo Mattana"},{"name":"Gianna Tempera"}],"keywords":[]},"article330":{"pmid":"31106237","title":"Biofilm Assays on Fibrinogen-coated Silicone Catheters and 96-well Polystyrene Plates.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biofilm formation is a well-known bacterial strategy that protects cells from hostile environments. During infection, bacteria found in a biofilm community are less sensitive to antibiotics and to the immune response, often allowing them to colonize and persist in the host niche. Not surprisingly, biofilm formation on medical devices, such as urinary catheters, is a major problem in hospital settings. To be able to eliminate such biofilms, it is important to understand the key bacterial factors that contribute to their formation. A common practice in the lab setting is to study biofilms grown in laboratory media. However, these media do not fully reflect the host environment conditions, potentially masking relevant biological determinants. This is the case during urinary catheterization, where a key element for Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus colonization and biofilm formation is the release of fibrinogen (Fg) into the bladder and its deposition on the urinary catheter. To recapitulate bladder conditions during catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), we have developed a fibrinogen-coated catheter and 96-well plate biofilm assay in urine. Notably, enterococcal biofilm factors identified in these in vitro assays proved to be important for biofilm formation in vivo in a mouse model of CAUTI.

In this study, we designed a two-step strategy for the rapid enrichment of Nitrosocosmicus-like AOA from soils. Firstly, combination of kanamycin and ampicillin was chosen as the selective stress for bacteria and quartz sands were used as the attachment of AOA cells during the first step cultivation; only after 40-75 days cultivation, AOA enrichments with abundance >20% were obtained. Secondly, combination of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin was chosen as the selective stress for the following cultivation; it is able to penetrate the biofilms and kill the bacterial cells inside the aggregate, contributing to the AOA enrichments reached high abundances (90%) only after one-time cultivation. Basing on this strategy, three AOA strains were obtained from agricultural soils only after 90-150 days cultivation. Phylogenetic analysis suggested these AOA belong to the soil group I.1b Thaumarchaeota and are closely related to the genus Nitrosocosmicus. In general, AOA enrichment or isolation is very difficult and time-consuming (an average of 2-3 years).

P. aeruginosa isolates (n = 28) from an international panel were tested for their susceptibility to manuka honey and clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and tobramycin), alone and in combination, using conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). To increase clinical applicability, two ex vivo porcine lung (EVPL) models (using alveolar and bronchiolar tissue) were used to determine the anti-biofilm effects of manuka honey alone and in combination with antibiotics. All P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to manuka honey, however, varying incidences of resistance were seen against antibiotics. The combination of sub-inhibitory manuka honey and antibiotics using conventional AST had no effect on activity against the majority of isolates tested. Using the two ex vivo models, 64% (w/v) manuka honey inhibited many of the isolates where abnormally high concentrations of antibiotics could not. Typically, combinations of both manuka honey and antibiotics had increased antimicrobial activity.

Three phenolic extracts were obtained: red onion extract in methanol acidified with 2.5% acetic acid (RO-1), white onion extract in methanol (WO-1) and white onion extract in methanol ammonium (WO-2). Quercetin 4-O-glucoside and quercetin 3,4-O-diglucoside were identified as the predominant compounds in both onion varieties using HPLC-DAD and LC-ESI-MS/MS.

The three extracts showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values equal to or above 125 μg/ml of dried extract.

In liquid media, Bacillus subtilis produces an opaque floating biofilm, or a pellicle. Biofilms are generally associated with an interface, but the ability of Bacillus subtilis to swim means the bacteria are additionally able to reside within the liquid phase. However, due to imaging complications associated with the opacity of pellicles, the extent to which bacteria coexist within the liquid bulk as well as their behavior in the liquid is not well studied. We therefore develop a high-throughput imaging system to image underneath developing pellicles. Here we report a well-defined sequence of developmental events that occurs underneath a growing pellicle. Comparison with bacteria deficient in swimming and chemotaxis suggest that these properties enable collective bacterial swimming within the liquid phase which facilitate faster surface colonization. Furthermore, comparison to bacteria deficient in exopolymeric substances (EPS) suggest that the lack of a surface pellicle prevents further developmental steps from occurring within the liquid phase. Our results reveal a sequence of developmental events during pellicle growth, encompassing adhesion, conversion, growth, maturity, and detachment on the interface, which are synchronized with the bacteria in the liquid bulk increasing in density until the formation of a mature surface pellicle, after which the density of bacteria in the liquid drops.","authors":[{"name":"Lisa M Lee"},{"name":"Gili Rosenberg"},{"name":"Shmuel M Rubinstein"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"collective behavior"},{"word":"development"},{"word":"flagellar motility"},{"word":"pellicles"}]},"article339":{"pmid":"31105656","title":"In vitro Antimicrobial Activity of Robenidine, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid and Polymyxin B Nonapeptide Against Important Human and Veterinary Pathogens.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The emergence and global spread of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens demand alternative strategies to treat life-threatening infections. Combination drugs and repurposing of old compounds with known safety profiles that are not currently used in human medicine can address the problem of multidrug-resistant infections and promote antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of robenidine alone or in combination with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including those associated with canine otitis externa and human skin and soft tissue infection, was evaluated in vitro using microdilution susceptibility testing and the checkerboard method. Fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) and dose reduction indices (DRI) of the combinations against tested isolates were determined. Robenidine alone was bactericidal against Acinetobacter baumannii [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) mode = 8 μg/ml] and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MIC mode = 2 μg/ml). Against Acinetobacter spp., an additivity/indifference of the combination of robenidine/EDTA (0.53 > FICIs > 1.06) and a synergistic effect of the combination of robenidine/PMBN (0.5 < FICI) were obtained. DRIs of robenidine were significantly increased in the presence of both EDTA and PMBN from 2- to 2048-fold. Robenidine exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of either EDTA or PMBN. Robenidine also demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens and all Gram-negative pathogens isolated from cases of canine otitis externa in the presence of EDTA. Robenidine did not demonstrate antibiofilm activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. EDTA facilitated biofilm biomass degradation for both Gram-positives and Gram-negatives. The addition of robenidine to EDTA was not associated with any change in the effect on biofilm biomass degradation. The combination of robenidine with EDTA or PMBN has potential for further exploration and pharmaceutical development, such as incorporation into topical and otic formulations for animal and human use.","authors":[{"name":"Manouchehr Khazandi"},{"name":"Hongfei Pi"},{"name":"Wei Yee Chan"},{"name":"Abiodun David Ogunniyi"},{"name":"Jowenna Xiao Feng Sim"},{"name":"Henrietta Venter"},{"name":"Sanjay Garg"},{"name":"Stephen W Page"},{"name":"Peter B Hill"},{"name":"Adam McCluskey"},{"name":"Darren J Trott"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EDTA"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"canine otitis externa"},{"word":"combination"},{"word":"robenidine"}]},"article340":{"pmid":"31105285","title":"Assessment of biofilm formation by pseudomonas aeruginosa and hydrodynamic evaluation of microtiter plate assay.","date":"2019-12-18","abs":"To assess the biofilm formation in clinical and environmental isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to evaluate the hydrodynamics in microtiter plate assay and compare it with conventional assays for biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Abdus Samad"},{"name":"Amir Afzal Khan"},{"name":"Muhammad Sajid"},{"name":"Rabaab Zahra"}],"keywords":[{"word":" Biofilm, P. aeruginosa,Microtiter plate assay, Computational fluid dynamics"}]},"article341":{"pmid":"31105214","title":"Cell Shape and Surface Colonisation in the Diatom Genus Cocconeis-An Opportunity to Explore Bio-Inspired Shape Packing?","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Optimal packing of 2 and 3-D shapes in confined spaces has long been of practical and theoretical interest, particularly as it has been discovered that rotatable ellipses (or ellipsoids in the 3-D case) can, for example, have higher packing densities than disks (or spheres in the 3-D case). Benthic diatoms, particularly those of the genus Cocconeis (Ehr.)-which are widely regarded as prolific colonisers of immersed surfaces-often have a flattened (adnate) cell shape and an approximately elliptical outline or footprint that allows them to closely contact the substratum. Adoption of this shape may give these cells a number of advantages as they colonise surfaces, such as a higher packing fraction for colonies on a surface for more efficient use of limited space, or an increased contact between individual cells when cell abundances are high, enabling the cells to minimize energy use and maximize packing (and biofilm) stability on a surface. Here, the outline shapes of individual diatom cells are measured using scanning electron and epifluorescence microscopy to discover if the average cell shape compares favourably with those predicted by theoretical modelling of efficient 2-D ellipse packing. It is found that the aspect ratio of measured cells in close association in a biofilm-which are broadly elliptical in shape-do indeed fall within the range theoretically predicted for optimal packing, but that the shape of individual diatoms also differ subtly from that of a true ellipse. The significance of these differences for optimal packing of 2-D shapes on surfaces is not understood at present, but may represent an opportunity to further explore bio-inspired design shapes for the optimal packing of shapes on surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Timothy Sullivan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"biomimetics"},{"word":"diatoms"},{"word":"ellipse"},{"word":"interfaces"},{"word":"optimal packing"}]},"article342":{"pmid":"31105160","title":"Antimicrobial potential of bismuth lipophilic nanoparticles embedded into chitosan-based membrane.","date":"2019-10-22","abs":"The objective of this work was to analyze the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of bismuth lipophilic nanoparticles (BisBAL NPs) incorporated into chitosan-based membranes.

The electrochemical activities and cell viabilities of Geobacter soli biofilms were simultaneously attenuated at 0.4 and 0.6 V compared to -0.2 and 0 V. It was found that the biofilms (especially the biofilm region closer to electrode surface) grown at -0.2 and 0 V produced relatively more extracellular redox-active proteins and less extracellular polysaccharides, which conferred higher electron accepting/donating capacities to EPS and consequently facilitated EET. Meanwhile, electrically nonconductive extracellular polysaccharide-dominated interior layers were formed in the biofilms grown at 0.4 and 0.6 V, which limited direct EET but might serve as physical barriers for protecting cells in these biofilms from the increasing stress by poised electrodes.

Acinetobacter baumannii constituted 9.4% of all Gram-negative organisms throughout the hospital and 22.6% in the ICUs according to a study carried out in an Indian hospital. One of the major factors contributing to drug resistance in A. baumannii infections is biofilm development. Quorum sensing (QS) facilitates biofilm formation and therefore the search for 'quorum quenchers' has increased recently. Such compounds are expected to inhibit biofilm formation and hence reduce/prevent development of drug resistance in the bacteria. Some of these compounds also target synthesis of some virulence factors (VF). Several candidate drugs have been identified and are at various stages of drug development. Since quorum quenching, inhibition of biofilm formation and inhibition of VF synthesis do not pose any threat to the DNA replication and cell division of the bacteria, chances of resistance development to such compounds is presumably rare. Thus, these compounds ideally qualify as adjunct therapeutics and could be administered along with an antibiotic to reduce chances of resistance development and also to increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy.

Many of these peptides disturb cells by forming pores in the plasma membrane that eventually lead to the cell death. The complexity of these peptide-lipid interactions is mainly related to electrostatic, hydrophobic and topological issues of these counterparts. Diverse studies have shed some light on how AMPs act on lipid bilayers composed by different phospholipids, and how mechanical properties of membranes could affect the antimicrobial effects of such compounds. On the other hand, cyclic lipopeptides (cLPs), an important class of microbial secondary metabolites, have received comparatively less attention. Due to their amphipathic structures, cLPs exhibit interesting biological activities including interactions with biofilms, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, antiviral, and anti-tumoral properties, which deserve more investigation. Understanding how physicochemical properties of lipid bilayers contribute and determining the antagonistic activity of these secondary metabolites over a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens could establish a framework to design and select effective strategies of biological control. This implies unravelling-at the biophysical level-the complex interactions established between cLPs and lipid bilayers. This review presents, in a systematic manner, the diversity of lipidated antibiotics produced by different microorganisms, with a critical analysis of the perturbing actions that have been reported in the literature for this specific set of membrane-active lipopeptides during their interactions with model membranes and in vivo. With an overview on the mechanical properties of lipid bilayers that can be experimentally determined, we also discuss which parameters are relevant in the understanding of those perturbation effects.

The binding of PNA and Con A to M. aeruginosa cells was visualized via fluorescence microscopy using a lectin adjunct with fluorescein isothiocyanate, and resulted in carbohydrate and protein accumulation in the cellular capsule. Given that the highest carbohydrate accumulation was seen in the Con A system (where iron accumulation was relatively lower), carbohydrate quality is likely important factor that influences cellular iron accumulation. Since PNA specifically binds to sugars such as galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, these saccharide species could be important candidates for intracellular and extracellular iron accumulation and transport. Microcystin biosynthesis was stimulated in the presence of PNA and WGA, whereas cellular iron uptake increased only in the presence of PNA. Thus, the iron uptake was not necessarily congruent with the upregulation of microcystin synthesis, which suggested that the positive effect of lectin on iron uptake is probably attributable to the PNA-assisted iron accumulation around the cell surface.

From the other side, alterations in the level of gene expression in response to antibiotic pressure leads to the establishment of a persisters subpopulation. Both subpopulations represent the cells in different physiological states. Dormancy and persistence do share some similarities, e.g. both represent cells with low metabolic activity that can exist for extended periods without replication, both constitute populations with different gene expression profiles and both differ significantly from replicating forms of spirochetes. Persisters are elusive, present in low numbers, morphologically heterogeneous, multi-drug-tolerant cells that can change with the environment. The definition of persisters substituted the originally-used term survivors, referring to the small bacterial population of Staphylococcus that survived killing by penicillin. The phenomenon of persisters is present in almost all bacterial species; however, the reasons why Borrelia persisters form are poorly understood. Persisters can adopt varying sizes and shapes, changing from well-known forms to altered morphologies. They are capable of forming round bodies, L-form bacteria, microcolonies or biofilms-like aggregates, which remarkably change the response of Borrelia to hostile environments. Persisters remain viable despite aggressive antibiotic challenge and are able to reversibly convert into motile forms in a favorable growth environment. Persisters are present in significant numbers in biofilms, which has led to the explanation of biofilm tolerance to antibiotics. Considering that biofilms are associated with numerous chronic diseases through their resilient presence in the human body, it is not surprising that interest in persisting cells has consequently accelerated. Certain diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria (e.g. tuberculosis, syphilis or leprosy) are commonly chronic in nature and often recur despite antibiotic treatment.

In comparison to well-studied Mediterranean streams, drying events in canopied temperate streams occur under higher ambient humidity which probably affects the metabolic response to drying.

We hypothesized that preservation of sediment moisture due to high humidity increases resistance to drying in temperate streambed biofilms and fast resilience of biofilm activity after flow resumption. We also expected the presence of macroinvertebrate grazers to modulate the biofilm response to dry-rewet stress. Following a two-level factorial design in 24 microcosms, we tested the effect of drying intensity (moderate and intense) and grazer presence and absence (P. antipodarum) on the activity of biofilm colonizing shallow hyporheic sediment.

The AMP P5 has been previously designed as a cationic linear α-helical sequence, being its antimicrobial and hemolytic properties also evaluated. In this work, we analyzed the feasibility of using P5 against a carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most common and risky pathogens in clinical practice. After antimicrobial activity confirmation in in vitro studies, synergistic activity of P5 with meropenem was evaluated, showing that P5 displayed significant synergistic activity in a time kill curve assay. The ability of P5 to permeabilize the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa can explain the obtained results. Finally, the antibiofilm activity was investigated by viability analysis (MTT assay), crystal violet and confocal imaging, with P5 displaying mild biofilm inhibition in the range of concentrations tested. Regarding biofilm disruption activity, P5 showed a higher efficacy, interfering with biofilm structure and promoting bacterial cell death.

Carotenoids are sterol analogs that are important for regulating membrane dynamics. The membrane of Pantoea sp. YR343 is characterized by the presence of the carotenoid zeaxanthin, and a carotenoid-deficient mutant, ΔcrtB, displays defects in root colonization, reduced secretion of indole-3-acetic acid, and defects in biofilm formation. Here we demonstrate that the loss of carotenoids results in changes to the membrane lipid composition in Pantoea sp. YR343, including increased amounts of unsaturated fatty acids in the ΔcrtB mutant membranes. These mutant cells displayed less fluid membranes in comparison to wild type cells as measured by fluorescence anisotropy of whole cells. Studies with artificial systems, however, have shown that carotenoids impart membrane rigidifying properties. Thus, we examined membrane fluidity using spheroplasts and vesicles composed of lipids extracted from either wild type or mutant cells. Interestingly, with the removal of the cell wall and membrane proteins, ΔcrtB vesicles were more fluid than vesicles made from lipids extracted from wild type cells. In addition, carotenoids appeared to stabilize membrane fluidity during rapidly changing temperatures. Taken together, these results suggest that Pantoea sp. YR343 compensates for the loss of carotenoids by changing lipid composition, which together with membrane proteins, results in reduced membrane fluidity. These changes may influence the abundance or function of membrane proteins that are responsible for the physiological changes observed in the ΔcrtB mutant cells.","authors":[{"name":"Sushmitha Vijaya Kumar"},{"name":"Graham Taylor"},{"name":"Sahar Hasim"},{"name":"C Patrick Collier"},{"name":"Abigail T Farmer"},{"name":"Shawn R Campagna"},{"name":"Amber N Bible"},{"name":"Mitchel J Doktycz"},{"name":"Jennifer Morrell-Falvey"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Atomic force microscopy"},{"word":"Fluorescence anisotropy"},{"word":"Membrane fluidity"},{"word":"Pantoea"},{"word":"Zeaxanthin"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"31095643","title":"Evaluation of biological and enzymatic quorum quencher coating additives to reduce biocorrosion of steel.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Microbial colonization can be detrimental to the integrity of metal surfaces and lead to microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). Biocorrosion is a serious problem for aquatic and marine industries in the world. In Minnesota (USA), where this study was conducted, biocorrosion severely affects the maritime transportation industry. The anticorrosion activity of a variety of compounds, including chemical (magnesium peroxide) and biological (surfactin, capsaicin, and gramicidin) molecules were investigated as coating additives. We also evaluated a previously engineered, extremely stable, non-biocidal enzyme known to interfere in bacterial signaling, SsoPox (a quorum quenching lactonase). Experimental steel coupons were submerged in water from the Duluth Superior Harbor (DSH) for 8 weeks in the laboratory. Biocorrosion was evaluated by counting the number and the coverage of corrosion tubercles on coupons and also by ESEM imaging of the coupon surface. Three experimental coating additives significantly reduced the formation of corrosion tubercles: surfactin, magnesium peroxide and the quorum quenching lactonase by 31%, 36% and 50%, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that these decreases in corrosion were associated with significant changes in the composition of bacterial communities on the steel surfaces. These results demonstrate the potential of highly stable quorum quenching lactonases to provide a reliable, cost-effective method to treat steel structures and prevent biocorrosion.","authors":[{"name":"Siqian Huang"},{"name":"Celine Bergonzi"},{"name":"Michael Schwab"},{"name":"Mikael Elias"},{"name":"Randall E Hicks"}],"keywords":[]},"article391":{"pmid":"31095597","title":"Transport and instream removal of the Cry1Ab protein from genetically engineered maize is mediated by biofilms in experimental streams.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"The majority of maize planted in the US is genetically-engineered to express insecticidal properties, including Cry1Ab protein, which is designed to resist the European maize borer (Ostrinia nubilalis). After crop harvest, these proteins can be leached into adjacent streams from crop detritus left on fields. The environmental fate of Cry1Ab proteins in aquatic habitats is not well known. From June-November, we performed monthly short-term additions of leached Cry1Ab into four experimental streams with varying benthic substrate to estimate Cry1Ab transport and removal. At the start of the experiments, when rocks were bare, we found no evidence of Cry1Ab removal from the water column, but uptake steadily increased as biofilm colonized the stream substrate. Overall, Cry1Ab uptake was strongly predicted by measures of biofilm accumulation, including algal chlorophyll a and percent cover of filamentous algae. Average Cry1Ab uptake velocity (vf = 0.059 ± 0.009 mm s-1) was comparable to previously reported uptake of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC; mean vf = 0.04 ± 0.008 mm s-1). Although Cry1Ab has been shown to rapidly degrade in stream water, benthic biofilms may decrease the distance proteins are transported in lotic systems. These results emphasize that once the Cry1Ab protein is leached, subsequent detection and transport through agricultural waterways is dependent on the structure and biology of receiving stream ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Arial J Shogren"},{"name":"Jennifer L Tank"},{"name":"Emma J Rosi"},{"name":"Martha M Dee"},{"name":"Shannon L Speir"},{"name":"Diogo Bolster"},{"name":"Scott P Egan"}],"keywords":[]},"article392":{"pmid":"31095299","title":"A novel medical device coating prevents Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation on medical device surfaces.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Prevention of device related infections due to Staphylococcus aureus biofilms on devices represents a significant challenge.
