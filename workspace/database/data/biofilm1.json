These microorganisms have been found in polymicrobial biofilms forming on titanium biomaterial surfaces in humans with peri-implant disease. The purpose of this work was to study mutualistic interactions in biofilms forming on titanium and their effect on the adjacent mucosa, using a relevant infection model. Single and mixed biofilms of C. albicans and each Streptococcus species were grown on titanium disks. Bacterial and fungal biovolume and biomass were quantified in these biofilms. Organotypic mucosal constructs were exposed to preformed titanium surface biofilms to test their effect on secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and cell damage. C. albicans promoted bacterial biofilms of all mitis Streptococcus species on titanium surfaces. This relationship was mutualistic since all bacterial species up-regulated the efg1 hypha-associated gene in C. albicans Mixed biofilms caused increased tissue damage, but did not increase proinflammatory cytokine responses compared to Candida alone. Interestingly, spent culture media from tissues exposed to titanium biofilms suppressed Candida growth on titanium surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"João Gabriel Silva Souza"},{"name":"Martinna Bertolini"},{"name":"Angela Thompson"},{"name":"Valentim Adelino Ricardo Barao"},{"name":"Anna Dongari-Bagtzoglou"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"32111506","title":"In vitro and in vivo activity of a possible novel antifungal small molecule against Candida albicans.","date":"2020-02-29","abs":"Nosocomial infections by fungi are important causes of morbidity and mortality, and the adhesion capacity of yeast on abiotic and biotic surfaces has been considered an important step in this process.

No specific bacterial species that can cause periodontitis alone has been found in any study to date. Several periodontopathic bacteria are associated with the progress of periodontal disease. Consequently, it is hypothesized that dysbiosis of subgingival microbiota may be a cause of periodontal disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the subgingival microbiota and the clinical status of periodontal pockets in a quantitative and clinically applicable way with the newly developed Oral Care Chip. The Oral Care Chip is a DNA microarray tool with improved quantitative performance, that can be used in combination with competitive PCR to quantitatively detect 17 species of subgingival bacteria. Cluster analysis based on the similarity of each bacterial quantity was performed on 204 subgingival plaque samples collected from periodontitis patients and healthy volunteers. A significant difference in the number of total bacteria, Treponema denticola, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus intermedia bacteria in any combination of the three clusters indicated that these bacteria gradually increased in number from the stage before the pocket depth deepened. Conversely, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus constellatus, which had significant differences only in limited clusters, were thought to increase in number as the pocket depth deepened, after periodontal pocket formation. Furthermore, in clusters where healthy or mild periodontal disease sites were classified, there was no statistically significant difference in pocket depth, but the number of bacteria gradually increased from the stage before the pocket depth increased. This means that quantitative changes in these bacteria can be a predictor of the progress of periodontal tissue destruction, and this novel microbiological test using the Oral Care Chip could be effective at detecting dysbiosis.","authors":[{"name":"Ai Nozawa"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Oshima"},{"name":"Naoyuki Togawa"},{"name":"Takenori Nozaki"},{"name":"Shinya Murakami"}],"keywords":[]},"article9":{"pmid":"32109809","title":"Biofiltration of oil sands process water in fixed-bed biofilm reactors shapes microbial community structure for enhanced degradation of naphthenic acids.","date":"2020-03-03","abs":"Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a complex mixture of carboxylic acids present in oil sands process water (OSPW).

Both raw and ozonated OSPW were treated in the biofilters and changes in microbial community were tested via 16S/18S amplicon sequencing and metatranscriptomics. Through switch from suspended growth to attached growth, a shift in indigenous microbial community was seen following by an increase in alpha diversity. Concomitantly, improved degradation of NAs was monitored, i.e., 35.8% and 69.4% of NAs were removed from raw and ozonated OSPW, respectively. Metatranscriptomics analysis suggested the presence of genes involved in the degradation of organic acids and petroleum-related compounds. Specifically, functional abundance of aromatic compounds' metabolism improved from 0.05% to 0.76%; whereas abundance of benzoate transport and degradation pathway increased from 0.04% to 0.64%.

As the mechanism by which sulfones gain access to the cytoplasm has not been elucidated yet, in order to track S1-3, we coupled their hydrazine group with BODIPY (final S1-3 BODIPY-labelled were named SB1-3). This approach allowed us to follow the vital internalization and endocytic routing of SB1-3, while BODIPY interacts primarily with fungal surfaces, thus confirming that S1-3 and their counterparts SB1-2 behaved as non-typical agents by damaging the cell membrane and wall after being endocytosed (SB1-3 fluorescence visible inside the unlysed sessile cells). Thus greatly decreasing the likelihood of the appearance of strains resistance. Core sulfones S1-3 are a promising alternative not only to treat planktonic C. albicans but also biofilm-embedded cells. In the flow cytometric analysis, the planktonic cell surface was digested by S1-3, which made the externalized PS accessible to AnnexinV binding and PI input (accidental cell death ACD). The occurrence of ACD as well as apoptosis (crescent-shaped nuclei) and anoikis of sessile cells (regulated cell death by 100%-reduction in attachment to epithelium) was assessed through monitoring the AO/PI/HO342 markers. CLSM revealed the invasion of S1-3 and SB1-3 in C. albicans without inducing cell lysis. This was a novel approach in which QCM-D was used for real-time in situ detection of viscoelastic changes in the C. albicans biofilm, and its interaction with S1 as a representative of the sulfones tested. S1 (not toxic in vivo) is a potent fungicidal agent against C. albicans and could be administered to treat invasive candidiasis as a monotherapy or in combination with antifungal agents of reference to treat C. albicans infections.","authors":[{"name":"Monika Staniszewska"},{"name":"Anna Sobiepanek"},{"name":"Gizińska Małgorzata"},{"name":"Eduardo Peña-Cabrera"},{"name":"Ismael J Arroyo-Córdoba"},{"name":"Kazek Michalina"},{"name":"Łukasz Kuryk"},{"name":"Magdalena Wieczorek"},{"name":"Mirosława Koronkiewicz"},{"name":"Tomasz Kobiela"},{"name":"Zbigniew Ochal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungals"},{"word":"BODIPY-Labelled sulfones"},{"word":"Biofilm viscoelastic changes"},{"word":"Endocytosis"},{"word":"Regulated cell death"}]},"article11":{"pmid":"32109732","title":"Optimizing nutrient removal of moving bed biofilm reactor process using response surface methodology.","date":"2020-03-24","abs":"The potential of 3-stages process (anaerobic, anoxic and moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR)) for organic matter and nutrient removals from secondary WWTP effluents at various hydraulic retention time (HRT) and nitrate recycle ratio (R) was investigated.

We established a high-throughput competitive assay based on mannoside-modified particles and flow-cytometry to directly measure the binding affinity between the mannoside ligands and fim+ E. coli 83972. We demonstrated that the bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation were strongly correlated to the binding affinity of the immobilized mannoside ligands. Mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis indicated a substantial difference in the proteome of the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secreted by biofilms on different mannoside surfaces, which might be related to the biofilm stability.","authors":[{"name":"Zhiling Zhu"},{"name":"Yanxin Chen"},{"name":"Siheng Li"},{"name":"Hong Lin"},{"name":"Guoting Qin"},{"name":"Chengzhi Cai"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CAUTI"},{"word":"FimH"},{"word":"benign bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"flow cytometry"},{"word":"mannoside"}]},"article23":{"pmid":"32107396","title":"Garlic alters the expression of putative virulence factor genes SIR2 and ECE1 in vulvovaginal C. albicans isolates.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Vulvovaginal candidiasis causes sufferers much discomfort.

Real-time PCR was used to assess changes in gene expression when exposed to garlic. Treatment with fresh garlic extract and pure allicin (an active compound produced in cut garlic) resulted in a decrease in SIR2 expression in all strains. In contrast, ECE1 expression was up-regulated in a reference strain and an isolate from a patient unresponsive to garlic therapy, while in an isolate from a patient responsive to garlic therapy, down-regulation of ECE1 occurred.

Antibacterial activity of the cranberry extract in the formed biofilm was evaluated by assessing the reduction in bacteria viability, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) combined with propidium monoazide (PMA), and by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and anti-biofilm activity by studying the inhibition of the incorporation of different bacteria species in biofilms formed in the presence of the cranberry extract, using qPCR and CLSM.

In agriculture, microbes and their bioactive compounds are being utilized in growth promotion and health promotion withnutrient fortification and its acquisition. Exhaustive explorations are unraveling the vast diversity of microbialcompounds with their potential usage in solving multiferous problems incrop production. Lipopeptides are one of such microbial compounds which havestrong antimicrobial properties against different plant pathogens. These compounds are reported to be produced by bacteria, cyanobacteria, fungi, and few other microorganisms; however, genus Bacillus alone produces a majority of diverse lipopeptides. Lipopeptides are low molecular weight compounds which havemultiple industrial roles apart from being usedas biosurfactants and antimicrobials. In plant protection, lipopeptides have wide prospects owing totheirpore-forming ability in pathogens, siderophore activity, biofilm inhibition, and dislodging activity, preventing colonization bypathogens, antiviral activity, etc. Microbes with lipopeptides that haveall these actions are good biocontrol agents. Exploring these antimicrobial compounds could widen the vistasof biological pest control for existing and emerging plant pathogens. The broader diversity and strong antimicrobial behavior of lipopeptides could be a boon for dealing withcomplex pathosystems and controlling diseases of greater economic importance. Understanding which and how these compounds modulate the synthesis and production of defense-related biomolecules in the plants is a key question-the answer of whichneeds in-depth investigation. The present reviewprovides a comprehensive picture of important lipopeptides produced by plant microbiome, their isolation, characterization, mechanisms of disease control, behavior against phytopathogens to understand different aspects of antagonism, and potential prospects for future explorations as antimicrobial agents.

The antibacterial activity of four honey samples supplemented with Vit C was expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). At sub-MICs, Vit C significantly increased the antibacterial activity of the tested honeys against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in planktonic cultures. However, after supplementation, honeydew honey, the most active honey, was ineffective against Staphylococcus aureus. On the other hand, when 100% honeydew honey was supplemented with Vit C (100 mg/g of honey) in a multispecies wound biofilm model, complete eradication of almost all bacterial isolates, including S. aureus, was observed. Furthermore, a mixture of honey and Vit C was partially effective against Enterococcus faecalis, whereas honey alone exhibited no antibacterial activity against this bacterium. Vit C counteracted hydrogen peroxide in honey solution and, thus, eliminated the major antibacterial compound present in honey.

Can an attaching cell help any other cell attach? If so, does it help all cells or employ a more selective strategy to help either nearby cells (spatial neighbors) or its progeny (temporal neighbors)? Using community tracking methods at the single-cell resolution, we suggest answers to these questions based on how reversible attachment progresses during surface sensing for Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA14. Although PAO1 and PA14 exhibit similar trends of surface cell population increase, they show unanticipated differences when cells are considered at the lineage level and interpreted using the quantitative framework of an exactly solvable stochastic model. Reversible attachment comprises two regimes of behavior, processive and nonprocessive, corresponding to whether cells of the lineage stay on the surface long enough to divide, or not, before detaching. Stark differences between PAO1 and PA14 in the processive regime of reversible attachment suggest the existence of two surface colonization strategies. PAO1 lineages commit quickly to a surface compared to PA14 lineages, with early c-di-GMP-mediated exopolysaccharide (EPS) production that can facilitate the attachment of neighbors. PA14 lineages modulate their motility via cyclic AMP (cAMP) and retain memory of the surface so that their progeny are primed for improved subsequent surface attachment. Based on the findings of previous studies, we propose that the differences between PAO1 and PA14 are potentially rooted in downstream differences between Wsp-based and Pil-Chp-based surface-sensing systems, respectively.","authors":[{"name":"Calvin K Lee"},{"name":"Jérémy Vachier"},{"name":"Jaime de Anda"},{"name":"Kun Zhao"},{"name":"Amy E Baker"},{"name":"Rachel R Bennett"},{"name":"Catherine R Armbruster"},{"name":"Kimberley A Lewis"},{"name":"Rebecca L Tarnopol"},{"name":"Charles J Lomba"},{"name":"Deborah A Hogan"},{"name":"Matthew R Parsek"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"},{"name":"Ramin Golestanian"},{"name":"Gerard C L Wong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacterial biofilms"},{"word":"reversible attachment"},{"word":"stochastic model"},{"word":"surface sensing"}]},"article50":{"pmid":"32098432","title":"Methylobacterium spp. as Emerging Opportunistic Premise Plumbing Pathogens.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Methylobacterium spp. are emerging opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens.

Moreover, using a range of cell wall-defective mutants and competition assays, the results indicated that phosphomannan and N-linked mannan in the cell wall are important for peptide binding to C. albicans cells. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous phosphosugars reduced the efficacy of the peptide, suggesting that negatively charged phosphosugars also contributed to the peptide binding to the cell wall polysaccharides. Finally, using a glycan array, P-113Tri, but not P-113, can bind to other glycans commonly present on other microbial and mammalian cells.

Oral biofilm elimination is still a challenge because bacteria are embedded inside with the biofilm matrix protecting them, preventing the penetration of antibiotics or bactericides. Promising strategies for disrupting oral biofilms have been developed, including the use of natural enzymes to degrade the biofilm matrix and hydrogen peroxide to kill bacteria. Here we demonstrate a strategy that combines nanozymes with peroxidase-like activity and bacteria generating biogenic hydrogen peroxide to eliminate oral biofilms for caries treatment. By using a saliva-coated hydroxyapatite disc and sectioned human tooth to mimic the real oral environment, we analyze the influence of iron oxide nanozymes or iron sulfide nanozymes on a Streptococcus mutans biofilm in the presence of Streptococcus gordonii which can generate hydrogen peroxide. Bacterial viability assays and biofilm morphology characterization show that the combination of nanozymes and bacteria remarkably reduces the bacteria number (5 lg reduction) and biofilm matrix (85% reduction).

Persisters have been linked to the recalcitrance of biofilm related infections; hence, a complete understanding of their physiology can lead to improvement of therapeutic strategies for such infections. Mechanisms pertaining to persister formation are thought to be associated with stress response pathways triggered by intra- or extra-cellular stress factors. Unfortunately, studies demonstrating the effects of osmolyte- and/or pH- induced stresses on bacterial persistence are largely missing. To fill this knowledge gap within the field, we studied the effects of various osmolytes and pH conditions on Escherichia coli persistence with the use of phenotype microarrays and antibiotic tolerance assays. Although we found that a number of chemicals and pH environments, including urea, sodium nitrite and acidic pH, significantly reduced persister formation in E. coli compared to no-osmolyte/no-buffer controls, this reduction in persister levels was less pronounced in late-stationary-phase cultures. Our results further demonstrated a positive correlation between cell growth and persister formation, which challenges the general notion in the field that slow-growing cultures have more persister cells than fast-growing cultures.","authors":[{"name":"Prashant Karki"},{"name":"Sayed Golam Mohiuddin"},{"name":"Pouria Kavousi"},{"name":"Mehmet A Orman"}],"keywords":[]},"article68":{"pmid":"32094132","title":"Lactoferrin is broadly active against yeasts and highly synergistic with amphotericin B.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional milk protein with antimicrobial activity against a range of pathogens. While numerous studies report that LF is active against fungi, there are considerable differences in the level of antifungal activity and the capacity of LF to interact with other drugs. Here we undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the antifungal spectrum of activity of three defined sources of LF across 22 yeast and 24 mould species, and assess interactions with six widely used antifungal drugs. LF was broadly and consistently active across all yeast species (MIC 8-64 μg/ml), with the extent of activity strongly affected by iron saturation. LF was synergistic with amphotericin B (AMB) in 19 out of 22 yeast species tested and synergy was unaffected by iron saturation but affected by the extent of LF digestion. LF+AMB combination therapy significantly prolonged the survival of Galleria mellonella infected with Candida albicans or Cryptococcus neoformans and decreased fungal burden 12-25 fold. Evidence that LF directly interacts with the fungal cell surface was seen via SEM, which showed pore formation, hyphal thinning and major cell collapse in response to LF+AMB synergy. Important virulence mechanisms were disrupted by LF+AMB treatment, which significantly prevented biofilms in C. albicans and C. glabrata, inhibited hyphal development in C. albicans, and reduced cell and capsule size and phenotypic diversity in Cryptococcus. Our results demonstrate the potential of LF+AMB as an antifungal treatment that is broadly synergistic against important yeast pathogens, with synergy attributed to the presence of one or more LF peptides.","authors":[{"name":"Kenya E Fernandes"},{"name":"Kerry Weeks"},{"name":"Dee A Carter"}],"keywords":[]},"article69":{"pmid":"32093497","title":"Inhibition of Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms by centipede oil and linoleic acid.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Microbial biofilms are associated with persistent infections because of their high tolerance to antimicrobial agents and host defenses.

These wounds remain challenging to treat, reduce the patients' life quality, and are responsible for a high percentage of limb amputations and many premature deaths. The presence of bacterial biofilms hampers chronic wound therapy due to the high tolerance of biofilm cells to many first- and second-line antibiotics. Due to the appearance of antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant pathogens in these types of wounds, the research for alternative and complementary therapeutic approaches has increased. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy, discovered in the early 1900s, has been revived in the last few decades due to its antibacterial efficacy against antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. Its use in the treatment of non-healing wounds has shown promising outcomes. In this review, we focus on the societal problems of chronic wounds, describe both the history and ongoing clinical trials of chronic wound-related treatments, and also outline experiments carried out for efficacy evaluation with different phage-host systems using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo animal models.

The findings obtained by those studies appear to be both complementary and contradicting, likely reflecting differences in the experimental settings and the type of transgenic mouse modalities employed by each study. Nevertheless, oral γδT cells were shown to consist of developmentally distinct tissue-resident Vγ6 cells and circulating Vγ1 and Vγ4 subsets that are independently maintained in the oral mucosa. In the gingiva, a particularly challenging barrier tissue due to its proximity to the dental plaque, γδT cells are strategically positioned close to the plaque and represent the major source of IL-17. While this suggests that γδT cells might be involved in controlling the dental biofilm, conflicting data were reported in this regard. In vivo studies have shown that γδT cells either play a protective role during age-associated bone loss or, alternatively, have no impact in this process. Also, recent reports suggested opposing data concerning the impact of γδT cells in experimental periodontitis based on the ligature model.

Klebsiella isolated from clinical mastitis cases (n = 53) were identified to the species level using a biochemical test panel and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The rpoB gene sequence was used as the gold standard method and identified Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 40), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), Raoultella ornithinolytica (n = 2), and Raoultella planticola (n = 2). Raoultella, a genus closely related to Klebsiella, was also accurately identified using mass spectrometry but not via biochemical testing. Using the disc diffusion technique, 31 (58%) isolates were found to be susceptible to all antimicrobials tested (n = 18). The remaining 22 (42%) isolates were resistant to 1 or more of the following antimicrobials: kanamycin (2%), streptomycin (38%), spectinomycin (13%), sulfisoxazole (13%), and tetracycline (19%).

Using biofilms grown in a simulated premise plumbing setup fed directly with freshly treated water at two full-scale water treatment plants, we previously determined the mass transfer coefficients for chlorine decay in premise plumbing. These coefficients coupled with inactivation kinetics of L. pneumophila released from biofilms reported previously were integrated into a Monte Carlo framework to estimate the infection risk of biofilm-derived L. pneumophila from 1 to 48 h of stagnation. The annual infection risk was significantly higher when water stayed stagnant for up to 48 h in pipes covered internally with biofilms, compared to clean pipes without biofilms. The decay of residual chlorine due to biofilms during 48-hour stagnation led to up to 6 times increase in the annual infection risk compared to the case where biofilms was absent. Global sensitivity analysis revealed that the rate of L. pneumophila detachment from biofilms and the decay of chlorine residual during stagnation are the two most important factors influencing the infection risks. Stagnation caused by water use patterns and water-saving devices in the premise plumbing can lead to increased infection risk by biofilm-derived L. pneumophila. Overall, this study's findings suggested that biofilms could induce chlorine decay and consequently increase L. pneumophila infection risk.

Csps play roles in different cellular processes and show functional redundancy. Ralstonia solanacearum, the agent of bacterial wilt, has 4 or 5 Csps based on genome analysis. However, the functions of all Csps in R. solanacearum remain unclear. According to phylogenetic analysis, the Csps from R. solanacearum are clustered into a group with CspD from E. coli. Here, we studied the role of CspD3, which was closer to CspD of E. coli in the phylogenetic tree. A cspD3 deletion strain was constructed to assess its effect on the phenotype of R. solanacearum, including growth, biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. The results showed that cspD3 of R. solanacearum was not necessary for normal growth, cold-shock adaptation, or biofilm formation. However, deletion of cspD3 in R. solanacearum CQPS-1 led to increased swimming motility, and the mean diameters of swimming haloes produced by the ΔcspD3 mutant were 1.3-fold larger than those produced by wild-type strain and 1.2-fold larger than those produced by the complemented strain. More importantly, the virulence of the cspD3 deletion mutant on susceptible tobacco plants was significantly attenuated compared to the wild-type strain. At 20 days after inoculation, the disease index of the ΔcspD3 mutant was 2.27, which was reduced by 1.6-fold relative to the wild-type strain. To assess the molecular response influenced by cspD3, the expressions of the main motility-associated genes and virulence-associated genes including flgM, fliA, pehS, pehR, hrpG, xpsR, and prhI in R. solanacearum were measured. The results showed that the expressions of hrpG, xpsR, and prhI were significantly decreased in cspD3 deletion mutant.

Under conditions of stimulated saliva flow (5 mm/min), pH rose to neutral or slightly alkaline values in all biofilms, and the vertical gradients were reversed, with the biofilm bottom becoming more acidic than the top.

Furthermore, new laws require a different stance of producers. Based on that, bacteria of the genus Bacillus present a great agricultural potential, producing lipopeptides (LPs) that have high activity against insects, mites, nematodes, and/or phytopathogens that are harmful to plant cultures. Biopesticide activity can be found mainly in three families of Bacillus lipopeptides: surfactin, iturin, and fengycin.

Recent studies also highlight the ability of these compounds to stimulate defense mechanisms of plants and biofilm formation, which is a key factor for the successful colonization of biocontrol organisms. The use of molecular biology has also recently been researched for continuous advances and discoveries of new LPs, avoiding possible future problems of resistance against these molecules.

This screening reveals the presence of competing strains drives up the expression of genes associated with biofilm matrix production (CsgD pathway), epithelial invasion (SPI1 invasion system), and, finally, chemical efflux and antibiotic tolerance (TolC efflux pump and AadA aminoglycoside 3-adenyltransferase). We validate that these regulatory changes result in the predicted phenotypic changes in biofilm, mammalian cell invasion, and antibiotic tolerance. We further show that these responses arise via activation of major stress responses, providing direct support for the competition sensing hypothesis. Moreover, inactivation of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) of a competitor annuls the responses to competition, indicating that T6SS-derived cell damage activates these stress response systems.

Current treatments are ineffective in resolving biofilm and simultaneously killing the bacteria; therefore, effective biofilm-resolving drugs are needed. We have previously shown that, together with α-tocopherol, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) significantly improves the healing of biofilm-containing chronic wounds, in a diabetic mouse model we developed, by causing disappearance of the bacteria and breakdown of the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). We hypothesize that NAC creates a microenvironment that affects bacterial survival and EPS integrity. To test this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro biofilm system using microbiome taken directly from diabetic mouse chronic wounds. For these studies, we chose mice in which chronic wound microbiome was rich in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (97%). We show that NAC at concentrations with pH < pKa causes bacterial cell death and breakdown of EPS. When used before biofilm is formed, NAC leads to bacterial cell death whereas treatment after the biofilm is established NAC causes biofilm dismantling accompanied by bacterial cell death. Mechanistically, we show that NAC can penetrate the bacterial membrane, increase oxidative stress, and halt protein synthesis. We also show that low pH is important for the actions of NAC and that bacterial death occurs independently of the presence of biofilm. In addition, we show that both the acetyl and carboxylic groups play key roles in NAC functions. The results presented here provide insight into the mechanisms by which NAC dismantles biofilm and how it could be used to treat chronic wounds after debridement (NAC applied at the start of culture) or without debridement (NAC applied when biofilm is already formed). This approach can be taken to develop biofilm from microbiome taken directly from human chronic wounds to test molecules that could be effective for the treatment of specific biofilm compositions.","authors":[{"name":"Xin Li"},{"name":"Jane Kim"},{"name":"Jiabin Wu"},{"name":"Alaa' I Ahamed"},{"name":"Yinsheng Wang"},{"name":"Manuela Martins-Green"}],"keywords":[]},"article121":{"pmid":"32082281","title":"FeGenie: A Comprehensive Tool for the Identification of Iron Genes and Iron Gene Neighborhoods in Genome and Metagenome Assemblies.","date":"2020-02-23","abs":"Iron is a micronutrient for nearly all life on Earth. It can be used as an electron donor and electron acceptor by iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing microorganisms and is used in a variety of biological processes, including photosynthesis and respiration. While it is the fourth most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, iron is often limiting for growth in oxic environments because it is readily oxidized and precipitated. Much of our understanding of how microorganisms compete for and utilize iron is based on laboratory experiments. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing and surge in publicly available sequence data has made it possible to probe the structure and function of microbial communities in the environment. To bridge the gap between our understanding of iron acquisition, iron redox cycling, iron storage, and magnetosome formation in model microorganisms and the plethora of sequence data available from environmental studies, we have created a comprehensive database of hidden Markov models (HMMs) based on genes related to iron acquisition, storage, and reduction/oxidation in Bacteria and Archaea. Along with this database, we present FeGenie, a bioinformatics tool that accepts genome and metagenome assemblies as input and uses our comprehensive HMM database to annotate provided datasets with respect to iron-related genes and gene neighborhood. An important contribution of this tool is the efficient identification of genes involved in iron oxidation and dissimilatory iron reduction, which have been largely overlooked by standard annotation pipelines. We validated FeGenie against a selected set of 28 isolate genomes and showcase its utility in exploring iron genes present in 27 metagenomes, 4 isolate genomes from human oral biofilms, and 17 genomes from candidate organisms, including members of the candidate phyla radiation. We show that FeGenie accurately identifies iron genes in isolates. Furthermore, analysis of metagenomes using FeGenie demonstrates that the iron gene repertoire and abundance of each environment is correlated with iron richness. While this tool will not replace the reliability of culture-dependent analyses of microbial physiology, it provides reliable predictions derived from the most up-to-date genetic markers.

To thrive in oxygen limited niches, bacteria's versatile physiology enables the utilization of alternative electron acceptors. Nitrate, the second most favorable electron acceptor after oxygen, plays a prominent role in the physiology of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) and is abundantly found in urine. Here we analyzed the role of extracellular nitrate in the pathogenesis of the UPEC strain CFT073 with an initial focus on biofilm formation. Colony morphotyping in combination with extensive mutational, transcriptional, and protein expression analyses of CFT073 wild-type and mutants deficient in one or several nitrate reductases revealed an association between nitrate reduction and the biosynthesis of biofilm extracellular matrix components. We identified a role for the nitrate response regulator NarL in modulating expression of the biofilm master regulator CsgD. To analyze the role of nitrate reduction during infection in vivo, we tested wild-type CFT073 and a nitrate reductase null mutant in an ascending urinary tract infection (UTI) model. Individually, each strain colonized extensively, suggesting that nitrate reduction is expendable during UTI. However, during competitive co-infection, the strain incapable of nitrate reduction was strongly outcompeted. This suggests that nitrate reduction can be considered a non-essential but advantageous fitness factor for UPEC pathogenesis. This implies that UPEC rapidly adapts their metabolic needs to the microenvironment of infected tissue. Collectively, this work demonstrates a unique association between nitrate respiration, biofilm formation, and UPEC pathogenicity, highlighting how the use of alternative electron acceptors enables bacterial pathogens to adapt to challenging infectious microenvironments.","authors":[{"name":"Alberto J Martín-Rodríguez"},{"name":"Mikael Rhen"},{"name":"Keira Melican"},{"name":"Agneta Richter-Dahlfors"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"curli"},{"word":"in vivo"},{"word":"nitrate respiration"},{"word":"tissue microbiology"},{"word":"urinary tract infection"},{"word":"uropathogenic Escherichia coli"}]},"article123":{"pmid":"32082276","title":"Association of Novel Streptococcus sanguinis Virulence Factors With Pathogenesis in a Native Valve Infective Endocarditis Model.","date":"2020-02-23","abs":"Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis) is an abundant oral commensal which can cause disseminated human infection if it gains access to the bloodstream.

The short half-life, high reactivity, and rapid diffusivity of NO make therapeutic delivery challenging. The goal of this work was to characterize NO-loaded microbubbles (MB) stabilized with a lipid shell and to assess the feasibility of antibacterial therapy in vitro. MB were loaded with either NO alone (NO-MB) or with NO and octafluoropropane (NO-OFP-MB) (9:1 v/v and 1:1 v/v). The size distribution and acoustic attenuation coefficient of NO-MB and NO-OFP-MB were measured. Ultrasound-triggered release of the encapsulated gas payload was demonstrated with 3-MHz pulsed Doppler ultrasound. An amperometric microelectrode sensor was used to measure NO concentration released from the MB and compared to an NO-OFP-saturated solution. The effect of NO delivery on the viability of planktonic (free living) Staphylococcus aureus (SA) USA 300, a methicillin-resistant strain, was evaluated in a 96 well-plate format. The co-encapsulation of NO with OFP increased the total volume and attenuation coefficient of MB.

The prediction of bacterial growth on 190 carbon and 95 nitrogen sources achieved a high accuracy of 85.6% compared to Biolog experiment results. Based upon two transposon mutant libraries of AB5075 and ATCC 17978, the predictions of essential genes reached the accuracy of 87.6% and 82.1%, respectively.

Several bacteria exhibit a large number of c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins, thus a fine-tuning of this nucleotide levels may occur. It is hypothesized that some c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins would provide the global c-di-GMP levels inside the cell whereas others would maintain a localized pool, with the resulting c-di-GMP acting at the vicinity of its production. Although attractive, this hypothesis has yet to be demonstrated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that the diguanylate cyclase DgcP interacts with the cytosolic region of FimV, a polar peptidoglycan-binding protein involved in type IV pilus assembly. Moreover, DgcP is located at the cell poles in wild type cells but scattered in the cytoplasm of cells lacking FimV. Overexpression of dgcP leads to the classical phenotypes of high c-di-GMP levels (increased biofilm and impaired motilities) in the wild-type strain, but not in a ΔfimV background. Therefore, our findings suggest that DgcP activity is regulated by FimV. The polar localization of DgcP might contribute to a local c-di-GMP pool that can be sensed by other proteins at the cell pole, bringing to light a specialized function for a specific diguanylate cyclase.","authors":[{"name":"Gianlucca G Nicastro"},{"name":"Gilberto H Kaihami"},{"name":"André A Pulschen"},{"name":"Jacobo Hernandez-Montelongo"},{"name":"Ana Laura Boechat"},{"name":"Thays de Oliveira Pereira"},{"name":"Caio Gomes Tavares Rosa"},{"name":"Eliezer Stefanello"},{"name":"Pio Colepicolo"},{"name":"Christophe Bordi"},{"name":"Regina L Baldini"}],"keywords":[]},"article131":{"pmid":"32079271","title":"Oligosaccharides and Complex Carbohydrates: A New Paradigm for Cranberry Bioactivity.","date":"2020-03-20","abs":"Cranberry is a well-known functional food, but the compounds directly responsible for many of its reported health benefits remain unidentified.

Cranberry oligosaccharides have shown similar biological properties as other dietary oligosaccharides, including effects on bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation, and microbial growth. Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity has also been observed. Oligosaccharides may therefore be significant contributors to many of the health benefits associated with cranberry products. Soluble oligosaccharides are present at relatively high concentrations (~20% w/w or greater) in many cranberry materials, and yet their possible contributions to biological activity have remained unrecognized. This is partly due to the inherent difficulty of detecting these compounds without intentionally seeking them. Inconsistencies in product descriptions and terminology have led to additional confusion regarding cranberry product composition and the possible presence of oligosaccharides. This review will present our current understanding of cranberry oligosaccharides and will discuss their occurrence, structures, ADME, biological properties, and possible prebiotic effects for both gut and urinary tract microbiota.

In the present study, we investigated the combinatory effect of the selected EC/EC-like with a natural antimicrobial agent, poly-L-lysine, on cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans growth and biofilm formation. Among four tested EC/EC-like, only two, anandamide (AEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), exhibited synergistic combinatory effect with poly-L-lysine against S. mutans.

To test this hypothesis, an in vitro saliva-derived multispecies biofilm model was established, and by comparing caries lesions on enamel blocks cocultured with biofilms treated with sucrose, glucose and lactose, we confirmed that this model can reproduce the in vivo finding that sucrose has the strongest cariogenic potential. In parallel, compared to a control treatment, sucrose treatment led to significant changes within the microbial structure and assembly of oral microflora, while no significant difference was detected between the lactose/glucose treatment group and the control. Specifically, sucrose supplementation disrupted the homeostasis between acid-producing and alkali-producing bacteria. Consistent with microbial dysbiosis, we observed the most significant disequilibrium between acid and alkali metabolism in sucrose-treated biofilms. Taken together, our data indicate that the cariogenicity of sugars is closely related to their ability to regulate the oral microecology.

Here, we conducted in vitro batch incubations of human faecal microbiota to obtain a mechanistic proof-of-concept of the short-term impact of celecoxib on activity and composition of colon bacterial communities. Celecoxib-exposed microbiota shifted metabolic activity and community composition, whereas total transcriptionally active bacterial population was not significantly changed. Butyrate production decreased by 50% in a donor-dependent manner, suggesting that celecoxib impacts in vitro fermentation. Microbiota-derived acetate has been associated with inhibition of cancer markers and our results suggest uptake of acetate for bacterial functions when celecoxib was supplied, which potentially favoured bacterial competition for acetyl-CoA. We further assessed whether colon microbiota modulates anti-inflammatory efficacy of celecoxib using a simplified inflammation model, and a novel in vitro simulation of the enterohepatic metabolism. Celecoxib was responsible for only 5% of the variance in bacterial community composition but celecoxib-exposed microbiota preserved barrier function and decreased concentrations of IL-8 and CXCL16 in a donor-dependent manner in our two models simulating gut inflammatory milieu.

To better understand the DNA damage response and its role in virulence, we studied the function of the Rad23 nucleotide excision repair protein in detail. The RAD23 deletion strain and overexpression strain both exhibit UV sensitivity, confirming the critical role of RAD23 in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Genetic interaction assays revealed that the role of RAD23 in the UV response relies on RAD4 but is independent of RAD53, MMS22, and RAD18RAD4 and RAD23 have similar roles in regulating cell morphogenesis and biofilm formation; however, only RAD23, but not RAD4, plays a negative role in virulence regulation in a mouse model. We found that the RAD23 deletion strain showed decreased survival in a Candida-macrophage interaction assay. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) data further revealed that RAD23, but not RAD4, regulates the transcription of a virulence factor, SUN41, suggesting a unique role of RAD23 in virulence regulation.

Analysis of recent reports regarding unsuccessful bioremediation attempts indicates that there is a need to highlight the fundamental aspects of hydrocarbon microbiology in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, in this review, we would like to elucidate some crucial, but often overlooked, factors. First, the formation of crude oil and abundance of naturally occurring hydrocarbons is presented and compared with bacterial ability to not only survive but also to utilize such compounds as an attractive energy source. Then, the significance of nutrient limitation on biomass growth is underlined on the example of a specially designed experiment and discussed in context of bioremediation efficiency. Next, the formation of aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as the role of surfactants for maintaining appropriate C:N:P ratio during initial stages of biodegradation is explained. Finally, a summary of recent scientific reports focused on the removal of hydrocarbon contaminants using bioaugmentation, biostimulation and introduction of surfactants, as well as biosurfactants, is presented. This review was designed to be a comprehensive source of knowledge regarding the unique aspects of hydrocarbon microbiology that may be useful for planning future biodegradation experiments. In addition, it is a starting point for wider debate regarding the limitations and possible improvements of currently employed bioremediation strategies.","authors":[{"name":"Łukasz Ławniczak"},{"name":"Marta Woźniak-Karczewska"},{"name":"Andreas P Loibner"},{"name":"Hermann J Heipieper"},{"name":"Łukasz Chrzanowski"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PAHs"},{"word":"bioaugmentation"},{"word":"biodegradation"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biostimulation"},{"word":"biosurfactants"},{"word":"crude oil"},{"word":"hydrocarbons"},{"word":"marine and terrestrial contamination"},{"word":"nutrient limitation"},{"word":"surfactants"}]},"article150":{"pmid":"32075040","title":"Management of Streptococcus mutans-Candida spp. Oral Biofilms' Infections: Paving the Way for Effective Clinical Interventions.","date":"2020-03-20","abs":"Oral diseases are considered the most common noncommunicable diseases and are related to serious local and systemic disorders. Oral pathogens can grow and spread in the oral mucosae and frequently in biomaterials (e.g., dentures or prostheses) under polymicrobial biofilms, leading to several disorders such as dental caries and periodontal disease. Biofilms harbor a complex array of interacting microbes, increasingly unapproachable to antimicrobials and with dynamic processes key to disease pathogenicity, which partially explain the gradual loss of response towards conventional therapeutic regimens. New drugs (synthesized and natural) and other therapies that have revealed promising results for the treatment or control of these mixed biofilms are presented and discussed here. A structured search of bibliographic databases was applied to include recent research. There are several promising new approaches in the treatment of Candida spp.-Streptococcus mutans oral mixed biofilms that could be clinically applied in the near future.

Here, we sequenced the genomes and conducted phenotypic assays to characterize these Burkholderia isolates. All recovered isolates of the two species fall within monophyletic clades based on phylogenomic trees of conserved single-copy core genes. Within species, the ISS-derived isolates all demonstrate greater than 99% average nucleotide identity (with 95-99% of genomes aligning) and share around 90% of the identified gene clusters from a pangenomic analysis-suggesting that the two groups are each composed of highly similar genomic lineages and their members may have all stemmed from the same two founding populations. The differences that can be observed between the recovered isolates at the pangenomic level are primarily located within putative plasmids. Phenotypically, macrophage intracellularization and lysis occurred at generally similar rates between all ISS-derived isolates, as well as with their respective type-terrestrial strain references. All ISS-derived isolates exhibited antibiotic sensitivity similar to that of the terrestrial reference strains, and minimal differences between isolates were observed. With a few exceptions, biofilm formation rates were generally consistent across each species. And lastly, though isolation date does not necessarily provide any insight into how long a given isolate had been aboard the ISS, none of the assayed physiology correlated with either date of isolation or distances based on nucleotide variation. Overall, we find that while the populations of Burkholderia present in the ISS PWS each maintain virulence, they are likely are not more virulent than those that might be encountered on planet and remain susceptible to clinically used antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Aubrie O'Rourke"},{"name":"Michael D Lee"},{"name":"William C Nierman"},{"name":"R Craig Everroad"},{"name":"Chris L Dupont"}],"keywords":[]},"article155":{"pmid":"32074086","title":"Genetic diversity and biofilm formation analysis of Staphylococcus aureus causing urinary tract infections in Tehran, Iran.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Over the past decades, prevalence of biofilm-forming Staphylococcus aureus strains has significantly increased in urinary tract infections.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and biofilm inhibitory concentration (BIC) of α-humulene for B. fragilis were 2 μg/mL, and the biofilm eradication concentration (Pumbwe et al.) was in the range of 8-32 μg/mL. The XTT reduction assay confirmed that the cellular metabolic activity in biofilm rarely occurred at 8-16 μg/mL concentration. In addition, the biofilm inhibition by α-humulene was also detected via confocal laser scanning microcopy. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was also used to investigate the effect of α-humulene on the expression of resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type multidrug efflux pump (bmeB1 and bmeB3) genes. As a result of qPCR, α-humulene significantly reduced the expression of bmeB1 and bmeB3 genes.

Rather than specifying a certain time frame, a nonunion is better defined as a fracture that will not heal without further intervention.Successful fracture healing depends on local biology, biomechanics and a variety of systemic factors. All components can principally be decisive and determine the classification of atrophic, oligotrophic or hypertrophic nonunions. Treatment prioritizes mechanics before biology.The degree of motion between fracture parts is the key for healing and is described by strain theory. If the change of length at a given load is > 10%, fibrous tissue and not bone is formed. Therefore, simple fractures require absolute and complex fractures relative stability.The main characteristics of a nonunion are pain while weight bearing, and persistent fracture lines on X-ray.Treatment concepts such as 'mechanobiology' or the 'diamond concept' determine the applied osteosynthesis considering soft tissue, local biology and stability. Fine wire circular external fixation is considered the only form of true biologic fixation due to its ability to eliminate parasitic motions while maintaining load-dependent axial stiffness. Nailing provides intramedullary stability and biology via reaming. Plates are successful when complex fractures turn into simple nonunions demanding absolute stability. Despite available alternatives, autograft is the gold standard for providing osteoinductive and osteoconductive stimuli.The infected nonunion remains a challenge. Bacteria, especially staphylococcus species, have developed mechanisms to survive such as biofilm formation, inactive forms and internalization. Therefore, radical debridement and specific antibiotics are necessary prior to reconstruction. Cite this article: EFORT Open Rev 2020;5:46-57.

P. aeruginosa evades antibiotics in bacterial biofilms by up-regulating expression of a symbiotic filamentous inoviral prophage, Pf4. We investigated the mechanism of phage-mediated antibiotic tolerance using biochemical reconstitution combined with structural biology and high-resolution cellular imaging. We resolved electron cryomicroscopy atomic structures of Pf4 with and without its linear single-stranded DNA genome, and studied Pf4 assembly into liquid crystalline droplets using optical microscopy and electron cryotomography. By biochemically replicating conditions necessary for antibiotic protection, we found that phage liquid crystalline droplets form phase-separated occlusive compartments around rod-shaped bacteria leading to increased bacterial survival. Encapsulation by these compartments was observed even when inanimate colloidal rods were used to mimic rod-shaped bacteria, suggesting that shape and size complementarity profoundly influences the process. Filamentous inoviruses are pervasive across prokaryotes, and in particular, several Gram-negative bacterial pathogens including Neisseria meningitidis, Vibrio cholerae, and Salmonella enterica harbor these prophages. We propose that biophysical occlusion mediated by secreted filamentous molecules such as Pf4 may be a general strategy of bacterial survival in harsh environments.","authors":[{"name":"Abul K Tarafder"},{"name":"Andriko von Kügelgen"},{"name":"Adam J Mellul"},{"name":"Ulrike Schulze"},{"name":"Dirk G A L Aarts"},{"name":"Tanmay A M Bharat"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"cryo-EM"},{"word":"phage"},{"word":"phase separation"}]},"article164":{"pmid":"32071223","title":"AB569, a nontoxic chemical tandem that kills major human pathogenic bacteria.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"Antibiotic-resistant superbug bacteria represent a global health problem with no imminent solutions.

Due to their increasing accretion in aquatic environments, as well as resistance towards degradation, marine litter research has focused on microplastics more recently. In the present study, a relatively new method of biodegradation was implemented for the biodegradation of three structurally different MPs i.e. polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Periphytic biofilm was used for this purpose in various backgrounds of carbon sources (glucose, peptone, and glucose and peptone). Biodegradation of MPs was estimated in terms of weight loss. It was observed that the addition of glucose enhanced the biodegradation of MPs by periphyton biofilm for all MPs (from 9.52%-18.02%, 5.95%-14.02% and 13.24-19.72% for PP, PE and PET respectively) after 60 days compared to natural biofilm alone. To the contrary, peptone, and glucose and peptone together, were inhibitory. Biodegradation was further confirmed by morphological changes observed using SEM, FTIR spectra and GPC lent further support to the results whereby new peaks appeared along with reduction in old peaks and decrease in peak intensities. MiSeq sequencing shows that Deinococcus-thermus > Proteobacteria > Cyanobacteria are the dominant phyla in natural biofilms, and their relative abundances increase after the addition of glucose. However, the abundances shifted to Deinococcus-thermus > Cyanobacteria > Firmicutes > Bacteroidetes, when the biofilms were treated with either peptone alone, or with glucose and peptone together. Therefore, the change in biodegradation capability might also be due to the change in the microbial community structures after addition of the C-sources. These experiments provide an innovative approach towards effective biodegradation of MPs using a relatively new environment-friendly method.","authors":[{"name":"Sadaf Shabbir"},{"name":"Muhammad Faheem"},{"name":"Naeem Ali"},{"name":"Philip G Kerr"},{"name":"Long-Fei Wang"},{"name":"Sathishkumar Kuppusamy"},{"name":"Yi Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biodegradation of microplastics"},{"word":"Environment"},{"word":"Glucose"},{"word":"Microplastics"},{"word":"Periphytic biofilms"}]},"article167":{"pmid":"32070544","title":"Chitosan derivatives co-delivering nitric oxide and methicillin for the effective therapy to the methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"We developed a co-delivery system of nitric oxide (NO) and antibiotic for the antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection therapy.

Chronic infections occur in 3%-5% of those infected and S. Typhi persists primarily in the gallbladder by forming biofilms on cholesterol gallstones, but how these bacterial communities evade host immunity is not known. Salmonella biofilms produce several extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) during chronic infection, which are hypothesized to prevent pathogen clearance either by protecting biofilm-associated bacteria from direct humoral attack or by modulating innate phagocyte interaction with biofilms. Using wild-type and EPS-deficient planktonic and biofilm Salmonella, the direct attack hypothesis was tested by challenging biofilms with human serum and antimicrobial peptides. Biofilms were found to be tolerant to these molecules, but these phenotypes were independent of the tested EPSs. By examining macrophage and neutrophil responses, new roles for biofilm-associated capsular polysaccharides and slime polysaccharides were identified. The S.

This is the first study that has harvested bacteria from diabetic foot infections and recreated similar polymicrobial biofilms to those present in vivo for individual subjects. After treatment with levels of gentamicin attained in serum after systemic administration (higher than corresponding tissues concentrations) we measured a 0-2 log reduction in bacterial viability of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus or a polymicrobial biofilm. Conversely, addition of gentamicin loaded calcium sulfate beads resulted in 5-9 log reductions in P. aeruginosa, S aureus and polymicrobial biofilms derived from three subjects.

The fabrication process included surface modification of MPDA with l-Arg and further adsorption of ICG via π-π stacking. Under near-infrared (NIR) exposure, AI-MPDA not only generated heat but also produced reactive oxygen species, causing a cascade catalysis of l-Arg to release nitric oxide (NO). Under NIR irradiation, biofilm elimination was attributed to the NO-enhanced photodynamic therapy and low-temperature PTT (≤45 °C). Notably, the NIR-triggered all-in-one strategy resulted in severe destruction of bacterial membranes. The phototherapeutic AI-MPDA also displayed good cytocompatibility. NIR-irradiated AI-MPDA nanoparticles not only prevented bacterial colonization but also realized a rapid recovery of infected wounds.

To shed light on the precise relationships across the respective type strains and the novel fungiphiles, we here compare their genomic and ecophysiological features. To reach this goal, the genomes of the three type strains, with sizes ranging from 9.0 to 11.5 Mb, were de novo sequenced and the high-quality genomes analyzed. Using whole-genome, ribosomal RNA and marker-gene-concatenate analyses, close relationships between P. hospita DSM 17164T and P. terrae DSM 17804T, versus more remote relationships to P. caribensis DSM 13236T were found. All four fungiphilic strains clustered closely to the two-species cluster. Analyses of average nucleotide identities (ANIm) and tetranucleotide frequencies (TETRA) confirmed the close relationships between P. hospita DSM 17164T and P. terrae DSM 17804T (ANIm = 95.42; TETRA = 0.99784), as compared to the similarities of each one of these strains to P. caribensis DSM 13236T. A species cluster was thus proposed. Furthermore, high similarities of the fungiphilic strains BS001, BS007, BS110 and BS437 with this cluster were found, indicating that these strains also make part of it, being closely linked to P. hospita DSM 17164T (ANIm = 99%; TETRA = 0.99). We propose to coin this cluster the P. hospita species cluster (containing P. hospita DSM 17164T, P. terrae DSM 17804T and strains BS001, BS007, BS110 and BS437), being clearly divergent from the closely related species P. caribiensis (type strain DSM 13236T). Moreover, given their close relatedness to P. hospita DSM 17164T within the cluster, we propose to rename the four fungiphilic strains as members of P. hospita. Analysis of migratory behavior along with fungal growth through soil revealed both P. terrae DSM 17804T and P. hospita DSM 17164T (next to the four fungiphilic strains) to be migration-proficient, whereas P. caribensis DSM 13236T was a relatively poor migrator. Examination of predicted functions across the genomes of the seven investigated strains, next to several selected additional ones, revealed the common presence of features in the P. hospita cluster strains that are potentially important in interactions with soil fungi.

Unfortunately, there is no generally accepted in vitro method for quantitatively evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of contact-active non-leachable antimicrobial surfaces. Moreover, guidelines of generally accepted international industrial standards do not reflect the basic principle of bacterial contamination and/or are performed in the presence of a solid covering material. Therefore, in the present study, six bacterial adherence tests on non-porous surfaces with no covering material were compared with respect to their efficacy and reproducibility, as well as to evaluate the bactericidal contact-killing of relevant device-associated slime-producing bacteria using antimicrobially coated Ti6Al4V surfaces with positively-charged poly(hexamethylene biguanide) hydrochloride (PHMB). After direct bacterial inoculation to simulate a perioperative infection, non-leaching PHMB reacts bactericidally against the slime-producing bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after surface contact. The 6-h drop technique was found to be a suitable method to quantitatively evaluate contact-active antibacterial surfaces. Adjunctively, however, damage of bacterial membrane integrity should be confirmed by LIVE/DEAD staining and the presence of non-leaching agents. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Unintentional perioperative bacterial adhesion to implant surfaces can generate biomaterial-associated infections. Adhered bacteria produce biofilms that protect them from antibiotic attack, which may be complicated by possible antibiotic resistance. Polycationic surfaces can prevent such unwanted biofilm formation by killing bacteria upon initial contact. Unfortunately, no reliable in vitro methods exist to evaluate the efficacy of contact-active antimicrobial surfaces. In this study, we show that the 6-h drop technique may be a suitable method to evaluate positively-charged contact-killing surfaces. Identification of suitable screening assays for evaluating the bactericidal efficacy of non-leachable antimicrobial agents will greatly improve this newly developing field as a prophylactic alternative to postoperative treatment of implant-associated infections by antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Melanie Hornschuh"},{"name":"Paula Zwicker"},{"name":"Thomas Schmidt"},{"name":"Axel Kramer"},{"name":"Gerald Müller"}],"keywords":[]},"article185":{"pmid":"32067957","title":"In vivo demonstration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms as independent pharmacological microcompartments.","date":"2020-02-18","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is difficult to eradicate from the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients due to biofilm formation.

To minimise confounding factors, test sections were chosen with comparable daily hydraulic regimes, physical dimensions, and all connected straight of a common trunk main and within close proximity, hence similar water chemistry, pressure and age. Taxonomical results showed differences in colonising communities between pipe materials, with several genera, including the bacteria Pseudomonas and the fungi Cladosporium, present in every sample. Diverse bacterial communities dominated compared to more homogeneous fungal, or mycobiome, community distribution. The analysis of bacterial/fungal networks based on relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) indicated microbial communities from cast iron pipes were more stable than communities from the non-ferrous pipe materials. Novel analysis of functional traits between all samples were found to be mainly associated to mobile genetic elements that play roles in determining links between cells, including phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids. The use of functional traits can be considered for development in future surveillance methods, capable of delivering network condition information beyond that of limited conventional faecal indicator tests, that will help protect water quality and public health.","authors":[{"name":"I Douterelo"},{"name":"B E Dutilh"},{"name":"K Arkhipova"},{"name":"C Calero"},{"name":"S Husband"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Discolouration"},{"word":"Drinking water"},{"word":"Functional traits"},{"word":"Fungi-bacteria"},{"word":"Mobile genetic elements"}]},"article195":{"pmid":"32065934","title":"Hyperbaric oxygen treatment: A complementary treatment modality of Modic changes?","date":"2020-03-18","abs":"Modic changes (MCs) have attracted great interest in recent years. The complex process of MC development and progression seems to involve interplay between mechanical, infective, inflammatory, and degenerative processes that cannot be clearly differentiated. Based on signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans, MCs can be divided three types: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Predominantly Type 1 MCs are commonly associated with chronic low back pain that is unresponsive to classic treatment options. Infection with low-virulent anaerobic microorganisms, most commonly Propionibacterium acnes, has been implicated in MC development following a disc herniation when a tear enables bacteria to enter the disc. Recent studies in patients with chronic low back pain following a lumbar disc herniation associated with Type 1 MCs have reported promising results following prolonged systemic antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, as primary or adjuvant treatment in association combination with systemic antibiotics or anti-inflammatory therapy, could offer important advantages in treating patients with suspected low-virulent disc infections due to anaerobic microorganisms associated with Type 1 MCs. We believe that hyperbaric oxygenation could contribute to faster resolution of Type 1 MCs and associated pain through multiple effects-including direct antimicrobial effects through formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), altering the favorable low oxygen tension milieu such that it becomes unfavorable for bacterial growth and survival, and anti-biofilm effects. Additionally, hyperbaric oxygenation could contribute to faster pain resolution via direct and indirect anti-inflammatory effects. As an adjuvant treatment administered in combination with systemic antibiotics, HBOT could increase the sensitivity of Propionibacterium acnes to antimicrobial drugs under hyperoxic conditions, resulting in faster MC resolution. Overall, the faster infection resolution, diminished bacterial load, and anti-inflammatory effects due to reduced cytokine expression and levels of infectious by-products could lead to faster pain resolution following HBOT, and a significant improvement of quality of life in these patients.","authors":[{"name":"Tanja Batinac"},{"name":"Vlatka Sotošek"},{"name":"Toni Valković"},{"name":"Lari Gorup"},{"name":"Mario Franolić"},{"name":"Igor Barković"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial infection"},{"word":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy"},{"word":"Modic changes"},{"word":"Propionibacterium acnes"}]},"article196":{"pmid":"32065887","title":"Alpine headwaters emerging from glaciers and rock glaciers host different bacterial communities: Ecological implications for the future.","date":"2020-03-24","abs":"Mountain glacier shrinkage represents a major effect of the current global warming and 80-100% of the Alpine glaciers are predicted to vanish within the next few decades. As the thawing rate of mountain permafrost ice is much lower than for glacier ice, a shift from glacial to periglacial dynamics is predicted for Alpine landscapes during the 21st century. Despite the growing literature on the impacts of deglaciation on Alpine hydrology and ecosystems, chemical and biological features of waters emerging from Alpine rock glaciers (i.e. permafrost landforms composed by a mixture of ice and debris) have been poorly investigated so far, and knowledge on microbial biodiversity of headwaters is still sparse. A set of glacier-, rock glacier- and groundwater/precipitation-fed streams was investigated in the Italian Central Alps in late summer 2016, aiming at exploring bacterial community composition and diversity in epilithic and surface sediment biofilm and at verifying the hypothesis that rock glacier-fed headwaters represent peculiar ecosystems from both a chemical and biological point of view. Rock glacier-fed waters showed high values of electrical conductivity and trace elements related to their bedrock lithology, and their highly diverse bacterial assemblages significantly differed from those detected in glacier-fed streams. Bacterial taxonomic composition appeared to be mainly related to water and substrate type, as well as to water chemistry, the latter including concentrations of nutrients and trace metals. The results of this study confirm the chemical and biological peculiarity of rock glacier-fed waters compared to glacial waters, and suggest a potential driving role of thawing permafrost in modulating future ecological traits of Alpine headwaters within the context of progressing deglaciation.","authors":[{"name":"Monica Tolotti"},{"name":"Leonardo Cerasino"},{"name":"Claudio Donati"},{"name":"Massimo Pindo"},{"name":"Michela Rogora"},{"name":"Roberto Seppi"},{"name":"Davide Albanese"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alpine headwaters"},{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Biodiversity"},{"word":"Glacier"},{"word":"Rock glacier"},{"word":"Water chemistry"}]},"article197":{"pmid":"32065821","title":"The Antibiotic sensitivity of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in a 5-year period and investigation of clonal outbreak with PFGE.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which is able to form a biofilm, has mostly been related to catheters when it is the agent in hospital infections; these infections generally present as bacteremia and pneumonia, which may progress with complications and result in death.","authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Çalışkan"},{"name":"Ayşegül Çopur Çicek"},{"name":"Nebahat Aydogan Ejder"},{"name":"Alper Karagöz"},{"name":"Özlem Kirişci"},{"name":"Selçuk Kılıç"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PFGE"},{"word":"Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis"},{"word":"antibiotic sensitivity"},{"word":"clonal outbreak"}]},"article198":{"pmid":"32065820","title":"Biocide susceptibilities and biofilm-forming capacities of Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates from Malaysia.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative nosocomial pathogen that has the capacity to develop resistance to all classes of antimicrobial compounds.

The present protocol describes a confocal microscopy-based method to monitor pH dynamics inside cross-kingdom biofilms comprising Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans. The pH-dependent dual-emission spectrum and the staining properties of the ratiometric probe C-SNARF-4 are exploited to determine drops in pH in extracellular areas of the biofilms. Use of pH ratiometry with the probe requires a meticulous choice of imaging parameters, a thorough calibration of the dye, and careful, threshold-based post-processing of the image data. When used correctly, the technique allows for the rapid assessment of extracellular pH in different areas of a biofilm and thus the monitoring of both horizontal and vertical pH gradients over time. While the use of confocal microscopy limits Z-profiling to thin biofilms of 75 µm or less, the use of pH ratiometry is ideally suited for the noninvasive study of an important virulence factor in cross-kingdom biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Schlafer"},{"name":"Mathilde Frost Kristensen"}],"keywords":[]},"article200":{"pmid":"32065088","title":"Activity of Metal-Azole Complexes against Biofilms of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata.","date":"2020-02-17","abs":"Onychomycosis is a chronic nail infection caused by fungi frequently resistant to antifungal treatments.

Data show that the number of attached S. thermosulfidooxidans on pyrite increases, if the pyrite had been pre-colonized by living biofilms of L. ferriphilum, while it decreases if the pre-colonized biofilms had been inactivated.

Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the inoculum and metabolites produced by L. fermentum TcUESC01 against S. mutans UA159. For this, a growth curve of L. fermentum was performed and both the inoculum and the metabolites formed in the fermentation were tested against the growth of S. mutans UA159 in agar diffusion tests, and only its metabolites were tested to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration, minimal bactericidal concentration and inhibition of cell adhesion. Inhibition of biofilm formation, pH drop and proton permeability were also tested with the metabolites. The zone of inhibition began to be formed at 14 h and continued until 16 h. The inoculum containing L. fermentum also showed zone of inhibition. The MIC for the metabolites was 1280 mg/mL and the MBC was obtained with a concentration higher than the MIC equal to 5120 mg/mL. Half of the MIC concentration (640 mg/mL) was required to inhibit S. mutans adhesion to the surface of the microplates.

Attempts to optimize biofilm eradication protocols for four alkaline, two acidic, and one enzymatic cleaning agent, in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations, were evaluated. Increased concentrations, the number of subsequent treatments, the exposure times, and the temperatures of the C&D agents provided between 4.0 and >5.5 log reductions in colony forming units (CFU) for seven-day-old L. monocytogenes biofilms.

The hydrophobicity was also modulated through conjugation of different long chain fatty acids with the central secondary amino group of the triamine. Molecules with constant backbone hydrophobicity displayed an enhanced antibacterial activity and decreased hemolytic activity upon increasing the side chain hydrophobicity of amino acids. On the other hand, increased hydrophobicity in the backbone introduced a slight hemolytic activity but a higher increment in antibacterial activity, resulting in better selective antibacterial compounds.

We found that inactivation of luxS caused a marked decrease in biofilm formation, hemolytic activity, antiphagocytosis and intracellular survival of S. agalactiae.

Further investigation indicated that high levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 could be induced in macrophages co-incubated with the luxS deletion mutant and synthetic AI-2, single or combined. Also, the results of tilapia infection showed that inactivation of luxS significantly decreased the virulence of S. agalactiae but upregulated the expression of cytokines in spleens and brains. Increased proinflammatory effects of the luxS mutant were restored in the luxS complemented strain but could not be restored by AI-2 addition.

Cyc8p could thus modulate cell adhesion in different niches, dependently on environmental glucose level, e.g., high-glucose blood versus low-glucose tissues in host organisms.","authors":[{"name":"Phu Van Nguyen"},{"name":"Vítězslav Plocek"},{"name":"Libuše Váchová"},{"name":"Zdena Palková"}],"keywords":[]},"article238":{"pmid":"32054068","title":"Antimicrobial Activity of Host-Derived Lipids.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Host-derived lipids are increasingly recognized as antimicrobial molecules that function in innate immune activities along with antimicrobial peptides. Sphingoid bases and fatty acids found on the skin, in saliva and other body fluids, and on all mucosal surfaces, including oral mucosa, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and reduce inflammation in animal models. Multiple studies demonstrate that the antimicrobial activity of lipids is both specific and selective. There are indications that the site of action of antimicrobial fatty acids is the bacterial membrane, while the long-chain bases may inhibit cell wall synthesis as well as interacting with bacterial membranes. Research in this area, although still sporadic, has slowly increased in the last few decades; however, we still have much to learn about antimicrobial lipid mechanisms of activity and their potential use in novel drugs or topical treatments. One important potential benefit for the use of innate antimicrobial lipids (AMLs) as antimicrobial agents is the decreased likelihood side effects with treatment. Multiple studies report that endogenous AML treatments do not induce damage to cells or tissues, often decrease inflammation, and are active against biofilms. The present review summarizes the history of antimicrobial lipids from the skin surface, including both fatty acids and sphingoid bases, in multiple human body systems and summarizes their relative activity against various microorganisms. The range of antibacterial activities of lipids present at the skin surface and in saliva is presented. Some observations relevant to mechanisms of actions are discussed, but are largely still unknown. Multiple recent studies examine the therapeutic and prophylactic uses of AMLs. Although these lipids have been repeatedly demonstrated to act as innate effector molecules, they are not yet widely accepted as such. These compiled data further support fatty acid and sphingoid base inclusion as innate effector molecules.","authors":[{"name":"Carol L Fischer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"antimicrobial lipids"},{"word":"fatty acids"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"sphingoid bases"}]},"article239":{"pmid":"32054067","title":"Gram-Negative Bacterial Lysins.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Antibiotics have had a profound impact on human society by enabling the eradication of otherwise deadly infections. Unfortunately, antibiotic use and overuse has led to the rapid spread of acquired antibiotic resistance, creating a major threat to public health. Novel therapeutic agents called bacteriophage endolysins (lysins) provide a solution to the worldwide epidemic of antibiotic resistance. Lysins are a class of enzymes produced by bacteriophages during the lytic cycle, which are capable of cleaving bonds in the bacterial cell wall, resulting in the death of the bacteria within seconds after contact. Through evolutionary selection of the phage progeny to be released and spread, these lysins target different critical components in the cell wall, making resistance to these molecules orders of magnitude less likely than conventional antibiotics. Such properties make lysins uniquely suitable for the treatment of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. Lysins, either naturally occurring or engineered, have the potential of being developed into fast-acting, narrow-spectrum, biofilm-disrupting antimicrobials that act synergistically with standard of care antibiotics. This review focuses on newly discovered classes of Gram-negative lysins with emphasis on prototypical enzymes that have been evaluated for efficacy against the major antibiotic resistant organisms causing nosocomial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Chandrabali Ghose"},{"name":"Chad W Euler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acinetobacter"},{"word":"E.coli"},{"word":"ESKAPE"},{"word":"Gram-negative"},{"word":"Klebsiella"},{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"endolysins"},{"word":"lysins"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"32053733","title":"The antibiofilm and collagen-stabilizing effects of proanthocyanidin as an auxiliary endodontic irrigant.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"To evaluate the antibiofilm effect of proanthocyanidin (PA) solution as an irrigant against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and its influence on the mechanical properties and biodegradation resistance of demineralized root dentine.","authors":[{"name":"S Y Yang"},{"name":"Y Liu"},{"name":"J Mao"},{"name":"Y B Wu"},{"name":"Y L Deng"},{"name":"S C Qi"},{"name":"Y C Zhou"},{"name":"S Q Gong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"antibacterial activity"},{"word":"dentine"},{"word":"endodontic irrigant"},{"word":"proanthocyanidin"}]},"article241":{"pmid":"32053506","title":"Antibiotic resistance, virulence factors and genotyping of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in public hospitals of northeastern Mexico.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the second most prevalent opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections in Mexico.

Vancomycin gradually degraded from dual carrier-v and PMMA-v up to about 8 and 6 weeks, respectively. At different elution time points, the inhibition zones of the dual carrier-v were larger than the inhibition zones of the PMMA-v (P < 0.05). The colony inhibition rate of the dual carrier-v was 95.57%, whereas it was 77.87% for PMMA-v. Scanning electron microscopy was used to demonstrate biofilm formation on the surface of plates treated with vancomycin-unloaded PMMA, whereas there was no biofilm formation on the surface of plates treated with dual carrier-v or PMMA-v. The dual carrier-v was more effective at antibacterial adhesion at each time point after immersion in simulated body fluid as compared with PMMA-v (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our results suggest that the dual carrier-v can release higher concentrations of antibiotics and inhibit bacteria growth more effectively in vitro as compared with PMMA-v.

The study aimed to investigate the potential usage of the EPF biosurfactant in the eradication of an ex vivo biofilm of Microsporum canis (M. canis) for the first time. An entomopathogenic fungus was isolated from the fungal-infected Vespa orientalis wasp and identified as Beauveria bassiana (MN173375). Chemical characterization revealed the lipopeptide nature of the B. bassiana biosurfactant (BBLP). Efficient antifungal and antibiofilm activities of BBLP against M. canis in vitro were detected. An ex vivo hair model was used to investigate the efficiency of BBLP against M. canis biofilm, in a scenario close to the in vivo conditions. M. canisex vivo biofilm eradication was confirmed in stereo, scanning electron, and fluorescent images. Also, the ex vivo biofilm was less susceptible to BBLP treatment compared to its in vitro counterpart. In conclusion, BBLP showed significant eradication to the M. canisex vivo biofilm and open horizons to use bio-resource derived from EPF in controlling microbial biofilm and holding great promise for combating recalcitrant dermatophytosis.","authors":[{"name":"Marwa M Abdel-Aziz"},{"name":"Mohsen S Al-Omar"},{"name":"Hamdoon A Mohammed"},{"name":"Tamer M Emam"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Microsporum canis"},{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"biosurfactant"},{"word":"dermatophytes"},{"word":"entomopathogenic fungi"},{"word":"ex vivo biofilm"},{"word":"lipopeptide"}]},"article257":{"pmid":"32050392","title":"Bioavailability of clay-adsorbed dioxin to Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 and its associated genome-wide shifts in gene expression.","date":"2020-02-13","abs":"Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans are a group of chemically-related pollutants categorically known as dioxins. Some of their chlorinated congeners are among the most hazardous pollutants that persist in the environment. This persistence is due in part to the limited number of bacteria capable of metabolizing these compounds, but also to their limited bioavailability in soil. We used Sphingomonas wittichii strain RW1 (RW1), one of the few strains able to grow on dioxin, to characterize its ability to respond to and degrade clay-bound dioxin. We found that RW1 grew on and completely degraded dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD) intercalated into the smectite clay saponite (SAP). To characterize the effects of DD sorption on RW1 gene expression, we compared transcriptomes of RW1 grown with either free crystalline DD or DD intercalated clay, i.e. sandwiched between the clay interlayers (DDSAP). Free crystalline DD appeared to cause greater expression of toxicity and stress related functions. Genes coding for heat shock proteins, chaperones, as well as genes involved in DNA repair, and efflux were up-regulated during growth on crystalline dioxin compared to growth on intercalated dioxin. In contrast, growth on intercalated dioxin up-regulated genes that might be important in recognition and uptake mechanisms, as well as surface interaction/attachment/biofilm formation such as extracellular solute-binding protein and LuxR. These differences in gene expression may reflect the underlying adaptive mechanisms by which RW1 cells sense and deploy pathways to access dioxin intercalated into clay. These data show that intercalated DD remains bioavailable to the degrading bacterium with implications for bioremediation alternatives.","authors":[{"name":"Benli Chai"},{"name":"Tamara Tsoi"},{"name":"J Brett Sallach"},{"name":"Cun Liu"},{"name":"Jeff Landgraf"},{"name":"Mark Bezdek"},{"name":"Gerben Zylstra"},{"name":"Hui Li"},{"name":"Cliff T Johnston"},{"name":"Brian J Teppen"},{"name":"James R Cole"},{"name":"Stephen A Boyd"},{"name":"James M Tiedje"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bioavailability"},{"word":"Clay-adsorbed"},{"word":"Dioxin"},{"word":"Sphingomonas wittichii"},{"word":"Toxicity"},{"word":"Transcriptome"}]},"article258":{"pmid":"32050387","title":"The effect of supporting matrix on sludge granulation under low hydraulic shear force: Performance, microbial community dynamics and microorganisms migration.","date":"2020-02-13","abs":"Granular sludge usually takes extracellular polymers (EPS) as matrices for colonizing microorganisms and maintaining structural stability.

This activation is controlled by a small number of inputs that are sensitive to growth phase: extracellular pyruvate, glucose, and molecular oxygen. Activation of lrgA appears to be self-limiting, so that strong expression of lrgA is confined to a short interval of time. lrgA is programmed to switch on briefly at the end of exponential growth, as glucose and molecular oxygen are exhausted and extracellular pyruvate is available.

Bacterial biofilm has been mediated to non-malignant pathologies like inflammatory bowel disease but has not been fully documented in the setting of colorectal cancer. The investigation has currently found that bacterial biofilm is mediated to colon cancer in the human and linked to the location of human cancer, with almost all right-sided adenomas of colon cancers possessing bacterial biofilm, whilst left-sided cancer is rarely biofilm positive.

In the present study, the isolate KTMA4 showed the highest inhibition against major phytopathogens of tomato; Fusarium oxysporum (66%) and Alternaria solani (54%) after seven days of incubation. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the isolate KTMA4 is Bacillus cereus (MG547975). The isolate produced in vitro plants growth-promoting factors such as Indole-3-acetic acid, ammonia, catalase, siderophore and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase and it has nitrogen fixation ability. The bacterial strain has also produced lytic enzymes such as amylase, cellulase, xylanase, lipase, and protease. Moreover, the bacterium Bacillus cereus KTMA4 effectively produced biofilm, biosurfactants and salt-tolerant (5% NaCl). The bacterium exhibited intrinsic antibiotic resistance. The in vivo studies using tomato plants grown from seeds treated with the bacterial strain KTMA4 demonstrated an enhancement in seed germination percentage (86.66 ± 2.88) and vigour index (637.5 ± 21.65) over the uninoculated control (germination percentage- 28.33 ± 2.88 and vigour index- 42.5 ± 4.33). 60 days of greenhouse study revealed that the bacterial isolate enhanced the plant growth significantly (P ≤ 0.05) compared to the uninoculated control and the treated plants.

The definition is subjective and operational: not every biofilm causes biofouling - only if a given a subjective threshold of interference is exceeded, biofilms cause technical or medical problems. These range from the formation of slime layers on ship hulls or in pipelines, which increase friction resistance, to separation membranes, on which biofilms increase hydraulic resistance, to heat exchangers where they interfere with heat transport to contamination of treated water by eroded biofilm cells which may comprise hygienically relevant microorganisms, and, most dangerous, to biofilms on implants and catheters which can cause persistent infections. The largest fraction of anti-fouling research, usually in short-term experiments, is focused on prevention or limiting primary microbial adhesion. Intuitively, this appears only logical, but turns out mostly hopeless. This is because in technical systems with open access for microorganisms, all surfaces are colonized sooner or later which explains the very limited success of that research. As a result, the use of biocides remains the major tool to fight persistent biofilms. However, this is costly in terms of biocides, it stresses working materials, causes off-time and environmental damage and it usually leaves large parts of biofilms in place, ready for regrowth. In order to really solve biofouling problems, it is necessary to learn how to live with biofilms and mitigate their detrimental effects. This requires rather an integrated strategy than aiming to invent one-shot solutions. In this context, it helps to understand the biofilm way of life as a natural phenomenon. Biofilms are the oldest, most successful and most widely distributed form of life on earth, existing even in extreme environments and being highly resilient. Microorganisms in biofilms live in a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which allows them to develop emerging properties such as enhanced nutrient acquisition, synergistic microconsortia, enhanced tolerance to biocides and antibiotics, intense intercellular communication and cooperation. Transiently immobilized, biofilm organisms turn their matrix into an external digestion system by retaining complexed exoenzymes in the matrix. Biofilms grow even on traces of any biodegradable material, therefore, an effective anti-fouling strategy comprises to keep the system low in nutrients (good housekeeping), employing low-fouling, easy-to-clean surfaces, monitoring of biofilm development, allowing for early intervention, and acknowledging that cleaning can be more important than trying to kill biofilms, because cleaning does not cut the nutrient supply of survivors and dead biomass serves as an additional carbon source for cannibalizing survivors, supporting rapid after growth. An integrated concept is presented as the result of a long journey of the author through biofouling problems.","authors":[{"name":"Hans-Curt Flemming"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-fouling"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Holistic approach"}]},"article288":{"pmid":"32044595","title":"Electromagnetic fields for biofouling mitigation in reclaimed water distribution systems.","date":"2020-03-28","abs":"Biofouling is ubiquitous in reclaimed water distribution systems and causes various industrial, economic, and health issues.

The obtained results revealed that EMF treatment significantly changed the bacterial communities and reduced their diversities in biofilm by affecting water quality parameters. Network analysis results indicated that EMFs were detrimental to the co-occurrence patterns of mutualistic relationships among bacterial species, destroyed the connectivity and complexity of the networks, and inhibited biofilm formation [decreased total biomass and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content]. EMF treatment could also decrease the deposition of mineral precipitates, reducing the carbonate and silicate content in biofilm. The decrease of EPS content appeared to reduce biofilm-induced mineral crystallization, while the ion precipitations accelerated by EMFs caused an erosive effect on biofilm. The results demonstrated that EMF treatment is an effective, chemical-free, and anti-biofouling treatment method with great potential for biofouling control in reclaimed water distribution systems.","authors":[{"name":"Yang Xiao"},{"name":"Youngwoo Seo"},{"name":"Yufei Lin"},{"name":"Lei Li"},{"name":"Tahir Muhammad"},{"name":"Changjian Ma"},{"name":"Yunkai Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biofouling control"},{"word":"Electromagnetic field"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Mineral precipitation"}]},"article289":{"pmid":"32044469","title":"Design and use of model membranes to study biomolecular interactions using complementary surface-sensitive techniques.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Cellular membranes are complex structures and simplified analogues in the form of model membranes or biomembranes are used as platforms to understand fundamental properties of the membrane itself as well as interactions with various biomolecules such as drugs, peptides and proteins.

Our results indicate that there is a significant decrease in total biofilm formation by S.mutans exposed to a casein protein mixture in a mono-species culture, whereas, in the co-culture with B. subtilis, an inhibitory effect of the caseins mixture on S.mutans biofilm formation was observed. Proteolytic activity analysis suggested that B. subtilis is capable of breaking down milk proteins, especially κ-casein, which enables biofilm formation by S.mutans in the presence of milk caseins. Therefore, these findings may challenge the assumption that milk is caries-safe, especially in a complex microbial environment.","authors":[{"name":"Danielle Duanis-Assaf"},{"name":"Eli Kenan"},{"name":"Ronit Sionov"},{"name":"Doron Steinberg"},{"name":"Moshe Shemesh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"milk caseins"}]},"article304":{"pmid":"32041294","title":"Inactivation of L. monocytogenes and S. typhimurium Biofilms by Means of an Air-Based Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) System.","date":"2020-03-22","abs":"Previous (biofilm) inactivation studies using Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) focused on helium (with or without the addition of oxygen) as feeding gas since this proved to result in a stable and uniform plasma.

In turn, in human biotopes there are optimal conditions for the implementation of biofilm-forming activity. Moreover, in medical practice, polymeric materials are often used for drainage or prosthetics, which can also be successfully colonized by bacteria. However, in laboratory practice, the formation of biofilms is usually evaluated on glass or polystyrene. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the methodological features of studying the biofilm-forming activity of microorganisms on the surface of synthetic polymeric materials. We used strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli K-12, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, as well as synthetic polymeric materials - DentLight Flow light-curing composite material (nano-hybrid fluid composite; Russia), glass ionomer chemical curing Fuji 1 (Japan), cement for temporary fixation of orthopedic constructions TempBond NE (USA), acrylic, polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride. The formation of biofilms in flat-bottomed ELISA plates in this study was considered as a control group. If the polymer belonged to cold curing materials, sterile flat-bottomed tablets were used, the bottom of which was filled with a thin layer of plastic. After hardening of the plastic, biofilms were formed in the tablets. In the second series of experiments, hot cured materials cut into equal parts 5×5×1 mm in size were placed in the wells of a plate and again used to determine biofilm formation with subsequent coloring. To extract the dye, the pieces were transferred to a new plate to exclude the amount of film biomass formed on the walls of the plate wells. In both cases, cultivation was carried out at 37° C for 24-48 hours. The biomass of the film was stained with fuchsin. Statistical data processing was performed using t-Student criterion. For the threshold level of significance, the value p <0.05 was taken. It is established that the proposed options for determining biofilm forming ability are available and indicative. It was revealed that the same microorganisms have individual biofilm formation indicators for each polymer material. The light curing dental composite and polyvinyl chloride exhibit the more pronounced antiadhesive properties than cements and polyurethane. Up to date, most of the studies of biofilm formation have been carried out using glass or polystyrene, which, as a rule, are not used for the manufacture of prostheses, catheters, drains, etc., which makes it difficult to assess the true film-forming activity of microorganisms. The proposed methodological approaches, especially the second option for preparing testing samples, solve this problem. In general, the proposed approaches to testing biofilm-forming activity on polymers are very simple to implement and generally available. For an adequate study of the biofilms formation, it will be advisable to use polymer materials, directly used in medicine, rather than polystyrene tablets, the material of which is found exclusively in laboratory practice.","authors":[{"name":"A P Godovalov"},{"name":"M S Stepanov"},{"name":"M V Yakovlev"},{"name":"E E Kobzarenko"},{"name":"K A Batog"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm-forming activity"},{"word":"biomass of the film"},{"word":"conditionally pathogenic microorganisms"},{"word":"polymeric materials"}]},"article309":{"pmid":"32040467","title":"Metagenomic investigation of bacteria associated with dental lesions: a cross-sectional study.","date":"2020-02-28","abs":"Dental caries is considered as one of the most significant global health problem over the world.

Globin coupled sensors (GCSs) are a family of heme proteins that regulate diverse functions in response to O2 levels, including modulating synthesis of cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), a bacterial second messenger that regulates biofilm formation. While GCS proteins have been demonstrated to regulate O2-dependent pathways, the mechanism by which the O2 binding event is transmitted from the globin domain to the cyclase domain is unknown. Using chemical cross-linking and subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, diguanylate cyclase (DGC)-containing GCS proteins from Bordetella pertussis (BpeGReg) and Pectobacterium carotovorum (PccGCS) have been demonstrated to form direct interactions between the globin domain and a middle domain π-helix. Additionally, mutation of the π-helix caused major changes in oligomerization and loss of DGC activity. Furthermore, results from assays with isolated globin and DGC domains found that DGC activity is affected by the cognate globin domain, indicating unique interactions between output domain and cognate globin sensor. Based on these studies a compact GCS structure, which depends on the middle domain π-helix for orienting the three domains, is needed for DGC activity and allows for direct sensor domain interactions with both middle and output domains to transmit the O2 binding signal. The insights from the present study improve our understanding of DGC regulation and provide insight into GCS signaling that may lead to the ability to rationally control O2-dependent GCS activity.","authors":[{"name":"Johnnie A Walker"},{"name":"Yuqi Wu"},{"name":"Jacob R Potter"},{"name":"Emily E Weinert"}],"keywords":[{"word":"diguanylate cyclase"},{"word":"globin"},{"word":"heme"},{"word":"oxygen sensing"},{"word":"signaling protein"}]},"article312":{"pmid":"32039189","title":"Effects of Low Frequency-Low Voltage Alternating Electric Current on Apoptosis Progression in Bioelectrical Reactor Biofilm.","date":"2020-02-14","abs":"Bioelectrochemical systems have undergone several modifications to promote the enzymes or pathways used to reduce the energy required for microbial metabolism.

However, limited BAR loading and nanoparticle retention in the oral cavity can result in inadequate release and efficaciousness. Given this, an effective delivery platform that can release concentrations of BAR suitable for twice-daily applications, may offer an alternative that enhances loading, ease of administration, and retention in the oral cavity. With this in mind, the study objectives were to develop and characterize a rapid-release platform, composed of polymeric electrospun fibers (EFs) that encapsulate BAR, and to evaluate fiber safety and functionality against P. gingivalis/S. gordonii biofilms in vitro. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), and polycaprolactone (PCL) were electrospun alone or blended with polyethylene oxide (PEO), to provide high BAR loading and rapid-release. The most promising formulation, 10:90 PLGA:PEO EFs, provided 95% BAR release after 4 h, dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm formation (IC50 = 1.3 μM), disruption of established dual-species biofilms (IC50 = 2 μM), and maintained high cell viability.

Objectives The present study compared the efficacy of oral care products and cannabinoids in reducing the bacterial content of dental plaques. Methods Sixty adults aged 18 to 45 years were categorized into six groups based on the Dutch periodontal screening index. Dental plaques of the adults were collected using paro-toothpick sticks and spread on two Petri dishes, each with four divisions. On Petri dish-A, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), and cannabigerol (CBG) were used, and on Petri dish-B, cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), Oral B, Colgate, and Cannabite F (a toothpaste formulation of pomegranate and algae) were used. The Petri dishes were sealed and incubated, followed by counting the number of colonies. Results By evaluating the colony count of the dental bacteria isolated from six groups, it was found that cannabinoids were more effective in reducing the bacterial colony count in dental plaques as compared to the well-established synthetic oral care products such as Oral B and Colgate.

It is responsible for a wide variety of infections, some of which are associated with biofilm production, such as implanted medical device infections or endocarditis. However, little is known about S. lugdunensis regulation of virulence factor expression. Two-component regulatory systems (TCS) play a critical role in bacterial adaptation, survival, and virulence. Among them, LytSR is widely conserved but has variable roles in different organisms, all connected to metabolism or cell death and lysis occurring during biofilm development. Therefore, we investigated here the functions of LytSR in S. lugdunensis pathogenesis. Deletion of lytSR in S. lugdunensis DSM 4804 strain did not alter either susceptibility to Triton X-100 induced autolysis or death induced by antibiotics targeting cell wall synthesis. Interestingly, ΔlytSR biofilm was characterized by a lower biomass, a lack of tower structures, and a higher rate of dead cells compared to the wild-type strain. Virulence toward Caenorhabditis elegans using a slow-killing assay was significantly reduced for the mutant compared to the wild-type strain. By contrast, the deletion of lytSR had no effect on the cytotoxicity of S. lugdunensis toward the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Transcriptional analyses conducted at mid- and late-exponential phases showed that lytSR deletion affected the expression of 286 genes. Most of them were involved in basic functions such as the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. Furthermore, LytSR appeared to be involved in the regulation of genes encoding known or putative virulence and colonization factors, including the fibrinogen-binding protein Fbl, the major autolysin AtlL, and the type VII secretion system. Overall, our data suggest that the LytSR TCS is implicated in S. lugdunensis pathogenesis, through its involvement in biofilm formation and potentially by the control of genes encoding putative virulence factors.","authors":[{"name":"Sandrine Dahyot"},{"name":"Virginie Oxaran"},{"name":"Maïté Niepceron"},{"name":"Eddy Dupart"},{"name":"Stéphanie Legris"},{"name":"Laurie Destruel"},{"name":"Jennifer Didi"},{"name":"Thomas Clamens"},{"name":"Olivier Lesouhaitier"},{"name":"Yasmine Zerdoumi"},{"name":"Jean-Michel Flaman"},{"name":"Martine Pestel-Caron"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"word":"LytSR"},{"word":"S. lugdunensis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"micro-array"},{"word":"two-component system"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article317":{"pmid":"32038588","title":"Structural Insights Into the Transcriptional Regulation of HigBA Toxin-Antitoxin System by Antitoxin HigA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-02-14","abs":"HigB-HigA is a bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) system in which the antitoxin HigA can mask the endoribonuclease activity of toxin HigB and repress the transcription of the TA operon by binding to its own promoter region.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying HigBA TA operon transcription by PaHigA remains elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of PaHigA binding to the promoter region of higBA operon containing two identical palindromic sequences at 3.14 Å resolution. The promoter DNA is bound by two cooperative dimers to essentially encircle the intact palindrome region.

A combinatory, broad spectrum biocidal antiseptic has been developed (ASP) as a topically applied solution to potential resistant and polymicrobial infected wounds that may be encountered in this context. The ASP-105 designate was evaluated in vitro by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), against different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), resulting estimates of which approximated the positive control (bacitracin). To evaluate in vivo microbicide efficacy, we utilized a murine full thickness wound model to study bacterial infection and wound healing kinetics. Mice were experimentally wounded dorsally and infected with bioluminescent MRSA. The infected wound was splinted, dressed and treated topically with either ASP-105, vehicle (-control), or bacitracin. Bacterial burden and wound healing was monitored using an in vivo imaging system and evaluation of biofilm formation using scanning electron microscopy of wound dressing. Treatment with ASP-105 significantly reduced bacterial burdens in the first 3 days of infection and inhibited MRSA biofilm formation on the surgical dressing. Notably, treatment with ASP-105 resulted in a sterilizing effect of any detectable MRSA in nearly all (80%; 4/5) of treatment group. All mice receiving vehicle control developed highly MRSA-luminescent and purulent wound beds as a result of experimental infection. The ASP-105 therapy facilitated natural healing in the absence of MRSA infection. Results of this study suggests that that the novel ASP combinatory topical antiseptic can be used directly in wounds as a potent, broad-spectrum microbicide against drug resistant S. aureus without injury to the wound bed and impediment of natural restorative processes associated with wound healing.

The existence of bacterial persistence and their possible mechanisms have been widely reported. However, the following regrowth of persister cells is not clear although the awakening of dormant surviving persisters is the key to reinitialize bacterial infection. In this study, we investigated the growth character and cariogenic virulence during the recovery of Streptococcus mutans drug-tolerant persister cells induced by a novel quaternary ammonium: dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM). A remarkable lag phase was observed in S. mutans persisters when regrew at the first 24 h compared to normal cells. During the entire recovery state, persisters are metabolically active to increase the production of both water-soluble and water-insoluble glucan. The shortage of cell number in persisters resulted in the decrease of lactic acid production, but persisters gradually recovered the normal acid production ability after 72 h. The up-regulated expression of gtf and vicR was in line with comDE circuit and consistent with the virulence change during the regrowth stage. Our findings proved that lethal dosages of DMADDM induced drug-tolerant S. mutans persisters in biofilm, which had a prolonged lag phase and elevated cariogenic virulence during regrowth. The recovery and elevated virulence of persisters were regulated by quorum-sensing and VicRK pathway. This alarmed the elevated cariogenicity of persisters and highlighted the critical requirement for the drug-tolerance evaluation when developing new oral antimicrobial agents. To the best of our knowledge, we characterized the regrowth and cariogenic virulence variation of S. mutans persisters induced by quaternary ammonium for the first time. Our findings suggest that S. mutans persisters with the elevated cariogenic virulence during their regrowth stage highlighted the need of new strategy to overcome bacterial persistence. Meanwhile, the prolonged lag phase and the involvement of quorum-sensing system in the regrowth of S. mutans persisters may provide the potential targets.","authors":[{"name":"Junzhuo Lu"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"},{"name":"Yuyao Huang"},{"name":"Yaling Jiang"},{"name":"Chun-Hung Chu"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Mingyun Li"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"},{"name":"Xuedong Zhou"},{"name":"Biao Ren"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-bacterial material"},{"word":"cariogenic virulence"},{"word":"dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate"},{"word":"drug tolerance"},{"word":"persister cells"}]},"article320":{"pmid":"32038544","title":"Computer-Aided Design of Antimicrobial Peptides: Are We Generating Effective Drug Candidates?","date":"2020-02-14","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), especially antibacterial peptides, have been widely investigated as potential alternatives to antibiotic-based therapies.

These peptides were covalently attached to glass using an azidobenzoic acid linker. Peptide attachment was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. Mel4 when bound to glass was able to adopt a more ordered structure in the presence of bacterial membrane mimetic lipids. The ability of surface bound peptides to neutralize endotoxin was measured along with their interactions with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane which were analyzed using DiSC(3)-5 and Sytox green, Syto-9, and PI dyes with fluorescence microscopy. Leakage of ATP and nucleic acids from cells were determined by analyzing the surrounding fluid. Attachment of the peptides resulted in increases in the percentage of nitrogen by 3.0% and 2.4%, and amino acid concentrations to 0.237 nmole and 0.298 nmole per coverslip on melimine and Mel4 coated surfaces, respectively. The immobilized peptides bound lipopolysaccharide and disrupted the cytoplasmic membrane potential of Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 15 min. Membrane depolarization was associated with a reduction in bacterial viability by 82% and 63% for coatings melimine and Mel4, respectively (p < 0.001). Disruption of membrane potential was followed by leakage of ATP from melimine (1.5 ± 0.4 nM) or Mel4 (1.3 ± 0.2 nM) coated surfaces compared to uncoated glass after 2 h (p < 0.001). Sytox green influx started after 3 h incubation with either peptide. Melimine coatings yielded 59% and Mel4 gave 36% PI stained cells after 4 h. Release of the larger molecules (DNA/RNA) commenced after 4 h for melimine (1.8 ± 0.9 times more than control; p = 0.008) and after 6 h with Mel4 (2.1 ± 0.2 times more than control; p < 0.001). The mechanism of action of surface bound melimine and Mel4 was similar to that of the peptides in solution, however, their immobilization resulted in much slower (approximately 30 times) kinetics.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Yasir"},{"name":"Debarun Dutta"},{"name":"Khondker R Hossain"},{"name":"Renxun Chen"},{"name":"Kitty K K Ho"},{"name":"Rajesh Kuppusamy"},{"name":"Ronald J Clarke"},{"name":"Naresh Kumar"},{"name":"Mark D P Willcox"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"membrane disruption"},{"word":"mode of action"},{"word":"surface immobilization"}]},"article322":{"pmid":"32038515","title":"Computational Identification of the Proteins Associated With Quorum Sensing and Biofilm Formation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","date":"2020-02-14","abs":"With prolonged therapy and increased instances of drug resistance, tuberculosis is viewed as a serious infectious disease causing high mortality. Emerging concepts in Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenicity include biofilm formation, which endows bacterial survival in the host for a long time. To tackle chronic tuberculosis infection, a detailed understanding of the bacterial survival mechanisms is crucial. Using comparative genomics and literature mining, 115 M. tuberculosis proteins were shortlisted for their likely association with biofilm formation or quorum sensing. These include essential genes such as secA2, lpqY-sugABC, Rv1176c, and Rv0195, many of which are also known virulence factors. Furthermore, the functional relationship among these proteins was established by considering known protein-protein interactions, regulatory interactions, and gene expression correlation data/information. Graph centrality and motif analyses predicted the importance of proteins, such as Rv0081, DevR, RegX3, Rv0097, and Rv1996 in M. tuberculosis biofilm formation. Analysis of conservation across other biofilm-forming bacteria suggests that most of these genes are conserved in mycobacteria. As the processes, such as quorum sensing, leading to biofilm formation involve diverse pathways and interactions between proteins, these system-wide studies provide a novel perspective toward understanding mycobacterial persistence.","authors":[{"name":"Shubhada R Hegde"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"evolution"},{"word":"protein interactions"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"tuberculosis"}]},"article323":{"pmid":"32037950","title":"Oral antibiotic use and chronic disease: long-term health impact beyond antimicrobial resistance and Clostridioides difficile.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"We recently reported an increased colon cancer risk associated with oral antibiotic use in a large United Kingdom population.

A growing body of evidence suggests that many lichen extracellular polymer matrices harbour unicellular, non-photosynthesizing organisms (UNPOs) not traditionally recognized as lichen symbionts. Understanding organismal input and uptake in this layer is key to interpreting the role UNPOs play in lichen biology. Here we review both polysaccharide composition determined from whole, pulverized lichens and UNPOs reported from lichens to date. Most reported polysaccharides are thought to be structural cell wall components. The composition of the extracellular matrix is not definitively known. Several lines of evidence suggest some polysaccharides have evaded detection in routine analysis of neutral sugars and may be involved in the extracellular matrix. UNPOs reported from lichens include diverse bacteria and yeasts for which secreted polysaccharides play important biological roles.

The genes that lack three-dimensional structures were predicted and validated. Carbon nano-fullerene selected as lead molecule and their drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetics properties were computationally predicted. The binding potential of carbon nano-fullerene toward selected drug targets was modeled and compared with the binding of conventional drugs, doripenem, and polymyxin-B with their usual targets. The stabilities of four best-docked complexes were confirmed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. This study suggested that selected genes demonstrated relevant interactions in the constructed metabolic pathways. Carbon fullerene exhibited significant binding abilities to most of the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of last-resort antibiotics and their usual target.

The presence of a halo surrounding the AZ78 colony on RMA was a first visible effect related to differences in growth medium composition and it corresponded to the formation of a large outer ring.

AZ78 cells on RMA were motile, equipped with cell surface appendages and organised in small groups embedded in a dense layer of fibrils. Metabolic profiling by mass spectrometry imaging revealed increased diversity of analytes produced by AZ78 on RMA as compared with LBA.

We previously demonstrated that a set of plant-derived triterpenes, including oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, inhibit formation of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, and alter expression of genes involved in chemotaxis and motility. In the present study, we have prepared a series of analogs of oleanolic acid. The analogs were evaluated against clinical isolates of E. coli and P. aeruginosa in biofilm formation assays and swarming assays. From these analogs, compound 9 was selected as a lead compound for further development. Compound 9 inhibits E. coli biofilm formation at 4 µg/mL; it also inhibits swarming at ≤1 µg/mL across multiple clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Burkholderia cepacia, and Salmonella enterica, and at <0.5 µg/mL against multiple agricultural strains. Compound 9 also potentiates the activity of the antibiotics tobramycin and colistin against swarming P. aeruginosa; this is notable, as tobramycin and colistin are inhaled antibiotics commonly used to treat P. aeruginosa lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. qPCR experiments suggested that 9 alters expression of genes involved in regulating Type IV pili; western blots confirmed that expression of Type IV pili components PilA and PilY1 decreases in P. aeruginosa in the presence of 9.","authors":[{"name":"Julie A Lawrence"},{"name":"Zhongping Huang"},{"name":"Sivaprakash Rathinavelu"},{"name":"Jin-Feng Hu"},{"name":"Eliane Garo"},{"name":"Michael Ellis"},{"name":"Vanessa L Norman"},{"name":"Ronald Buckle"},{"name":"Russell B Williams"},{"name":"Courtney M Starks"},{"name":"Gary R Eldridge"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm inhibitor"},{"word":"Gram-negative"},{"word":"Swarming"}]},"article345":{"pmid":"32033530","title":"ClpP participates in stress tolerance, biofilm formation, antimicrobial tolerance, and virulence of Enterococcus faecalis.","date":"2020-02-14","abs":"ClpP is important for bacterial growth and plays an indispensable role in cellular protein quality control systems by refolding or degrading damaged proteins, but the physiological significance of ClpP in Enterococcus faecalis remains obscure.

In this study, a 1D biofilm model embedding the n-DAMO and anammox reactions was developed to facilitate further understanding of the process and its optimization. The model was calibrated and validated using comprehensive data sets from two independent MBfRs, treating sidestream- and mainstream-strength wastewater, respectively. Modelling results revealed a unique biofilm stratification. While anammox bacteria dominated throughout the biofilm, n-DAMO archaea (coupling nitrate reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation) only occurred at the inner layer and n-DAMO bacteria (coupling nitrite reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation) spread more evenly with a slightly higher fraction in the outer layer. The established MBfRs were robust against dynamic influent flowrates and nitrite/ammonium ratios. Thicker biofilms were beneficial for not only the total nitrogen (TN) removal but also the system robustness. Additionally, a positive correlation between the nitrogen removal efficiency and the residual methane emission was observed, as a result of higher methane partial pressure required. However, there was a threshold of methane partial pressure, above which the residual methane increased but nitrogen removal efficiency was stable.

LB trough and atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis indicated the propensity of the amphiphiles to form a monolayer as well as spherical aggregates, with the critical micelle concentration (CMC) for C2 (7.0 μM) being lower than C1 (18.5 μM) in water. Formation of an amphiphile-metal complex was evidenced by ESI-MS, FTIR, FETEM-EDX, and ITC analysis. Growth of S. aureus MRSA 100 cells was remarkably impaired in the presence of 5.0 μM C1 or 20 μM C2 as compared to free cells or cells grown in the presence of equivalent levels of amphiphile-metal complexes, suggesting that the amphiphiles perhaps sequester metal and induce metal starvation in MRSA. C1 and C2 rendered superior membrane damage in MRSA and were less toxic to human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells as compared to their metal complexes. C1 and C2 rendered a dose-dependent inhibition of S. aureus biofilm formation, while revival of biofilm upon Zn(II) addition suggested that zinc starvation rendered by the amphiphiles may induce biofilm inhibition. C1 imposed a concentration-dependent metal starvation response in MRSA as there was an upregulation of the cntL gene and downregulation of cntA gene, which are involved in synthesis of the zincophore staphylopine (Stp) and transport of the Stp-Zn complex, respectively. ITC analysis revealed that binding of C1 and C2 to staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was stronger than the corresponding Zn(II) complexes, which perhaps accounted for the higher bactericidal potency of the amphiphiles.

Bioinformatic analysis revealed eleven candidate genes for c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins (GGDEF/EAL domain proteins) in the genome of A. baumannii strain 17978.

The over expression of three GGDEF proteins exerted a pronounced effect on colony formation of A. baumannii on Congo Red agar plates. Distinct panels of GGDEF/EAL proteins were found to alter biofilm formation and surface associated motility of A. baumannii upon over expression. The GGDEF protein A1S_3296 appeared as a major diguanylate cyclase regulating macro-colony formation, biofilm formation and the surface associated motility.

Here, we report that the lack of citrullination in a PPAD deletion mutant (Δ8820) enhances biofilm formation. More Δ8820 cells attached to the surface than the parent strain during the early stages of biofilm development and, ultimately, mature Δ8820 biofilms were comprised of significantly more cell-cell aggregates and extracellular matrix. Imaging by electron microscopy discovered that Δ8820 biofilm cells secrete copious amounts of protein aggregates. Furthermore, gingipain-derived adhesin proteins, which are also secreted by the T9SS were predicted by mass spectrometry to be citrullinated and citrullination of these targets by wild-type strain 381 in vitro was confirmed. Lastly, Δ8820 biofilms contained more gingipain-derived adhesin proteins and more gingipain activity than 381 biofilms. Overall, our findings support the model that citrullination of T9SS cargo proteins known to play a key role in colonization, such as gingipain-derived adhesin proteins, is an underlying mechanism that modulates P. gingivalis biofilm development.","authors":[{"name":"Danielle M Vermilyea"},{"name":"Gregory K Ottenberg"},{"name":"Mary E Davey"}],"keywords":[]},"article361":{"pmid":"32029309","title":"Un-steady state modeling for free cyanide removal and biofilm growth in a RBC batch process.","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"Biofilm growth and free cyanide biological removal from gold mine wastewater were modeled and simulated using a bench-scale rotating biological contactor (RBC).

Coevolution of plasmids and their hosts promotes this spread of resistance by ameliorating the cost of plasmid carriage. However, our knowledge of plasmid-bacteria coevolution is solely based on studies done in well-mixed liquid cultures, even though biofilms represent the main way of bacterial life on Earth and are responsible for most infections. The spatial structure and heterogeneity provided by biofilms is known to lead to increased genetic diversity as compared to well-mixed liquids. Therefore we expect that growth in this complex environment could affect the evolutionary trajectories of plasmid-host dyads. We experimentally evolved Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with plasmid pBP136Gm in biofilms and chemostats and sequenced the genomes of clones and populations. Biofilm populations not only maintained a higher diversity of mutations than chemostat populations, but contained a few clones with markedly more persistent plasmids that evolved via multiple distinct trajectories. These included the acquisition of a putative toxin-antitoxin transposon by the plasmid and chromosomal mutations. Some of these genetic changes resulted in loss of plasmid transferability or decrease in plasmid cost. Growth in chemostats led to a higher proportion of variants with decreased plasmid persistence, a phenomenon not detected in biofilms. We suggest that the presence of more stable plasmid-host dyads in biofilms reflects higher genetic diversity and possibly unknown selection pressures. Overall this study underscores the importance of the mode of growth in the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Thibault Stalder"},{"name":"Brandon Cornwell"},{"name":"Jared Lacroix"},{"name":"Bethel Kohler"},{"name":"Seth Dixon"},{"name":"Hirokazu Yano"},{"name":"Ben Kerr"},{"name":"Larry J Forney"},{"name":"Eva M Top"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"experimental evolution"},{"word":"horizontal gene transfer"},{"word":"plasmid"},{"word":"spatial structure"}]},"article372":{"pmid":"32026679","title":"Edge-Localized Biodeterioration and Secondary Microplastic Formation by Papiliotrema laurentii Unsaturated Biofilm Cells on Polyurethane Films.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Painted environmental surfaces are prone to microbiological colonization with potential coating deterioration induced by the microorganisms. Accurate mechanistic models of these interactions require an understanding of the heterogeneity in which the deterioration processes proceed. Here, unsaturated biofilms (i.e., at air/solid interfaces) of the yeast Papiliotrema laurentii were prepared on polyether polyurethane (PEUR) and polyester-polyether polyurethane (PEST-PEUR) coatings and incubated for up to 33 days at controlled temperature and humidity with no additional nutrients. Transmission micro-Fourier transform infrared microscopy (μFTIR) confirmed preferential hydrolysis of the ester component by the biofilm. Atomic force microscopy combined with infrared nanospectroscopy (AFM-IR) was used to analyze initial PEST-PEUR coating deterioration processes at the single-cell level, including underlying surfaces that became exposed following cell translocation. The results revealed distinct deterioration features that remained localized within ∼10 μm or less of the edges of individual cells and cell clusters. These features comprised depressions of up to ∼300 nm with locally reduced ester/urethane ratios. They are consistent with a formation process initiated by enzymatic ester hydrolysis followed by erosion from water condensation cycles. Further observations included particle accumulation in the broader biofilm vicinity. AFM-IR spectroscopy indicated these to be secondary microplastics consisting of urethane-rich oligomeric aggregates. Overall, multiple contributing factors have been identified that can facilitate differential deterioration rates across the PEST-PEUR surface. Effects of the imposed nutrient conditions on Papiliotrema laurentii physiology were also apparent, with cells developing the characteristics of starvation response, despite the availability of polyester metabolites as a carbon source. The combined results provide new laboratory insights into field-relevant microbiological polymer deterioration mechanisms and biofilm physiology at polymer coating interfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel E Barlow"},{"name":"Justin C Biffinger"},{"name":"Luis Estrella"},{"name":"Qin Lu"},{"name":"Chia-Suei Hung"},{"name":"Lloyd J Nadeau"},{"name":"Audra L Crouch"},{"name":"John N Russell"},{"name":"Wendy J Crookes-Goodson"}],"keywords":[]},"article373":{"pmid":"32025329","title":"Virulence and biofilms as promising targets in developing antipathogenic drugs against candidiasis.","date":"2020-02-11","abs":"Candida albicans has remained the main etiological agent of candidiasis, challenges clinicians with high mortality and morbidity.

The alginate of the biofilm was believed to be the key factor disabling immune therapy and antibiotic treatments. A silver nanocomposite consisting of silver nanoparticles and a mesoporous organosilica layer was created to deliver two pharmaceutical compounds (alginate lyase and ceftazidime) to degrade the alginate and eradicate P. aeruginosa from the lungs. The introduction of thioether-bridged mesoporous organosilica into the nanocomposites greatly benefited the conjunction of foreign functional molecules such as alginate lyase and increased their hemocompatibility and drug-loading capacity. Silver nanocomposites with a uniform diameter (∼39 nm) exhibited a high dispersity, good biocompatibility, and high ceftazidime-loading capacity (380.96 mg/g). Notably, the silver nanocomposites displayed a low pH-dependent drug release and degradation profiles (pH 6.4), guaranteeing the targeted release of the drugs in the acidic niches of the P. aeruginosa biofilm. Indeed, particles loaded with alginate lyase and ceftazidime exhibited high inhibitory and degradation effects on the biofilm of P. aeruginosa PAO1 based on the specific catalytic activity of the enzyme to the alginate and antibacterial function of their loaded ceftazidime and silver ions. It should be noted that the enzyme-decorated nanocomposites succeeded in eradicating P. aeruginosa PAO1 from the mouse lungs and decreasing the lung injuries. No deaths or serious side effects were observed during the experiments.

A suction tongue cleaner enables professional cleaning of the tongue. The aim of this study was to investigate the acceptance and efficiency of a suction tongue-cleaning device in adults in comparison to a conventional manual tongue cleaner in an office (professional) setting. Both were tested simultaneously on 100 individuals with a split-mouth (i. e. half-tongue) design, between the ages of 19 to 31, at the University Center for Dental Medicine Basel UZB. To evaluate the efficiency of the cleaning, photos were taken before and after the cleaning and later assessed by using a modified coating tongue index by Winkel (WTCI). Both cleaning devices significantly reduced the coating on the tongue (p < 0.001). In 58 cases, the side cleaned with the suction tongue cleaner resulted to be cleaner in comparison to the side which was cleaned manually. There were no significant differences in acceptance on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-10 cm) between the devices (p = 0.259). However, 53 subjects favored the manual method in comparison to 36 who favored the suction device. The remaining 11 did not convey any preference for either. Both devices triggered an equally frequent gag stimulus. With 95%, the majority of the patients who had this treatment would undergo it a second time. In conclusion, both cleaning devices resulted in a significant reduction of tongue coating, and the usage in general can be highly recommended. While it does not matter which one is used, the suction tongue-cleaning device offers a good alternative to manual tongue-cleaning devices in dental clinics and can be considered a viable adjunct for in-office use.","authors":[{"name":"Sandro Rhyn"},{"name":"Andrea Zürcher"},{"name":"Virginia Ortiz"},{"name":"Andreas Filippi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"TS1 suction tongue cleaner"},{"word":"Tongue cleaning"},{"word":"Tongue sanitizer"}]},"article377":{"pmid":"32024254","title":"Increasing Susceptibility of Drug-Resistant Candida albicans to Fluconazole and Terbinafine by 2(5H)-Furanone Derivative.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"The frequency of mycoses caused by drug-resistant fungal pathogen Candida albicans has increased drastically over the last two decades.

IMIs are often caused by staphylococci, which are Gram-positive bacteria that become pathogenic by forming biofilms and producing toxins. As a model for a teat dip (DIP), the BacStop iodine-based teat dip (DIP) was used. Witch hazel extract (whISOBAX (WH)) was tested because it contains a high concentration of the anti-biofilm/anti-toxin phenolic compound hamamelitannin. We found that the minimal inhibitory or bactericidal concentrations of DIP against planktonic S. epidermidis cells increased up to 160fold in the presence of WH, and that DIP was 10-fold less effective against biofilm cells. While both DIP and WH are effective in inhibiting the growth of S. aureus, only WH inhibits toxin production (tested for enterotoxin-A). Importantly, WH also significantly enhances the antibacterial effect of DIP against Gram-negative bacteria that can cause IMIs, like Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Put together, these results suggest that the antibacterial activity of DIP combined with WH is significantly higher, and thus have potential in eradicating bacterial infections, both in acute (planktonic-associated) and in chronic (biofilm-associated) conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Reuven Rasooly"},{"name":"Adel Molnar"},{"name":"Paula Do"},{"name":"Gianluca Morroni"},{"name":"Lucia Brescini"},{"name":"Oscar Cirioni"},{"name":"Andrea Giacometti"},{"name":"Emmanouil Apostolidis"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"mastitis"},{"word":"staphylococcus"},{"word":"witch hazel extract"}]},"article380":{"pmid":"32023990","title":"Adhesion of Campylobacterjejuni Is Increased in Association with Foodborne Bacteria.","date":"2020-03-22","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate Campylobacterjejuni NTCT 11168 adhesion to abiotic and biotic surfaces when grown in co-culture with Escherichiacoli ATCC 11229 and/or Listeriamonocytogenes 4b.

In the case of Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, biofilms have remained largely enigmatic. Here, applying live and static confocal microscopy, we report growth and ultrastructural organization of the biofilms formed in vitro by these microorganisms over the early transition from coccobacillary into coccoid shape during biofilm assembly. Using selective dispersing agents, we provided evidence for extracellular DNA (eDNA) being a major and conserved structural component of mature biofilms formed by both F. subsp. novicida and a human clinical isolate of F. philomiragia. We also observed a higher physical robustness of F. novicida biofilm as compared to F. philomiragia one, a feature likely promoted by specific polysaccharides. Further, F. novicida biofilms resisted significantly better to ciprofloxacin than their planktonic counterparts.

In this study, we hypothesize that isolates pertaining to clusters may be found more frequently in the environment due to their ability to form biofilms compared to singleton genotypes. Two hundred and thirty-nine Candida spp. isolates (78 clusters) from candidemia patients admitted to 16 hospitals located in different cities and countries-and the same number of singleton genotypes used as controls-were tested in terms of biofilm formation using the crystal violet and the XTT reduction assays. Candida albicans clusters showed higher biofilm formation in comparison to singleton genotypes (P < .01). The biofilms formed by intra-hospital C. albicans clusters showed higher metabolic activity (P < .05). Furthermore, marked variability was found among species and type of cluster. We observed that the higher the number of isolates, the higher the variability of biofilm production by isolates within the cluster, suggesting that the production of biofilm by isolates of the same genotype is quite diverse and does not depend on the type of cluster studied. In conclusion, candidemia Candida spp. clusters-particularly in the case of C. albicans-show significantly more biomass production and metabolic activity than singleton genotypes.","authors":[{"name":"Judith Díaz-García"},{"name":"Maiken C Arendrup"},{"name":"Rafael Cantón"},{"name":"Julio García-Rodríguez"},{"name":"Ana Gómez"},{"name":"Elia Gómez"},{"name":"Beatriz Orden"},{"name":"Gabriella Parisi"},{"name":"Javier Pemán"},{"name":"Brunella Posteraro"},{"name":"Maurizio Sanguinetti"},{"name":"Daniel Archimedes Da Matta"},{"name":"Arnaldo L Colombo"},{"name":"Patricia Muñoz"},{"name":"Carlos Sánchez-Carrillo"},{"name":"Jesús Guinea"},{"name":"Pilar Escribano"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Candida        "},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biomass formation"},{"word":"candidemia"},{"word":"cluster"},{"word":"metabolic activity"}]},"article388":{"pmid":"32022432","title":"Antibody response against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its relationship with immune mediators in the upper and lower airways of cystic fibrosis patients.","date":"2020-03-16","abs":"The upper airways (UAW) are a niche and a reservoir of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that cause chronic infection of the lower airways (LAW) in cystic fibrosis (CF).

In clinical and medical settings, these persistent pathogens predominantly grow as complex heterogeneous structures enmeshed in a self-produced exopolysaccharide matrix, termed as biofilms. Since biofilms can rapidly form by adapting new environmental surroundings and have potential effect on human health, it is critical to study them promptly and consistently. Biofilm infections are challenging in the contamination of medical devices and implantations, food processing and pharmaceutical industrial settings, and in dental area caries, periodontitis and so on. The persistence of infections associated with biofilms has been mainly attributed to the increased antibiotic resistance offered by the cells growing in biofilms. In fact, it is well known that this recalcitrance of bacterial biofilms is multifactorial, and there are several resistance mechanisms that may act in parallel in order to provide an enhanced level of resistance to the biofilm. In combination, distinct resistance mechanisms significantly decrease our ability to control and eradicate biofilm-associated infections with current antimicrobial arsenal. In addition, various factors are known to influence the process of biofilm formation, growth dynamics, and their heterogeneous response towards antibiotic therapy. The current review discusses the contribution of cellular and physiochemical factors on the growth dynamics of biofilm, especially their role in antibiotic resistance mechanisms of bacterial population living in surface attached growth mode. A systematic investigation on the effects and treatment of biofilms may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat biofilms in healthcare and industrial settings.","authors":[{"name":"Lakshmi Machineni"}],"keywords":[]},"article394":{"pmid":"32020464","title":"Curtailing Quorum Sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Sitagliptin.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa coordinates the secretion of virulence factors through quorum sensing. Quorum sensing inhibitors can attenuate the pathogenesis of bacteria and help the immune system to eradicate them without targeting the bacterial growth. This study aimed to explore the anti-quorum sensing and anti-virulence activities of sitagliptin against P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain. Sub-inhibitory concentration of sitagliptin significantly inhibited the virulence factors pyocyanin, hemolysin, protease and elastase in addition to blocking swimming, swarming and twitching motilities and biofilm formation. In silico analysis showed that sitagliptin interacted with LasR receptors by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction, mainly with the amino acids leucine present at positions 40 and 125, tyrosine at position 56, serine at position 129, tryptophan at position 60, alanine at position 50 and phenyl alanine at position 101. qRT-PCR confirmed the anti-quorum sensing activity by reducing the expression level of QS genes lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, pqsA and pqsR. In conclusion, sitagliptin is a novel anti-quorum sensing agent that can be used for treating P. aeruginosa infections.","authors":[{"name":"Hisham A Abbas"},{"name":"Moutaz A Shaldam"},{"name":"Dalia Eldamasi"}],"keywords":[]},"article395":{"pmid":"32020424","title":"Evaluation of the biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on human umbilical cord CD146+ stem cells and stem cell-based decellularized matrix.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"This study aims to evaluate the CD146+ stem cells obtained from the human umbilical cord and their extracellular matrix proteins on in vitro Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms to understand their possible antimicrobial activity.

Cell viability/proliferation of cells in co-cultures was evaluated by WST-1 and crystal-violet staining. The effects of cells and decellularized matrix proteins on biofilms were investigated on a drip flow biofilm reactor and their effects on gene expression were determined by RT-qPCR. We observed that CD146/105+ stem cells could differentiate adipogenically and decellularized matrix showed negative DAPI and positive collagen staining with Masson' s Trichrome. Proteome analysis of the decellularized matrix revealed some matrix components and growth factors.

Hence, this study investigated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm potentials of cell-free supernatants (CFS) obtained from Clostridium butyricum, as probiotic, against A. baumannii. Our results demonstrated that C. butyricum CFS inhibited A. baumannii cell growth in planktonic culture. Also, C. butyricum CFS not only inhibited the biofilm development and dispersed mature biofilms, but also suppressed the metabolic activity of biofilm cells, showing antibiofilm activity. The biofilm components reduced by C. butyricum CFS were observed via confocal laser scanning microscopy. In addition, C. butyricum CFS exhibited antivirulence effect by inhibiting the motility of A. baumannii. Furthermore, C. butyricum CFS significantly downregulated the expression of efflux pump-related genes including adeA, adeB and adeC in A. baumannii. Our data demonstrate that C. butyricum CFS showed antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects on A. baumannii. These effects are closely associated with suppression of motility and efflux pump-related genes in A. baumannii. The findings suggest that C. butyricum CFS can be used as a new therapeutic alternative against biofilm-associated infection caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.","authors":[{"name":"Da-Seul Shin"},{"name":"Yong-Bin Eom"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acinetobacter baumannii"},{"word":"AdeABC efflux pump"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Clostridium butyricum"},{"word":"Probiotic"}]},"article397":{"pmid":"32020052","title":"Synergism between Corynebacterium and Streptococcus sanguinis reveals new interactions between oral commensals.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"The oral microbiome engages in a diverse array of highly sophisticated ecological interactions that are crucial for maintaining symbiosis with the host. Streptococci and corynebacteria are among the most abundant oral commensals and their interactions are critical for normal biofilm development. In this study, we discovered that Streptococcus sanguinis specifically responds to the presence of Corynebacterium durum by dramatically altering its chain morphology and improving its overall fitness. By employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, specific fatty acids were identified in C. durum supernatants that are responsible for the observed effect. Membrane vesicles (MVs) containing these fatty acids were isolated from C. durum supernatants and were able to replicate the chain morphology phenotype in S. sanguinis, suggesting MV as a mediator of interspecies interactions. Furthermore, S. sanguinis responds to C. durum lipids by decreasing the expression of key FASII genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Several of these genes are also essential for the chain elongation phenotype, which implicates a regulatory connection between lipid metabolism and chain elongation. In addition, C. durum was found to affect the growth, cell aggregation, and phagocytosis of S. sanguinis, revealing a complex association of these species that likely supports oral commensal colonization and survival.","authors":[{"name":"Puthayalai Treerat"},{"name":"Ulrike Redanz"},{"name":"Sylvio Redanz"},{"name":"Rodrigo A Giacaman"},{"name":"Justin Merritt"},{"name":"Jens Kreth"}],"keywords":[]},"article398":{"pmid":"32019109","title":"Lipidated Analogs of the LL-37-Derived Peptide Fragment KR12-Structural Analysis, Surface-Active Properties and Antimicrobial Activity.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"An increasing number of multidrug-resistant pathogens is a serious problem of modern medicine and new antibiotics are highly demanded.
