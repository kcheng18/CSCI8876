M. haemolytica cells initially colonize the tonsillar crypts in the upper respiratory tract of cattle, from where they can subsequently descend into the lungs to cause disease. Many bacteria exist as biofilms inside their hosts. We hypothesize that M. haemolytica colonization of cattle during its commensal state may include biofilm formation. To begin to assess this possibility, we developed an in vitro system to study biofilm formation directly on bovine respiratory epithelial cells. Using fixed primary bovine bronchial epithelial cells, we observed M. haemolytica biofilm formation after a 48h incubation period at 37°C. Addition of mucin, the main component of mucus present in the upper respiratory tract, decreased M. haemolytica biofilm formation on bovine epithelial cells. We investigated the effects of prior viral infection of the epithelial cells on subsequent biofilm formation by M. haemolytica and found negligible effects. Utilization of this model system will provide new insights into the potential role of biofilm formation by M. haemolytica in the pathogenesis of BRDC.","authors":[{"name":"Ismail Boukahil"},{"name":"Charles J Czuprynski"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Epithelial cells"},{"word":"Mannheimia haemolytica"},{"word":"Model system"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"27937018","title":"Biofilms: prevention and treatment.","date":"2017-03-09","abs":"Biofilms are a major aetiological factor in many infections.

Most of these diseases are reported to be caused by waterborne pathogens. In this study, we examined the overall bacterial diversity of selected source and point-of-use water from rural areas in Central Plateau, Haiti using pyrosequencing of 16s rRNA genes. Taxonomic composition of water samples revealed an abundance of Firmicutes phyla, followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. A total of 38 bacterial families and 60 genera were identified. The presence of several Klebsiella spp. (tentatively, K. pneumoniae, K. variicola and other Klebsiella spp.) was detected in most water samples. Several other human pathogens such as Aeromonas, Bacillus, Clostridium, and Yersinia constituted significantly higher proportion of bacterial communities in the point-of-use water samples compared to source water. Bacterial genera traditionally associated with biofilm formation, such as Chryseobacterium, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Pseudomonas were found in the point-of-use waters obtained from water filters or domestic water storage containers.

Filamentous growth of this fungus is tied to biofilm formation because many filamentation-associated genes are required for surface adherence. Cell cycle or cell growth defects can induce filamentation, but we have limited information about the coupling between filamentation and filamentation-associated gene expression after cell cycle/cell growth inhibition. Here we identified the CDK activating protein kinase Cak1 as a determinant of filamentation and filamentation-associated gene expression through a screen of mutations that diminish expression of protein kinase-related genes implicated in cell cycle/cell growth control. A cak1 diminished expression (DX) strain displays filamentous growth and expresses filamentation-associated genes in the absence of typical inducing signals. In a wild-type background, expression of filamentation-associated genes depends upon the transcription factors Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Tec1, and Ume6. In the cak1 DX background, the dependence of filamentation-associated gene expression on each transcription factor is substantially relieved. The unexpected bypass of filamentation-associated gene expression activators has the functional consequence of enabling biofilm formation in the absence of Bcr1, Brg1, Tec1, Ume6, or in the absence of both Brg1 and Ume6. It also enables filamentous cell morphogenesis, though not biofilm formation, in the absence of Efg1. Because these transcription factors are known to have shared target genes, we suggest that cell cycle/cell growth limitation leads to activation of several transcription factors, thus relieving dependence on any one.","authors":[{"name":"Carol A Woolford"},{"name":"Katherine Lagree"},{"name":"Wenjie Xu"},{"name":"Tatyana Aleynikov"},{"name":"Hema Adhikari"},{"name":"Hiram Sanchez"},{"name":"Paul J Cullen"},{"name":"Frederick Lanni"},{"name":"David R Andes"},{"name":"Aaron P Mitchell"}],"keywords":[]},"article8":{"pmid":"27935844","title":"Cooperative Evolutionary Strategy between the Bacteriome and Mycobiome.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Nonhealing chronic wounds are all unique in origin and circumstance, and attempting to isolate a single etiology for the failure of a wound to heal is daunting.

This study aimed to investigate the synergistic antibacterial activity of polymyxin B in combination with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) against problematic Gram-negative pathogens. In vitro synergistic antibacterial activity of polymyxin B and the SERMs tamoxifen, raloxifene, and toremifene was assessed using the microdilution checkerboard and static time-kill assays against a panel of Gram-negative isolates. Polymyxin B and the SERMs were ineffective when used as monotherapy against polymyxin-resistant minimum inhibitory concentration ([MIC] ≥8 mg/L) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. However, when used in combination, clinically relevant concentrations of polymyxin B and SERMs displayed synergistic killing against the polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii isolates as demonstrated by a ≥2-3 log10 decrease in bacterial count (CFU/ml) after 24 hours. The combination of polymyxin B with toremifene demonstrated very potent antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms in an artificial sputum media assay. Moreover, polymyxin B combined with toremifene synergistically induced cytosolic green fluorescence protein release, cytoplasmic membrane depolarization, permeabilizing activity in a nitrocefin assay, and an increase of cellular reactive oxygen species from P. aeruginosa cells. In addition, scanning and transmission electron micrographs showed that polymyxin B in combination with toremifene causes distinctive damage to the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa cells, compared with treatments with each compound per se. In conclusion, the combination of polymyxin B and SERMs illustrated a synergistic activity against XDR Gram-negative pathogens, including highly polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates, and represents a novel combination therapy strategy for the treatment of infections because of problematic XDR Gram-negative pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Maytham H Hussein"},{"name":"Elena K Schneider"},{"name":"Alysha G Elliott"},{"name":"Meiling Han"},{"name":"Felisa Reyes-Ortega"},{"name":"Faye Morris"},{"name":"Mark A T Blastovich"},{"name":"Raad Jasim"},{"name":"Bart Currie"},{"name":"Mark Mayo"},{"name":"Mark Baker"},{"name":"Matthew A Cooper"},{"name":"Jian Li"},{"name":"Tony Velkov"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Gram-negative"},{"word":"SERMs"},{"word":"multidrug resistant"},{"word":"polymyxin"},{"word":"repositioning"}]},"article10":{"pmid":"27935662","title":"Antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cement modified by zinc oxide nanoparticles.","date":"2018-04-04","abs":"This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles incorporated into self-cured glass ionomer cement (GIC) and light-cured resin-reinforced GIC on Streptococcus mutans biofilm.

In addition to biofilm bacteria on necrotic tissue and implants, studies have implicated intracellular infection of osteoblasts and osteocytes as a mechanism of chronic osteomyelitis. Thus, we performed the first systematic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies to formally define major reservoirs of S. aureus in chronically infected mouse (Balb/c J) long bone tissue. Although rare, evidence of colonized osteoblasts was found. In contrast, we readily observed S. aureus within canaliculi of live cortical bone, which existed as chains of individual cocci and submicron rod-shaped bacteria leading to biofilm formation in osteocyte lacunae. As these observations do not conform to the expectations of S. aureus as non-motile cocci 1.0 to 1.5 μm in diameter, we also performed immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) following in vivo BrdU labeling to assess the role of bacterial proliferation in canalicular invasion.

Subtle structural differences in the PVA active site that regulate specificity for acyl chain length have been characterized, which could reflect the evolution of AHL-degrading acylases in relation to the environment of the bacteria that produce them and also provide strategies for enzyme engineering.

The human immune system tries to counter this via defensive proteins such as lysozyme (HLZ). HLZ targets the bacterial cell wall but may also have other antimicrobial activities. The enzyme contains four disulfide bonds and shows high thermodynamic stability and resistance to proteolytic attack. Here we show that RL promotes HLZ degradation by several unrelated peptidases, including the PA elastase and human peptidases. This occurs although RL does not by itself denature HLZ. Nevertheless, RL binds in a sufficiently high stoichiometry (8:1 RL:HLZ) to neutralize the highly cationic surface of HLZ. The initial cleavage sites agree well with the domain boundaries of HLZ. Thus, binding of RL to native HLZ may be sufficient to allow proteolytic attack at slightly exposed sites on the protein, leading to subsequent degradation. Furthermore, biofilms of RL-producing strains of PA are protected better against high concentrations of HLZ than RL-free PA strains are. We conclude that pathogen-produced RL may weaken host defenses by facilitating degradation of key host proteins.","authors":[{"name":"Kell K Andersen"},{"name":"Brian S Vad"},{"name":"Carsten Scavenius"},{"name":"Jan J Enghild"},{"name":"Daniel E Otzen"}],"keywords":[]},"article30":{"pmid":"27930872","title":"Bacterial Interactions with Immobilized Liquid Layers.","date":"2018-01-31","abs":"Bacterial interactions with surfaces are at the heart of many infection-related problems in healthcare.

In this study, conditions affecting eDNA export were examined, and genes involved with the eDNA export mechanism were identified. After a method for monitoring eDNA in real time in undisturbed biofilms was established, different conditions affecting eDNA were investigated. Bicarbonate positively influenced eDNA export in a pH-independent manner in Mycobacterium avium, M. abscessus, and M. chelonae The surface-exposed proteome of M. avium in eDNA-containing biofilms revealed abundant carbonic anhydrases. Chemical inhibition of carbonic anhydrases with ethoxzolamide significantly reduced eDNA export. An unbiased transposon mutant library screen for eDNA export in M. avium identified many severely eDNA-attenuated mutants, including one not expressing a unique FtsK/SpoIIIE-like DNA-transporting pore, two with inactivation of carbonic anhydrases, and nine with inactivation of genes belonging to a unique genomic region, as well as numerous mutants involved in metabolism and energy production. Complementation of nine mutants that included the FtsK/SpoIIIE and carbonic anhydrase significantly restored eDNA export. Interestingly, several attenuated eDNA mutants have mutations in genes encoding proteins that were found with the surface proteomics, and many more mutations are localized in operons potentially encoding surface proteins. Collectively, our data strengthen the evidence of eDNA export being an active mechanism that is activated by the bacterium responding to bicarbonate.","authors":[{"name":"Sasha J Rose"},{"name":"Luiz E Bermudez"}],"keywords":[]},"article51":{"pmid":"27923605","title":"Rhodomyrtone inhibits lipase production, biofilm formation, and disorganizes established biofilm in Propionibacterium acnes.","date":"2017-05-15","abs":"Virulence enzymes and biofilm a play crucial role in the pathogenesis of Propionibacterium acnes, a major causative agent of acne vulgaris.

However, the role of norspermidine in S. mutans biofilms remains unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the impact of norspermidine on S. mutans biofilms. The different architectures of the biofilms in norspermidine and control groups indicated that the basic units, bacteria‑exopolysaccharide units (BEUs), represent the exopolysaccharide (EPS) and bacterial assembly pattern in S. mutans biofilms. In addition, norspermidine inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation and changed the basic composition of the biofilm, which led to an unusual EPS architecture. Therefore, 5 mM norspermidine inhibited biofilm formation both by decreasing the rate of cell viability and changing the biofilm structure. Gene‑expression microarray analysis indicated that the formation of an irregular architecture in the norspermidine group was potentially attributable to the downregulation of elements of the quorum‑sensing system (by 2.7‑15‑fold).

Filamentous growth is a pH-responsive behavior, where alkaline conditions favor hyphal growth and acid conditions favor growth as yeast. We employed filamentous growth as a tool to study the impact of pH on the hyphal growth regulator Cyr1, and we report that downregulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling by acidic pH contributes to the inhibition of hyphal growth in minimal medium with GlcNAc. Ras1 and Cyr1 are generally required for efficient hyphal growth, and the effects of low pH on Ras1 proteolysis and GTP binding are consistent with diminished cAMP output. Active alleles of ras1 do not suppress the hyphal growth defect at low pH, while dibutyryl cAMP partially rescues filamentous growth at low pH in a cyr1 mutant. These observations are consistent with Ras1-independent downregulation of Cyr1 by low pH. We also report that extracellular pH leads to rapid and prolonged decreases in intracellular pH, and these changes may contribute to reduced cAMP signaling by reducing intracellular bicarbonate pools. Transcriptomics analyses found that the loss of Cyr1 at either acidic or neutral pH leads to increases in transcripts involved in carbohydrate catabolism and protein translation and glycosylation and decreases in transcripts involved in oxidative metabolism, fluconazole transport, metal transport, and biofilm formation. Other pathways were modulated in pH-dependent ways. Our findings indicate that cAMP has a global role in pH-dependent responses, and this effect is mediated, at least in part, through Cyr1 in a Ras1-independent fashion.

Here, we show that the autB gene is broadly distributed among pathogenic Neisseria spp. The gene is intact in most meningococcal strains. However, its expression is prone to phase variation due to slipped-strand mispairing at AAGC repeats located within the DNA encoding the signal sequence and is switched off in the vast majority of these strains. Moreover, various genetic disruptions prevent autB expression in most of the strains in which the gene is in phase indicating a strong selection against AutB synthesis. We observed that autB is expressed in two of the strains examined and that AutB is secreted and exposed at the cell surface. Functionality assays revealed that AutB synthesis promotes biofilm formation and delays the passage of epithelial cell layers in vitro. We hypothesize that this autotransporter is produced during the colonization process only in specific niches to facilitate microcolony formation, but its synthesis is switched off probably to evade the immune system and facilitate human tissue invasion.","authors":[{"name":"Jesús Arenas"},{"name":"Fernanda L Paganelli"},{"name":"Patricia Rodríguez-Castaño"},{"name":"Sara Cano-Crespo"},{"name":"Arie van der Ende"},{"name":"Jos P M van Putten"},{"name":"Jan Tommassen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Haemophilus influenzae"},{"word":"Neisseria meningitidis"},{"word":"autotransporters"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"pathogenesis"},{"word":"protein secretion"}]},"article64":{"pmid":"27920774","title":"Effects of Tween 80 on Growth and Biofilm Formation in Laboratory Media.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Tween 80 is a widely used non-ionic emulsifier that is added to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods.

Addition of 0.1% Tween 80 to laboratory growth media increased the growth rate of planktonic S. aureus batch cultures, and it also increased the total biomass when S. aureus was grown as biofilms.

Furthermore, Tween 80 lowered the antibacterial efficacy of two hydrophobic antimicrobials: rifampicin and the essential oil isoeugenol. Our findings underline the importance of documenting indirect effects of emulsifiers when studying the efficacy of hydrophobic antimicrobials that are dispersed in solution by emulsification, or when antimicrobials are applied in food matrixes that include emulsifiers.

A systematic search for ED pathway genes in a wide range of Campylobacter isolates and in the C. jejuni/coli PubMLST database revealed that 1.7% of >6,000 genomes encoded a complete ED pathway, including both C. jejuni and C. coli from diverse clinical, environmental and animal sources.

Three type II TA systems have previously been identified in the genome of H. pylori 26695: HP0315-HP0316, HP0892-HP0893, and HP0894-HP0895.

The objective of this study was to assess the activity of PYRRO-C3D against nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) biofilms and examine the role of NO in reducing biofilm-associated antibiotic tolerance. The activity of PYRRO-C3D on in vitro NTHi biofilms was assessed through CFU enumeration and confocal microscopy. NO release measurements were performed using an ISO-NO probe. NTHi biofilms grown on primary ciliated respiratory epithelia at an air-liquid interface were used to investigate the effects of PYRRO-C3D in the presence of host tissue. Label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) proteomic analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed proteins following NO treatment. PYRRO-C3D specifically released NO in the presence of NTHi, while no evidence of spontaneous NO release was observed when the compound was exposed to primary epithelial cells. NTHi lacking β-lactamase activity failed to trigger NO release. Treatment significantly increased the susceptibility of in vitro NTHi biofilms to azithromycin, causing a log fold reduction (10-fold reduction or 1-log-unit reduction) in viability (P < 0.05) relative to azithromycin alone. The response was more pronounced for biofilms grown on primary respiratory epithelia, where a 2-log-unit reduction was observed (P < 0.01).

I propose that the relationships between fate choice, environmental cues and signaling pathways are not Boolean, but involve graded levels of signals, pathway activation and master-regulator activity. In the absence of large differences between environmental cues, small differences in the concentration of cues may be reinforced by cell-to-cell signals. These signals are particularly essential for fate determination within communities, such as colonies and biofilms, where fate choice varies dramatically from one region of the community to another.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a potential class of antimicrobial drugs consisting of evolutionarily conserved multifunctional molecules with both microbicidal and immunomodulatory properties being part of the innate immune response of diverse organisms. In this study, we evaluated 11 scorpion-venom derived non-disulfide-bridged peptides against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida spp., which are important human pathogens. Seven of them, including two novel molecules, showed activity against both genera with minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 3.12 to 200 μM and an analogous activity against Candida albicans biofilms. Most of the peptides presented low hemolytic and cytotoxic activity against mammalian cells. Modifications in the primary peptide sequence, as revealed by in silico and circular dichroism analyses of the most promising peptides, underscored the importance of cationicity for their antimicrobial activity as well as the amphipathicity of these molecules and their tendency to form alpha helices. This is the first report of scorpion-derived AMPs against C. neoformans and our results underline the potential of scorpion venom as a source of antimicrobials.

This review focuses on phytoremediation with particular interest on the interactions between and use of plant-associated bacteria to restore PHC polluted sites. Plant-associated bacteria include endophytic, phyllospheric, and rhizospheric bacteria, and cooperation between these bacteria and their host plants allows for greater plant survivability and treatment outcomes in contaminated sites. Bacterially driven PHC bioremediation is attributed to the presence of diverse suites of metabolic genes for aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, along with a broader suite of physiological properties including biosurfactant production, biofilm formation, chemotaxis to hydrocarbons, and flexibility in cell-surface hydrophobicity. In soils impacted by PHC contamination, microbial bioremediation generally relies on the addition of high-energy electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen) and fertilization to supply limiting nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium) in the face of excess PHC carbon. As an alternative, the addition of plants can greatly improve bioremediation rates and outcomes as plants provide microbial habitats, improve soil porosity (thereby increasing mass transfer of substrates and electron acceptors), and exchange limiting nutrients with their microbial counterparts. In return, plant-associated microorganisms improve plant growth by reducing soil toxicity through contaminant removal, producing plant growth promoting metabolites, liberating sequestered plant nutrients from soil, fixing nitrogen, and more generally establishing the foundations of soil nutrient cycling. In a practical and applied sense, the collective action of plants and their associated microorganisms is advantageous for remediation of PHC contaminated soil in terms of overall cost and success rates for in situ implementation in a diversity of environments. Mechanistically, there remain biological unknowns that present challenges for applying bio- and phyto-remediation technologies without having a deep prior understanding of individual target sites. In this review, evidence from traditional and modern omics technologies is discussed to provide a framework for plant-microbe interactions during PHC remediation. The potential for integrating multiple molecular and computational techniques to evaluate linkages between microbial communities, plant communities and ecosystem processes is explored with an eye on improving phytoremediation of PHC contaminated sites.","authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Gkorezis"},{"name":"Matteo Daghio"},{"name":"Andrea Franzetti"},{"name":"Jonathan D Van Hamme"},{"name":"Wouter Sillen"},{"name":"Jaco Vangronsveld"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioremediation"},{"word":"petroleum hydrocarbons"},{"word":"phytoremediation"},{"word":"plant–bacteria assisted remediation"},{"word":"remediation"}]},"article77":{"pmid":"27916925","title":"Microbial Biofilms in Urinary Tract Infections and Prostatitis: Etiology, Pathogenicity, and Combating strategies.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most important causes of morbidity and health care spending affecting persons of all ages.

Robust performance in wastewater treatment and enrichment of PHA-producing biomass was demonstrated under realistic conditions including influent variability during 225days of operation. The IFAS system was found to be advantageous since maintaining nitrification on the biofilm allowed for a relatively low (2days) solids retention time (SRT) for the suspended biomass in the bulk phase.

This study reports the design of a family of eight-residue tryptophan-rich peptides (TetraF2W) obtained by converting the four phenylalanines in temporin-SHf to tryptophans. The temporin-SHf template was identified from the antimicrobial peptide database (http://aps.unmc.edu/AP). Remarkably, the double arginine variant (TetraF2W-RR) was more effective in killing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) USA300, but less cytotoxic to human skin HaCat and kidney HEK293 cells, than the lysine-containing dibasic combinations (KR, RK and KK). Killing kinetics and fluorescence spectroscopy suggest membrane targeting of TetraF2W-RR, making it more difficult for bacteria to develop resistance. Because established biofilms on medical devices are difficult to remove, we chose to covalently immobilize TetraF2W-RR onto the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surface to prevent biofilm formation. The successful surface coating of the peptide is supported by FT-IR and XPS spectroscopies, chemical quantification, and antibacterial assays.

Lactobacillus iners, a fairly recently detected species, is frequently present in the vaginal niche. However, the role of this species in vaginal health is unclear, since it can be detected in normal conditions as well as during vaginal dysbiosis, such as bacterial vaginosis, a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in bacterial diversity and lack of typical lactobacilli. Compared to other Lactobacillus species, L. iners has more complex nutritional requirements and a Gram-variable morphology. L. iners has an unusually small genome (ca. 1 Mbp), indicative of a symbiotic or parasitic lifestyle, in contrast to other lactobacilli that show niche flexibility and genomes of up to 3-4 Mbp. The presence of specific L. iners genes, such as those encoding iron-sulfur proteins and unique σ-factors, reflects a high degree of niche specification. The genome of L. iners strains also encodes inerolysin, a pore-forming toxin related to vaginolysin of Gardnerella vaginalis. Possibly, this organism may have clonal variants that in some cases promote a healthy vagina, and in other cases are associated with dysbiosis and disease.

Biofilm formation progresses through multiple developmental stages beginning with bacterial attachment to a surface, followed by development of microcolonies and finally detachment and dispersal from a mature biofilm as free planktonic bacteria. Tissue damage arising from inflammatory response to biofilm is one of the hallmark features of periodontal disease. A consequence of tissue damage is the release of ATP from within the cell into the extracellular space. Extracellular ATP (eATP) is an example of a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) employed by mammalian cells to elicit inflammatory and damage healing responses. Although, the roles of eATP as a signaling molecule in multi-cellular organisms have been relatively well studied, exogenous ATP also influences bacteria biofilm formation. Since plaque biofilms are continuously exposed to various stresses including exposure to the host damage factors such as eATP, we hypothesized that eATP, in addition to eliciting inflammation could potentially influence the biofilm lifecycle of periodontal associated bacteria. We found that eATP rather than nutritional factors or oxidative stress induced dispersal of Fusobacterium nucleatum, an organism associated with periodontal disease. eATP induced biofilm dispersal through chelating metal ions present in biofilm. Dispersed F. nucleatum biofilm, regardless of natural or induced dispersal by exogenous ATP, were more adhesive and invasive compared to planktonic or biofilm counterparts, and correspondingly activated significantly more pro-inflammatory cytokine production in infected periodontal fibroblasts. Dispersed F. nucleatum also showed higher expression of fadA, a virulence factor implicated in adhesion and invasion, compared to planktonic or biofilm bacteria.

Available reports show that some of the metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) including Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO, CuO, Co3O4, In2O3, MgO, SiO2, ZrO2, Cr2O3, Ni2O3, Mn2O3, CoO, and Nickel oxide have toxicity toward several microorganisms and they could successfully kill numerous bacteria.

It can be considered that in the use of nanomaterials as antimicrobial agents, consideration of many factors remain principal. Antibacterial resistance to common chemical antibacterial agents can be due to long production-consumption cycle, thereby reducing their efficiency, and use of poor quality or fake medicines in undeveloped and developing countries. NPs as antimicrobial agents have become an emerging approach against this challenge, which can establish an effective nanostructure to deliver the antimicrobial agents for targeting the bacterial community efficiently. In addition, they are so potent that microbial pathogens cannot develop resistance to wards them. On the other hand, most of the metal oxide NPs have no toxicity toward humans at effective concentrations used to kill bacterial cells, which thus becomes an advantage for using them in a full scale.

By metabolizing carbohydrates, S. mutans emits extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) that adheres to the tooth surface and forms layers of biofilm. Periodontal disease occurs due to the low pH environment created by S. mutans biofilm, and such an acidic environment gradually erodes tooth enamel. Since the existence of EPS is essential in the formation of biofilm, the in-situ investigation of its generation and distribution in real time is the key to the control and suppression of S. mutans biofilm. Prior studies of the biofilm formation process by fluorescence microscope, scanning electron microscope, or spectroscope have roughly divided the mechanism into three stages: (1) initial attachment; (2) microcolonies; and (3) maturation. However, these analytical methods are incapable to observe real-time changes in different locations of the extracellular matrix, and to analyze mechanical properties for single bacteria in micro and nanoscale. Since atomic force microscopy (AFM) operates by precise control of tip-sample interaction forces in liquid and in air, living microorganisms can be analyzed under near-physiological conditions. Thus, analytical techniques based on AFM constitute powerful tools for the study of biological samples, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this study, we used AFM to quantitatively track the changes of multiple nanomechanical properties of S. mutans, including dissipation energy, adhesion force, deformation, and elastic modulus at different metabolic stages. The data revealed that the bacterial extracellular matrix has a gradient distribution in stickiness, in which different stickiness indicates the variation of EPS compositions, freshness, and metabolic stages. In-situ, time-lapse AFM images showed the local generation and distribution of EPS at different times, in which the highest adhesion distributed along sides of the S. mutans cells. Through time-lapse analysis, we concluded that each contour layer is associated with a dynamic process of cell growth and nutrient consumption, and S. mutans is capable of controlling the priority of EPS secretion at specific locations. The live bacteria exhibited cyclic metabolic activities in the period of 23-34min at the maturation stage of biofilm formation.

Recent work has explored the use of biochar to improve performance of stormwater biofilters under simplified conditions that do not consider potential effects of biofilm development on filter media. The present study investigates the role of biofilm on microbial contaminant removal performance of stormwater biofilters. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were formed in laboratory-scale sand and biochar-modified sand packed columns, which were then challenged with Escherichia coli laden synthetic stormwater containing natural organic matter. Results suggests that the presence of biofilm influences the removal of E. coli. However, the nature of the influence depends on the specific surface area and the relative hydrophobicity of filter media. The distribution of attached bacteria within the columns indicates that removal by filter media varies along the length of the column: the inlet was the primary removal zone regardless of experimental conditions. Findings from this research inform the design of field-scale biofilters for better and consistent performance in removing microbial contaminants from urban stormwater.","authors":[{"name":"A R M Nabiul Afrooz"},{"name":"Alexandria B Boehm"}],"keywords":[]},"article111":{"pmid":"27907122","title":"Biodegradation of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) by a Microbial Consortium in a Continuous Up-Flow Packed-Bed Biofilm Reactor: Kinetic Study, Metabolite Identification and Toxicity Bioassays.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"This study investigated the aerobic biodegradation of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) by a microbial consortium in a continuous up-flow packed-bed biofilm reactor using tezontle stone particles as a supporting material for the biofilm.

Plants have evolved an array of antimicrobial compounds to anticipate and cope with pathogens, of which essential oils (EOs) are widely recognized.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most prevalent pathogens isolated from the airways of CF patients. Mucoid colony morphology has been described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen in CF, but not for S. aureus. From the airways of 8 of 313 CF patients (2.5%) mucoid S. aureus isolates (n = 115) were cultured with a mean persistence of 29 months (range 1 month, 126 months). In contrast to non-mucoid S. aureus, mucoid isolates were strong biofilm formers. The upstream region of the ica operon, which encodes the proteins responsible for the synthesis of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), of mucoid isolates was sequenced. Spa-types of mucoid and non-mucoid strains were identical, but differed between patients. Mucoid isolates carried a 5 bp deletion in the intergenic region between icaR and icaA. During long-term persistence, from two patients subsequent non-mucoid isolates (n = 12) with 5 bp deletions were cultured, which did not produce biofilm. Sequencing of the entire ica operon identified compensatory mutations in various ica-genes including icaA (n = 7), icaD (n = 3) and icaC (n = 2). Six sequential isolates of each of these two patients with non-mucoid and mucoid phenotypes were subjected to whole genome sequencing revealing a very close relationship of the individual patient's isolates. Transformation of strains with vectors expressing the respective wild-type genes restored mucoidy. In contrast to the non-mucoid phenotype, mucoid strains were protected against neutrophilic killing and survived better under starvation conditions.

The extent of morphogenesis in hLF1-11 treated and untreated biofilms was also investigated microscopically. Transcription levels of genes related to cell adhesion, hyphal development and extracellular matrix production were analysed by qRT-PCR in hLF1-11 treated and untreated biofilms.

The results revealed that hLF1-11 exhibited an inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by all C. albicans isolates tested in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of their fluconazole susceptibility. Visual inspection of treated or untreated biofilm cells with an inverted microscope revealed a significant reduction in hyphal formation by hLF1-11 treated cells, as early as 3 hours of incubation. Moreover, hLF1-11 showed a reduced activity on preadherent cells. hLF1-11 induced the down-regulation of biofilm and hyphal-associated genes, which were predominantly regulated via the Ras1-cAMP-Efg1 pathway.

The results indicate that the pathogenicity of S. capitis, S. auricularis, S. lugdunensis, S. cohnii and S. caprae is multi-factorial, involving the ability of these bacteria to adhere to human epithelial cells, form biofilms and invade and destroy human cells.","authors":[{"name":"Ewa Szczuka"},{"name":"Lucyna Jabłońska"},{"name":"Adam Kaznowski"}],"keywords":[]},"article129":{"pmid":"27902306","title":"Description of Gloeomargarita lithophora gen. nov., sp. nov., a thylakoid-bearing, basal-branching cyanobacterium with intracellular carbonates, and proposal for Gloeomargaritales ord. nov.","date":"2019-12-11","abs":"A unicellular cyanobacterium, strain Alchichica-D10, was isolated from microbialites of the alkaline Lake Alchichica, Mexico.

Plants can secrete up to 30% of their fixed carbon via root exudates, thereby feeding the bacteria, and in return the associated B. subtilis bacteria provide the plant with many growth-promoting traits. Formation of a biofilm on the root by matrix-producing B. subtilis is a well-established requirement for long-term colonization. However, we observed that cells start forming a biofilm only several hours after motile cells first settle on the plant. We also found that intact chemotaxis machinery is required for early root colonization by B. subtilis and for plant protection. Arabidopsis thaliana root exudates attract B. subtilis in vitro, an activity mediated by the two characterized chemoreceptors, McpB and McpC, as well as by the orphan receptor TlpC. Nonetheless, bacteria lacking these chemoreceptors are still able to colonize the root, suggesting that other chemoreceptors might also play a role in this process. These observations suggest that A. thaliana actively recruits B. subtilis through root-secreted molecules, and our results stress the important roles of B. subtilis chemoreceptors for efficient colonization of plants in natural environments.

Current methodologies for the quantification of c-di-GMP are typically based on chemical extraction, representing end point measurements. Chemical methodologies also fail to take into consideration the physiological heterogeneity of the biofilm and thus represent an average c-di-GMP concentration across the entire biofilm. To address these problems, a ratiometric, image-based quantification method has been developed based on expression of the green fluorescence protein (GFP) under the control of the c-di-GMP-responsive cdrA promoter (Rybtke, M.

The methodology uses the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) as a biomass indicator and the GFP as a c-di-GMP reporter. Thus, the CFP/GFP ratio gives the effective c-di-GMP per biomass. A binary mask was applied to alleviate background fluorescence, and fluorescence was calibrated against known c-di-GMP concentrations. Using flow cells for biofilm formation, c-di-GMP showed a non-uniform distribution across the biofilm, with concentrated hot spots of c-di-GMP. Additionally, c-di-GMP was found to be localized at the outer boundary of mature colonies in contrast to a uniform distribution in early stage, small colonies. These data demonstrate the application of a method for the in situ, real time quantification of c-di-GMP and show that the amount of this biofilm-regulating second messenger was dynamic with time and colony size, reflecting the extent of biofilm heterogeneity in real time.","authors":[{"name":"Harikrishnan A S Nair"},{"name":"Saravanan Periasamy"},{"name":"Liang Yang"},{"name":"Staffan Kjelleberg"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm development"},{"word":"bioreporter"},{"word":"cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP)"},{"word":"development"},{"word":"image based quantification"},{"word":"nitric oxide"}]},"article136":{"pmid":"30895009","title":"Comparison of the adhesion of Streptococcus sanguinis to commonly used dental alloys stratified by gold content.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of biofilm and plays a key role in the process of adhesion to prosthetic surfaces by facilitating the adhesion of later colonizers.

The work was conducted on 20 urinary catheters from patients ranging from 1.5 to 85 years with catheters that remained in situ for a period of 3 to 20 days. Samples of catheters for culture and SEM and samples of urine were taken at the same time. The correlation between renal conditions and biofilm formation was not significant (p=0.336).

Pelagic and biofilm-associated microbes interact with macroalgal propagules at multiple stages of recruitment, yet these interactions have not been described for Macrocystis pyrifera. Here we investigate the influence of microbes from coastal environments on recruitment of giant kelp, M. pyrifera. Through repeated laboratory experiments, we tested the effects of altered pelagic microbial abundance on the settlement and development of the microscopic propagules of M. pyrifera during recruitment. M. pyrifera zoospores were reared in laboratory microcosms exposed to environmental microbial communities from seawater during the complete haploid stages of the kelp recruitment cycle, including zoospore release, followed by zoospore settlement, to gametophyte germination and development. We altered the microbial abundance states differentially in three independent experiments with repeated trials, where microbes were (a) present or absent in seawater, (b) altered in community composition, and (c) altered in abundance. Within the third experiment, we also tested the effect of nearshore versus offshore microbial communities on the macroalgal propagules. Distinct pelagic microbial communities were collected from two southern California temperate environments reflecting contrasting intensity of human influence, the nearshore Point Loma kelp forest and the offshore Santa Catalina Island kelp forest. The Point Loma kelp forest is a high impacted coastal region adjacent to the populous San Diego Bay; whereas the kelp forest at Catalina Island is a low impacted region of the Channel Islands, 40 km offshore the southern California coast, and is adjacent to a marine protected area. Kelp gametophytes reared with nearshore Point Loma microbes showed lower survival, growth, and deteriorated morphology compared to gametophytes with the offshore Catalina Island microbial community, and these effects were magnified under high microbial abundances. Reducing abundance of Point Loma microbes restored M. pyrifera propagule success. Yet an intermediate microbial abundance was optimal for kelp propagules reared with Catalina Island microbes, suggesting that microbes also have a beneficial influence on kelp. Our study shows that pelagic microbes from nearshore and offshore environments are differentially influencing kelp propagule success, which has significant implications for kelp recruitment and kelp forest ecosystem health.","authors":[{"name":"Megan M Morris"},{"name":"John M Haggerty"},{"name":"Bhavya N Papudeshi"},{"name":"Alejandro A Vega"},{"name":"Matthew S Edwards"},{"name":"Elizabeth A Dinsdale"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Macrocystis pyrifera"},{"word":"gametophytes"},{"word":"kelp recruitment"},{"word":"macroalgae–microbial interaction"},{"word":"microbial ecology"}]},"article151":{"pmid":"27895625","title":"Evaluation of Virulence Factors In vitro, Resistance to Osmotic Stress and Antifungal Susceptibility of Candida tropicalis Isolated from the Coastal Environment of Northeast Brazil.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Several studies have been developed regarding human health risks associated with the recreational use of beaches contaminated with domestic sewage.

In this context, the objective of this study was to characterize C. tropicalis isolates from the sandy beach of Ponta Negra, Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, regarding the expression of in vitro virulence factors, adaptation to osmotic stress and susceptibility to antifungal drugs. We analyzed 62 environmental isolates and observed a great variation among them for the various virulence factors evaluated. In general, environmental isolates were more adherent to human buccal epithelial cells (HBEC) than C. tropicalis ATCC13803 reference strain, and they also showed increased biofilm production. Most of the isolates presented wrinkled phenotypes on Spider medium (34 isolates, 54.8%). The majority of the isolates also showed higher proteinase production than control strains, but low phospholipase activity. In addition, 35 isolates (56.4%) had high hemolytic activity (hemolysis index > 0.55). With regard to C. tropicalis resistance to osmotic stress, 85.4% of the isolates were able to grow in a liquid medium containing 15% sodium chloride. The strains were highly resistant to the azoles tested (fluconazole, voriconazole and itraconazole). Fifteen strains were resistant to the three azoles tested (24.2%). Some strains were also resistant to amphotericin B (14 isolates; 22.6%), while all of them were susceptible for the echinocandins tested, except for a single strain of intermediate susceptibility to micafungin.

Biofilms were shown to facilitate B. subtilis-plant interactions. In this study, we show that different environmental isolates of B. subtilis, all capable of forming biofilms, vary significantly in γ-PGA production. This is possibly due to differential regulation of γ-PGA biosynthesis genes. In many of those environmental isolates, γ-PGA seems to contribute to robustness and complex morphology of the colony biofilms, suggesting a role of γ-PGA in biofilm formation. Our evidence further shows that in selected B. subtilis strains, γ-PGA also plays a role in root colonization by the bacteria, pinpointing a possible function of γ-PGA in B. subtilis-plant interactions.

The most significant virulence factor for S. epidermidis is its ability to form a biofilm, which renders the bacteria highly resistant to host immune responses and antibiotic action. Intercellular adhesion within the biofilm is mediated by the accumulation-associated protein (Aap), a cell wall-anchored protein that self-assembles in a zinc-dependent manner. The C-terminal portion of Aap contains a 135-aa-long, proline/glycine-rich region (PGR) that has not yet been characterized. The region contains a set of 18 nearly identical AEPGKP repeats. Analysis of the PGR using biophysical techniques demonstrated the region is a highly extended, intrinsically disordered polypeptide with unusually high polyproline type II helix propensity. In contrast to many intrinsically disordered polypeptides, there was a minimal temperature dependence of the global conformational state of PGR in solution as measured by analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering. Furthermore, PGR was resistant to conformational collapse or α-helix formation upon the addition of the osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide or the cosolvent 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. Collectively, these results suggest PGR functions as a resilient, extended stalk that projects the rest of Aap outward from the bacterial cell wall, promoting intercellular adhesion between cells in the biofilm.

At the time of this writing, the phylum Actinobacteria consisted of only one class, Actinobacteria, including five subclasses, 10 orders, 56 families, and 330 genera. Moreover, new taxa of this phylum continue to be discovered. Korean actinobacterial species with a valid name has been reported from 1995 as Tsukamurella inchonensis isolated from a clinical specimen. In 1997, Streptomyces seoulensis was validated with the isolate from the natural Korean environment. Until Feb. 2016, 256 actinobacterial species with valid names originated from Korean territory were listed on LPSN. The species were affiliated with three subclasses (Acidimicrobidae, Actinobacteridae, and Rubrobacteridae), four orders (Acidimicrobiales, Actinomycetales, Bifidobacteriales, and Solirubrobacterales), 12 suborders, 36 families, and 93 genera. Most of the species belonged to the subclass Actinobacteridae, and almost of the members of this subclass were affiliated with the order Actinomycetales. A number of novel isolates belonged to the families Nocardioidaceae, Microbacteriaceae, Intrasporangiaceae, and Streptomycetaceae as well as the genera Nocardioides, Streptomyces, and Microbacterium. Twenty-six novel genera and one novel family, Motilibacteraceae, were created first with Korean indigenous isolates. Most of the Korean indigenous actionobacterial species were isolated from natural environments such as soil, seawater, tidal flat sediment, and fresh-water. A considerable number of species were isolated from artificial resources such as fermented foods, wastewater, compost, biofilm, and water-cooling systems or clinical specimens. Korean indigenous actinobacterial species were isolated from whole territory of Korea, and especially a large number of species were from Jeju, Gyeonggi, Jeonnam, Daejeon, and Chungnam.

Allee effect decides the extinction or conservation of a microbial population and thus appears to be an important criterion in population ecology. The underlying factor of Allee effect that decides the stabilization and extinction of a particular population density is the threshold or the critical density of their abundance. According to Allee, microbial populations exhibit a definite, critical or threshold density, beyond which the population fitness of a particular population increases with the rise in population density and below it, the population fitness goes down with the decrease in population density. In particular, microbial population displays advantageous traits such as biofilm formation, expression of virulence genes, spore formation and many more only at a high population density. It has also been observed that microorganisms exhibiting a lower population density undergo complete extinction from the residual microbial ecosystem. In reference to Allee effect, decrease in population density or size introduces deleterious mutations among the population density through genetic drift. Mutations are carried forward to successive generations resulting in its accumulation among the population density thus reducing its microbial fitness and thereby increasing the risk of extinction of a particular microbial population. However, when the microbial load is high, the chance of genetic drift is less, and through the process of biofilm formation, the cooperation existing among the microbial population increases that increases the microbial fitness. Thus, the high microbial population through the formation of microbial biofilm stabilizes the ecosystem by increasing fitness. Taken together, microbial fitness shows positive correlation with the ecosystem conservation and negative correlation with ecosystem extinction.","authors":[{"name":"Madhurankhi Goswami"},{"name":"Purnita Bhattacharyya"},{"name":"Prosun Tribedi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Allee effect"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cooperativity"},{"word":"Fitness"},{"word":"Microbial threshold density"}]},"article174":{"pmid":"27887972","title":"Radon as a natural tracer for underwater cave exploration.","date":"2017-07-07","abs":"The Molnár János cave is one of the largest hypogenic caves of the Buda Thermal Karst (Budapest, Hungary) and mainly characterized by water-filled passages.

Since the area under the curve divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration is the best pharmacodynamic predictor of its efficacy, we used tigecycline at high dose, in order to optimize its efficacy and achieve implant retention in 3 patients who refused prosthesis exchange. All patients with prosthetic joint infections treated at our Institution are prospectively registered in a database. Three patients with early prosthetic joint infection of total hip arthroplasty due to multidrug resistant A. baumannii were treated with debridement, antibiotics and implant retention, using a high maintenance dose of tigecycline (100 mg every 12 hours). The cases were retrospectively reviewed. All patients signed informed consent for receiving off-label use of tigecycline. Tigecycline was well tolerated, allowing its administration at high maintenance dose for a median of 40 days (range 30-60). Two patients were then switched to minocycline at standard doses for a median of 3.3 months in order to complete treatment. Currently, none of the patients showed relapse. Increasing the dose of tigecycline could be considered as a means to better attain pharmacodynamic targets in patients with severe or difficult-to-treat infections. Tigecycline at high maintenance dose might be useful when retention of the implant is attempted for treatment for prosthetic joint infections due to multidrug resistant Acinetobacter.

DJK-5 was able to significantly prevent biofilm formation over 3 days (P = 0.000). After 72 hours of exposure, DJK-5 significantly reduced and almost completely prevented plaque biofilm production by more than 90% of biovolume compared to untreated controls (P = 0.000). The proportion of dead biofilm bacteria at the 10 μg/mL DJK-5 concentration was similar for 1- and 3-day-old biofilms, whereby >86% of the bacteria were killed.

Also the hydrogen acceptor number and the molecular flexibility, as assessed by the number of rotatable bounds, have emerged as the most relevant descriptors for SrtA affinity. The Bemis-Murcko scaffolding revealed favoured scaffolds as containing at least two ring structures bonded directly or merged in a condensed cycle. This data represent a valuable tool for identifying new potent SrtA inhibitors, potential anti-virulence agents targeted against Gram-positive bacteria, including multiresistant strains.","authors":[{"name":"Georgiana Nitulescu"},{"name":"Anca Zanfirescu"},{"name":"Octavian Tudorel Olaru"},{"name":"Isabela Madalina Nicorescu"},{"name":"George Mihai Nitulescu"},{"name":"Denisa Margina"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bemis-Murcko scaffolding"},{"word":"Gram-positive bacteria"},{"word":"anti-virulence drugs"},{"word":"classification method"},{"word":"cysteine transpeptidases"},{"word":"hydrogen bond acceptors"},{"word":"rotatable bonds"}]},"article193":{"pmid":"27879420","title":"Saliva and Serum Protein Exchange at the Tooth Enamel Surface.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The acquired enamel pellicle is an oral, fluid-derived protein layer that forms on the tooth surface. It is a biologically and clinically important integument that protects teeth against enamel demineralization, and abrasion. Tooth surfaces are exposed to different proteinaceous microenvironments depending on the enamel location. For instance, tooth surfaces close to the gingival sulcus contact serum proteins that emanate via this sulcus, which may impact pellicle composition locally. The aims of this study were to define the major salivary and serum components that adsorb to hydroxyapatite, to study competition among them, and to obtain preliminary evidence in an in vivo saliva/serum pellicle model. Hydroxyapatite powder was incubated with saliva and serum, and the proteins that adsorbed were identified by mass spectrometry. To study competition, saliva and serum proteins were labeled with CyDyes, mixed in various proportions, and incubated with hydroxyapatite. In vivo competition was assessed using a split-mouth design, with half the buccal tooth surfaces coated with serum and the other half with saliva. After exposure to the oral environment for 0 min, 30 min and 2 h, the pellicles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In pure saliva- or serum-derived pellicles, 82 and 84 proteins were identified, respectively. When present concomitantly, salivary protein adsorbers effectively competed with serum protein adsorbers for the hydroxyapatite surface. Specifically, acidic proline-rich protein, cystatin, statherin and protein S100-A9 proteins competed off apolipoproteins, complement C4-A, haptoglobin, transthyretin and serotransferrin. In vivo evidence further supported the replacement of serum proteins by salivary proteins. In conclusion, although significant numbers of serum proteins emanate from the gingival sulcus, their ability to participate in dental pellicle formation is likely reduced in the presence of strong salivary protein adsorbers. The functional properties of the acquired enamel pellicle will therefore be mostly dictated by the salivary component.","authors":[{"name":"D Heller"},{"name":"E J Helmerhorst"},{"name":"F G Oppenheim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"dental enamel"},{"word":"dental pellicle"},{"word":"gingival crevicular fluid"},{"word":"gingivitis"},{"word":"proteomics"}]},"article194":{"pmid":"27879329","title":"Phenotypic Profiling Reveals that Candida albicans Opaque Cells Represent a Metabolically Specialized Cell State Compared to Default White Cells.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"The white-opaque switch is a bistable, epigenetic transition affecting multiple traits in Candida albicans including mating, immunogenicity, and niche specificity. To compare how the two cell states respond to external cues, we examined the fitness, phenotypic switching, and filamentation properties of white cells and opaque cells under 1,440 different conditions at 25°C and 37°C. We demonstrate that white and opaque cells display striking differences in their integration of metabolic and thermal cues, so that the two states exhibit optimal fitness under distinct conditions. White cells were fitter than opaque cells under a wide range of environmental conditions, including growth at various pHs and in the presence of chemical stresses or antifungal drugs. This difference was exacerbated at 37°C, consistent with white cells being the default state of C. albicans in the mammalian host. In contrast, opaque cells showed greater fitness than white cells under select nutritional conditions, including growth on diverse peptides at 25°C. We further demonstrate that filamentation is significantly rewired between the two states, with white and opaque cells undergoing filamentous growth in response to distinct external cues. Genetic analysis was used to identify signaling pathways impacting the white-opaque transition both in vitro and in a murine model of commensal colonization, and three sugar sensing pathways are revealed as regulators of the switch. Together, these findings establish that white and opaque cells are programmed for differential integration of metabolic and thermal cues and that opaque cells represent a more metabolically specialized cell state than the default white state.","authors":[{"name":"Iuliana V Ene"},{"name":"Matthew B Lohse"},{"name":"Adrian V Vladu"},{"name":"Joachim Morschhäuser"},{"name":"Alexander D Johnson"},{"name":"Richard J Bennett"}],"keywords":[]},"article195":{"pmid":"27879061","title":"Patterned SLIPS for the Formation of Arrays of Biofilm Microclusters with Defined Geometries.","date":"2017-12-01","abs":"Biofilms represent an immense problem in medicine due to their strong drug-resistant properties and inherent stress-response activities.

The method is based on the formation of water-infused hydrophilic porous polymer areas with precise geometries separated by slippery lubricant-infused porous surface (SLIPS). Due to the SLIPS' biofilm repellent properties, multiple identical 3D biofilm clusters are formed in the hydrophilic patches that can be used for biofilm screening. Formation of biofilm microcluster arrays of different bacterial strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the SLIPS micropatterns is investigated. Critical parameters influencing minimal adhesive regions for biofilm attachment and minimal SLIPS dimensions to avoid biofilm adhesion are studied.

In contrast, cells defective in EPS production hyper-reverse their moving direction and show severe defects in S-motility. Surprisingly, S-motility and wild-type reversal frequency are restored in double mutants that are defective in both EPS production and the Frz chemosensory system, indicating that EPS regulates cellular reversal in parallel to the Frz pathway.

These AMPs have been organized into 6 functional groups, 1 of which, cationic AMPs, has received extensive attention in recent years for their promise as potential antibiotics. The goal of this review is to describe recent advances in our understanding of the diverse mechanisms of action of cationic AMPs and the bacterial resistance against these peptides. The recently developed peptide GL13K is used as an example to illustrate many of the discussed concepts. Cationic AMPs typically exhibit an amphipathic conformation, which allows increased interaction with negatively charged bacterial membranes. Peptides undergo changes in conformation and aggregation state in the presence of membranes; conversely, lipid conformation and packing can adapt to the presence of peptides. As a consequence, a single peptide can act through several mechanisms depending on the peptide's structure, the peptide:lipid ratio, and the properties of the lipid membrane. Accumulating evidence shows that in addition to acting at the cell membrane, AMPs may act on the cell wall, inhibit protein folding or enzyme activity, or act intracellularly. Therefore, once a peptide has reached the cell wall, cell membrane, or its internal target, the difference in mechanism of action on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria may be less pronounced than formerly assumed. While AMPs should not cause widespread resistance due to their preferential attack on the cell membrane, in cases where specific protein targets are involved, the possibility exists for genetic mutations and bacterial resistance. Indeed, the potential clinical use of AMPs has raised the concern that resistance to therapeutic AMPs could be associated with resistance to endogenous host-defense peptides. Current evidence suggests that this is a rare event that can be overcome by subtle structural modifications of an AMP.","authors":[{"name":"B Bechinger"},{"name":"S-U Gorr"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial agents"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance bacterial"},{"word":"cell membrane"},{"word":"cell wall"},{"word":"gram negative bacteria"},{"word":"gram positive bacteria"}]},"article216":{"pmid":"27872164","title":"Functional consequences of B-repeat sequence variation in the staphylococcal biofilm protein Aap: deciphering the assembly code.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogen that can form robust biofilms that render the bacteria resistant to antibiotic action and immune responses.

Thus, compounds which have the ability to degrade biofilms, but not host tissue components, are highly sought after for clinical applications. In this study, we examined the efficacy of two glycoside hydrolases, α-amylase and cellulase, which break down complex polysaccharides, to effectively disrupt Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa monoculture and coculture biofilms. We hypothesized that glycoside hydrolase therapy would significantly reduce EPS biomass and convert bacteria to their planktonic state, leaving them more susceptible to conventional antimicrobials. Treatment of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms, grown in vitro and in vivo, with solutions of α-amylase and cellulase resulted in significant reductions in biomass, dissolution of the biofilm, and an increase in the effectiveness of subsequent antibiotic treatments. These data suggest that glycoside hydrolase therapy represents a potential safe, effective, and new avenue of treatment for biofilm-related infections.","authors":[{"name":"Derek Fleming"},{"name":"Laura Chahin"},{"name":"Kendra Rumbaugh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chronic wounds"},{"word":"dispersal"},{"word":"glycoside hydrolase"}]},"article218":{"pmid":"27872031","title":"Penile Prosthesis Infections-A Review of Risk Factors, Prevention, and Treatment.","date":"2018-10-04","abs":"Inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) surgery has been performed for more than 40 years.

However, the toxicity response mechanism of biofilm to NP exposure may be different from that of activated sludge due to the denser and stronger microbial aggregate structure of biofilm. Thus, in this study, the response to CuO NPs of wastewater biofilm collected from a rotating biological contactor was investigated. Short-term exposure (24h) to CuO NPs led to a great loss in cell viability, and SEM-EDS images revealed that the nano-CuO aggregates were not transformed to Cu-S species in the biofilm samples. In response, more extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) (especially loosely bound-EPS) was produced in wastewater biofilm exposed to CuO NPs, with a higher content of protein compared to polysaccharides. The shifts of fluorescence intensity and peak locations in 3D-EEM fluorescence spectra indicated chemical changes of the EPS components. FT-IR analysis revealed that exposure to nano-CuO had more distinct effects on the functional groups of proteins and polysaccharides in LB-EPS. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed that CuO NPs enhanced bacterial diversity. The bacterial community structure significantly shifted, with a significantly increased abundance of Comamonas, a slight increase in Zoogloea, and a notable decrease in Flavobacterium. The shifts of these dominant genera may be associated with altered EPS production, which might result in microbial community function fluctuations.

The results indicated that the MBSBR exhibited good removal of chemical oxygen demand (92.43%) and nitrogen (83.73%) when DO concentration was 2.5 mg/L.

Microelectrode measurements showed that the thickness of oxygen penetration increased from 1.2 to 2.6 mm when the DO concentration (from 1.5 mg/L to 5.5 mg/L) in the system increased. Oxygen diffusion was not significantly limited by the boundary layer surrounding the carrier and had the largest slope when DO concentration was 2.5 mg/L.

Biofilms are of particular concern with Candida albicans, one of the leading opportunistic fungal pathogens of humans. C. albicans biofilms include yeast and filamentous cells that are surrounded by an extracellular matrix, and they are intrinsically resistant to antifungal drugs such that resolving biofilm infections often requires surgery to remove the contaminated device. C. albicans biofilms form through a regulated process of adhesion to surfaces, filamentation, maturation, and ultimately dispersion. To uncover new strategies to block the initial stages of biofilm formation, we utilized a functional genomic approach to identify genes that modulate C. albicans adherence. We screened a library of 1,481 double barcoded doxycycline-repressible conditional gene expression strains covering ~25% of the C. albicans genome. We identified five genes for which transcriptional repression impaired adherence, including: ARC18, PMT1, MNN9, SPT7, and orf19.831. The most severe adherence defect was observed upon transcriptional repression of ARC18, which encodes a member of the Arp2/3 complex that is involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis. Depletion of components of the Arp2/3 complex not only impaired adherence, but also caused reduced biofilm formation, increased cell surface hydrophobicity, and increased exposure of cell wall chitin and β-glucans. Reduced function of the Arp2/3 complex led to impaired cell wall integrity and activation of Rho1-mediated cell wall stress responses, thereby causing cell wall remodelling and reduced adherence. Thus, we identify important functional relationships between cell wall stress responses and a novel mechanism that controls adherence and biofilm formation, thereby illuminating novel strategies to cripple a leading fungal pathogen of humans.","authors":[{"name":"Jason A Lee"},{"name":"Nicole Robbins"},{"name":"Jinglin L Xie"},{"name":"Troy Ketela"},{"name":"Leah E Cowen"}],"keywords":[]},"article227":{"pmid":"27870863","title":"Characteristics of Aspergillus fumigatus in Association with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in an In Vitro Model of Mixed Biofilm.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Biofilms are communal structures of microorganisms that have long been associated with a variety of persistent infections poorly responding to conventional antibiotic or antifungal therapy.

The combination of enzymatic studies concerning the PPIase and chaperone activities of each mutant protein, with structural analyses based on 3D models, provided further insights into the effects of the mutations on the function of PpiB and showed the importance of structural features in addition to the catalytic site, for its in vivo role.","authors":[{"name":"Aggeliki Skagia"},{"name":"Eleni Vezyri"},{"name":"Markezina Sigala"},{"name":"Areti Kokkinou"},{"name":"Michael Karpusas"},{"name":"Anastasia Venieraki"},{"name":"Panagiotis Katinakis"},{"name":"Maria Dimou"}],"keywords":[]},"article240":{"pmid":"27868317","title":"Comparative testing of disinfectant efficacy on planktonic bacteria and bacterial biofilms using a new assay based on kinetic analysis of metabolic activity.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The aim of our study was to develop a new reproducible method for disinfectant efficacy testing on bacterial biofilms and to evaluate the efficacy of different disinfectants against biofilms.

While the causes for this post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms are unclear, one possibility is due to Borrelia burgdorferi persisters that are not effectively killed by current antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin used to treat Lyme disease. A previous study showed that four rounds of ceftriaxone pulse dosing treatment eradicated B. burgdorferi persisters in vitro using a relatively young late log phase culture (5 day old). In this study, we investigated if ceftriaxone pulse dosing could also eradicate B. burgdorferi persisters in older stationary phase cultures (10 day old) enriched with more resistant microcolony form of persisters. We found that ceftriaxone pulse dosing could only eradicate planktonic log phase B. burgdorferi spirochetal forms and round body forms but not more resistant aggregated biofilm-like microcolony persisters enriched in stationary phase cultures. Moreover, we found that not all drugs are suitable for pulse dosing, with bactericidal drugs ceftriaxone and cefuroxime being more appropriate for pulse dosing than bacteriostatic drug doxycycline and persister drug daptomycin. We also showed that drug combination pulse dosing treatment was more effective than single drug pulse dosing. Importantly, we demonstrate that pulse dosing treatment impaired the activity of the persister drug daptomycin and its drug combination against B. burgdorferi persisters and that the most effective way to kill the more resistant biofilm-like microcolonies is the daptomycin/doxycycline/ceftriaxone triple drug combination without pulse dosing. Our findings indicate pulse dosing may not always work as a general principle but rather depends on the specific drugs used, with cidal drugs being more appropriate for pulse dosing than static or persister drugs, and that drug combination approach with persister drugs is more effective at killing the more resistant microcolony form of persisters than pulse dosing. These observations may have implications for more effective treatment of Lyme disease. Future studies are required to validate these findings in animal models of B. burgdorferi persistence.","authors":[{"name":"Jie Feng"},{"name":"Shuo Zhang"},{"name":"Wanliang Shi"},{"name":"Ying Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Borrelia burgdorferi"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"drug combination"},{"word":"persisters"},{"word":"pulse dosing"}]},"article245":{"pmid":"27866628","title":"Production of gold nanoparticles by electrode-respiring Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The goal of this work was to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using electrode-respiring Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms.

Advancement in these areas could result in the biosynthesis of NPs that are suitable for practical applications, especially in drug delivery and biocatalysis.

Polyamines, including norspermidine, play central roles in bacterial biofilm development, but have also recently been shown to inhibit biofilm formation in select strains of various pathogenic bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the biofilm dispersive and inhibitory activities of norspermidine against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii(n = 4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4) associated with chronic extremity wound infections using the semi-quantitative 96-well plate method and confocal laser microscopy. In addition to the antibiofilm activity, biocompatibility of norspermidine was also evaluated by measuring toxicity in vitro to human cell lines and whole porcine tissue explants using MTT viability assay and histological analysis. Norspermidine (5-20 mM) had variable dispersive and inhibitory activity on biofilms which was dependent on both the strain and species. Of the clinical bacterial species evaluated herein, A. baumannii isolates were the most sensitive to the effect of norspermidine, which was in part due to the inhibitory effects of norspermidine on bacterial motility and expression of genes involved in the production of homoserine lactones and quorum sensing molecules both essential for biofilm formation. Importantly, exposure of cell lines and whole tissues to norspermidine for prolonged periods of time (≥24 h) was observed to reduce viability and alter tissue histology in a time and concentration dependent manner, with 20 mM exposure having the greatest negative effects on both tissues and individual cell lines. Collectively our findings demonstrate that, similar to other polyamines, norspermidine displays both inhibitory and dispersive activities on biofilms of clinical multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates, in particular for strains of A. baumannii. Additionally our findings suggest that direct application may be considered on tissues, albeit for limited exposure times.","authors":[{"name":"Anthony P Cardile"},{"name":"Ronald L Woodbury"},{"name":"Carlos J Sanchez"},{"name":"Sandra C Becerra"},{"name":"Rebecca A Garcia"},{"name":"Katrin Mende"},{"name":"Joseph C Wenke"},{"name":"Kevin S Akers"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm dispersal"},{"word":"Biofilm inhibition"},{"word":"Norspermidine"},{"word":"Polyamine"},{"word":"Wound infection"}]},"article252":{"pmid":"27864779","title":"Activity of novel inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important pathogens causing chronic biofilm infections.

In the present study, we screened for inhibitors of S. aureus biofilm formation using a natural product library from the Korea Chemical Bank (KCB). Screening by crystal violet-based biomass staining assay identified hit compounds. Further examination of antibiofilm properties of these compounds was conducted and led to the identification of celastrol and telithromycin. In vitro, both celastrol and telithromycin were toxic to planktonic S. aureus and also active against a clinical methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolate. The effect of the compounds on preformed biofilms of clinical MRSA isolates was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which revealed the absence of typical biofilm architecture. In addition, celastrol and telithromycin inhibited the production of extracellular protein at selected sub-MIC concentrations, which revealed the reduced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secretion. Celastrol exhibited greater cytotoxicity than telithromycin. These data suggest that the hit compounds, especially telithromycin, could be considered novel inhibitors of S. aureus biofilm.

The taxonomy of all strains was confirmed or inferred via the analysis of ca. 1,450-bp 16S rRNA gene sequences using a combination of bioinformatic and phylogenetic approaches. Taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships between the respective treponeme strains were further investigated by analyzing individual and concatenated flaA (1,074-nucleotide [nt]), recA (1,377-nt), and pyrH (696-nt) gene sequence data sets.

Our results reveal a novel method to culture electroactive bacteria in which every single cell in the medium could be instantaneously wired to a fluid-like electrode. Direct extracellular electron transfer is occurring but with a new paradigm behind the bacteria-electrode interaction.","authors":[{"name":"Sara Tejedor-Sanz"},{"name":"Jose Rodrigo Quejigo"},{"name":"Antonio Berná"},{"name":"Abraham Esteve-Núñez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioelectrochemistry"},{"word":"extracellular electron transfer"},{"word":"fluidized bed"},{"word":"geobacter"},{"word":"microbial electrochemistry"}]},"article263":{"pmid":"27860429","title":"Antibacterial-nanocomposite bone filler based on silver nanoparticles and polysaccharides.","date":"2019-10-08","abs":"Injectable bone fillers represent an attractive strategy for the treatment of bone defects. These injectable materials should be biocompatible, capable of supporting cell growth and possibly able to exert antibacterial effects. In this work, nanocomposite microbeads based on alginate, chitlac, hydroxyapatite and silver nanoparticles were prepared and characterized. The dried microbeads displayed a rapid swelling in contact with simulated body fluid and maintained their integrity for more than 30 days. The evaluation of silver leakage from the microbeads showed that the antibacterial metal is slowly released in saline solution, with less than 6% of silver released after 1 week. Antibacterial tests proved that the microbeads displayed bactericidal effects toward Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and were also able to damage pre-formed bacterial biofilms. On the other hand, the microbeads did not exert any cytotoxic effect towards osteoblast-like cells. After characterization of the microbeads bioactivity, a possible means to embed them in a fluid medium was explored in order to obtain an injectable paste. Upon suspension of the particles in alginate solution or alginate/hyaluronic acid mixtures, a homogenous and time-stable paste was obtained. Mechanical tests enabled to quantify the extrusion forces from surgical syringes, pointing out the proper injectability of the material. This novel antibacterial bone filler appears as a promising material for the treatment of bone defects, in particular when possible infections could compromise the bone-healing process.

Bacteria in biofilms are highly tolerant of antimicrobials, and little data exist to guide the choice of anti-biofilm wound therapy. Cadexomer iodine (CI) was recently reported to have superior efficacy compared to diverse wound dressings against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in an ex vivo model. In the current study, the strong performance of CI vs. P. aeruginosa biofilm was confirmed using colony and colony drip-flow in vitro wound biofilm models. Similar in vitro efficacy of CI was also demonstrated against mature Staphylococcus aureus biofilms using the same models. Additionally, the rapid kill of mature S. aureus and P. aeruginosa colony biofilms was visualized by confocal microscopy using Live/Dead fluorescent stains. Superior in vitro efficacy of CI vs. staphylococcal biofilms was further demonstrated against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) using multiple biofilm models with log reduction, Live/Dead, and metabolic endpoints. Comparator antimicrobial dressings, including silver-based dressings used throughout and other active agents used in individual models, elucidated only limited effects against the mature biofilms. Given the promising in vitro activity, CI was tested in an established mouse model of MRSA wound biofilm. CI had significantly greater impact on MRSA biofilm in mouse wounds than silver dressings or mupirocin based on Gram-stained histology sections and quantitative microbiology from biopsy samples (>4 log reduction in CFU/g vs. 0.7-1.6, p < 0.0001).

Areas covered: Unfortunately, a standardized methodological approach of biofilm models has not been adopted leading to a large disparity between testing conditions. This has made it almost impossible to compare data across multiple laboratories, leaving large gaps in the evidence. Furthermore, many biofilm models testing anti-biofilm strategies aimed at the medical arena have not considered the matter of relevance to an intended application.

In response to this, microorganisms have developed various strategies to withstand environmental conditions that limit active growth. Endospore-forming Firmicutes (EFF) deploy a myriad of survival strategies in order to resist adverse conditions. Like many bacterial groups, they can form biofilms and detect nutrient scarcity through chemotaxis. Moreover, within this paraphyletic group of Firmicutes, ecophysiological optima are diverse. Nonetheless, a response to adversity that delimits this group is the formation of wet-heat resistant spores. These strategies are energetically demanding and therefore might affect the biological success of EFF. Therefore, we hypothesize that abundance and diversity of EFF should be maximized in those environments in which the benefits of these survival strategies offsets the energetic cost. In order to address this hypothesis, geothermal and mineral springs and drillings were selected because in these environments of steep physicochemical gradients, diversified survival strategies may become a successful strategy.We collected 71 samples from geothermal and mineral environments characterized by none (null), single or multiple limiting environmental factors (temperature, pH, UV radiation, and specific mineral composition). To measure success, we quantified EFF gene copy numbers (GCN; spo0A gene) in relation to total bacterial GCN (16S rRNA gene), as well as the contribution of EFF to community composition. The quantification showed that relative GCN for EFF reached up to 20% at sites characterized by multiple limiting environmental factors, whereas it corresponded to less than 1% at sites with one or no limiting environmental factor. Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene supports a higher contribution of EFF at sites with multiple limiting factors. Community composition suggested a combination of phylotypes for which active growth could be expected, and phylotypes that are most likely in the state of endospores, in all the sites. In summary, our results suggest that diversified survival strategies, including sporulation and metabolic adaptations, explain the biological success of EFF in geothermal and natural springs, and that multiple extreme environmental factors favor the prevalence of EFF.","authors":[{"name":"Sevasti Filippidou"},{"name":"Tina Wunderlin"},{"name":"Thomas Junier"},{"name":"Nicole Jeanneret"},{"name":"Cristina Dorador"},{"name":"Veronica Molina"},{"name":"David R Johnson"},{"name":"Pilar Junier"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA gene"},{"word":"Clostridium"},{"word":"Firmicutes"},{"word":"endospores"},{"word":"geothermal springs"},{"word":"mineral springs"},{"word":"qPCR"},{"word":"spo0A"}]},"article273":{"pmid":"27857168","title":"Osteogenic and bactericidal surfaces from hydrothermal titania nanowires on titanium substrates.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Nanotopographical cues on Ti have been shown to elicit different cell responses such as cell differentiation and selective growth.

In the current study, an attempt was made to evaluate soil bacteria from an extreme environment, volcano soils, based on plant growth promoting and abiotic stress mitigating characteristics. The screening led to the isolation of eight (NBRISH4, NBRISH6, NBRISH10, NBRISH11, NBRISH13, NBRISH14, NBRISH16 and NBRISH26) bacterial isolates capable of withstanding stresses, namely temperature (up to 45 °C), salt (up to 2 M NaCl) and drought (up to 60% Poly Ethylene Glycol 6000) in vitro. Further, the selected isolates were notable for their in vitro temporal performance with regards to survival (in terms of colony count), phosphate solubilisation, biofilm formation, auxin, alginate and exo-polysaccharide production abilities under abiotic stresses i.e. 40 °C temperature; 500 mM NaCl salt and drought (PEG) conditions. In vivo seed treatments of individual selected bacteria to maize plants resulted into significant enhancement in root and shoot length, root and shoot fresh and dry weight and number of leaves per plant.

Essential oils are compounds derived from plant material that have a potential to be used in natural food preservation in the future since they are natural antimicrobials. Bacterial biofilms are particularly resilient towards biocides, and preservatives that effectively eradicate biofilms are therefore needed. In this study, we test the antibacterial properties of emulsion-encapsulated and unencapsulated isoeugenol against biofilms of Lis. monocytogenes, S. aureus, P. fluorescens and Leu. mesenteroides in tryptic soy broth and carrot juice. We show that emulsion encapsulation enhances the antimicrobial properties of isoeugenol against biofilms in media but not in carrot juice. Some of the isoeugenol emulsions were coated with chitosan, and treatment of biofilms with these emulsions disrupted the biofilm structure. Furthermore, we show that addition of the surfactant Tween 80, which is commonly used to disperse oils in food, hampers the antibacterial properties of isoeugenol. This finding highlights that common food additives, such as surfactants, may have an adverse effect on the antibacterial activity of preservatives. Isoeugenol is a promising candidate as a future food preservative because it works almost equally well against planktonic bacteria and biofilms.

However, the precise role played by each individual component of this complex QS circuit in the control of virulence remains to be elucidated. Key components of the pqs QS system are 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (HHQ), 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (PQS), 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO), the transcriptional regulator PqsR and the PQS-effector element PqsE. To define the individual contribution of each of these components to QS-mediated regulation, transcriptomic analyses were performed and validated on engineered P. aeruginosa strains in which the biosynthesis of 2-alkyl-4-quinolones (AQs) and expression of pqsE and pqsR have been uncoupled, facilitating the identification of the genes controlled by individual pqs system components. The results obtained demonstrate that i) the PQS biosynthetic precursor HHQ triggers a PqsR-dependent positive feedback loop that leads to the increased expression of only the pqsABCDE operon, ii) PqsE is involved in the regulation of diverse genes coding for key virulence determinants and biofilm development, iii) PQS promotes AQ biosynthesis, the expression of genes involved in the iron-starvation response and virulence factor production via PqsR-dependent and PqsR-independent pathways, and iv) HQNO does not influence transcription and hence does not function as a QS signal molecule. Overall this work has facilitated identification of the specific regulons controlled by individual pqs system components and uncovered the ability of PQS to contribute to gene regulation independent of both its ability to activate PqsR and to induce the iron-starvation response.","authors":[{"name":"Giordano Rampioni"},{"name":"Marilena Falcone"},{"name":"Stephan Heeb"},{"name":"Emanuela Frangipani"},{"name":"Matthew P Fletcher"},{"name":"Jean-Frédéric Dubern"},{"name":"Paolo Visca"},{"name":"Livia Leoni"},{"name":"Miguel Cámara"},{"name":"Paul Williams"}],"keywords":[]},"article291":{"pmid":"27851809","title":"A Genome-Wide Transcriptional Analysis of Yeast-Hyphal Transition in Candida tropicalis by RNA-Seq.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Candida tropicalis is considered as the leading pathogen in nosocomial fungemia and hepatosplenic fungal infections in patients with cancer, particularly in leukemia.

Comparison of Tn-seq results from laboratory cultures and from monoinoculated worker bees reveal that 519 of 2,226 protein-coding genes in S. alvi are essential in culture, whereas 399 are not essential but are beneficial for gut colonization. Genes facilitating colonization fall into three broad functional categories: extracellular interactions, metabolism, and stress responses. Extracellular components with strong fitness benefits in vivo include trimeric autotransporter adhesins, O antigens, and type IV pili (T4P). Experiments with T4P mutants establish that T4P in S. alvi likely function in attachment and biofilm formation, with knockouts experiencing a competitive disadvantage in vivo. Metabolic processes promoting colonization include essential amino acid biosynthesis and iron acquisition pathways, implying nutrient scarcity within the hindgut environment. Mechanisms to deal with various stressors, such as for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and protein quality control, are also critical in vivo.

Typically, both bacteria and viruses strongly associate with particulate matter present in freshwater, estuarine and marine environments. This association tends to be stronger in finer textured sediments and is strongly influenced by the type and quantity of clay minerals and organic matter present. Binding to particle surfaces promotes the persistence of bacteria in the environment by offering physical and chemical protection from biotic and abiotic stresses. How bacterial and viral viability and pathogenicity is influenced by surface attachment requires further study. Typically, long-term association with surfaces including sediments induces bacteria to enter a viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state. Inherent methodological challenges of quantifying VBNC bacteria may lead to the frequent under-reporting of their abundance in sediments. The implications of this in a quantitative risk assessment context remain unclear. Similarly, sediments can harbor significant amounts of enteric viruses, however, the factors regulating their persistence remains poorly understood. Quantification of viruses in sediment remains problematic due to our poor ability to recover intact viral particles from sediment surfaces (typically <10%), our inability to distinguish between infective and damaged (non-infective) viral particles, aggregation of viral particles, and inhibition during qPCR. This suggests that the true viral titre in sediments may be being vastly underestimated. In turn, this is limiting our ability to understand the fate and transport of viruses in sediments. Model systems (e.g., human cell culture) are also lacking for some key viruses, preventing our ability to evaluate the infectivity of viruses recovered from sediments (e.g., norovirus). The release of particle-bound bacteria and viruses into the water column during sediment resuspension also represents a risk to water quality. In conclusion, our poor process level understanding of viral/bacterial-sediment interactions combined with methodological challenges is limiting the accurate source apportionment and quantitative microbial risk assessment for pathogenic organisms associated with sediments in aquatic environments.","authors":[{"name":"Francis Hassard"},{"name":"Ceri L Gwyther"},{"name":"Kata Farkas"},{"name":"Anthony Andrews"},{"name":"Vera Jones"},{"name":"Brian Cox"},{"name":"Howard Brett"},{"name":"Davey L Jones"},{"name":"James E McDonald"},{"name":"Shelagh K Malham"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"fecal indicator organisms"},{"word":"resuspension"},{"word":"sediment"},{"word":"survival"},{"word":"viable but non-culturable bacteria"},{"word":"virus"}]},"article295":{"pmid":"27846284","title":"Mutation of the Streptococcus gordonii Thiol-Disulfide Oxidoreductase SdbA Leads to Enhanced Biofilm Formation Mediated by the CiaRH Two-Component Signaling System.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Streptococcus gordonii is a commensal inhabitant of human oral biofilms.

Herein, hierarchical 3D multidrug scaffolds based on nanocomposite bioceramic and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) prepared by rapid prototyping with an external coating of gelatin-glutaraldehyde (Gel-Glu) have been fabricated.

Levofloxacin was loaded into the mesopores of nanocomposite bioceramic part, vancomycin was localized into PVA biopolymer part and rifampin was loaded in the external coating of Gel-Glu. The obtained results show an early and fast release of rifampin followed by sustained and prolonged release of vancomycin and levofloxacin, respectively, which are mainly governed by the progressive in vitro degradability rate of these scaffolds.

Stress response genes are induced whenever a cell needs to adapt and survive under unfavorable growth conditions. Two of the possible important genes are rpoS and bolA. The rpoS gene has been known as the alternative sigma (σ) factor, which controls the expression of a large number of genes, which are involved in responses to various stress factors as well as transition to stationary phase from exponential form of growth. Morphogene bolA response to stressed environment leads to round morphology of E. coli cells, but little is known about its involvement in biofilms and its development or maintenance. This study has been undertaken to address the adherence pattern and formation of biofilms by E. coli on stainless steel, polypropylene, and silicone surfaces after 24 h of growth at 37 °C. Scanning electron microscopy was used for direct examination of the cell attachment and biofilm formation on various surfaces and it was found that, in the presence of bolA, E. coli cells were able to attach to the stainless steel and silicone very well.

However, in this study, periodic jets of CO2 aerosols without nitrogen purges were used to remove Pseudomonas putida biofilms from polished stainless steel surfaces. CO2 aerosols are mixtures of solid and gaseous CO2 and are generated when high-pressure CO2 gas is adiabatically expanded through a nozzle.

In the current study, both chemical and physical interactions between C. albicans and C. difficile were investigated. In the presence of C. albicans, C. difficile was able to grow under aerobic, normally toxic, conditions. This phenomenon was neither linked to adherence of bacteria to hyphae nor to biofilm formation by C. albicans.

Significantly, phages may help to remove biofilms, which are notoriously resistant to commonly used eradication methods. However, the successful development of novel antibiofilm strategies must take into account that real-life biofilms usually consist of mixed-species populations. Within this context, this study aimed to explore the effectiveness of bacteriophage-based sanitation procedures for removing polymicrobial biofilms from food industry surfaces. We treated dual-species biofilms formed by the food pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in combination with Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium, or Lactobacillus pentosus with the staphylococcal phage phiIPLA-RODI. Our results suggest that the impact of bacteriophage treatment on S. aureus mixed-species biofilms varies depending on the accompanying species and the infection conditions. For instance, short treatments (4 h) with a phage suspension under nutrient-limiting conditions reduced the number of S. aureus cells in 5-h biofilms by ∼1 log unit without releasing the nonsusceptible species. In contrast, longer infection periods (18 h) with no nutrient limitation increased the killing of S. aureus cells by the phage (decrease of up to 2.9 log units). However, in some cases, these conditions promoted the growth of the accompanying species. For example, the L. plantarum cell count in the treated sample was up to 2.3 log units higher than that in the untreated control. Furthermore, phage propagation inside dual-species biofilms also depended greatly on the accompanying species, with the highest rate detected in biofilms formed by S. aureus-L. pentosus Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) also showed changes in the three-dimensional structures of the mixed-species biofilms after phage treatment. Altogether, the results presented here highlight the need to study the impact of phage therapy on microbial communities that reflect a more realistic setting.","authors":[{"name":"Silvia González"},{"name":"Lucía Fernández"},{"name":"Ana Belén Campelo"},{"name":"Diana Gutiérrez"},{"name":"Beatriz Martínez"},{"name":"Ana Rodríguez"},{"name":"Pilar García"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"phage"}]},"article324":{"pmid":"27836762","title":"Passive immunization against Pseudomonas aeruginosa recombinant PilA in a murine burn wound model.","date":"2017-04-04","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV pili have an essential role in twitching motility, colonization and biofilm formation.

Both the extracts were screened for the presence of phytocompounds followed by the characterization using Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) infrared spectroscopy and bioactivity finger print analysis. Anti-biofilm assays were determined to test the potential of both extracts to inhibit the biofilm formation, while Propidium Iodide (PI) uptake analysis revealed that cell membrane was damaged by the exposure of nutraceuticals for 1 h.

The probiotic potential was investigated by using the following criteria: (i) adhesion to host epithelial cells and mucus, (ii) biofilm formation, (iii) co-aggregation with bacterial pathogens, (iv) inhibition of pathogen adhesion to mucus and HeLa cells, and (v) antimicrobial activity. Tested lactobacilli adhered to mucin, co-aggregated with all genital microorganisms, and displayed antimicrobial activity. With the exception of L. acidophilus and L. paracasei, they adhered to HeLa cells. However, only L. fermentum produced a moderate biofilm and a higher level of co-aggregation and mucin binding. The displacement assay demonstrated that all Lactobacillus strains inhibit C. albicans binding to mucin (p < 0.001), likely due to the production of substances with antimicrobial activity. Clinical isolates belonging to the most common Candida species associated to vaginal candidiasis were inhibited by L. fermentum.

The ClpP protease has been shown to demonstrate its pivotal importance to both the survival and the virulence of pathogenic bacteria during host infection. Deregulating ClpP activity either through overactivation or inhibition could lead to antibacterial activity, declaiming the dual molecular mechanism for small-molecule modulation. Recently, natural products acyldepsipeptides (ADEPs) have been identified as a new class of antibiotics that activate ClpP to a dysfunctional state in the absence of cognate ATPases. ADEPs in combination with rifampicin eradicate deep-seated mouse biofilm infections. In addition, several non-ADEP compounds have been identified as activators of the ClpP proteolytic core without the involvement of ATPases. These findings indicate a general principle for killing dormant cells, the activation and corruption of the ClpP protease, rather than through conventional inhibition. Deletion of the clpP gene reduced the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus, thus making it an ideal antivirulence target. Multiple inhibitors have been developed in order to attenuate the production of extracellular virulence factors of bacteria through covalent modifications on serine in the active site or disruption of oligomerization of ClpP. Interestingly, due to the unusual composition and activation mechanism of ClpP in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacteria are killed by ADEPs through inhibition of ClpP activity rather than overactivation. In this short review, we will summarize recent progress in the development of small molecules modulating ClpP protease activity for both antibiotics and antivirulence.","authors":[{"name":"Fei Ye"},{"name":"Jiahui Li"},{"name":"Cai-Guang Yang"}],"keywords":[]},"article345":{"pmid":"27830437","title":"Temporal Profile of Biofilm Formation, Gene Expression and Virulence Analysis in Candida albicans Strains.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The characterization of Candida albicans strains with different degrees of virulence became very useful to understand the mechanisms of fungal virulence.

Summer temperature (29-33°C) and salinity (39 PSU) exceeded average global maxima for coral reefs, whereas DO concentration was low (2-4 mg L-1). While temperature and salinity differences were most pronounced between seasons, DO, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, and sedimentation varied most between reefs. Similarly, biotic communities were highly dynamic between reefs and seasons. Differences in bacterial biofilms were driven by four abundant families: Rhodobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Flammeovirgaceae, and Pseudanabaenaceae. In algal biofilms, green crusts, brown crusts, and crustose coralline algae were most abundant and accounted for most of the variability of the communities. Higher bacterial diversity of biofilms coincided with increased algal cover during spring and summer. By employing multivariate matching, we identified temperature, salinity, DO, and chlorophyll-a as the main contributing physico-chemical drivers of biotic community structures. These parameters are forecast to change most with the progression of ocean warming and increased nutrient input, which suggests an effect on the recruitment of Red Sea benthic communities as a result of climate change and anthropogenic influence.

Substrates consisted of mild steel - a major constituent of maritime infrastructure - and the naturally occurring iron sulfide mineral pyrite. Four conditions were tested: free-venting high-flux conditions; a stagnant condition; an active flow-through condition with seawater slowly pumped over the substrates; and an enrichment condition where the slow pumping of seawater was supplemented with nutrient rich medium. Electron microscopy analyses of the 2-month high flux incubations document coating of substrates with twisted stalks, resembling iron oxyhydroxide bioprecipitates made by marine neutrophilic Fe-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB). Six-month incubations exhibit increased biofilm and substrate corrosion in the active flow and nutrient enriched conditions relative to the stagnant condition. A scarcity of twisted stalks was observed for all 6 month slow-flow conditions compared to the high-flux condition, which may be attributable to oxygen concentrations in the slow-flux conditions being prohibitively low for sustained growth of stalk-producing bacteria. All substrates developed microbial communities reflective of the original seawater input, as based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Deltaproteobacteria sequences increased in relative abundance in the active flow and nutrient enrichment conditions, whereas Gammaproteobacteria sequences were relatively more abundant in the stagnant condition. These results indicate that (i) high-flux incubations with higher oxygen availability favor the development of biofilms with twisted stalks resembling those of marine neutrophilic FeOB and (ii) long-term nutrient stimulation results in substrate corrosion and biofilms with different bacterial community composition and structure relative to stagnant and non-nutritionally enhanced incubations. Similar microbial succession scenarios, involving increases in nutritional input leading to the proliferation of anaerobic iron and sulfur-cycling guilds, may occur at the nearby Port of Los Angeles and cause potential damage to maritime port infrastructure.","authors":[{"name":"Gustavo A Ramírez"},{"name":"Colleen L Hoffman"},{"name":"Michael D Lee"},{"name":"Ryan A Lesniewski"},{"name":"Roman A Barco"},{"name":"Arkadiy Garber"},{"name":"Brandy M Toner"},{"name":"Charles G Wheat"},{"name":"Katrina J Edwards"},{"name":"Beth N Orcutt"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Catalina Island"},{"word":"Wrigley Institute"},{"word":"accelerated low-water corrosion (ALWC)"},{"word":"microbial induced corrosion (MIC)"},{"word":"mineral–microbe interactions"}]},"article352":{"pmid":"27825899","title":"Influence of culture conditions on porphyrin production in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis.","date":"2017-10-23","abs":"Increasing antibiotic resistance among pathogens has raised the demands for new treatment methods such as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and phototherapy (PT).

The design and use of MFCs has attracted considerable interests because of the potential new opportunities they offer for sustainable production of energy from biodegradable and reused waste materials. However, the associated slow microbial kinetics and costly construction materials has limited a much wider commercial use of the technology. In the past ten years, there has been significant new developments in MFCs which has resulted in several-fold increase in achievable power density. Yet, there is still considerable possibility for further improvement in performance and development of new cost effective materials. This paper comprehensively reviews recent advances in the construction and utilization of novel anodes for MFCs. In particular, it highlights some of the critical roles and functions of anodes in MFCs, strategies available for improving surface areas of anodes, dominant performance of stainless-steel based anode materials, and the emerging benefits of inclusion of nanomaterials. The review also demonstrates that some of the materials are very promising for large scale MFC applications and are likely to replace conventional anodes for the development of next generation MFC systems. The hurdles to the development of commercial MFC technology are also discussed. Furthermore, the future directions in the design and selection of materials for construction and utilization of MFC anodes are highlighted.","authors":[{"name":"Jayesh M Sonawane"},{"name":"Abhishek Yadav"},{"name":"Prakash C Ghosh"},{"name":"Samuel B Adeloju"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Air-cathode"},{"word":"Biocatalyst"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Microbial fuel cells"},{"word":"Stainless steel"},{"word":"Wastewater"}]},"article354":{"pmid":"27825734","title":"Predominance of SCCmec types IV and V among biofilm producing device-associated Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from tertiary care hospitals in Mysuru, India.","date":"2018-05-24","abs":"Device associated infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus in hospitalised patients is a serious healthcare problem.

These interactions involve all ecological aspects, including physiochemical changes, metabolite exchange, metabolite conversion, signaling, chemotaxis and genetic exchange resulting in genotype selection. In addition, the establishment in the environment depends on the species diversity, since high functional redundancy in the microbial community increases the competitive ability of the community, decreasing the possibility of an invader to establish in this environment. Therefore, these associations are the result of a co-evolution process that leads to the adaptation and specialization, allowing the occupation of different niches, by reducing biotic and abiotic stress or exchanging growth factors and signaling. Microbial interactions occur by the transference of molecular and genetic information, and many mechanisms can be involved in this exchange, such as secondary metabolites, siderophores, quorum sensing system, biofilm formation, and cellular transduction signaling, among others. The ultimate unit of interaction is the gene expression of each organism in response to an environmental (biotic or abiotic) stimulus, which is responsible for the production of molecules involved in these interactions. Therefore, in the present review, we focused on some molecular mechanisms involved in the microbial interaction, not only in microbial-host interaction, which has been exploited by other reviews, but also in the molecular strategy used by different microorganisms in the environment that can modulate the establishment and structuration of the microbial community.","authors":[{"name":"Raíssa Mesquita Braga"},{"name":"Manuella Nóbrega Dourado"},{"name":"Welington Luiz Araújo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Diversity"},{"word":"Microbe–host interaction"},{"word":"Microbial interaction"},{"word":"Molecular interaction"}]},"article357":{"pmid":"27825487","title":"Phytohormone production endowed with antagonistic potential and plant growth promoting abilities of culturable endophytic bacteria isolated from Clerodendrum colebrookianum Walp.","date":"2017-03-27","abs":"In this study, culturable endophytic bacterial isolates obtained from an ethnomedicinal plant Clerodendrum colebrookianum Walp., were assessed for their diversity, in vitro screening for their plant growth promoting (PGP) activities and to use them as inoculant for in vivo PGP activities with biocontrol potential.

For instance, a polysaccharide, alginate (from seaweed), is widely used in food, textile and pharmaceutical industries. Certain bacteria also produce alginate through membrane spanning multi-protein complexes. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model organism, we investigated the biological function of an alginate degrading enzyme, AlgL, in alginate production and biofilm formation. We showed that AlgL negatively impacts alginate production through its enzymatic activity. We also demonstrated that deletion of AlgL does not interfere with polymer length control, epimerization degree or stability of the biosynthesis complex, arguing that AlgL is a free periplasmic protein dispensable for alginate production. This was further supported by our protein-stability and interaction experiments. Interestingly, over-production of AlgL interfered with polymer length control, suggesting that AlgL could be loosely associated with the biosynthesis complex. In addition, chromosomal expression of algL enhanced alginate O-acetylation; both attachment and dispersal stages of the bacterial biofilm lifecycle were sensitive to the level of O-acetylation. Since this modification also protects the pathogen against host defences and enhances other virulence factors, chromosomal expression of algL could be important for the pathogenicity of this organism. Overall, this work improves our understanding of bacterial alginate production and provides new knowledge for alginate production and disease control.","authors":[{"name":"Yajie Wang"},{"name":"M Fata Moradali"},{"name":"Ali Goudarztalejerdi"},{"name":"Ian M Sims"},{"name":"Bernd H A Rehm"}],"keywords":[]},"article361":{"pmid":"27823882","title":"Novel hamamelitannin analogues for the treatment of biofilm related MRSA infections-A scaffold hopping approach.","date":"2018-01-12","abs":"Antimicrobial research is increasingly being focused on the problem of resistance and biofilm formation.

At the microscopic level, it is now well established that important consortia of bacteria colonize the phycosphere, the immediate environment of phytoplankton cells. In this microscale environment, abundant bacterial cells are organized in a structured biofilm, and exchange information through the diffusion of small molecules called semiochemicals. Among these processes, quorum sensing plays a particular role as, when a sufficient abundance of cells is reached, it allows bacteria to coordinate their gene expression and physiology at the population level. In contrast, quorum quenching mechanisms are employed by many different types of microorganisms that limit the coordination of antagonistic bacteria. This review synthesizes quorum sensing and quorum quenching mechanisms evidenced to date in the phycosphere, emphasizing the implications that these signaling systems have for the regulation of bacterial communities and their activities. The diversity of chemical compounds involved in these processes is examined. We further review the bacterial functions regulated in the phycosphere by quorum sensing, which include biofilm formation, nutrient acquisition, and emission of algaecides. We also discuss quorum quenching compounds as antagonists of quorum sensing, their function in the phycosphere, and their potential biotechnological applications. Overall, the current state of the art demonstrates that quorum sensing and quorum quenching regulate a balance between a symbiotic and a parasitic way of life between bacteria and their phytoplankton host.","authors":[{"name":"Jean Luc Rolland"},{"name":"Didier Stien"},{"name":"Sophie Sanchez-Ferandin"},{"name":"Raphaël Lami"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Phycosphere"},{"word":"Phytoplankton"},{"word":"Quorum quenching"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"}]},"article364":{"pmid":"27822538","title":"Diversity and Activity of Communities Inhabiting Plastic Debris in the North Pacific Gyre.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Marine plastic debris has become a significant concern in ocean ecosystems worldwide.

Competence induced by CSP is a late response to the pheromone that requires the response regulator ComE and the XIP-encoding gene comS. XIP binds to ComR to allow expression of the alternative sigma factor SigX and the effector genes it controls. While these regulatory links are established, the precise set of effectors controlled by each regulator is poorly defined. To improve the definition of all three regulons, we used a high-resolution tiling array to map global changes in gene expression in the early and late phases of the CSP response. The early phase of the CSP response was limited to increased gene expression at four loci associated with bacteriocin production and immunity. In the late phase, upregulated regions expanded to a total of 29 loci, including comS and genes required for DNA uptake and recombination. The results indicate that the entire late response to CSP depends on the expression of comS and that the immediate transcriptional response to CSP, mediated by ComE, is restricted to just four bacteriocin-related loci. Comparison of the new data with published transcriptome data permitted the identification of all of the operons in each regulon: 4 for ComE, 2 for ComR, and 21 for SigX.

Confocal and scanning electron microscopy showed that NO-np-treated staphylococcal biofilms displayed considerably reduced thicknesses and bacterial numbers compared to those of control biofilms in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Although both phenotypes, planktonic and biofilm-associated staphylococci, of multiple clinical strains were susceptible to NO-np, bacteria within biofilms were more resistant to killing than their planktonic counterparts. Furthermore, chitosan, a biopolymer found in the exoskeleton of crustaceans and structurally integrated into the nanoparticles, seems to add considerable antimicrobial activity to the technology. Our findings suggest promising development and translational potential of NO-np for use as a prophylactic or therapeutic against bacterial biofilms on CVCs and other medical devices.","authors":[{"name":"Mircea Radu Mihu"},{"name":"Vitor Cabral"},{"name":"Rodney Pattabhi"},{"name":"Moses T Tar"},{"name":"Kelvin P Davies"},{"name":"Adam J Friedman"},{"name":"Luis R Martinez"},{"name":"Joshua D Nosanchuk"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"antimicrobials"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"nitric oxide"}]},"article375":{"pmid":"27821054","title":"Determination of virulence and antibiotic resistance pattern of biofilm producing Listeria species isolated from retail raw milk.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"One of the foodborne pathogens is Listeria monocytogenes, which causes serious invasive illness in elderly and immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, newborns and infants ranking second after salmonellosis because of its high case fatality rate.

Through hydrolytic degradation of the composites in the oral cavity it yields a hydrophilic biodegradation product, triethylene glycol (TEG), which has been shown to promote the growth of Streptococcus mutans, a dominant cariogenic bacterium. Previously it was shown that TEG up-regulated gtfB, an important gene contributing to polysaccharide synthesis function in biofilms. However, molecular mechanisms related to TEG's effect on bacterial function remained poorly understood. In the present study, S. mutans UA159 was incubated with clinically relevant concentrations of TEG at pH 5.5 and 7.0. Quantitative real-time PCR, proteomics analysis, and glucosyltransferase enzyme (GTF) activity measurements were employed to identify the bacterial phenotypic response to TEG. A S. mutans vicK isogenic mutant (SMΔvicK1) and its associated complemented strain (SMΔvicK1C), an important regulatory gene for biofilm-associated genes, were used to determine if this signaling pathway was involved in modulation of the S. mutans virulence-associated genes. Extracted proteins from S. mutans biofilms grown in the presence and absence of TEG were subjected to mass spectrometry for protein identification, characterization and quantification. TEG up-regulated gtfB/C, gbpB, comC, comD and comE more significantly in biofilms at cariogenic pH (5.5) and defined concentrations. Differential response of the vicK knock-out (SMΔvicK1) and complemented strains (SMΔvicK1C) implicated this signalling pathway in TEG-modulated cellular responses. TEG resulted in increased GTF enzyme activity, responsible for synthesizing insoluble glucans involved in the formation of cariogenic biofilms. As well, TEG increased protein abundance related to biofilm formation, carbohydrate transport, acid tolerance, and stress-response. Proteomics data was consistent with gene expression findings for the selected genes. These findings demonstrate a mechanistic pathway by which TEG derived from commercial resin materials in the oral cavity promote S. mutans pathogenicity, which is typically associated with secondary caries.","authors":[{"name":"Lida Sadeghinejad"},{"name":"Dennis G Cvitkovitch"},{"name":"Walter L Siqueira"},{"name":"J Paul Santerre"},{"name":"Yoav Finer"}],"keywords":[]},"article378":{"pmid":"27820691","title":"Bacterial Colonization in the Marginal Region of Ceramic Restorations: Effects of Different Cement Removal Methods and Polishing.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This study evaluated the effects of excess cement removal techniques, with or without subsequent polishing, on biofilm formation and micromorphology in the marginal region of the tooth/restoration. From bovine teeth, 96 dentin blocks (4 × 8 × 2 mm) were produced, molded, and reproduced in type IV gypsum, on which 96 pressed ceramic blocks (Vita PM9, Vita Zahnfabrik; 4 × 8 × 2 mm) were produced via the lost wax technique. The dentin blocks and their respective ceramic blocks were cemented with a self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX U200, 3M ESPE), and cement excess was removed from the margin using four different techniques, followed or not by polishing with silicone rubber tips: MBr, removal with microbrush and photoactivation; MBr-Pol, MBr + polishing; Br, removal with brush and photoactivation; Br-Pol, Br + polishing; Photo-Expl, 5 seconds of initial photoactivation, removal with explorer, and final curing; Photo-Expl-Pol, Photo-Expl + polishing; Photo-SB, 5 seconds of initial photoactivation, removal with scalpel, and final curing; and Photo-SB-Pol, Photo-SB + polishing. After 24 hours, the roughness in the marginal region was analyzed using a profilometer (three measurements on each sample). Micromorphological analyses of the region were performed by stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then the samples were contaminated with sucrose broth standardized suspension with Streptococcus mutans , Staphylococcus aureus , and Candida albicans and incubated for a period of 48 hours. The samples were quantitatively analyzed for bacterial adherence in the marginal region by confocal laser scanning microscopy and counting of colony-forming units (CFUs/mL) and qualitatively analyzed using SEM. Roughness data (Ra) were submitted to two-way analysis of variance, Tukey test at a confidence level of 95%, and Student t-tests. CFU, biomass, and biothickness data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Dunn tests. The removing technique statistically influenced Ra (MBr, p=0.0019; Br, p=0.002; Photo-Expl, p=0.0262; Photo-SB, p=0.0196) when comparing the polished and unpolished groups. The MBr and MBr-Pol technique differed significantly for CFU/mL values (p=0.010). There was no significant difference in the amounts of biomass and biothickness comparing polished and unpolished groups and when all groups were compared (p>0.05). Different morphological patterns were observed (more regular surface for polished groups). We conclude that margin polishing after cementation of feldspar/pressed ceramic restorations is decisive for achieving smoother surfaces, as the excess cement around the edges can increase the surface roughness in these areas, influencing bacterial adhesion.","authors":[{"name":"Smb Pereira"},{"name":"L C Anami"},{"name":"C A Pereira"},{"name":"Roa Souza"},{"name":"K Z Kantorski"},{"name":"M A Bottino"},{"name":"Aoc Jorge"},{"name":"L F Valandro"}],"keywords":[]},"article379":{"pmid":"27819280","title":"Cationic bactericidal peptide 1018 does not specifically target the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The bacterial stringent response is a key regulator of bacterial virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance, and is a promising target for the development of new antibacterial compounds.

When inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa planktonic and biofilm growth is tested simultaneously in the same assay, peptides 1018 and the control peptide 8101 generated by an inversion of the amino acid sequence of 1018 are equally potent, and, importantly, do not display a preferential activity against biofilm. 1018 inhibits planktonic growth of Escherichia coli equally efficiently either when the alleged target, (p)ppGpp, is essential (MOPS media lacking amino acid L-valine), or dispensable for growth (MOPS media supplemented with L-valine). Genetic disruption of the genes relA and spoT responsible for (p)ppGpp synthesis moderately sensitizes - rather than protects - E. coli to 1018.

We also examined whether polystyrene acts as a vector for gut biofilm assemblages after subsequent incubation of the egested particles in seawater. Our results showed that after passage through the digestive tract of A. marina, the bacterial assemblages on polystyrene particles and reference glass beads became more similar, harbouring common sediment bacteria. By contrast, only in the presence of polystyrene the potential symbiont Amphritea atlantica was enriched in the investigated biofilms, faeces, and water. Thus, especially in areas of high polystyrene contamination, this polymer may impact the bacterial composition of different habitats, with as yet unknown consequences for the respective ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Katharina Kesy"},{"name":"Sonja Oberbeckmann"},{"name":"Felix Müller"},{"name":"Matthias Labrenz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Amphritea sp."},{"word":"Arenicola marina"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Microplastics"},{"word":"Polystyrene"}]}}
