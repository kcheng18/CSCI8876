In this study, the release of biofilm-associated L. pneumophila under simulated drinking water flow containing a disinfectant residual was examined. Meanwhile, the inactivation and infectivity (to amoebae) of the released L. pneumophila were studied. To simulate drinking water system conditions, biofilms were prepared under either disinfectant exposure (predisinfected biofilms) or disinfectant-free (untreated biofilms) conditions, respectively. For experiments with water flow containing a disinfectant to release the biofilm-associated L. pneumophila from these two types of biofilms, the L. pneumophila release kinetics values from predisinfected and untreated biofilms under flow condition were not statistically different (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). However, inactivation of the L. pneumophila released from predisinfected biofilms was 1-2 times higher and amoeba infectivity was 2-29 times lower than that from untreated biofilms. The higher disinfectant resistance of L. pneumophila released from untreated biofilms was presumably influenced by the detachment of a larger amount of biofilm material (determined by 16S rRNA qPCR) surrounding the released L. pneumophila. This study highlights the interaction among disinfectant residual, biofilms, and L. pneumophila, which provides guidelines to assess and control pathogen risk.","authors":[{"name":"Yun Shen"},{"name":"Conghui Huang"},{"name":"Jie Lin"},{"name":"Wenjing Wu"},{"name":"Nicholas J Ashbolt"},{"name":"Wen-Tso Liu"},{"name":"Thanh H Nguyen"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"28084994","title":"Flow environment and matrix structure interact to determine spatial competition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.","date":"2019-01-09","abs":"Bacteria often live in biofilms, which are microbial communities surrounded by a secreted extracellular matrix. Here, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic flow and matrix organization interact to shape competitive dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Irrespective of initial frequency, in competition with matrix mutants, wild-type cells always increase in relative abundance in planar microfluidic devices under simple flow regimes. By contrast, in microenvironments with complex, irregular flow profiles - which are common in natural environments - wild-type matrix-producing and isogenic non-producing strains can coexist. This result stems from local obstruction of flow by wild-type matrix producers, which generates regions of near-zero shear that allow matrix mutants to locally accumulate.

Germ-free (GF) model systems allow dissection of host-microbe interactions in a simple and direct way where each member of the symbiosis can be studied in isolation.

Resulting corrosion rates, however, were inversely proportional to cell exposure, indicating that A. aceti biofilms are able to protect carbon steel surfaces from corrosion.

However, the impact of protein glycosylation on the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus remains incompletely understood. To study protein glycosylation in staphylococci, we analyzed lysostaphin lysates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains by SDS-PAGE and subsequent periodic acid-Schiff's staining. We detected four (>300, ∼250, ∼165, and ∼120 kDa) and two (>300 and ∼175 kDa) glycosylated surface proteins with strain COL and strain 1061, respectively. The ∼250, ∼165, and ∼175 kDa proteins were identified as plasmin-sensitive protein (Pls) by mass spectrometry. Previously, Pls has been demonstrated to be a virulence factor in a mouse septic arthritis model. The pls gene is encoded by the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC)mec type I in MRSA that also encodes the methicillin resistance-conferring mecA and further genes. In a search for glycosyltransferases, we identified two open reading frames encoded downstream of pls on the SCCmec element, which we termed gtfC and gtfD. Expression and deletion analysis revealed that both gtfC and gtfD mediate glycosylation of Pls. Additionally, the recently reported glycosyltransferases SdgA and SdgB are involved in Pls glycosylation. Glycosylation occurs at serine residues in the Pls SD-repeat region and modifying carbohydrates are N-acetylhexosaminyl residues. Functional characterization revealed that Pls can confer increased biofilm formation, which seems to involve two distinct mechanisms. The first mechanism depends on glycosylation of the SD-repeat region by GtfC/GtfD and probably also involves eDNA, while the second seems to be independent of glycosylation as well as eDNA and may involve the centrally located G5 domains. Other previously known Pls properties are not related to the sugar modifications. In conclusion, Pls is a glycoprotein and Pls glycosyl residues can stimulate biofilm formation. Thus, sugar modifications may represent promising new targets for novel therapeutic or prophylactic measures against life-threatening S. aureus infections.","authors":[{"name":"Isabelle Bleiziffer"},{"name":"Julian Eikmeier"},{"name":"Gottfried Pohlentz"},{"name":"Kathryn McAulay"},{"name":"Guoqing Xia"},{"name":"Muzaffar Hussain"},{"name":"Andreas Peschel"},{"name":"Simon Foster"},{"name":"Georg Peters"},{"name":"Christine Heilmann"}],"keywords":[]},"article20":{"pmid":"28081148","title":"Characterization of Multi-Drug Resistant Enterococcus faecalis Isolated from Cephalic Recording Chambers in Research Macaques (Macaca spp.).","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Nonhuman primates are commonly used for cognitive neuroscience research and often surgically implanted with cephalic recording chambers for electrophysiological recording.

We also show that it is readily cell penetrant, like HBD3, although with a different mechanism, which is independent from CD98. Overall, the potency of the single-disulfide, 23-amino acid γ-core is comparable with the full-length peptide across the whole spectrum of examined properties, and the peptide is not toxic to human cells. The HBD3 γ-core peptide may therefore represent the first example of an economically viable lead peptide derived from a HDP privileged scaffold.

The anammox sludge secreted more EPS (especially polysaccharides) than AOB with a markedly higher c-di-GMP content, which could be used by the bacteria to regulate the synthesis of exopolysaccharides that are ultimately used as a fixation matrix, for the adhesion of biomass. Indeed, increased intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations in the anammox sludge enhanced the regulation of polysaccharides to promote the adhesion of AOB and formation of the CANON biofilm.

To overcome this problem, we designed a dental implant composed of a porous titanium-silica (Ti/SiO2) composite material and containing an internal reservoir that can be loaded with antimicrobial compounds. The composite material consists of a sol-gel derived mesoporous SiO2 diffusion barrier integrated in a macroporous Ti load-bearing structure obtained by powder metallurgical processing. The antimicrobial compounds can diffuse through the porous implant walls, thereby reducing microbial biofilm formation on the implant surface. A continuous release of µM concentrations of chlorhexidine through the Ti/SiO2 composite material was measured, without initial burst effect, over at least 10 days and using a 5 mM chlorhexidine solution in the implant reservoir. Metabolic staining, CFU counting and visualisation by scanning electron microscopy confirmed that Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation on the implant surface was almost completely prevented due to chlorhexidine release (preventive setup). Moreover, we demonstrated efficacy of released chlorhexidine against mature Streptococcus mutans biofilms (curative setup). In conclusion, we provide a proof of concept of the sustained release of chlorhexidine, one of the most widely used oral antiseptics, through the Ti/SiO2 material thereby preventing and eradicating biofilm formation on the surface of the dental implant.

Microbial biofilm pathogens are the causative agents in chronic osteomyelitis. Research on the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis has focused on indirect bone destruction by host immune cells and cytokines secondary to microbial insult. Direct bone resorption by biofilm pathogens has not yet been seriously considered. In this study, common osteomyelitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus mutans) were grown as biofilms in multiple in vitro and ex vivo experiments to analyze quantitative and qualitative aspects of bone destruction during infection. Pathogens were grown as single or mixed species biofilms on the following substrates: hydroxyapatite, rat jawbone, or polystyrene wells, and in various media. Biofilm growth was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and pH levels were monitored over time. Histomorphologic and quantitative effects of biofilms on tested substrates were analyzed by microcomputed tomography and quantitative cultures. All tested biofilms demonstrated significant damage to bone. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that all strains formed mature biofilms within 7 days on all substrate surfaces regardless of media. Experimental conditions impacted pH levels, although this had no impact on biofilm growth or bone destruction. Presence of biofilm led to bone dissolution with a decrease of total volume by 20.17±2.93% upon microcomputed tomography analysis, which was statistically significant as compared to controls (p <0.05, ANOVA). Quantitative cultures indicated that media and substrate did not impact biofilm formation (Kruskall-Wallis test, post-hoc Dunne's test; p <0.05). Overall, these results indicate that biofilms associated with osteomyelitis have the ability to directly resorb bone. These findings should lead to a more complete understanding of the etiopathogenesis of osteomyelitis, where direct bone resorption by biofilm is considered in addition to the well-known osteoclastic and host cell destruction of bone.","authors":[{"name":"Adam Junka"},{"name":"Patrycja Szymczyk"},{"name":"Grzegorz Ziółkowski"},{"name":"Ewa Karuga-Kuzniewska"},{"name":"Danuta Smutnicka"},{"name":"Iwona Bil-Lula"},{"name":"Marzenna Bartoszewicz"},{"name":"Susan Mahabady"},{"name":"Parish Paymon Sedghizadeh"}],"keywords":[]},"article34":{"pmid":"28076361","title":"Synergy and Order Effects of Antibiotics and Phages in Killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms.","date":"2019-01-09","abs":"In contrast to planktonic cells, bacteria imbedded biofilms are notoriously refractory to treatment by antibiotics or bacteriophage (phage) used alone. Given that the mechanisms of killing differ profoundly between drugs and phages, an obvious question is whether killing is improved by combining antibiotic and phage therapy. However, this question has only recently begun to be explored. Here, in vitro biofilm populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 were treated singly and with combinations of two phages and bactericidal antibiotics of five classes. By themselves, phages and drugs commonly had only modest effects in killing the bacteria. However some phage-drug combinations reduced bacterial densities to well below that of the best single treatment; in some cases, bacterial densities were reduced even below the level expected if both agents killed independently of each other (synergy). Furthermore, there was a profound order effect in some cases: treatment with phages before drugs achieved maximum killing. Combined treatment was particularly effective in killing in Pseudomonas biofilms grown on layers of cultured epithelial cells. Phages were also capable of limiting the extent to which minority populations of bacteria resistant to the treating antibiotic ascend. The potential of combined antibiotic and phage treatment of biofilm infections is discussed as a realistic way to evaluate and establish the use of bacteriophage for the treatment of humans.","authors":[{"name":"Waqas Nasir Chaudhry"},{"name":"Jeniffer Concepción-Acevedo"},{"name":"Taehyun Park"},{"name":"Saadia Andleeb"},{"name":"James J Bull"},{"name":"Bruce R Levin"}],"keywords":[]},"article35":{"pmid":"28075119","title":"Bubble-Driven Detachment of Bacteria from Confined Microgeometries.","date":"2018-09-19","abs":"Moving air-liquid interfaces, for example, bubbles, play a significant role in the detachment and transport of colloids and microorganisms in confined systems as well as unsaturated porous media.

In this study six spoilage related L. plantarum strains FBR1-FBR6 and the model strain L. plantarum WCFS1 were characterised in single, dual and multiple strain competition models. A quantitative PCR approach was used with added propidium monoazide (PMA) enabling quantification of intact cells in the biofilm, representing the viable cell fraction that determines the food spoilage risk. Our results show that the performance of individual strains in multi-strain cultures generally correlates with their performance in pure culture, and relative strain abundance in multi-strain biofilms positively correlated with the relative strain abundance in suspended (planktonic) cultures. Performance of individual strains in dual-strain biofilms was highly influenced by the presence of the secondary strain, and in most cases no correlation between the relative contributions of viable planktonic cells and viable cells in the biofilm was noted. The total biofilm quantified by CV staining of the dual and multi-strain biofilms formed was mainly correlated to CV values of the dominant strain obtained in single strain studies. However, the combination of strain FBR5 and strain WCFS1 showed significantly higher CV values compared to the individual performances of both strains indicating that total biofilm formation was higher in this specific condition.

These are passed on to the consumer since the bacteria can form biofilms or otherwise populate plant tissues, thereby using plants as vectors to infect animal hosts. The life cycle of the bacteria in plants differs from those in animals or humans and results in altered physiochemical and biological properties (e.g., physiology, immunity, native microflora, physical barriers, mobility, and temperature). Mechanisms by which healthy plants may become contaminated by microorganisms, develop biofilms, and then pass on their pathogenic burden to people are explored in the context of hollow fiber microfiltration by which plant-derived microorganisms may be recovered and rapidly concentrated to facilitate study of their properties. Enzymes, when added to macerated plant tissues, hydrolyze or alter macromolecules that would otherwise foul hollow-fiber microfiltration membranes. Hence, microfiltration may be used to quickly increase the concentration of microorganisms to detectable levels. This review discusses microbial colonization of vegetables, formation and properties of biofilms, and how hollow fiber microfiltration may be used to concentrate microbial targets to detectable levels. The use of added enzymes helps to disintegrate biofilms and minimize hollow fiber membrane fouling, thereby providing a new tool for more time effectively elucidating mechanisms by which biofilms develop and plant tissue becomes contaminated with human pathogens.

This means that ARB must have a high substrate-oxidation rate coupled with a high ratio of electrons used for respiration compared to total electrons removed by substrate utilization. It also means that they are especially susceptible to inhibition that slows anode respiration or lowers their biomass yield. Using several electrochemical techniques, we show that a relatively high total ammonium-nitrogen (TAN) concentration (2.2 g TAN/L) induced significant stress on the ARB biofilms, lowering their true yield and forcing the ARB to boost the ratio of electrons respired per electrons consumed from the substrate. In particular, a higher respiration rate, measured as current density (j), was associated with slower growth and a lower net yield, compared to an ARB biofilm grown with a lower ammonium concentration (0.2 g TAN/L). Further increases in influent TAN (to 3 and then to 4.4 g TAN/L) caused nearly complete inhibition of anode respiration. However, the ARB could recover from high-TAN inhibition after a shift of the MXC's feed to 0.2 g TAN/L. In summary, ARB biofilms were inhibited by a high TAN concentration, but could divert more electron flow toward anode respiration with modest inhibition and recover when severe inhibition was relieved.

This paper focuses for the first time on the ability of ultrashort Fmoc-peptide gelators to eradicate established bacterial biofilms implicated in a variety of medical device infections (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The effect of increasing the cationicity of FmocFF via addition of di-lysine and di-orntithine was also studied with regard to antibacterial activity. Our studies demonstrated that Fmoc-peptides (FmocFF, FmocFFKK, FmocFFFKK, FmocFFOO) formed surfactant-like soft gels at concentrations of 1% w/v and above using a method of glucono-δ-Lactone pH induction.

This bacterium is highly responsive to changes in its environment, resulting in the expression of a diverse array of genes that may contribute to the host inflammatory response. P. aeruginosa is well-known to induce neutrophilic inflammation via the activation of Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs). Recently, it was shown that pyocyanin, a phenazine produced by P. aeruginosa, binds to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), leading to neutrophilic inflammation as part of the host defense response. In this study, we have investigated the contribution of the TLR and AhR signaling pathways to the expression of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 in response to P. aeruginosa diffusible material. Although both pathways are involved in IL-8 synthesis, the AhR played a greater role when planktonic P. aeruginosa was grown in a media favoring phenazine synthesis. However, when P. aeruginosa was grown in a media that mimics the nutritional composition of CF sputa, both pathways contributed similarly to IL-8 synthesis. Finally, when P. aeruginosa was grown as a biofilm, the TLR pathway did not contribute to biofilm-driven IL-8 synthesis and AhR was found to only partially contribute to IL-8 synthesis, suggesting the contribution of another unknown signaling pathway. Therefore, the interaction between P. aeruginosa and airway epithelial cells is very dynamic, and sensor engagement is variable according to the adaptation of P. aeruginosa to the CF lung environment.","authors":[{"name":"Lucie Roussel"},{"name":"Shantelle LaFayette"},{"name":"Dao Nguyen"},{"name":"Carolyn J Baglole"},{"name":"Simon Rousseau"}],"keywords":[{"word":"TLR2"},{"word":"TLR5"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"epithelium"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"innate immunity"}]},"article69":{"pmid":"28066389","title":"Harnessing Bacterial Signals for Suppression of Biofilm Formation in the Nosocomial Fungal Pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Faced with the continued emergence of antibiotic resistance to all known classes of antibiotics, a paradigm shift in approaches toward antifungal therapeutics is required.

Addition of methoxy or methyl groups at the C5-C7 positions led to retention of anti-biofilm activity, in some cases dependent on the alkyl chain length at position C2.

Some genes are considered to be involved in biofilm formation, but the specific mechanisms involved in this process remain unknown. This limited understanding of how some bacteria form biofilms is a major barrier to our comprehension of the progression of diseases caused by biofilm-producing bacteria. Several investigations have shown that the toxin-antitoxin (TA) operon is related to biofilm formation. This operon is composed of a toxin with RNAse activity and its cognate antitoxin. Previous reports have indicated that the antitoxin is able to inhibit toxin activity and modulate the expression of the operon as well as other target genes involved in oxidative stress and mobility. In this study, we characterize a toxin-antitoxin system consisting of XfMqsR and XfYgiT, respectively, from X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca strain 9a5c. These proteins display a high similarity to their homologs in X. fastidiosa strain Temecula and a predicted tridimensional structure that is similar to MqsR-YgiT from Escherichia coli. The characterization was performed using in vitro assays such as analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), size exclusion chromatography, isothermal titration calorimetry, and Western blotting. Using a fluorometric assay to detect RNAses, we demonstrated that XfMqsR is thermostable and can degrade RNA. XfMqsR is inhibited by XfYgiT, which interacts with its own promoter. XfYgiT is known to be localized in the intracellular compartment; however, we provide strong evidence that X. fastidiosa secretes wild-type XfYgiT into the extracellular environment via outer membrane vesicles, as confirmed by Western blotting and specific immunofluorescence labeling visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Taken together, our results characterize the TA system from X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c, and we also discuss the possible influence of wild-type XfYgiT in the cell.","authors":[{"name":"André da Silva Santiago"},{"name":"Juliano S Mendes"},{"name":"Clelton A Dos Santos"},{"name":"Marcelo A S de Toledo"},{"name":"Lilian L Beloti"},{"name":"Aline Crucello"},{"name":"Maria A C Horta"},{"name":"Marianna T de Pinho Favaro"},{"name":"Duber M M Munar"},{"name":"Alessandra A de Souza"},{"name":"Mônica A Cotta"},{"name":"Anete P de Souza"}],"keywords":[{"word":"OMV"},{"word":"Xylella fastidiosa"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"protein characterization"},{"word":"toxin-antitoxin system"}]},"article72":{"pmid":"28065820","title":"Bioavailability-enhanced Resveramax™ modulates quorum sensing and inhibits biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS), a cell-to-cell communication mechanism present in many bacterial species plays a key role in regulating the virulence factor and biofilm formation in many pathogens, which causes severe public health risk.

While species diversity has been shown to influence community function in many other natural systems, the question of how species diversity of host-associated symbiotic microbes contributes to pathogen resistance is just beginning to be explored. Understanding diversity effects on pathogen resistance could be particularly helpful in combating the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) which has caused dramatic population declines in many amphibian species and is a major concern for amphibian conservation. Our study investigates the ability of host-associated bacteria to inhibit the proliferation of Bd when grown in experimentally assembled biofilm communities that differ in species number and composition. Six bacterial species isolated from the skin of Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae) were used to assemble bacterial biofilm communities containing 1, 2, 3, or all 6 bacterial species. Biofilm communities were grown with Bd for 7 days following inoculation. More speciose bacterial communities reduced Bd abundance more effectively. This relationship between bacterial species richness and Bd suppression appeared to be driven by dominance effects-the bacterial species that were most effective at inhibiting Bd dominated multi-species communities-and complementarity: multi-species communities inhibited Bd growth more than monocultures of constituent species. These results underscore the notion that pathogen resistance is an emergent property of microbial communities, a consideration that should be taken into account when designing probiotic treatments to reduce the impacts of infectious disease.","authors":[{"name":"Jonah Piovia-Scott"},{"name":"Daniel Rejmanek"},{"name":"Douglas C Woodhams"},{"name":"S Joy Worth"},{"name":"Heather Kenny"},{"name":"Valerie McKenzie"},{"name":"Sharon P Lawler"},{"name":"Janet E Foley"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Community function"},{"word":"Microbial symbiont"},{"word":"Pathogen resistance"},{"word":"Synergy"}]},"article79":{"pmid":"28063792","title":"Syntheses and antiproliferative activities of novel phosphatidylcholines containing dehydroepiandrosterone moieties.","date":"2017-12-19","abs":"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a natural hormone with many beneficial properties including an anticancer activity.

It showed that the biofilm formation ability of qseC mutant was limited as compared to the wild type strain. We also show overexpression of qseB was in a qseC mutant. Interestingly, deletion of qseB in a qseC mutant restored a wild type phenotype. These results suggested that QseB may account for the impaired biofilm formation in the absence of QseC. Furthermore, deletion of qseB in wild type cells decreased biofilm formation, whereas overexpression of qseB in wild type cells increased biofilm formation. Quantitative real-time PCR also revealed the up-regulation of some fimbria-associated genes in a qseB overexpression strain. These results indicate that QseB may enhance biofilm formation in the presence of QseC.

This study reports that biofilm-derived exoproducts decrease the transcriptional activity of the anti-oxidant response element in bronchial epithelial cells. In a live co-culture assay of BEAS-2B cells and P. aeruginosa biofilm, the QS molecule 3OC12-HSL was an important but not sole contributor to the inhibition of basal NRF2 luciferase reporter activity. Moreover, biofilm-derived exoproducts and 3OC12-HSL decrease the expression of endogenous antioxidant response element-regulated genes hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase-1 (NQO-1) while they increase IL-8 expression. As previously reported, IL-8 expression is partially dependent on p38 MAPK activity, but the inhibitory effect of biofilm QS molecules on HO-1 and NQO-1 expression occurs independently of this protein kinase. Finally, the transfection of CFTRdelF508 but not its wild type counterpart decreases basal, planktonic PsaDM and sulforaphane-driven NRF2 luciferase reporter activity in BEAS-2B cells. Therefore, the presence of quorum sensing molecules derived from bacterial biofilms lowers the transcriptional activity of the anti-oxidant response element, which may contribute to the establishment of chronic bacterial infections, especially in the presence of mutated CFTR. Increasing NRF2 activity may thus be a promising strategy to potentiate anti-biofilm activity in cystic fibrosis lung disease.","authors":[{"name":"Lucie Roussel"},{"name":"Simon Rousseau"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CFTR"},{"word":"Cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"Infection"},{"word":"Oxidant"},{"word":"Transcription"},{"word":"p38 MAPK"}]},"article91":{"pmid":"28062003","title":"Identification of genes involved in Mycoplasma gallisepticum biofilm formation using mini-Tn4001-SGM transposon mutagenesis.","date":"2017-03-08","abs":"Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is an important pathogen that can cause chronic respiratory disease in chickens and infectious sinusitis in turkeys.

Biofilms have displayed an exceptionally high tolerance for chemotherapy, which is thought to be multifactorial. For instance, the matrix provides a physical barrier that decreases the penetration of antibiotics into the biofilm. Also, cells within the biofilms are phenotypically diverse. Likely, biofilm resilience arises from a combination of these and other, yet unknown, mechanisms. All of the currently existing antibiotics have been developed against single-cells (planktonic) bacteria. Therefore, so far, a very limited repertoire of molecules exists that can selectively act on mature biofilms. This situation has driven a progressive paradigm shift in drug discovery, in which searching for anti-biofilms has been urged to occupy a more prominent place. An additional challenge is that there are a very limited number of standardized methods for biofilm research, especially those that can be used for large-throughput screening of chemical libraries. Here, an experimental anti-biofilm platform for chemical screening is presented. It uses three assays to measure biofilm viability (with resazurin staining), total biomass (with crystal violet staining), and biofilm matrix (using a wheat germ agglutinin, WGA-fluorescence-based staining of the poly-N-acetyl-glucosamine, PNAG, fraction). All the assays were developed using Staphylococcus aureus as the model bacteria. Examples of how the platform can be used for primary screening as well as for functional characterization of identified anti-biofilm hits are presented. This experimental sequence further allows for the classification of the hits based upon the measured end-points. It also provides information on their mode of action, especially on long-term versus short-term chemotherapeutic effects. Thus, it is very advantageous for the quick identification of high-quality hit compounds that can serve as starting points for various biomedical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Malena E Skogman"},{"name":"Pia M Vuorela"},{"name":"Adyary Fallarero"}],"keywords":[]},"article99":{"pmid":"28060284","title":"Visualizing the Effects of Sputum on Biofilm Development Using a Chambered Coverglass Model.","date":"2018-12-14","abs":"Biofilms consist of groups of bacteria encased in a self-secreted matrix.

During this process, EB1, dynein, and ClipA form transient fibrous and then bar-like structures, novel configurations for +TIPS. Cells also respond in an autonomous manner, with cells separated by a septum able to maintain different MT dynamics. Surprisingly, all cells with depolymerized MTs rapidly repolymerize their MTs after air exchange above the static culture medium of biofilms. Although the specific gasotransmitter for this biofilm response is not known, we find that addition of hydrogen sulfide gas to growing cells recapitulates all aspects of reversible MT depolymerization and transient formation of +TIPs bars. However, as biofilms mature, physical removal of part of the biofilm is required to promote MT repolymerization, which occurs at the new biofilm edge. We further show MT depolymerization within biofilms is regulated by the SrbA hypoxic transcription factor and that without SrbA, MTs are maintained as biofilms form. This reveals a new mode of MT regulation in response to changing gaseous biofilm microenvironments, which could contribute to the unique characteristics of fungal biofilms in medical and industrial settings.","authors":[{"name":"Nandini Shukla"},{"name":"Aysha H Osmani"},{"name":"Stephen A Osmani"}],"keywords":[]},"article102":{"pmid":"28057476","title":"Operative treatment of early infection after internal fixation of limb fractures (exclusive of severe open fractures).","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Early infection after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a limb bone is defined as bacteriologically documented, deep and/or superficial surgical-site infection (SSI) diagnosed within 6months after the surgical procedure.

The principles are the same as for revision arthroplasty. Superficial SSIs should be differentiated from deep SSIs, based on the results of bacteriological specimens collected using flawless technique. A turning point in the local microbial ecology occurs around the third or fourth week, when a biofilm develops around metallic implants. This biofilm protects the bacteria. The treatment relies on both non-operative and operative measures, which are selected based on the time to occurrence of the infection, condition of the soft tissues, and stage of bone healing. Both the surgical strategy and the antibiotic regimen should be determined during a multidisciplinary discussion. When treating superficial SSIs after ORIF, soft-tissue management is the main challenge. The treatment differs according to whether the hardware is covered or exposed. Defects in the skin and/or fascia can be managed using reliable reconstructive surgery techniques, either immediately or after a brief period of vacuum-assisted closure. In deep SSIs, deciding whether to leave or to remove the hardware is difficult. If the hardware is removed, the fracture site can be stabilised provisionally using either external fixation or a cement rod. Once infection control is achieved, several measures can be taken to stimulate bone healing before the end of the classical 6-month interval.

The major regulator of biofilm formation in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are nucleotide-based second messenger signaling pathways. Nucleotide-based signaling is a ubiquitous signal transduction mechanism in all domains of life that relay changes in the extracellular or intracellular milieu to protein or RNA effectors, leading to adaptive physiological responses. To date, six bona fide nucleotide signaling pathways, (p)ppGpp, cAMP, cGMP, c-di-AMP, c-di-GMP and cGAMP, have been characterized with respect to basic pathway modules and phenotypic and physiological output. Thereby, c-di-GMP is by far the most complex signaling network with up to over 100 turnover protein in some bacteria. While c-di-GMP is a ubiquitous regulator of the motility/sessility switch which translates into the transition from acute to chronic infection, and (p)ppGpp has been shown to be required for persistence, the role of other nucleotide signaling pathways is comparatively poorly characterized. Due to their importance in chronic infections, interference with these signal transduction systems has emerged as a strategy for the control of recurrent bacterial infections. Substantial efforts are being placed in finding small molecules for antibiofilm chemotherapy. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of our current knowledge on bacterial nucleotide signaling and to provide an up-to-date perspective on small molecules thwarting these transduction pathways. Furthermore, we summarize the high-throughput approaches developed for the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of nucleotide turnover proteins or effectors from large chemical libraries. Implications and future prospects for the control of biofilm-related infections are discussed.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of AMPs as alternative anti-biofilm molecules for the control of biofilm-related infections. Biofilms are sessile communities of microbial cells embedded in a self-produced matrix and characterized by a low metabolic activity. Due to their peculiar physiological properties, bacteria/fungi in biofilms result more resistant to conventional antibiotic therapies compared with their planktonic counterparts. AMPs may be a promising strategy to combat biofilm-related infections, as many of them target the microbial membrane, thus being potentially effective also on metabolically inactive cells.

Sequencing of 22 consecutive VRE isolates identified the emergence of a single missense mutation (L152F) in relA, which constitutively activated the stringent response, resulting in elevated baseline levels of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp).

The root cause may be multifaceted, but the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely plays a key role. ROS are formed when redox enzymes accidentally transfer electrons to oxygen rather than to their physiological substrates. In this study, we confirm that the predominant intestinal anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron generates intracellular ROS at a very high rate when it is aerated. Fumarate reductase (Frd) is a prominent enzyme in the anaerobic metabolism of many bacteria, including B. thetaiotaomicron, and prior studies of Escherichia coli Frd showed that the enzyme is unusually prone to ROS generation. Surprisingly, in this study biochemical analysis demonstrated that the B. thetaiotaomicron Frd does not react with oxygen at all: neither superoxide nor hydrogen peroxide is formed. Subunit-swapping experiments indicated that this difference does not derive from the flavoprotein subunit at which ROS normally arise. Experiments with the related enzyme succinate dehydrogenase discouraged the hypothesis that heme moieties are responsible. Thus, resistance to oxidation may reflect a shift of electron density away from the flavin moiety toward the iron-sulfur clusters. This study shows that the autoxidizability of a redox enzyme can be suppressed by subtle modifications that do not compromise its physiological function. One implication is that selective pressures might enhance the oxygen tolerance of an organism by manipulating the electronic properties of its redox enzymes so they do not generate ROS.","authors":[{"name":"Zheng Lu"},{"name":"James A Imlay"}],"keywords":[]},"article126":{"pmid":"28049105","title":"Rapid adaptation of activated sludge bacteria into a glycogen accumulating biofilm enabling anaerobic BOD uptake.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAO) are known to allow anaerobic uptake of biological oxygen demand (BOD) in activated sludge wastewater treatment systems.

However, many subfractions of the LDL, which differ both in structure and composition, are present in the blood and among different individuals. Understanding the relationship between LDL structure and composition is key to unravel the specific role of various LDL components in the development and/or prevention of atherosclerosis. Here, we describe a model for analyzing small-angle X-ray scattering data for rapid and robust structure determination for the LDL. The model not only gives the overall structure but also the particular internal layering of the fats inside the LDL core. Thus, the melting of the LDL can be followed in situ as a function of temperature for samples extracted from healthy human patients and purified using a double protocol based on ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography. The model provides information on: (i) the particle-specific melting temperature of the core lipids, (ii) the structural organization of the core fats inside the LDL, (iii) the overall shape of the particle, and (iv) the flexibility and overall conformation of the outer protein/hydrophilic layer at a given temperature as governed by the organization of the core. The advantage of this method over other techniques such as cryo-TEM is the possibility of in situ experiments under near-physiological conditions which can be performed relatively fast (minutes at home source, seconds at synchrotron).

The focus here is on the impact of initial spatial localization and substrate diffusivity on the growth of a model microbial consortium consisting of a producer strain that consumes glucose and produces acetate and a scavenger strain that consumes the acetate. The mathematical model is based on an individual cell model where growth is described by Monod kinetics, and substrate transport is described by a continuum-based, non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion model where convective transport is negligible (e.g., in a biofilm). The first set of results focus on a single producer cell at the center of the domain and surrounded by an initial population of scavenger cells. The impact of the initial population density and substrate diffusivity is examined. A transition is observed from the highest initial density resulting in the greatest cell growth to cell growth being independent of initial density. A high initial density minimizes diffusive transport time and is typically expected to result in the highest growth, but this expected behavior is not predicted in environments with lower diffusivity or larger length scales. When the producer cells are placed on the bottom of the domain with the scavenger cells above in a layered biofilm arrangement, a similar critical transition is observed. For the highest diffusivity values examined, a thin, dense initial scavenger layer is optimal for cell growth. However, for smaller diffusivity values, a thicker, less dense initial scavenger layer provides maximal growth. The overall conclusion is that high density clustering of members of a food chain is optimal under most common transport conditions, but under some slow transport conditions, high density clustering may not be optimal for microbial growth.","authors":[{"name":"Michael Venters"},{"name":"Ross P Carlson"},{"name":"Tomas Gedeon"},{"name":"Jeffrey J Heys"}],"keywords":[]},"article133":{"pmid":"28045495","title":"Bacterial Networks on Hydrophobic Micropillars.","date":"2018-10-04","abs":"Bacteria have evolved as intelligent microorganisms that can colonize and form highly structured and cooperative multicellular communities with sophisticated singular and collective behaviors.

Staphyloccocus aureus, a ubiquitous human pathogen, is of specific clinical importance due to the rise of antibiotic resistant strains of this species, which can cause life-threatening infections. Although several methods have attempted to pattern bacterial cells onto solid surfaces at single cell resolution, no study has truly controlled the 3D architectures of growing colonies. Herein, we present a simple, low-cost method to pattern S. aureus bacterial colonies and control the architecture of their growth. Using the wetting properties of micropatterened poly(dimethyl siloxane) platforms, with help from the physiological activities of the S. aureus cells, we fabricated connected networks of bacterial microcolonies of various sizes. Unlike conventional heterogeneous growth of biofilms on surfaces, the patterned S. aureus microcolonies in this work grow radially from nanostrings of a few bacterial cells, to form micrometer-thick rods when provided with a nutrient rich environment. This simple, efficient, and low-cost method can be used as a platform for studies of cell-cell communication phenomena, such as quorum sensing, horizontal gene transfer, and metabolic cross-feeding especially during initial stages of colony formation.","authors":[{"name":"Zeinab Jahed"},{"name":"Hamed Shahsavan"},{"name":"Mohit S Verma"},{"name":"Jacob L Rogowski"},{"name":"Brandon B Seo"},{"name":"Boxin Zhao"},{"name":"Ting Y Tsui"},{"name":"Frank X Gu"},{"name":"Mohammad R K Mofrad"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial communication"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell patterning"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)"},{"word":"microbiome"}]},"article134":{"pmid":"28045163","title":"CRISPR-Cas9 technology: applications in genome engineering, development of sequence-specific antimicrobials, and future prospects.","date":"2018-02-01","abs":"The development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has revolutionized our ability to edit DNA and to modulate expression levels of genes of interest, thus providing powerful tools to accelerate the precise engineering of a wide range of organisms.

The objective of this review was to determine the status of current knowledge and challenges of the fate and transport of Escherichia coli in overland flow and their interaction within vegetative filter strip (VFS) as one of these implemented best management practices and to critically evaluate its use in that setting as an indicator organism. With few studies directly focusing on VFS removal of E. coli from overland flow, we critically evaluated the available data on movement of E. coil from fecal source loading to retention and decay or re-release for potential contamination of water ways and pointed out potential limitations in both pathogen-specific removal and its use as an indicator organisms within overland flow and VFS. Critical areas of focus for future studies to reduce gaps in knowledge were identified, and the integration of newer approaches in source tracking, alternative indicators and the use of non-pathogenic surrogates for field testing of existing VFS models was encouraged. With VFS as a growing field of interest as an economical conservation practice and as an avenue for conservation of resources for small-scale agro-pastoral operations, management strategies to reduce initial fecal load from either applied manure constituents or shedding from free-range animals will continue to test the limits in the applications of models to overland flow and VFS management strategies. Further studies at the microscale in understanding discrepancies between low and high pathogenicity strains of E. coil and between E. coil and other fecal pathogens in the context of VFS will be critical.

We test our predictions experimentally using strains of Escherichia coli that grow at a similar rate but differ in cell shape due to single amino acid changes in the actin homolog MreB.

They are crucial for modulating biofilm formation and bacterial-host interactions. Glycosylation of SRRPs plays a pivotal role in the process; thus understanding the glycosyltransferases involved is key to identifying new therapeutic drug targets. The glycosylation of Fap1, an SRRP of Streptococcus parasanguinis, is mediated by a gene cluster consisting of six genes: gtf1, gtf2, gly, gtf3, dGT1, and galT2 Mature Fap1 glycan possesses the sequence of Rha1-3Glc1-(Glc1-3GlcNAc1)-2,6-Glc1-6GlcNAc. Gtf12, Gtf3, and dGT1 are responsible for the first four steps of the Fap1 glycosylation, catalyzing the transfer of GlcNAc, Glc, Glc, and GlcNAc residues to the protein backbone sequentially. The role of GalT2 and Gly in the Fap1 glycosylation is unknown. In the present study, we synthesized the fully modified Fap1 glycan in Escherichia coli by incorporating all six genes from the cluster. This study represents the first reconstitution of an exogenous stepwise O-glycosylation synthetic pathway in E. coli In addition, we have determined that GalT2 mediates the fifth step of the Fap1 glycosylation by adding a rhamnose residue, and Gly mediates the final glycosylation step by transferring glucosyl residues. Furthermore, inactivation of each glycosyltransferase gene resulted in differentially impaired biofilms of S. parasanguinis, demonstrating the importance of Fap1 glycosylation in the biofilm formation. The Fap1 glycosylation system offers an excellent model to engineer glycans using different permutations of glycosyltransferases and to investigate biosynthetic pathways of SRRPs because SRRP genetic loci are highly conserved.","authors":[{"name":"Fan Zhu"},{"name":"Hua Zhang"},{"name":"Tiandi Yang"},{"name":"Stuart M Haslam"},{"name":"Anne Dell"},{"name":"Hui Wu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus parasanguinis"},{"word":"bacterial adhesion"},{"word":"glycoengineering"},{"word":"glycoprotein"},{"word":"glycoprotein biosynthesis"},{"word":"glycosylation"},{"word":"glycosyltransferase"},{"word":"rhamnosyltransferase"},{"word":"serine-rich repeat protein"}]},"article149":{"pmid":"28039134","title":"A Family of Secretory Proteins Is Associated with Different Morphotypes in Cryptococcus neoformans.","date":"2019-03-29","abs":"Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, can undergo a yeast-to-hypha transition in response to environmental cues.

Cfl1 has been shown to regulate morphology, biofilm formation, and intercellular communication.

Interestingly, some of these secretory proteins display cell type-specific expression patterns: Cfl1 is hypha specific, Dha2 is yeast specific, and Dha1 (delayed hypersensitivity antigen 1) is expressed in all cell types but is particularly enriched at basidia. Interestingly, Dha1 is induced by copper limitation and suppressed by excessive copper in the medium.

Bonding agents with 5% DMAHDM + 5% MPC had much greater reduction in biofilms than DMAHDM or MPC alone (p < 0.05). Biofilm CFU was reduced by 3 to 4 log via DMAHDM + MPC. Metabolic activities and polysaccharide of biofilms were also substantially reduced (p < 0.05). In conclusion, a novel bonding agent was developed for dental restorations with inhibition of biofilms, reducing CFU by 3 to 4 log. Besides remineralizartion and acid-neutralization via NACP to inhibit caries as shown previously, the multifunctional adhesive is promising for root restorations with subgingival margins to suppress periodontal pathogens and protect the periodontium.","authors":[{"name":"Lin Wang"},{"name":"Chunyan Li"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Ke Zhang"},{"name":"Yanmin Zhou"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"},{"name":"Mark A Reynolds"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Dental bonding agent"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"periodontal pathogens"},{"word":"protein-repellent"},{"word":"root caries"},{"word":"single and multiple species biofilms"}]},"article159":{"pmid":"29863159","title":"Blood Serum Affects Polysaccharide Production and Surface Protein Expression in S.

About half of the GGI consists of genes encoding a type IV secretion system (T4SS), and most of these genes are clustered in a ~28 kb region at one end of the GGI. Two additional genes (parA and parB) are found at the other end of the island. The remainder of the GGI consists mostly of hypothetical proteins, with several being identified as DNA-binding or DNA-processing proteins. The T4SS genes show similarity to those of the F-plasmid family of conjugation systems, with similarity in gene order and a low but significant level of sequence identity for the encoded proteins. However, several GGI-encoded proteins are unique from the F-plasmid system, such as AtlA, Yag, and TraA. Interestingly, the gonococcal T4SS does not act as a conjugation system. Instead, this T4SS secretes ssDNA into the extracellular milieu, where it can serve to transform highly competent Neisseria species, thereby increasing the transfer of genetic information. Although many of the T4SS proteins are expressed at low levels, this system has been implicated in several cellular processes. The secreted ssDNA is involved in the initial stages of biofilm formation, and the presence of the T4SS enables TonB-independent intracellular survival of N. gonorrhoeae strains during infection of cervical cells. Other GGI-like T4SSs have been identified in several other α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria, but the function of these GGI-like T4SSs is unknown. Remarkably, the presence of the GGI is related to resistance to several antibiotics.

Significant population differences were observed between mutant and wild type biofilms; V. dispar proportions increased (p<0.001), whilst A. naeslundii (p<0.01) and Streptococcus spp. (p<0.05) decreased in mutant biofilms. Keratinocytes produced less IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1α when stimulated with the mutant biofilms compared to wild type. Lack of mgl in P. gingivalis has been shown to affect microbial ecology in vitro, giving rise to a markedly different biofilm composition, with a more pro-inflammatory cytokine response from the keratinocytes observed. A possible role for methanethiol in biofilm formation and cytokine response with subsequent effects on oral malodor and periodontitis is suggested.","authors":[{"name":"Abish S Stephen"},{"name":"Emma Millhouse"},{"name":"Leighann Sherry"},{"name":"Joseph Aduse-Opoku"},{"name":"Shauna Culshaw"},{"name":"Gordon Ramage"},{"name":"David J Bradshaw"},{"name":"Gary R Burnett"},{"name":"Robert P Allaker"}],"keywords":[]},"article184":{"pmid":"28032543","title":"Candida albicans biofilm heterogeneity does not influence denture stomatitis but strongly influences denture cleansing capacity.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Approximately 20  % of the UK population wear some form of denture prosthesis, resulting in denture stomatitis in half of these individuals. Candida albicans is primarily attributed as the causative agent, due to its biofilm -forming ability. Recently, there has been increasing evidence of C. albicans biofilm heterogeneity and the negative impact it can have clinically; however, this phenomenon has yet to be studied in relation to denture isolates. The aims of this study were to evaluate C. albicans biofilm formation of clinical denture isolates in a denture environment and to assess antimicrobial activity of common denture cleansers against these tenacious communities. C. albicans isolated from dentures of healthy and diseased individuals was quantified using real-time PCR and biofilm biomass assessed using crystal violet. Biofilm development on the denture substratum poly(methyl methacrylate), Molloplast B and Ufi-gel was determined. Biofilm formation was assessed using metabolic and biomass stains, following treatment with denture hygiene products. Although C. albicans was detected in greater quantities in diseased individuals, it was not associated with increased biofilm biomass. Denture substrata were shown to influence biofilm biomass, with poly(methyl methacrylate) providing the most suitable environment for C. albicans to reside. Of all denture hygiene products tested, Milton had the most effective antimicrobial activity, reducing biofilm biomass and viability the greatest. Overall, our results highlight the complex nature of denture- related disease, and disease development cannot always be attributed to a sole cause. It is the distinct combination of various factors that ultimately determines the pathogenic outcome.","authors":[{"name":"Lindsay E O'Donnell"},{"name":"Hasanain K A Alalwan"},{"name":"Ryan Kean"},{"name":"Gareth Calvert"},{"name":"Christopher J Nile"},{"name":"David F Lappin"},{"name":"Douglas Robertson"},{"name":"Craig Williams"},{"name":"Gordon Ramage"},{"name":"Leighann Sherry"}],"keywords":[]},"article185":{"pmid":"28032239","title":"The Influence of Pregnancy on Sweet Taste Perception and Plaque Acidogenicity.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Objectives Women undergo different physiological and oral changes during pregnancy and this may increase the risk of dental caries and other oral diseases.

Incidence of aortic graft infections is 0.5 to 5% and the estimated mortality rate from aortic graft infections ranges from 8 to 27%. We present the case of a 73-year-old male patient with an infected abdominal aortic graft following an emergency ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Postemergency repair, he developed ischemic colitis with sigmoid colon perforation leading to fecal peritonitis and secondary sepsis. He developed a large infective collection within the aortic sac growing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus sensitive to linezolid. A percutaneous drain was placed in the aortic sac and this was irrigated with linezolid for a total of 28 days. The patient clinically improved. Overall, 7 months later, follow-up scan shows complete resolution of infection and the patient remains clinically stable. Conventional treatment of aortic graft infections involves an extra-anatomical bypass. Percutaneous drainage and antibiotic use may be used as bridging therapy for surgery or as definitive therapy when surgical treatment is impractical. Most aortic graft infections grow gram-positive cocci, the organisms form a biofilm which is protected from the external environment. Percutaneous drainage and antibiotic irrigation could possibly penetrate the biofilm and eradicate infection.

We previously demonstrated that strain TK1402, which was isolated from a Japanese patient with duodenal and gastric ulcers, has high biofilm-forming ability in vitro relative to other strains. In addition, we showed that outer membrane vesicles (OMV) play an important role in biofilm formation. The aim of this study was to analyze which protein(s) in the OMV contributes to biofilm formation in TK1402. We obtained a spontaneous mutant strain derived from TK1402 lacking biofilm-forming ability. The protein profiles of the OMV were compared between this mutant strain and the wild type, and it was found that AlpB, an outer membrane protein in the OMV of the mutant strain, was markedly decreased compared to that of the wild type. Restoration of TK1402 alpB to the mutant strain fully recovered the ability to form biofilm. However, restoration with alpB from other strains demonstrated incomplete recovery of biofilm-forming ability. We therefore inferred that the variable region of AlpB (amino acid positions 121 to 146) was involved in TK1402 biofilm formation. In addition, diversification of the AlpB sequence was shown to affect the ability to adhere to AGS cells.

The spacers were compared on hydraulic characterization and in biofouling studies with membrane fouling simulators (MFSs). The virgin feed spacer was characterized hydraulically by their resistance, measured in terms of feed channel pressure drop, performed by operating MFSs at varying feed water flow rates. Short-term (9 days) biofouling studies were carried out with nutrient dosage to the MFS feed water to accelerate the biofouling rate. Long-term (96 days) biofouling studies were done without nutrient dosage to the MFS feed water.

The six feed spacers were ranked on pressure drop (hydraulic characterization) and on biofouling impact (biofouling studies).

As prolonged complement activation is key to excessive inflammation, the aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-complement activities of ES. Results revealed that heat sensitive serine proteases in ES degrade multiple complement proteins in all steps of the three complement activation pathways. Importantly, C3a and C5a-major activators of inflammation-were also degraded by ES and pretreatment of these factors with ES completely blocked their ability to induce activation of human neutrophils. Pre-exposure of the neutrophils to ES did not affect their responsiveness to C3a/C5a and fMLP, indicating that the receptors for these activators on neutrophils were not affected by ES. Surprisingly, heat and serine protease inhibitor pretreatment did not affect the ability of ES to inhibit C5b-9 complex formation despite degrading complement proteins, indicating a second complement-inhibiting molecule in ES. Heated ES was as effective as intact ES in inhibiting C3 deposition upon activation of the alternative pathway, but was significantly less effective in wells with a classical or lectin pathway-specific coating. Unfortunately, the molecules affecting the complement system could not be identified due to an insufficient database for L. sericata. Together, larval ES inhibit complement activation by two different mechanisms and down-regulate the C3a/C5a-mediated neutrophil activation.

However, recent evidence has shown that the removal of these visible portions are not sufficient, and that biofilms can continue to form even with daily wiping. In this work, we tested an approach to detect the biofilms which are present after clinically wiping or sharp wound debridement.

In this prospective study, members of an interdisciplinary pressure ulcer team at a university hospital tested our method's ability to predict the generation of wound slough in the week that followed each blotting. A total of 70 blots collected from 23 pressure ulcers produced 27 wounds negative for staining and 43 positive. In the negative blots 55.6% were found to have decreased wound slough, while 81.4% with positive staining had either increase or unchanged wound slough generation.

Degradation of PQS by exogenous addition of HodC to planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa attenuated production of virulence factors, and reduced virulence in planta.

In static biofilms of the P. aeruginosa PA14 lasB::Tn mutant, the catalytic activity of HodC led to an increase in viable biomass in newly formed but also in established biofilms, and reduced the expression of genes involved in iron metabolism and siderophore production, such as pvdS, pvdL, pvdA, and pvdQ.

Stainless steel cathodes (SSCs) coupled to aluminum or carbon steel generated a higher mean current (0.39 mA) than that coupled to copper nickel (0.17 mA). Following 3 months of exposure, the bacterial composition of biofilms collected from the SSCs was determined and compared. Dominant bacterial taxa from the two higher current SSCs were different from that of the low-current SSC as determined by DGGE and verified by Illumina DNA-seq analysis. These results demonstrate that electrochemical current could influence the composition of dominant bacteria in metallic biofilms and that amplicon sequencing is sufficient to complement current methods used to study metallic biofilms in marine environments.","authors":[{"name":"Athenia L Oldham"},{"name":"Mia K Steinberg"},{"name":"Kathleen E Duncan"},{"name":"Zakari Makama"},{"name":"Iwona Beech"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA gene"},{"word":"316 stainless steel"},{"word":"Bacterial community"},{"word":"DNA-seq"},{"word":"Galvanic couples"},{"word":"Galvanic current"},{"word":"Marine biofilm"}]},"article223":{"pmid":"28013326","title":"Chronic rhinosinusitis: New understanding of specific and general Quality of life scores.","date":"2017-02-21","abs":"Our goal in treating chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is to reduce sinonasal symptoms and improve quality of life (QoL).

The proteogenomic data suggested that (1) anaerobic benzene degradation was activated by a yet unknown mechanism for conversion of benzene to benzoyl-CoA; (2) the central benzoyl-CoA degradation pathway involved reductive dearomatization by a class II benzoyl-CoA reductase followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage and modified β-oxidation; (3) the oxidative acetyl-CoA pathway was utilized for complete oxidation to CO2.

To avoid resistance, anti-virulence therapy has been proposed where toxicity is targeted rather than viability. Previously we have shown that norlichexanthone, a small non-reduced tricyclic polyketide produced by fungi and lichens, reduces expression of hla encoding α-hemolysin as well as the regulatory RNAIII of the agr quorum sensing system in S. aureus 8325-4. The aim of the present study was to further characterise the mode of action of norlichexanthone and its effect on biofilm formation. We find that norlichexanthone reduces expression of both hla and RNAIII also in strain USA300. Structurally, norlichexanthone resembles ω-hydroxyemodin that recently was shown to bind the agr two component response regulator, AgrA, which controls expression of RNAIII and the phenol soluble modulins responsible for human neutrophil killing. We show that norlichexanthone reduces S. aureus toxicity towards human neutrophils and interferes directly with AgrA binding to its DNA target. In contrast to ω-hydroxyemodin however, norlichexanthone reduces staphylococcal biofilm formation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes regulated by the SaeRS two-component system are repressed by norlichexanthone when compared to untreated cells, an effect that was mitigated in strain Newman carrying a partially constitutive SaeRS system. Our data show that norlichexanthone treatment reduces expression of key virulence factors in CA-MRSA strain USA300 via AgrA binding and represses biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Mara Baldry"},{"name":"Anita Nielsen"},{"name":"Martin S Bojer"},{"name":"Yu Zhao"},{"name":"Cathrine Friberg"},{"name":"Dan Ifrah"},{"name":"Nina Glasser Heede"},{"name":"Thomas O Larsen"},{"name":"Hanne Frøkiær"},{"name":"Dorte Frees"},{"name":"Lixin Zhang"},{"name":"Huanqin Dai"},{"name":"Hanne Ingmer"}],"keywords":[]},"article245":{"pmid":"28005521","title":"Characterization of nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from international human and veterinary surgeons.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Nasal colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is poorly described for surgeons, despite the increased exposure to nosocomial pathogens and at-risk patients.

In this treatise, we propose a new way of looking at dry eye, both evaporative and insufficiency, as the natural sequelae of decades of chronic blepharitis. Dry eye is simply the late form and late manifestation of one disease, blepharitis. We suggest the use of a new term in describing this one chronic disease, namely dry eye blepharitis syndrome (DEBS). Bacteria colonize the lid margin within a structure known as a biofilm. The biofilm allows for population densities that initiate quorum-sensing gene activation. These newly activated gene products consist of inflammatory virulence factors, such as exotoxins, cytolytic toxins, and super-antigens, which are then present for the rest of the patient's life. The biofilm never goes away; it only thickens with age, producing increasing quantities of bacterial virulence factors, and thus, increasing inflammation. These virulence factors are likely the culprits that first cause follicular inflammation, then meibomian gland dysfunction, aqueous insufficiency, and finally, after many decades, lid destruction. We suggest that there are four stages of DEBS which correlate with the clinical manifestations of folliculitis, meibomitis, lacrimalitis, and finally lid structure damage evidenced by entropion, ectropion, and floppy eyelid syndrome. When one fully understands the structure and location of the glands within the lid, it becomes easy to understand this staged disease process. The longer a gland can resist the relentless encroachment of the invading biofilm, the longer it can maintain normal function. The stages depend purely on anatomy and years of biofilm presence. Dry eye now becomes a very easy disease to understand. We feel that dry eye should be treated and prevented by early and routine biofilm removal through electromechanical lid margin debridement.","authors":[{"name":"James M Rynerson"},{"name":"Henry D Perry"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Demodex"},{"word":"MGD"},{"word":"aqueous insufficiency"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"meibomian gland disease"},{"word":"quorum-sensing gene activation"}]},"article252":{"pmid":"28003605","title":"Contribution of Streptococcus gordonii Hsa Adhesin to Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Adhesion of oral mitis group streptococci, such as Streptococcus gordonii, to acquired pellicle on the tooth surface is the first step in oral biofilm formation.

GO significantly enhanced the cell growth, biofilm formation, and biofilm development even up to a concentration of 500mg/L.

ROS levels were significantly increased by rGO at early phase, while they returned to the same levels as control at mature phase.

MSI excels at providing complementary information to existing methods for molecular analysis-such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics-and stands apart from other chemical imaging modalities through its capability to generate information that is simultaneously multiplexed and chemically specific. Today a diverse family of MSI approaches are applied throughout the scientific community to study the distribution of proteins, peptides, and small-molecule metabolites across many biological models. The inherent strengths of MSI make the technique valuable for studying microbial systems. Many microbes reside in surface-attached multicellular and multispecies communities, such as biofilms and motile colonies, where they work together to harness surrounding nutrients, fend off hostile organisms, and shield one another from adverse environmental conditions. These processes, as well as many others essential for microbial survival, are mediated through the production and utilization of a diverse assortment of chemicals. Although bacterial cells are generally only a few microns in diameter, the ecologies they influence can encompass entire ecosystems, and the chemical changes that they bring about can occur over time scales ranging from milliseconds to decades. Because of their incredible complexity, our understanding of and influence over microbial systems requires detailed scientific evaluations that yield both chemical and spatial information. MSI is well-positioned to fulfill these requirements. With small adaptations to existing methods, the technique can be applied to study a wide variety of chemical interactions, including those that occur inside single-species microbial communities, between cohabitating microbes, and between microbes and their hosts. In recognition of this potential for scientific advancement, researchers have adapted MSI methodologies for the specific needs of the microbiology research community. As a result, workflows exist for imaging microbial systems with many of the common MSI ionization methods. Despite this progress, there is substantial room for improvements in instrumentation, sample preparation, and data interpretation. This Account provides a brief overview of the state of technology in microbial MSI, illuminates selected applications that demonstrate the potential of the technique, and highlights a series of development challenges that are needed to move the field forward. In the coming years, as microbial MSI becomes easier to use and more universally applicable, the technique will evolve into a fundamental tool widely applied throughout many divisions of science, medicine, and industry.","authors":[{"name":"Sage J B Dunham"},{"name":"Joseph F Ellis"},{"name":"Bin Li"},{"name":"Jonathan V Sweedler"}],"keywords":[]},"article259":{"pmid":"28001217","title":"Biofilm inhibition activity of traditional medicinal plants from Northwestern Argentina against native pathogen and environmental microorganisms.","date":"2017-04-05","abs":"Plants have been commonly used in popular medicine of most cultures for the treatment of disease.

We therefore inferred that CrcZ indirectly impacts on biofilm formation by competing for Hfq. This hypothesis was supported by the findings that over-production of CrcZ mirrored the biofilm phenotype of the hfq deletion mutant, and that deletion of the crcZ gene augmented biofilm formation.

Bone apposition onto the implant surface starts earlier in trabecular bone than in compact bone. While the first new bone may be found on the implant surface around 1 week after installation, bone remodeling starts at between 6 and 12 weeks and continues throughout life. Bone remodeling also involves the bone-implant interface, thus transiently exposing portions of the implant surface. Surface modifications creating micro-rough implant surfaces accelerate the osseointegration process of titanium implants, as demonstrated in numerous animal experiments. Sandblasting followed by acid-etching may currently be regarded as the gold standard technique to create micro-rough surfaces. Chemical surface modifications, resulting in higher hydrophilicity, further increase the speed of osseointegration of titanium and titanium-zirconium implants in both animals and humans. Surface modifications of zirconia and alumina-toughened zirconia implants also have an influence on the speed of osseointegration, and some implant types reach high bone-to-implant contact values in animals. Although often discussed independently of each other, surface characteristics, such as topography and chemistry, are virtually inseparable. Contemporary, well-documented implant systems with micro-rough implant surfaces, placed by properly trained and experienced clinicians, demonstrate high long-term survival rates. Nevertheless, implant failures do occur. A low percentage of implants are diagnosed with peri-implantitis after 10 years in function.

In recent years, a high prevalence of peri-implant soft-tissue inflammation, associated with peri-implant bone loss, has been reported and the need for treatments similar to those offered for natural teeth affected by periodontitis has been proposed. This suggestion is based on the assumption that periodontal indices, such as probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing, are reliable indicators of the peri-implant tissue conditions and good predictors of future bone loss. However, based on a critical review of the literature in the present paper, it is concluded that periodontal indices are not reliable either for identifying peri-implant disease or for predicting future risk for peri-implant crestal bone loss and implant failure. The long-term experiences with dental implants, presented in the literature, indicate that the presence of bleeding on probing, probing pocket depths much larger than 4 mm and some bone loss seem to reflect, in most instances, normal conditions of well-functioning dental implants, bearing in mind that healing of dental implants is the result of a foreign body reaction with the formation of scar tissue. Therefore, the use of probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing assessments may lead to over-diagnosis and possibly to over-treatment of assumed biofilm-mediated peri-implantitis lesions. It is the opinion of the authors of this review that a treatment should only be initiated when a clinical problem is present based on patient's symptoms (discomfort, pain), the presence of swelling, redness and pus, and significant crestal bone loss over time (as verified with radiographs). The treatment should aim at resolving the infection, which could include removal of the implant.","authors":[{"name":"Pierluigi Coli"},{"name":"Véronique Christiaens"},{"name":"Lars Sennerby"},{"name":"Hugo De Bruyn"}],"keywords":[]},"article266":{"pmid":"28000045","title":"Nitrosative Stress Response in Vibrio cholerae: Role of S-Nitrosoglutathione Reductase.","date":"2017-06-26","abs":"Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, poses serious threats to humans worldwide.

Aap requires proteolytic cleavage to act as an intercellular adhesin. Whether and which staphylococcal proteases account for Aap processing is yet unknown.

In addition, the fluorescence patterns of biofilm formed from saliva of eight different donors are described under simulated gingivitis and caries conditions. Biofilm formation was analysed for 12 hours under flow conditions in a microfluidic BioFlux flow system with high performance microscopy using a camera to allow live cell imaging. For fluorescence images dedicated excitation and emission filters were used. Both green and red fluorescence were linearly related with the total biomass of the biofilms. All biofilms displayed to some extent green and red fluorescence, with higher red and green fluorescence intensities from biofilms grown in the presence of serum (gingivitis simulation) as compared to the sucrose grown biofilms (cariogenic simulation). Remarkably, cocci with long chain lengths, presumably streptococci, were observed in the biofilms. Green and red fluorescence were not found homogeneously distributed within the biofilms: highly fluorescent spots (both green and red) were visible throughout the biomass. An increase in red fluorescence from the in vitro biofilms appeared to be related to the clinical inflammatory response of the respective saliva donors, which was previously assessed during an in vivo period of performing no-oral hygiene. The BioFlux model proved to be a reliable model to assess biofilm fluorescence.

In the prominent pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, Pmr1 acts as a Golgi-resident ion pump that provides cofactors to mannosyltransferases, regulating the synthesis of mannans attached to glycoproteins. To gain insight into a putative conservation of such a crucial process within opportunistic yeasts, we were particularly interested in studying the role of the PMR1 homolog in a low-virulent species that rarely causes candidiasis, Candida guilliermondii. We disrupted C. guilliermondii PMR1 and found that loss of Pmr1 affected cell growth and morphology, biofilm formation, susceptibility to cell wall perturbing agents, mannan levels, and the wall composition and organization. Despite the significant increment in the amount of β1,3-glucan exposed at the wall surface, this positively influenced only the ability of the mutant to stimulate IL-10 production by human monocytes, suggesting that recognition of both mannan and β1,3-glucan, is required to stimulate strong levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, our results indicate C. guilliermondii sensing by monocytes was critically dependent on the recognition of N-linked mannans and β1,3-glucan, as reported in other Candida species. In addition, chemical remotion of cell wall O-linked mannans was found to positively influence the recognition of C. guilliermondii by human monocytes, suggesting that O-linked mannans mask other cell wall components from immune cells. This observation contrasts with that reported in C. albicans. Finally, mice infected with C. guilliermondii pmr1Δ null mutant cells had significantly lower fungal burdens compared to animals challenged with the parental strain. Accordingly, the null mutant showed inability to kill larvae in the Galleria mellonella infection model. This study thus demonstrates that mannans are relevant for the C. guilliermondii-host interaction, with an atypical role for O-linked mannans.","authors":[{"name":"María J Navarro-Arias"},{"name":"Tatiana A Defosse"},{"name":"Karine Dementhon"},{"name":"Katalin Csonka"},{"name":"Erika Mellado-Mojica"},{"name":"Aline Dias Valério"},{"name":"Roberto J González-Hernández"},{"name":"Vincent Courdavault"},{"name":"Marc Clastre"},{"name":"Nahúm V Hernández"},{"name":"Luis A Pérez-García"},{"name":"Dhirendra K Singh"},{"name":"Csaba Vizler"},{"name":"Attila Gácser"},{"name":"Ricardo S Almeida"},{"name":"Thierry Noël"},{"name":"Mercedes G López"},{"name":"Nicolas Papon"},{"name":"Héctor M Mora-Montes"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida guilliermondii"},{"word":"cell wall"},{"word":"host-fungus interplay"},{"word":"mannosylation pathway"},{"word":"protein glycosylation"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article291":{"pmid":"27994455","title":"Reduced Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation in the presence of chitosan-coated iron oxide nanoparticles.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus can adhere to most foreign materials and form biofilm on the surface of medical devices.

Using confocal and electron microscopy and flow cytometry, we found that direct current (DC) leads to cell death and changes in the architecture of biofilms formed by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear to play a role in DC-associated cell death, as there was an increase in ROS-production by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms following exposure to DC. An increase in the production of ROS response enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was observed for S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms following exposure to DC. Additionally, biofilms were protected from cell death when supplemented with antioxidants and oxidant scavengers, including catalase, mannitol and Tempol. Knocking out SOD (sodAB) in P. aeruginosa led to an enhanced DC effect.

Rhamnolipids represent a chemically heterogeneous group of secondary metabolites composed of one or two rhamnose molecules linked to one or mostly two 3-hydroxyfatty acids of various chain lengths. The biosynthetic pathway involves rhamnosyltransferase I encoded by the rhlAB operon, which synthesizes 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acids (HAAs) followed by their coupling to one rhamnose moiety. The resulting mono-rhamnolipids are converted to di-rhamnolipids in a third reaction catalyzed by the rhamnosyltransferase II RhlC. However, the mechanism behind the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids containing only a single fatty acid is still unknown. To understand the role of proteins involved in rhamnolipid biosynthesis the heterologous expression of rhl-genes in non-pathogenic Pseudomonas putida KT2440 strains was used in this study to circumvent the complex quorum sensing regulation in P. aeruginosa. Our results reveal that RhlA and RhlB are independently involved in rhamnolipid biosynthesis and not in the form of a RhlAB heterodimer complex as it has been previously postulated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mono-rhamnolipids provided extracellularly as well as HAAs as their precursors are generally taken up into the cell and are subsequently converted to di-rhamnolipids by P. putida and the native host P. aeruginosa. Finally, our results throw light on the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids containing one fatty acid, which occurs by hydrolyzation of typical rhamnolipids containing two fatty acids, valuable for the production of designer rhamnolipids with desired physicochemical properties.","authors":[{"name":"Andreas Wittgens"},{"name":"Filip Kovacic"},{"name":"Markus Michael Müller"},{"name":"Melanie Gerlitzki"},{"name":"Beatrix Santiago-Schübel"},{"name":"Diana Hofmann"},{"name":"Till Tiso"},{"name":"Lars Mathias Blank"},{"name":"Marius Henkel"},{"name":"Rudolf Hausmann"},{"name":"Christoph Syldatk"},{"name":"Susanne Wilhelm"},{"name":"Frank Rosenau"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biosurfactant"},{"word":"Biosynthesis pathway"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Pseudomonas putida"},{"word":"Rhamnolipids"}]},"article311":{"pmid":"27988234","title":"Deletion of the vacJ gene affects the biology and virulence in Haemophilus parasuis serovar 5.","date":"2017-02-02","abs":"Haemophilus parasuis is an important pathogen causing severe infections in pigs.

Thus, we hypothesized that PEI brushes inhibit bacterial adhesion owing to the dynamic motion of brushes in liquid environment.

Consequently, the total free energy of adhesion of C. albicans to this alloy became unfavorable after treatment with the investigated microbial extract. A linear relationship between the electron-donor property and the total free energy of adhesion has been found for both dental alloys.

Three different cadA genes (designated cadA1 to cadA3) were previously characterized in L. monocytogenes A novel putative cadmium resistance gene (cadA4) was recently identified through whole-genome sequencing, but experimental confirmation for its involvement in cadmium resistance is lacking. In this study, we characterized cadA4 in L. monocytogenes strain F8027, a cadmium-resistant strain of serotype 4b. By screening a mariner-based transposon library of this strain, we identified a mutant with reduced tolerance to cadmium and that harbored a single transposon insertion in cadA4 The tolerance to cadmium was restored by genetic complementation with the cadmium resistance cassette (cadA4C), and enhanced cadmium tolerance was conferred to two unrelated cadmium-sensitive strains via heterologous complementation with cadA4C Cadmium exposure induced cadA4 expression, even at noninhibitory levels. Virulence assessments in the Galleria mellonella model suggested that a functional cadA4 suppressed virulence, potentially promoting commensal colonization of the insect larvae.

The extent to which the emergence of fmt bypass mutations might compromise the therapeutic utility of actinonin is determined, in part, by the effects of these bypass mutations on fitness. Here, we characterize the phenotypic consequences of an fmt null mutation in the model organism Bacillus subtilis. An fmt null mutant is defective for several post-exponential phase adaptive programmes including antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, swarming and swimming motility and sporulation. In addition, a survey of well-characterized stress responses reveals an increased sensitivity to metal ion excess and oxidative stress. These diverse phenotypes presumably reflect altered synthesis or stability of key proteins involved in these processes.","authors":[{"name":"Yanfei Cai"},{"name":"Pete Chandrangsu"},{"name":"Ahmed Gaballa"},{"name":"John D Helmann"}],"keywords":[]},"article334":{"pmid":"27982704","title":"Tramadol, an Opioid Receptor Agonist: An Inhibitor of Growth, Morphogenesis, and Biofilm Formation in the Human Pathogen, Candida albicans.","date":"2018-08-24","abs":"Tramadol is a synthetic, centrally acting low-affinity agonist of μ-opioid receptors in humans.

Also, the effect of tramadol on germ tube formation, adhesion, and biofilms in Candida albicans was studied. Tramadol impaired in vitro growth of C. albicans. A time-dependent killing assay showed that it kills C. albicans within 24 h of exposure. Tramadol has strong activity against Candida virulence factors such as yeast-to-hyphal form switching and adhesion. C. albicans biofilms, which are notoriously resistant to many antifungals, were sensitive to tramadol. At 8 mg/mL of tramadol, 82% of early stage biofilms and 52.88% of matured biofilms were inhibited.

Although this is an important arm of host immunity, most studies examine how bacteria respond to iron restriction in laboratory rather than host settings, where the microbiome can potentially alter pathogen strategies for acquiring iron. One of the most important transcriptional regulators controlling bacterial iron homeostasis is Fur. Here we used a combination of RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq to characterize the iron-restricted and Fur regulons of the biofilm-forming opportunistic pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. We discovered that iron restriction and Fur regulate 4% and 3.5% of the genome, respectively. While most genes in these regulons were related to iron uptake and metabolism, we found that Fur also directly regulates the biofilm-dispersing enzyme Dispersin B, allowing A. actinomycetemcomitans to escape from iron-scarce environments. We then leveraged these datasets to assess the availability of iron to A. actinomycetemcomitans in its primary infection sites, abscesses and the oral cavity. We found that A. actinomycetemcomitans is not restricted for iron in a murine abscess mono-infection, but becomes restricted for iron upon co-infection with the oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii. Furthermore, in the transition from health to disease in human gum infection, A. actinomycetemcomitans also becomes restricted for iron.

These tubes allow non-limiting signal diffusion from one open end, thereby showing that population spatial extension away from an open boundary can be a main critical factor in QS.

Despite strict regulations, a number of pathogens persist within the food environment, which is greatly contributed to by a build-up of resistance mechanisms and also through the formation of biofilms.

In parallel, the growing concern of consumers regarding the use of chemically derived antimicrobials within food has led to a drive toward more natural products. As a consequence, the use of naturally derived antimicrobials has become of particular interest. In this study we investigated the efficacy of nisin A and its bioengineered derivative M21A in combination with food grade additives to treat biofilms of a representative foodborne disease isolate of Listeria monocytogenes. Investigations revealed the enhanced antimicrobial effects, in liquid culture, of M21A in combination with citric acid or cinnamaldehyde over its wild type nisin A counterpart. Subsequently, an investigation was conducted into the effects of these combinations on an established biofilm of the same strain. Nisin M21A (0.1 μg/ml) alone or in combination with cinnamaldehyde (35 μg/ml) or citric acid (175 μg/ml) performed significantly better than combinations involving nisin A. All combinations of M21A with either citric acid or cinnamaldehyde eradicated the L. monocytogenes biofilm (in relation to a non-biofilm control).

Seasonal fluctuations of natural fouling pressure and chemical fouling control strength against micro- and macrofoulers have previously been observed in Fucus, suggesting that control strength varies with threat. To date, a study on the seasonal composition of surface associated metabolites, responsible for much of the fouling control, has not been done. We sampled individuals of the two co-occurring species F. vesiculosus and F. serratus at monthly intervals (six per species and month) during a one-year field study. We analysed the chemical composition of surface associated metabolites of both Fucus species by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to describe temporal patterns in chemical surface composition. Additionally, we correlated abiotic and biotic parameters recorded monthly within the sampled habitat with the variation in the chemical surface landscape of Fucus. Our study revealed that the chemical surface composition of both Fucus species exhibits substantial seasonal differences between spring/summer and autumn/winter months. Light and temperature explained most of the seasonal variability in surface metabolite composition of both Fucus species. A strong summerly up-regulation of eighteen saccharides and two hydroxy acids in F. vesiculosus as well as of four fatty acids and two saccharides in F. serratus was observed. We discuss how these up-regulated molecules may have a complex effect on associated microfoulers, both promoting or decreasing fouling depending on metabolite and bacterial identity. These seasonal shifts in the surface metabolome seem to exert a compound control of density and composition of the Fucus associated biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Esther Rickert"},{"name":"Martin Wahl"},{"name":"Heike Link"},{"name":"Hannes Richter"},{"name":"Georg Pohnert"}],"keywords":[]},"article371":{"pmid":"27959782","title":"CRISPR-based genome editing of clinically important Escherichia coli SE15 isolated from indwelling urinary catheters of patients.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are clinically important problems that lead to serious morbidity and mortality, and indwelling urinary catheters are a major factor of UTIs.

A major regulatory pathway of such biofilm formation on medical devices is the quorum sensing mechanism via small molecule autoinducer-2 synthesized by LuxS enzyme. Here, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system for precise deletion of luxS gene in clinical isolate E. coli SE15. To this end, we constructed a donor DNA for homologous recombination to delete 93 bases in the chromosomal target (luxS) and observed the success rate of luxS deletion to be 22.7 %. We conducted biofilm assay to observe decreased biofilm formation in the E. coil SE15 ΔluxS mutants compared to wild-type E. coil SE15. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of E. coil SE15 ΔluxS mutants showed that the expression of luxS was below detection level.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Biofilm of P. aeruginosa in alginate beads and planktonic PA0725 were purified by anion-exchange chromatograph. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were immunized with the biofilm and then inhaled the same strain of P. aeruginosa. Anti-biofilm antibody titer was detected using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The cell count and differential count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured. The levels of cytokines (IL-17, IL-1β, MIP-2, and G-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in sera were also measured using an ELISA kit. RESULTS The sera anti-biofilm IgG antibody titer of immunized SD rats was increased significantly on the 5th and 8th days after inhalation. The IL-17 concentration was significantly higher on the 8th day after inhalation. The results indicated that when biofilm-pre-immunized rats were challenged with inhalation of PA0725 of P. aeruginosa, the biofilm acted as an antigen substance and mediated the antibody reaction of the antigen, which might cause serious airway inflammatory response and lung tissue injury. This effect may be related to IL-17.

Treatment with PodA disrupts P. aeruginosa biofilm formation similarly to DNase, suggesting interference with the pyocyanin-dependent release of extracellular DNA into the matrix.

Proportionally, the number of biological complications is also increasing. Among them, peri-implant disease is considered the most common cause of implant loss after osseointegration. In this context, microorganisms residing on the surfaces of implants and their prosthetic components are considered to be the primary etiologic factor for peri-implantitis. Some research groups have proposed combining surgical and non-surgical therapies with systemic antibiotics. The major problem associated with the use of antibiotics to treat peri-implantitis is that microorganisms replicate very quickly. Moreover, inappropriate prescription of antibiotics is not only associated with potential resistance but also and most importantly with the development of superinfections that are difficult to eradicate. Although antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) was discovered several years ago, aPDT has only recently emerged as a possible alternative therapy against different oral pathogens causing peri-implantitis. The mechanism of action of aPDT is based on a combination of a photosensitizer drug and light of a specific wavelength in the presence of oxygen. The reaction between light and oxygen produces toxic forms of oxygen species that can kill microbial cells. This mechanism is crucial to the efficacy of aPDT. To help us understand conflicting data, it is necessary to know all the particularities of the etiology of peri-implantitis and the aPDT compounds. We believe that this review will draw attention to new insights regarding the impact of aPDT on peri-implant disease.","authors":[{"name":"Lívia Jacovassi Tavares"},{"name":"Ana Claudia Pavarina"},{"name":"Carlos Eduardo Vergani"},{"name":"Erica Dorigatti de Avila"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Microorganisms"},{"word":"Peri-implantitis"},{"word":"Photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"Photosensitizer"}]},"article392":{"pmid":"27939941","title":"The Toxin-Antitoxin System DarTG Catalyzes Reversible ADP-Ribosylation of DNA.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The discovery and study of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems helps us advance our understanding of the strategies prokaryotes employ to regulate cellular processes related to the general stress response, such as defense against phages, growth control, biofilm formation, persistence, and programmed cell death.

However, the exact mode of cinnamaldehyde binding with LuxR and receptor interaction still remains inconclusive. In the current study, combined method of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the binding mode, dynamic and energy aspects of cinnamaldehyde derivatives into the binding site of LuxR.

In this work, the effectiveness of four anticancer drugs on the growth of A. baumannii ATTC BAA-747 was evaluated, including the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil and three DNA crosslinkers, namely cisplatin, mitomycin C (MMC) and merphalan. MMC was the most effective drug, having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of growth in Luria-Bertani medium at ca. 7 µg/mL and completely inhibiting growth at 25 µg/mL. Hence, MMC was tested against a panel of 21 clinical isolates, including 18 multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates, 3 of which were sensitive only to colistin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations of MMC in all tested strains were found to be similar to those of A. baumannii ATCC BAA-747, and MMC also effectively killed stationary-phase, persister and biofilm cells. Moreover, MMC was able to increase survival of the insect larvae Galleria mellonella against an otherwise lethal A. baumannii infection from 0% to ≥53% for the antibiotic-sensitive A. baumannii ATCC BAA-747 strain and the MDR strains A560 and A578.
