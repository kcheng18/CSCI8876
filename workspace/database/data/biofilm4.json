Here, we report antibiofilm activity and quorum sensing inhibition of aqueous seeds extract of Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) and biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against multidrug resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) isolated from typhoid patients and asymptomatic carriers. S. Typhi isolates revealed higher percentage (46%) of biofilm production identified by tissue culture plate (TCP) than Congo red agar (CRA) and tube adherence (TA) methods. The inhibition of biofilm-producing MDR S. Typhi isolates and pigment production of Chromobacterium violaceum (indicator bacteria) demonstrated the quorum sensing potential of nutmeg. The aqueous seed extract of nutmeg exhibited 87% of antibiofilm activity, while the biosynthesized AgNPs showed 99.1% of antibiofilm activity. Molecular docking studies of bioactive compounds of nutmeg against transcriptional regulatory protein RcsB and sensor kinase protein RcsC revealed interaction with the target proteins. It is proposed that biosynthesized AgNPs could be used as one of the effective candidates in treating asymptomatic typhoid carriers or typhoid patients and to control the subsistence of biofilm-producing S.

Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) plays a central role in controlling this transition and regulating biofilm formation via various effectors. As an effector of c-di-GMP in Escherichia coli and related species, the PilZ domain-containing protein YcgR responds to elevated c-di-GMP concentrations and acts on the flagellar motor to suppress bacterial motility in a brakelike fashion, which promotes bacterial surface attachment. To date, several target proteins within the motor, MotA, FliG, and FliM, along with different regulatory mechanisms have been reported. However, how YcgR acts on these components remains unclear. Here, we report that activated YcgR stably binds to MotA at the MotA-FliG interface and thereby regulates bacterial swimming. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that c-di-GMP rearranges the PilZ domain configuration, resulting in the formation of a MotA-binding patch consisting of an RXXXR motif and the C-tail helix α3. Moreover, we noted that a conserved region in the YcgR-N domain, which is independent of MotA interaction, is necessary for motility regulation. On the basis of these findings, we infer that the YcgR-N domain is required for activity on other motor proteins. We propose that activated YcgR appends to MotA via its PilZ domain and thereby interrupts the MotA-FliG interaction and simultaneously interacts with other motor proteins via its YcgR-N domain to inhibit flagellar motility. Our findings suggest that the mode of interaction between YcgR and motor proteins may be shared by other PilZ family proteins.","authors":[{"name":"Yan-Jie Hou"},{"name":"Wen-Si Yang"},{"name":"Yuan Hong"},{"name":"Ying Zhang"},{"name":"Da-Cheng Wang"},{"name":"De-Feng Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MotA"},{"word":"PilZ domain"},{"word":"biofilm regulation"},{"word":"cell signaling"},{"word":"crystal structure"},{"word":"cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP)"},{"word":"flagellar motility"},{"word":"molecular motor"},{"word":"multiple targets"},{"word":"second messenger"},{"word":"structure-function"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"31835971","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus communication in biofilm infections: insights through network and database construction.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"The polymicrobial nature of most infections is often characterized by complex biofilm communities, where pathogen interactions promote infection progression and severity.

In the presented work, we focused on the ability of neutrophils-the main cells of the host's immune system to recognize quorum sensing molecules (QSMs) produced by C. albicans, especially farnesol (FOH), farnesoic acid (FA), and tyrosol (TR), with emphasis on the neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in a process called netosis.

Some bacteria produce lipid A with a single hydroxylated secondary acyl chain. This hydroxylation is catalyzed by the dioxygenase LpxO, and is important for resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (e.g., polymyxins), survival in human blood, and pathogenicity in animal models. The lipid A of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be hydroxylated in both secondary acyl chains, but the genetic basis and physiological role of these hydroxylations are still unknown. Through the generation of single and double deletion mutants in the lpxO1 and lpxO2 homologs of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and lipid A analysis by mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that both LpxO1 and LpxO2 are responsible for lipid A hydroxylation, likely acting on different secondary acyl chains. Lipid A hydroxylation does not appear to affect in vitro growth, cell wall stability, and resistance to human blood or antibiotics in P. aeruginosa. In contrast, it is required for infectivity in the Galleria mellonella infection model, without relevantly affecting in vivo persistence. Overall, these findings suggest a role for lipid A hydroxylation in P. aeruginosa virulence that could not be directly related to outer membrane integrity.","authors":[{"name":"Alessandra Lo Sciuto"},{"name":"Matteo Cervoni"},{"name":"Roberta Stefanelli"},{"name":"Maria Concetta Spinnato"},{"name":"Alessandra Di Giamberardino"},{"name":"Carmine Mancone"},{"name":"Francesco Imperi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Galleria mellonella"},{"word":"LpxO1"},{"word":"LpxO2"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"hydroxylation"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"lipid A"},{"word":"resistance"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article10":{"pmid":"31835470","title":"Prevention of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation on Soft Contact Lenses by Allium sativum Fermented Extract (BGE) and Cannabinol Oil Extract (CBD).","date":"2020-01-28","abs":"Two natural mixtures, Allium sativum fermented extract (BGE) and cannabinol oil extract (CBD), were assessed for their ability to inhibit and remove Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on soft contact lenses in comparison to a multipurpose Soft Contact Lens-care solution present on the Italian market.

The available antifungal agents are few and other options are needed for the cryptococcosis treatment. In this work, we first analyzed the virulence of twelve C. neoformans and C. gattii strains assessing capsule thickness, biofilms formation, and survival and morbidity in the invertebrate model of Galleria mellonella and then we evaluated the antifungal activity of voriconazole (VRC) in vitro and in vivo also using G. mellonella. Our results showed that all Cryptococcus spp. isolates were able to produce capsule and biofilms, and were virulent using G. mellonella model. The VRC has inhibitory activity on planktonic cells with MIC values ranging from 0.03 to 0.25 μg/mL on Cryptococcus spp.; and these isolates were more tolerant to fluconazole (ranging from 0.25 to 16 μg/mL), the triazol agent often recommended alone or in combination with amphotericin B in the cryptococcosis therapy. In contrast, mature biofilms were less susceptible to the VRC treatment. The VRC (10 or 20 mg/kg) treatment of infected G. mellonella larvae significantly increased the larval survival when compared to the untreated group for the both Cryptococcus species and significantly decreased the fungal burden and dissemination in the larval tissue. Our findings corroborate with the literature data, supporting the potential use of VRC as an alternative for cryptococcosis treatment. Here, we emphasize the use of G. mellonella larval model as an alternative animal model for studies of antifungal efficacy on mycosis, including cryptococcosis.","authors":[{"name":"Cristina de Castro Spadari"},{"name":"Fernanda Walt Mendes da Silva de Bastiani"},{"name":"Pietro Bruno Bautista Pisani"},{"name":"Analy Salles de Azevedo Melo"},{"name":"Kelly Ishida"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungal"},{"word":"Cryptococcus"},{"word":"Galleria mellonella"},{"word":"Virulence"},{"word":"Voriconazole"}]},"article26":{"pmid":"31832440","title":"Purification of PIA and rSesC as Putative Vaccine Candidates Against Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is predominant at sites of biomaterial-associated infection (BAI) and frequently infects hospitalized individuals.","authors":[{"name":"Sara Bahonar"},{"name":"Maryam Ghazvinian"},{"name":"Mohamad Reza Haghshenas"},{"name":"Hamid Reza Goli"},{"name":"Bahman Mirzaei"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"Polysaccharide Intracellular Adhesin"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"}]},"article27":{"pmid":"31832426","title":"Tribal warfare: Commensal Neisseria kill pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae using its DNA.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"It is now abundantly clear that our microbiota (commensals) are critical for many physiological and developmental processes.

Here we introduce a novel application of Gini coefficient, herein named Aggregation Coefficient (AC), to quantify the aggregation levels of cystic fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CF-PA) isolates in vitro using 3D micrographs, Fiji and MATLAB. Different aggregation patterns of five strains were compared statistically using the numerical AC indexes, which correlated well with the size distribution curves plotted by different biovolumes of aggregates. To test the sensitivity of AC, aggregates of the same strains were treated with nitric oxide (NO), a dispersal agent that reduces the biomass of surface attached biofilms. Strains unresponsive to NO were reflected by comparable AC indexes, while those undergoing dispersal showed a significant reduction in AC index, mirroring the changes in average aggregate sizes and proportions. Therefore, AC provides simpler and more descriptive numerical outputs for measuring different aggregation patterns compared to current approaches.","authors":[{"name":"Yu-Ming Cai"},{"name":"David S Chatelet"},{"name":"Robert P Howlin"},{"name":"Zhi-Zhong Wang"},{"name":"Jeremy S Webb"}],"keywords":[]},"article29":{"pmid":"31831822","title":"Identification of a Phenylthiazole Small Molecule with Dual Antifungal and Antibiofilm Activity Against Candida albicans and Candida auris.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Candida species are a leading source of healthcare infections globally.

A common lifestyle choice that bacteria make is whether to exhibit individual behavior and exist in the free-living planktonic state or to engage in collective behavior and form sessile communities called biofilms. Transitions between individual and collective behaviors are controlled by the chemical cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing. Here, we show that quorum sensing represses Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation and virulence by activating expression of genes encoding the KinB-AlgB two-component system (TCS). Phospho-AlgB represses biofilm and virulence genes, while KinB dephosphorylates and thereby inactivates AlgB. We discover that the photoreceptor BphP is the kinase that, in response to light, phosphorylates and activates AlgB. Indeed, exposing P. aeruginosa to light represses biofilm formation and virulence gene expression. To our knowledge, P. aeruginosa was not previously known to detect and respond to light. The KinB-AlgB-BphP module is present in all pseudomonads, and we demonstrate that AlgB is the partner response regulator for BphP in diverse bacterial phyla. We propose that in the KinB-AlgB-BphP system, AlgB functions as the node at which varied sensory information is integrated. This network architecture provides a mechanism enabling bacteria to integrate at least two different sensory inputs, quorum sensing (via RhlR-driven activation of algB) and light (via BphP-AlgB), into the control of collective behaviors. This study sets the stage for light-mediated control of P. aeruginosa infectivity.","authors":[{"name":"Sampriti Mukherjee"},{"name":"Matthew Jemielita"},{"name":"Vasiliki Stergioula"},{"name":"Mikhail Tikhonov"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"}],"keywords":[]},"article38":{"pmid":"31830032","title":"NUFEB: A massively parallel simulator for individual-based modelling of microbial communities.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"We present NUFEB (Newcastle University Frontiers in Engineering Biology), a flexible, efficient, and open source software for simulating the 3D dynamics of microbial communities.

This approach allows us to study population behaviours that emerge from the interaction between individuals and their environment.

A wide range of biological, physical and chemical processes are implemented to explicitly model microbial systems, with particular emphasis on biofilms. NUFEB is fully parallelised and allows for the simulation of large numbers of microbes (107 individuals and beyond). The parallelisation is based on a domain decomposition scheme that divides the domain into multiple sub-domains which are distributed to different processors. NUFEB also offers a collection of post-processing routines for the visualisation and analysis of simulation output.

Here, we report a two-component directed self-assembly mode: the phytochemicals berberine and cinnamic acid can directly self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) displaying good bacteriostastic activity. Compared with several first-line antibiotics, the obtained nanostructures have a better inhibitory effect on multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and stronger ability for biofilm removal. These qualities are attributed to the fact that organic assemblies can first spontaneously adhere to the surface of the bacteria, infiltrate into the cell, and then lead to converging attack against MRSA; thereafter, multipath bactericidal mechanisms of NPs on MRSA are found by both transcriptomic analysis and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis. Moreover, when combined with spectral data and single crystal X-ray diffraction, the NPs' self-assembly mechanism governed by hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions is clearly elucidated. These non-covalent interactions induce the NPs' formation of butterfly-like one-dimensional self-assembled units and finally layered three-dimensional spatial configuration. In addition, biocompatibility tests show that the NPs are nonhemolytic with little toxicity in vitro and in vivo.

The process of adhesion and further biofilm development depends, in part, on cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH). In this study, we compared the resistance of C. albicans strains with different CSH to the most commonly prescribed antifungal drug, fluconazole, and the newly described synergistic combination, fluconazole and gentamicin. The hydrophobic strain was more resistant to fluconazole due to, among others, overexpression of the ERG11 gene encoding the fluconazole target protein (CYP51A1, Erg11p), which leads to overproduction of ergosterol in this strain. Additionally, the hydrophobic strain displayed high efflux activity of the multidrug resistance Cdr1 pump due to high expression of the CDR1 gene. On the other hand, the hydrophobic C. albicans strain was more susceptible to fluconazole-gentamicin combination because of its different effect on lipid content in the two strains. The combination resulted in ergosterol depletion with subsequent Cdr1p mislocalization and loss of activity in the hydrophobic strain. We propose that C. albicans strains with different CSH may possess altered lipid metabolism and consequently may differ in their response to treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Jakub Suchodolski"},{"name":"Jakub Muraszko"},{"name":"Aleksandra Korba"},{"name":"Przemysław Bernat"},{"name":"Anna Krasowska"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Cdr1"},{"word":"cell surface hydrophobicity"},{"word":"ergosterol"},{"word":"fluconazole synergism"},{"word":"gentamicin"}]},"article47":{"pmid":"31825771","title":"Defying hard-to-heal wounds with an early antibiofilm intervention strategy: 'wound hygiene'.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"Biofilm has been implicated as a barrier to wound healing and it is widely accepted that the majority of wounds not following a normal healing trajectory contain biofilm.

Combination therapy involving current antibiotics and other biological or chemical molecules represents an attractive novel strategy. In this study, we investigated the synergistic antibacterial activity of a series of Trp-containing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with four classes of traditional chemical antibiotics that are inactive against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in vitro and in vivo. Among the antibiotics that we studied, penicillin, ampicillin and erythromycin showed a distinct synergistic effect in combination with all of the Trp-containing AMPs, represented by a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of <0.5. The antibacterial activities were noticeably improved, with 32-to 64-fold reductions in the MIC values for ampicillin and 16- to 32-fold reductions in the MIC values for erythromycin and penicillin. Tetracycline showed synergistic activity with only I1WL5W but additive activity with L11W, L12W, and I4WL5W. Ceftazidime exhibited additive activity with the Trp-containing peptides. In addition, the antibiotics in combination with the peptide significantly inhibited biofilm formation by MRSE 1208. A mechanistic study demonstrated that the Trp-containing peptides, especially I1WL5W and I4WL5W, which contain two tryptophan residues, disrupted bacterial inner and outer membranes, which promoted antibiotic delivery into the cytoplasm and access to cytoplasmic targets; however, L11W and L12W may have increased intracellular antibiotic concentrations by decreasing blaZ, tet(m) and msrA expression. Importantly, strong synergistic activity against the MRSE 1208 strain was observed for the combination of I1WL5W and penicillin in a mouse infection model. Thus, the combination of AMPs and traditional antibiotics could be a promising option for the prevention of acute and chronic infections caused by MRSE.","authors":[{"name":"Dejing Shang"},{"name":"Yue Liu"},{"name":"Fengquan Jiang"},{"name":"Fangyu Ji"},{"name":"He Wang"},{"name":"Xue Han"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Trp-containing peptide"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"membrane"},{"word":"synergism"}]},"article51":{"pmid":"31824466","title":"Biofilm Formation of Listeria monocytogenes Strains Under Food Processing Environments and Pan-Genome-Wide Association Study.","date":"2019-12-18","abs":"Concerns about food contamination by Listeria monocytogenes are on the rise with increasing consumption of ready-to-eat foods.

The quantity of sessile biomass varied according to growth conditions, lineage, serotype as well as genotype but association of clonal complex (CC) 26 genotype with biofilm production was evidenced under cold temperature. In general, relative biofilm productivity of each strain varied inconsistently across growth conditions. Under our experimental conditions, there were no clear associations between biofilm formation efficiency and persistent or prevalent genotypes. Distinct extrinsic factors affected specific steps of biofilm formation. Sudden nutrient deprivation enhanced cellular adhesion while a prolonged nutrient deficiency impeded biofilm maturation.

Here, we describe the central nervous system (CNS) of the short great-appendage euarthropod Alalcomenaeus based on material from two Cambrian Burgess Shale-type deposits of the American Great Basin, the Pioche Formation (Stage 4) and the Marjum Formation (Drumian). The specimens reveal complementary ventral and lateral views of the CNS, preserved as a dark carbonaceous compression throughout the body. The head features a dorsal brain connected to four stalked ventral eyes, and four pairs of segmental nerves. The first to seventh trunk tergites overlie a ventral nerve cord with seven ganglia, each associated with paired sets of segmental nerve bundles. Posteriorly, the nerve cord features elongate thread-like connectives. The Great Basin fossils strengthen the original description-and broader evolutionary implications-of the CNS in Alalcomenaeus from the early Cambrian (Stage 3) Chengjiang deposit of South China. The spatio-temporal recurrence of fossilized neural tissues in Cambrian Konservat-Lagerstätten across North America (Pioche, Burgess Shale, Marjum) and South China (Chengjiang, Xiaoshiba) indicates that their preservation is consistent with the mechanism of Burgess Shale-type fossilization, without the need to invoke alternative taphonomic pathways or the presence of microbial biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Javier Ortega-Hernández"},{"name":"Rudy Lerosey-Aubril"},{"name":"Stephen Pates"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alalcomenaeus"},{"word":"Burgess Shale-type preservation"},{"word":"Marjum Formation"},{"word":"Pioche Formation"},{"word":"palaeoneurobiology"}]},"article55":{"pmid":"31821997","title":"Effects of the Consumption of Probiotic Yogurt Containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 on the Levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli in Saliva of Students with Initial Stages of Dental Caries: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.","date":"2020-01-29","abs":"Dental caries, caused by oral microbiota, is one of the most common human diseases.

The VicRK 2-component system is crucial for bacterial adaptation, virulence, and biofilm organization and contains a global and vital response regulator, VicR. Notably, we identified an antisense vicR RNA (ASvicR) associated with an adjacent RNase III-encoding (rnc) gene that was relevant to microRNA-size small RNAs (msRNAs). Here, we report that ASvicR overexpression significantly impeded bacterial growth, biofilm exopolysaccharide synthesis, and cariogenicity in vivo. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the ASvicR RNA mainly regulated carbohydrate metabolism. In particular, overproducing ASvicR demonstrated a reduction in galactose and glucose metabolism by monosaccharide composition analysis. The results of high-performance gel permeation chromatography revealed that the water-insoluble glucans isolated from ASvicR presented much lower molecular weights. Furthermore, direct evidence showed that total RNAs were disrupted by rnc-encoded RNase III. With the coexpression of T4 RNA ligase, putative msRNA1657, which is an rnc-related messenger RNA, was verified to bind to the 5'-UTR regions of the vicR gene. Furthermore, ASvicR regulation revealed a sponge regulatory-mediated network for msRNA associated with adjacent RNase III-encoding genes. There was an increase in ASvicR transcript levels in clinical S. mutans strains from caries-free children, while the expression of ASvicR was decreased in early childhood caries patients; this outcome may be explored as a potential strategy contributing to the management of dental caries. Taken together, our findings suggest an important role of ASvicR-mediated sponge regulation in S. mutans, indicating the characterization of lactose metabolism by a vital response regulator in cariogenicity.

In this study, the aim was to assess the potential organohalide respiration capacity in wastewater biosolids by investigating actively organohalide respiring bacteria with a focus on organohalide respiration of PCBs and PCE. The results of the biosolids analysis showed increased amounts of products from PCB respiration. Simultaneously, experiments with organohalide respiration of PCE in biosolids samples showed significant decreases PCE concentration after 46 days (28-92%). Subsequently, it was evaluated if the OHR microbial populations in biosolids were similar to those present in intestinal human biofilms by applying a bioinformatic approach. The OHR populations of the communities were analyzed from existing American and Chinese human intestinal microbiomes. The overall groups Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes phyla dominated the microbiomes in all datasets. The OHR groups in biosolids and intestinal biofilms included Dehalogenimonas, Dehalobacter, Desulfitibacter, Desulfovibrio, Sulfurospirillum, Clostridium, and Comamonas. The results of this study showed that several OHR phyla were present in all samples independent of origin. Wastewater and intestinal microbiomes also contained OHR phyla. Overall, the results points towards using bacterial communities in biosolids as indicators of organohalide respiration in wastewater and intestinal microbiomes, which is related to ingestion or halogenated compounds.","authors":[{"name":"Ran Jing"},{"name":"Birthe V Kjellerup"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biosolids"},{"word":"Halogenated compounds"},{"word":"Intestinal biofilm"},{"word":"Organohalide respiring bacteria"},{"word":"Wastewater"}]},"article69":{"pmid":"31818247","title":"The Moraxella catarrhalis phase-variable DNA methyltransferase ModM3 is an epigenetic regulator that affects bacterial survival in an in vivo model of otitis media.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Moraxella catarrhalis is a leading cause of otitis media (OM) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Therefore, the availability of safe, pathogen-free drinking water is vital to public health. This need has resulted in global initiatives to develop sustainable urban water infrastructure for the treatment of wastewater for different purposes such as reuse water for irrigation, and advanced waste water purification systems for domestic water supply. In developed countries, most of the water goes through primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments combined with disinfectant, microfiltration (MF), reverse osmosis (RO), etc. to produce potable water. During this process the total bacterial load of the water at different stages of the treatment will decrease significantly from the source water. Microbial diversity and load may decrease by several orders of magnitude after microfiltration and reverse osmosis treatment and falling to almost non-detectable levels in some of the most managed wastewater treatment facilities. However, one thing in common with the different end users is that the water goes through massive distribution systems, and the pipes in the distribution lines may be contaminated with diverse microbes that inhabit these systems. In the main distribution lines, microbes survive within biofilms which may contain opportunistic pathogens. This review highlights the role of microbial community composition in the final effluent treated wastewater, biofilms formation in the distribution systems as the treated water goes through, and the subsequent health effects from potential pathogens associated with poorly treated water. We conclude by pointing out some basic steps that may be taken to reduce the accumulation of biofilms in the water distribution systems.","authors":[{"name":"Abasiofiok Mark Ibekwe"},{"name":"Shelton E Murinda"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"drinking water"},{"word":"pathogen"},{"word":"public health"},{"word":"water distribution systems"}]},"article72":{"pmid":"31817588","title":"Antibiotic Susceptibility Patterns of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis Strains from Different Decades.","date":"2020-01-28","abs":"The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of 57 Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 56 Porphyromonas gingivalis strains isolated from subgingival biofilm samples of periodontitis patients in Switzerland from 1980 to 2017.

Local bone infections were treated with antibiotics directly or by controlled drug-releasing scaffolds, like polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spheres, which have to be removed at a later stage, but there is a risk of a bacterial contamination during the removement. Therefore, biomaterials loaded with antibiotics for controlled release could be the method of choice: The biomaterials degrade during the drug release, therefore, there is no need for a second surgery to remove the drug eluting agent. Even non-resorbable bone materials are available (e.g., hydroxyapatite (HA)) or resorbable bone graft materials (e.g., beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP)) that will be replaced by newly formed bone. Composite materials with organic additives (e.g., collagen) supports the handling during surgery and enhances the drug loading capacity, as well as the drug releasing time. The purpose of this study was to investigate the loading capacity and the release rate of Vancomycin and Gentamicin on TCP and HA granules in the shape of a degradable scaffold compared to composite materials from TCP mixed with porcine collagen. Its antibacterial efficacy to a more elementary drug with eluting in aqueous solution was examined. The loading capacity of the biomaterials was measured and compared according to the Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) of a bacterial biofilm after 24 h aging. Antibiotic elution and concentration of gentamycin and vancomycin, as well as inhibition zones, were measured by using the Quantitative Microparticle Systems (QMS) immunoassays. The antibiotic concentration was determined by the automated Beckman Coulter (BC) chemistry device. For examination of the antibacterial activity, inhibition zone diameters were measured. Generally, the antibiotic release is more pronounced during the first couple of days than later. Both TCP granules and HA granules experienced a significantly decline of antibiotics release during the first three days. After the fourth day and beyond, the antibiotic release was below the detection threshold. The antibiotic release of the composite material TCP and porcine collagen declined less drastically and was still in the frame of the specification during the first nine days. There was no significant evidence of interaction effect between antibiotic and material, i.e., the fitted lines for Gentamycin and Vancomycin are almost parallel.

However, the peri-implant soft tissue complex lacks Sharpey's fibers, thus offering less resistance to clinical probing and biofilm penetration compared to the natural dentition. Therefore, the proper restorative emergence profile design is essential to facilitate favorable esthetic outcomes and maintain peri-implant health. The aim of this article is to review the currently available evidence related to the design of subgingival (critical and subcritical) and supragingival contours of the implant restorative emergence profile (IREP) as well as provide a flowchart for decision-making in clinical practice. Theoretically, the subgingival contours of the crown/abutment complex should mimic the morphology of the root and the cervical third of the anatomic crown as much and as often as possible. However, this is highly dependent upon the three-dimensional spatial position of the implant relative to the hard and soft tissue complex, in addition to the location of the definitive restoration. Frequently, a convex critical contour is required on the facial aspect of a palatally or incisally positioned implant to support an adequate gingival-margin architecture. Conversely, if the implant is placed too far facially, then a flat or concave contour is recommended. In instances where soft tissue support is not needed, the subcritical area may be undercontoured to increase the thickness, height, and stability of the soft tissue cuff.","authors":[{"name":"Stephen J Chu"},{"name":"Joseph Yk Kan"},{"name":"Ernesto A Lee"},{"name":"Guo-Hao Lin"},{"name":"Leila Jahangiri"},{"name":"Myron Nevins"},{"name":"Hom-Lay Wang"}],"keywords":[]},"article89":{"pmid":"31815139","title":"Efficacy of Artesunate against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Mediated by Iron.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of causing a variety of chronic infections due to the formation of biofilms.

Herein, we investigated whether artesunate, which is a type of iron-dependent drug, could influence Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation and structure, including the underlying mechanisms. Artesunate could enhance twitching motility significantly and decrease the proportion of surviving cells in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in a dose-dependent manner. Artesunate treatment also reduced biofilm thickness, diffusion in the biomass, and the content of Fe(II). However, changes in biofilm structure and ion concentration were very similar following treatment with 512 μg/ml and 1024 μg/ml artesunate. Interestingly, both biofilm structure and surviving cell fraction were recovered after iron supplementation. These results suggest that artesunate interferes with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by decreasing bacterial viability and enhancing twitching motility in an iron-independent manner.","authors":[{"name":"Lei Bao"},{"name":"Jinjin Guo"},{"name":"Lei Feng"},{"name":"Xianjie Zhou"},{"name":"Qi Lu"}],"keywords":[]},"article90":{"pmid":"31814991","title":"Biofilms facilitate cheating and social exploitation of β-lactam resistance in Escherichia coli.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli commonly resist β-lactam antibiotics using plasmid-encoded β-lactamase enzymes. Bacterial strains that express β-lactamases have been found to detoxify liquid cultures and thus to protect genetically susceptible strains, constituting a clear laboratory example of social protection. These results are not necessarily general; on solid media, for instance, the rapid bactericidal action of β-lactams largely prevents social protection. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the greater tolerance of biofilm bacteria for β-lactams would facilitate social interactions. We used a recently isolated E. coli strain, capable of strong biofilm formation, to compare how cooperation and exploitation in colony biofilms and broth culture drives the dynamics of a non-conjugative plasmid encoding a clinically important β-lactamase. Susceptible cells in biofilms were tolerant of ampicillin-high doses and several days of exposure were required to kill them. In support of our hypothesis, we found robust social protection of susceptible E. coli in biofilms, despite fine-scale physical separation of resistant and susceptible cells and lower rates of production of extracellular β-lactamase. In contrast, social interactions in broth were restricted to a relatively narrow range of ampicillin doses. Our results show that β-lactam selection pressure on Gram-negative biofilms leads to cooperative resistance characterized by a low equilibrium frequency of resistance plasmids, sufficient to protect all cells.","authors":[{"name":"Elli Amanatidou"},{"name":"Andrew C Matthews"},{"name":"Ute Kuhlicke"},{"name":"Thomas R Neu"},{"name":"James P McEvoy"},{"name":"Ben Raymond"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobials"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Evolution"},{"word":"Pathogens"}]},"article91":{"pmid":"31814741","title":"Combined Effects Of Low Incubation Temperature, Minimal Growth Medium, And Low Hydrodynamics Optimize Acinetobacter baumannii Biofilm Formation.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Biofilm formation is an important virulence factor expressed by Acinetobacter baumannii.

Furthermore, the inactivation of CREC cells in biofilms was explored by CLSM. Our results showed that UA has a MIC of 0.1 mg/mL against CREC.

The known structure and functions of biofilm indicate that it is one of the most widespread and most successful life forms on earth. The quorum sensing (QS) system plays a key role in biofilm because it is a mechanism by which bacteria regulate the gene expression profile according to the size of the microbial population, causing the formation of different forms of biofilm. The QS includes the auto-inducer-1 (AI- 1) system, which uses N-acyl-homoserine lactones as a signaling factor in the formation of biofilm by Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the auto-inducer-2 (AI-2) system identified as furanosyl borate diester present in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) have a natural antibacterial effect, which are produced by eukaryocytes and prokaryocytes, and have the ability to form pores in the bacterial cell membrane or interfere with its function. On the other hand, biofilm degrading enzymes - DNase I, alpha-amylase and dispersin B - reduce the weight of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and the number of cells in the biofilm. Natural compounds that inhibit the formation of bacterial biofilm have been distinguished, so-called QS inhibitors (QSI) and which quench active process (QSQ). In turn, genetic diversification of microorganisms in biofilm is largely responsible for shaping antibiotic resistance. The combined use of antibiotics with nanoparticles seems to be the most promising therapeutic option for bacterial biofilm. Silver nanoparticles with citrate in combination with aztreonam have been shown to have significant biofilm-destroying efficacy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and selenium nanoparticles used together with ampicillin, oxacillin and penicillin in 94% inhibited and interrupted the MRSA (methicillin-resistent) biofilm.

Investigating subcutaneous magnesium implants infected with bioluminescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa via in vivo imaging, we found that the rate of implant infections was critically dependent on a surprisingly high quantity of injected bacteria. At high inocula, bacteria were antibiotic-refractory immediately after infection. High cell densities are known to limit nutrient availability, restricting proliferation and trigger quorum sensing which could both contribute to the rapid initial resistance. We propose that gas bubbles such as those formed during magnesium corrosion, can then act as interfaces that support biofilm formation and permit long-term survival. This model could provide an explanation for the apparent ineffectiveness of innovative contact-dependent bactericidal implant surfaces in patients.

Biofilm formation by clinical and environmental reference strains was tested under different temperatures (24, 30, and 37 °C), pH (5.5, 7.5, and 8.5) and iron concentrations (18, 30, 50, 100, and 200 μM).

There was a strong, direct correlation between iron concentration in the growth medium and biofilm production by all strains tested. The current study indicates that biofilm formation might be important for the survival of V. vulnificus in vivo as well as in the marine environment.

In previous experiments, we found that the absence of phoP affects APEC biofilm formation and pathogenicity. To further explore the molecular mechanism of phoP regulation of these phenomena, the differentially expressed gene tolC was screened based on phoP-derived transcriptional data, and the specific sequence identity of the PhoP binding sequence was predicted by bioinformatics and verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The results showed that PhoP can directly bind to the tolC promoter. On this basis, tolC deletion and complementary strains were constructed. Biofilm formation was quantified by crystal violet staining and rdar morphology change was observed in these strains. Loss of tolC reduced biofilm formation. We also examined pathological changes in organ paraffin sections by challenging chicks with the strains. After loss of tolC, the clinical signs of pericarditis and liver and spleen enlargement in chicks were alleviated, and pathogenicity to the host cells was decreased. Additionally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that tolC deletion downregulated secA/secB/secE/secY transcript levels, which are part of the type II secretion system secreting virulence effector element.

Biofilm communities displayed a wide range of functional capabilities, with up to 53 505 gene probes detected. The capability of bacterial communities to (re)cycle carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur were detected. The cycling of major nutrients is important for maintaining the biofilm community as well as enabling the biogeochemical cycling and mobilisation of heavy and noble metals. Additionally, a multitude of stress- and heavy metal resistance capabilities were also detected, most notably from the α/β/γ-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.

The Parker Road and Belle Brooke sites were consistently the most different from other sites, which may be a result of local physicochemical conditions (extreme nutrient poverty and sulphur-richness, respectively).

Due to its use as a solvent, wetting agent, and stabilizer for chlorinated solvents employed in metal vapor degreasing, 1,4-dioxane has often been found to occur with a variety of co-contaminants, including heavy metals such as hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)]. Cr(VI) also occurs naturally in groundwater due to geological formations, but also has sources that can coincide with 1,4-dioxane from anthropogenic activities such as metal vapor degreasing. Biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane can be accomplished by microbes that use it as a source of carbon or energy as well as those that cometabolize it after growth on other organic substrates. A propanotroph, Mycobacterium austroafricanum JOB5, was grown in planktonic pure cultures and biofilms to determine its ability to cometabolize 1,4-dioxane in the presence of varying concentrations of Cr(VI). 1,4-Dioxane cometabolism by JOB5 planktonic cells was uninhibited by Cr(VI) at levels up to 10 mg/L, while biofilms were only mildly inhibited at 10 mg/L. As an important part of the biofilms commonly found in subsurface aquifers and engineered systems, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were found to play an important role in preventing Cr(VI) exposure to cells. We observed that soluble EPS were able to bind to Cr(VI) and theorize that biofilm-associated EPS additionally served to impede penetration of the biofilm structure by Cr(VI), thus mitigating exposure and toxicity. These findings suggest that bioremediation would be a viable treatment strategy for 1,4-dioxane-contaminated waters that contain elevated levels of Cr(VI) in natural and built environments.","authors":[{"name":"Nicholas W Johnson"},{"name":"Phillip B Gedalanga"},{"name":"Linduo Zhao"},{"name":"Baohua Gu"},{"name":"Shaily Mahendra"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biotransformation"},{"word":"Cyclic ether"},{"word":"Dichromate"},{"word":"Exopolysaccharides"},{"word":"Oxyanion"},{"word":"Transition metal"}]},"article142":{"pmid":"31806298","title":"Potassium channel blocker inhibits the formation and electroactivity of Geobacter biofilm.","date":"2020-03-27","abs":"Bacteria in biofilms are able to utilize potassium ion channel-mediated electrical signaling to achieve cell-cell communication.

Secondly, summarize the bactericidal activity of NP and AB due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The complete information was gathered from database and analysed as per the conjectured questions under laboratory versus environmental-relevant conditions (1. Fate of NPs and ABs, and 2. Will the presence of NPs and ABs alone and their mixtures influence the ROS concentration and antibacterial activity), and proposed six reactions to describe the fate of NP and AB in natural aquatic settings.

One promising method of disrupting biofilm formation and growth is to employ passive surface structures to inhibit bacterial adhesion and aggregation. However, most studies thus far have mainly focused on the early stages of biofilm formation and it is unclear if the influence of surface topography in the early phase will propagate to later stages. Here, we attempt to address this with an investigation into the biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on 25 different nanograting geometries, with dimensions that were systematically varied from subcellular to cellular sizes. The biofilms were characterized from the exponential growth phase to the decline phase, in intervals of 24 H over 4 days, using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Comparing the maximum volume of biofilm formed on each surface over 96 H, it was found that approximately 1/3 of the nanograting geometries exhibited 72 ± 16 % lower biovolume density than a flat surface. Bacteria on these nanogratings were also observed to form 40 ± 11 % smaller microcolonies that were 17 ± 6 % less compact than that found on the control surface. The majority of these nanogratings had deep trenches (i.e. depth ≥ 70% of the cell diameter). Furthermore, P. aeruginosa cells were observed to multiply at approximately twice the rate on almost all the nanogratings compared to flat surfaces, but these cell populations also began to decline 24 H earlier than those on a flat surface. Using available literature on P. aeruginosa, a qualitative model was put forth, attributing the results to increased cell motility, decreased exopolysaccharide formation and disrupted psl adhesin/ signal trails on nanogratings. These factors, together, led to the net effects of reduced attachment, increased scattering of cells and rapid decline of the biofilms on nanogratings. The insights derived from this study suggest that passive surface geometries can be designed and optimized to successfully control/ inhibit long-term biofilm formation and growth.","authors":[{"name":"C Q Lai"}],"keywords":[]},"article149":{"pmid":"31804801","title":"Polyfunctional Nanofibril Appendages Mediate Attachment, Filamentation, and Filament Adaptability in Leptothrix cholodnii.","date":"2019-12-05","abs":"Leptothrix is a species of Fe/Mn-oxidizing bacteria known to form long filaments composed of chains of cells that eventually produce a rigid tube surrounding the filament.

We show that in SP-6 nanofibrils are important for attachment and their distribution on young filaments post-attachment is correlated to the directionality of filament elongation. Elongating filaments demonstrate a surprising ability to adapt to their physical environment by changing direction when they encounter obstacles: they bend or reverse direction depending on the angle of the collision. We show that the forces involved in the collision can be used to predict the behavior of filament.

Whereas the exact function of LTA has not been elucidated, loss of LTA in some species affects hydrophobicity, biofilm formation, and cell division. Using a viable LTA-deficient strain of the human oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii, we demonstrated that LTA plays an important role in surface protein presentation. Cell wall fractions derived from the wild-type and LTA-deficient strains of S. gordonii were analyzed using label-free mass spectroscopy. Comparisons showed that the abundances of many proteins differed, including (i) SspA, SspB, and S. gordonii 0707 (SGO_0707) (biofilm formation); (ii) FtsE (cell division); (iii) Pbp1a and Pbp2a (cell wall biosynthesis and remodeling); and (iv) DegP (envelope stress response).

We aimed at investigating how a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm escapes ciprofloxacin treatment. P. aeruginosa PA14 in vitro mature biofilms were challenged with supra-MIC ciprofloxacin concentrations. Cell viability was quantified by fluorescein diacetate assay. Population dynamics were determined by counts of surviving culturable cells. Biofilms were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and the expression of genes involved in stringent response, toxin-antitoxin HigB/HigA, and type 3 secretion system (T3SS) was quantified by RT-qPCR in untreated and treated biofilms. Ciprofloxacin exposure resulted in an initial reduction of bacterial counts following a biphasic time-kill curve. After 24 h of treatment, the overall cell activity and the density of culturable cells significantly decreased as compared to untreated biofilm. No resistant mutant was isolated among the <1% surviving cells. Phenotypic adaptation toward persistence appeared to start after only 1 h of antibiotic exposure, by an overexpression of the genes involved in stringent response and in the toxin-antitoxin system, whereas the expression of genes encoding for the T3SS remained unchanged. After 4 h of ciprofloxacin exposure, stringent response genes returned to their basal level of expression. After a prolonged ciprofloxacin exposure, a deep alteration in the matrix structure that became thinner and lost mushroom-like aggregates was observed, in relation with reduced biovolumes of exopolysaccharides and extracellular DNA. These results support that ciprofloxacin might first induce the bacterial killing of most bacterial cells, but simultaneously activate stringent response mechanisms contributing to the switch of a subpopulation toward a persister phenotype. Once the persister phenotype is expressed, and despite an unexpected alteration of the biofilm matrix, ciprofloxacin fails to eradicate biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Anaïs Soares"},{"name":"Valérie Roussel"},{"name":"Martine Pestel-Caron"},{"name":"Magalie Barreau"},{"name":"François Caron"},{"name":"Emeline Bouffartigues"},{"name":"Sylvie Chevalier"},{"name":"Manuel Etienne"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"ciprofloxacin"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"stringent response"}]},"article173":{"pmid":"31798551","title":"Inhibitory Effect of Two Traditional Chinese Medicine Monomers, Berberine and Matrine, on the Quorum Sensing System of Antimicrobial-Resistant Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-12-11","abs":"The quorum sensing (QS) system controls bacterial biofilm formation, which is highly related to the virulence and resistance of pathogens.

By analyzing a collection of S. mitis strains isolated from the oral cavity at commensal states or from systemic infections (blood strains), we established that S. mitis ubiquitously express the surface immunodominant protein, PcsB (also called GbpB), required for binding to sucrose-derived exopolysaccharides (EPS). Immuno dot blot assays with anti-PcsB antibodies and RT-qPCR transcription analyses revealed strain-specific profiles of PcsB production associated with diversity in pcsB transcriptional activities. Additionally, blood strains showed significantly higher levels of PcsB expression compared to commensal isolates. Because Streptococcus mutans co-colonizes S. mitis dental biofilms, and secretes glucosyltransferases (GtfB/C/D) for the synthesis of highly insoluble EPS from sucrose, profiles of S. mitis binding to EPS, biofilm formation and evasion of the complement system were assessed in sucrose-containing BHI medium supplemented or not with filter-sterilized S. mutans culture supernatants. These analyses showed significant S. mitis binding to EPS and biofilm formation in the presence of S. mutans supernatants supplemented with sucrose, compared to BHI or BHI-sucrose medium. In addition, these phenotypes were abolished if strains were grown in culture supernatants of a gtfBCD-defective S. mutans mutant. Importantly, GtfB/C/D-associated phenotypes were enhanced in high PcsB-expressing strains, compared to low PcsB producers. Increased PcsB expression was further correlated with increased resistance to deposition of C3b/iC3b of the complement system after exposure to human serum, when strains were previously grown in the presence of S. mutans supernatants. Finally, analyses of PcsB polymorphisms and bioinformatic prediction of epitopes with significant binding to MHC class II alleles revealed that blood isolates harbor PcsB polymorphisms in its functionally conserved CHAP-domain, suggesting antigenic variation. These findings reveal important roles of PcsB in S. mitis-host interactions under commensal and pathogenic states, highlighting the need for studies to elucidate mechanisms regulating PcsB expression in this species.","authors":[{"name":"Erika N Harth-Chu"},{"name":"Lívia A Alves"},{"name":"Jéssica D Theobaldo"},{"name":"Mariana F Salomão"},{"name":"José F Höfling"},{"name":"William F King"},{"name":"Daniel J Smith"},{"name":"Renata O Mattos-Graner"}],"keywords":[{"word":"GbpB"},{"word":"PcsB"},{"word":"Streptococcus mitis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"complement immunity"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides"},{"word":"microbial ecology"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article175":{"pmid":"31798183","title":"Adhesion of biofilms on titanium measured by laser-induced spallation.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Eradication of established implant-associated and bacterial biofilm-forming infections remains difficult in part because these biofilms remain well-adhered to the implant surface. Few experimental techniques are available to measure macro-scale strength of bacterial biofilm-implant adhesion. We have adapted the laser spallation technique to compare the macro-scale adhesion strength of biofilms formed on titanium. By using a rapid pressure wave (35 ns) to load the interface, we prevent disturbance of the biofilm surface prior to measurement, and preclude the time necessary for the biofilm to respond to and adapt under loading. Biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, a Gram-positive bacterium associated with human dental caries (cavities) were cultured directly on commercially pure titanium within our custom substrate assembly. Growth conditions were varied by adding sucrose to the Todd Hewitt Yeast (THY) broth: THY control, 37.5 mM, 75 mM, 375 mM, and 750 mM sucrose. Multiple locations on each biofilm were loaded using the laser spallation technique. Loading pressure wave amplitude was controlled by adjusting laser fluence, energy per area. Initially, addition of sucrose to the media increased biofilm adhesion to titanium. However, once a saturation concentration of 75 mM sucrose was reached, increasing the sucrose concentration further resulted in a decrease in biofilm adhesion. This study is the first demonstration of the adaptation of the laser spallation technique to measure bacterial biofilm adhesion. Establishment of this macro-scale biofilm adhesion measurement technique opens the door for many biofilm-surface adhesion studies. We anticipate further work in this area towards understanding the complex relationships among bacteria species, environmental factors, surface characteristics, and biofilm adhesion strength.","authors":[{"name":"J D Boyd"},{"name":"N Korotkova"},{"name":"M E Grady"}],"keywords":[]},"article176":{"pmid":"31797934","title":"Self-regenerating giant hyaluronan polymer brushes.","date":"2020-02-19","abs":"Tailoring interfaces with polymer brushes is a commonly used strategy to create functional materials for numerous applications.

The platform provides a dynamic interface with tunable brush heights that extend up to 20 microns - two orders of magnitude thicker than standard brushes. The brushes are easily sculpted into micropatterned landscapes by photo-deactivation of the enzyme. Further, they provide a continuous source of megadalton hyaluronan or they can be covalently-stabilized to the surface. Stabilized brushes exhibit superb resistance to biofilms, yet are locally digested by fibroblasts. This brush technology provides opportunities in a range of arenas including regenerating tailorable biointerfaces for implants, wound healing or lubrication as well as fundamental studies of the glycocalyx and polymer physics.","authors":[{"name":"Wenbin Wei"},{"name":"Jessica L Faubel"},{"name":"Hemaa Selvakumar"},{"name":"Daniel T Kovari"},{"name":"Joanna Tsao"},{"name":"Felipe Rivas"},{"name":"Amar T Mohabir"},{"name":"Michelle Krecker"},{"name":"Elaheh Rahbar"},{"name":"Adam R Hall"},{"name":"Michael A Filler"},{"name":"Jennifer L Washburn"},{"name":"Paul H Weigel"},{"name":"Jennifer E Curtis"}],"keywords":[]},"article177":{"pmid":"31797835","title":"Evaluation of the Antibacterial Efficiency of a Combination of 1% Alexidine and Sodium Hypochlorite on Enterococcus faecalis Biofilm Models: An In Vitro Study.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"The aim of the study was to assess the antibacterial efficiency of a combination of 1% alexidine (ALX) and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) against E. faecalis biofilm using a confocal scanning electron microscopy.","authors":[{"name":"Anchu R Thomas"},{"name":"Rekha Mani"},{"name":"Tripuravaram Vk Reddy"},{"name":"Ashwin Ravichandran"},{"name":"Murali Sivakumar"},{"name":"Shobana Krishnakumar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alexidine"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Confocal laser scanning microscope"},{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis."}]},"article178":{"pmid":"31797692","title":"Synthesis and evaluation of polymeric micelle containing piperacillin/tazobactam for enhanced antibacterial activity.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"Infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa are important therapeutic complications.

However, the combination of various AMPs with different action mechanisms is rarely investigated. A newly designed lytic AMP ZXR-2.3 combined with antibiofilm peptide IDR-1018 or KT2 was tested for the antibiofilm effect on mature Streptococcus mutans biofilms.

Furthermore, cell-free filtrates of some isolates produced Mn oxides at specific time points, but this activity was not induced by Mn(II). Manganese oxide formation in cell-free filtrates occurred via reaction with the oxygen radical superoxide produced by soluble extracellular proteins.

The inhibitory effect on photocurrent of three commonly used herbicides (i.e., atrazine, diuron, and paraquat) was used as a means of measuring their concentrations in aqueous solution. The injection of atrazine and diuron into the algal medium caused an immediate photocurrent drop due to the inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport. The detected concentrations were suitable for environmental analysis, as revealed by a comparison with the freshwater quality benchmarks set by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States (US EPA). In contrast, paraquat caused an initial increase (~2 h) of the photocurrent effect of about 200%, as this compound can act as a redox mediator between the cells and the anode. A relatively long-term stability of the biosensor was demonstrated, by keeping anodes colonized with cyanobacterial biofilm in the dark at 4 °C. After 22 days of storage, the performance in terms of the photocurrent was comparable with the freshly prepared biosensor. This result was confirmed by the measurement of chlorophyll content, which demonstrated preservation of the cyanobacterial biofilm. The capacity of this biosensor to recover after a cold season or other prolonged environmental stresses could be a key advantage in field applications, such as in water bodies and agriculture.

Escherichia coli epitomizes these obstacles: this gram-negative bacterial species is the most prevalent agent of UTIs worldwide and can also colonize the urogenital tract in a phenomenon known as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Unfortunately, at the level of the individual E. coli strains, the relationship between UTI and ASB is poorly defined, confounding our understanding of microbial pathogenesis and strategies for clinical management. Unlike diarrheagenic pathotypes of E. coli, the definition of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) remains phenomenologic, without conserved phenotypes and known genetic determinants that rigorously distinguish UTI- and ASB-associated strains. This article provides a cross-disciplinary review of the current issues from interrelated mechanistic and diagnostic perspectives and describes new opportunities by which clinical resources can be leveraged to overcome molecular challenges. Specifically, we present our work harnessing a large collection of patient-derived isolates to identify features that do (and do not) distinguish UTI- from ASB-associated E. coli strains. Analyses of biofilm formation, previously reported to be higher in ASB strains, revealed extensive phenotypic heterogeneity that did not correlate with symptomatology. However, metabolomic experiments revealed distinct signatures between ASB and cystitis isolates, including in the purine pathway (previously shown to be critical for intracellular survival during acute infection).

Among the integron-positive isolates, 38.9% Salmonella spp. and 87.5% E. coli contained ∼800 or/and 1500 bp size gene cassette within the integrons. However, four S. aureus strains possessing class 1 integron without gene cassette were found. Although none of the isolated strains were found strong biofilm producer, 44.8% were found to have weak or moderate biofilm formation ability. Despite biofilm formation ability or not, the Salmonella spp. containing positive class 1 integron showed significant resistance to cefazolin and gentamicin. In addition, class 1 integron-positive E. coli isolates having the biofilm formation ability hardly showed sensitive to four antibiotics, such as amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, and gentamicin. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the prevalence of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes containing antibiotic resistance genes by the prudent use of antibiotics in livestock farms, and the improvement of food processing and storage environment.","authors":[{"name":"Wen Wang"},{"name":"Li Wang"},{"name":"Jianyu Su"},{"name":"Zhenbo Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic susceptibility"},{"word":"class 1 integron"},{"word":"foodborne pathogens"}]},"article197":{"pmid":"31793753","title":"Influence of carbon source complexity on porosity, water retention and extracellular matrix composition of Neurospora discreta biofilms.","date":"2020-03-03","abs":"To evaluate carbon source complexity as a process lever to impact the microstructure, chemical composition and water retention capacity of biofilms produced by Neurospora discreta.","authors":[{"name":"A Ahmed"},{"name":"R A Narayanan"},{"name":"A R Veni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"biopolymers"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"fungi"},{"word":"metabolism"}]},"article198":{"pmid":"31793092","title":"Chemotaxis and cyclic-di-GMP signalling control surface attachment of Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"Attachment to surfaces is an important early step during bacterial infection and during formation of submerged biofilms. Although flagella-mediated motility is known to be important for attachment of Escherichia coli and other bacteria, implications of motility regulation by cellular signalling remain to be understood. Here, we show that motility largely promotes attachment of E. coli, including that mediated by type 1 fimbriae, by allowing cells to reach, get hydrodynamically trapped at and explore the surface. Inactivation or inhibition of the chemotaxis signalling pathway improves attachment by suppressing cell reorientations and thereby increasing surface residence times. The attachment is further enhanced by deletion of genes encoding the cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP)-dependent flagellar brake YcgR or the diguanylate cyclase DgcE. Such increased attachment in absence of c-di-GMP signalling is in contrast to its commonly accepted function as a positive regulator of the sessile state. It is apparently due to the increased swimming speed of E. coli in absence of YcgR-mediated motor control, which strengthens adhesion mediated by the type 1 fimbriae. Thus, both signalling networks that regulate motility of E. coli also control its engagement with both biotic and abiotic surfaces, which has likely implications for infection and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Verena Maria Suchanek"},{"name":"María Esteban-López"},{"name":"Rémy Colin"},{"name":"Olga Besharova"},{"name":"Kirstin Fritz"},{"name":"Victor Sourjik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"chemotaxis"},{"word":"fimbriae"},{"word":"flagella"},{"word":"motility"}]},"article199":{"pmid":"31792794","title":"Towards sustainable system configuration for the treatment of fish processing wastewater using bioreactors.","date":"2020-03-03","abs":"The wastewater generated from fish processing industry contains a credible level of biodegradable proteins and low biodegradable fats, oils, and grease (FOG).

Here, we demonstrate that exogenous alginate protects S. aureus from P. aeruginosa in both planktonic and biofilm coculture models under a variety of nutritional conditions. S. aureus protection in the presence of exogenous alginate is due to the transcriptional downregulation of pvdA, a gene required for the production of the iron-scavenging siderophore pyoverdine as well as the downregulation of the PQS (Pseudomonas quinolone signal) (2-heptyl-3,4-dihydroxyquinoline) quorum sensing system. The impact of exogenous alginate is independent of endogenous alginate production. We further demonstrate that coculture of mucoid P. aeruginosa with nonmucoid P. aeruginosa strains can mitigate the killing of S. aureus by the nonmucoid strain of P. aeruginosa, indicating that the mechanism that we describe here may function in vivo in the context of mixed infections.

The initial evolution of such cooperation is likely to involve interactions that produce non-additive fitness effects among small groups of individuals in local populations. However, most models for the evolution of cooperation have focused on genealogically related individuals, assume that the factors influencing individual fitness are deterministic, that populations are very large, and that the benefits of cooperation increase linearly with the number of cooperative interactions. Here we show that stochasticity and non-additive interactions can facilitate the evolution of cooperation in small local groups. We derive a generalized model for the evolution of cooperation and show that if cooperation reduces the variance in individual fitness (separate from its effect on average fitness), this can aid in the evolution of cooperation through directional stochastic effects. In addition, we show that the potential for the evolution of cooperation is influenced by non-additivity in benefits with cooperation being more likely to evolve when the marginal benefit of a cooperative act increases with the number of such acts.

Simple models of signal propagation in heterogenous media, such as percolation theory, can potentially provide a quantitative understanding of these processes, but it is unclear whether these simple models properly capture the complexities of multicellular systems. We recently discovered that in biofilms of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the propagation of an electrical signal is statistically consistent with percolation theory, and yet it is reasonable to suspect that key features of this system go beyond the simple assumptions of basic percolation theory. Indeed, we find here that the probability for a cell to signal is not independent from other cells as assumed in percolation theory, but instead is correlated with its nearby neighbors. We develop a mechanistic model, in which correlated signaling emerges from cell division, phenotypic inheritance, and cell displacement, that reproduces the experimentally observed correlations. We find that the correlations do not significantly affect the spatial statistics, which we rationalize using a renormalization argument. Moreover, the fraction of signaling cells is not constant in space, as assumed in percolation theory, but instead varies within and across biofilms. We find that this feature lowers the fraction of signaling cells at which one observes the characteristic power-law statistics of cluster sizes, consistent with our experimental results. We validate the model using a mutant biofilm whose signaling probability decays along the propagation direction. Our results reveal key statistical features of a correlated signaling process in a multicellular community. More broadly, our results identify extensions to percolation theory that do or do not alter its predictions and may be more appropriate for biological systems.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoling Zhai"},{"name":"Joseph W Larkin"},{"name":"Kaito Kikuchi"},{"name":"Samuel E Redford"},{"name":"Ushasi Roy"},{"name":"Gürol M Süel"},{"name":"Andrew Mugler"}],"keywords":[]},"article213":{"pmid":"31790115","title":"A lipase-responsive antifungal nanoplatform for synergistic photodynamic/photothermal/pharmaco-therapy of azole-resistant Candida albicans infections.","date":"2019-12-18","abs":"A lipase-triggered drug release nanoplatform (PGL-DPP-FLU NPs) for multi-modal antifungal therapy is developed.

Novel PMMA cements were formulated containing AgNWs (0 and 1% w/w) and CS or CSMCC at various concentrations (0, 10, 20, and 30% w/w), testing two different ratios of powder and MMA (P/L). Mechanical, thermal, antibacterial, and cytotoxic properties of the resulting composite cements were tested. Cements with concentrations of CS > 10% presented a significantly reduced polymerization temperature. The mechanical performances were affected for concentrations > 20% with a P/L concentration equal to 2:1.

The significant increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens, together with their ability to form biofilms, is associated with morbidity and mortality. Research on novel synthetically prepared immunomodulators as potential antifungal immunotherapeutics is of serious interest. Our study demonstrated the immunobiological activity of synthetically prepared biotinylated mannooligosaccharides mimicking Candida antigenic factors using RAW264.7 macrophages. Macrophage exposure to the set of eight structurally different mannooligosaccharides induced a release of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cytokine signature patterns. The observed immune responses were tightly associated with structure, dose, exposure time, and selected signature cytokines. The viability/cytotoxicity of the mannooligosaccharide formulas was assessed based on cell proliferation. The structure-based immunomodulatory activity of the formulas was evaluated with respect to the length, branching and conformation of the various formulas. Glycoconjugate formulas with terminal β-mannosyl-units tended to be more potent in terms of Candida relevant cytokines IL-12 p70, IL-17, GM-CSF, IL-6, and TNFα induction and cell proliferation, and this tendency was associated with structural differences between the studied glycoconjugate formulas. The eight tested mannooligosaccharide conjugates can be considered potential in vitro immunomodulative agents suitable for in vitro Candida diagnostics or prospectively for subcellular anti-Candida vaccine design.","authors":[{"name":"Ema Paulovičová"},{"name":"Lucia Paulovičová"},{"name":"Pavol Farkaš"},{"name":"Alexander A Karelin"},{"name":"Yury E Tsvetkov"},{"name":"Vadim B Krylov"},{"name":"Nikolay E Nifantiev"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"RAW 264.7"},{"word":"cytokines"},{"word":"oligomannosides"},{"word":"proliferation"}]},"article221":{"pmid":"31787962","title":"RAFT-Derived Polymethacrylates as a Superior Treatment for Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis by Targeting Biotic Biofilms and Persister Cells.","date":"2019-12-09","abs":"Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common infection in need of more effective treatment.

Compared to mono-species biofilm, the biomass, bio-volume, and thickness of mixed-species biofilms were significantly lower, which were confirmed using crystal violet staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Further experimental analysis showed these variations might result from the reduction of bacterial numbers, the down-regulation of biofilm-regulated genes and loss of metabolic activity in mixed-species biofilm. In addition, V. parahaemolyticus was located primarily on the surface layers of the mixed-species biofilms thus accruing competitive advantage. This competitive advantage was evidenced in a higher V. parahaemolyticus population density in the mixed-species biofilms. The adhesion to surfaces of the mixed-species biofilms were also reduced due to lower concentrations of extracellular polysaccharide and protein when the structure of the mixed-species was examined using Raman spectral analysis, phenol-sulfuric acid method and Lowry method. Furthermore, the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration to antibiotics obviously decreased when V. parahaemolyticus co-exited with L. monocytogenes.

These species can establish cooperative and competitive interactions, possibly resulting in an increase or a decrease in antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, results obtained following inactivation of single-species biofilms by means of different technologies (e.g., Cold Atmospheric Plasma, CAP) should be validated for multi-species biofilms. First, a strongly adherent and mature Listeria monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium dual-species biofilm was developed by altering different incubation conditions, i.e., growth medium, incubation temperature, inoculum ratio of L. monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium cells, and incubation time. Adherence and maturity were quantified by means of optical density measurements and viable plate counts, respectively. Secondly, both the (1 day old) reference biofilm and a more mature 7 days old biofilm were treated for different CAP treatment times (0-30 min). Viable plate counts were again used to determine the (remaining) cell density. For both the biofilm development and inactivation, predictive models were applied to describe the growth/inactivation kinetics. Finally, the kinetics of the [1 and 7 day(s) old] dual-species biofilms were compared with those obtained for the corresponding single-species biofilms. Results implied that a strongly adherent and mature reference dual-species biofilm was obtained following 24 h of incubation at 25°C using 20-fold diluted TSB and an inoculum ratio of 1:1. Main observations regarding CAP inactivation were: (i) the dual-species biofilm age had no influence on the CAP efficacy, although a longer treatment time was required for the oldest biofilm, (ii) for the 1 day old biofilms, CAP treatment became less efficient for S. Typhimurium inactivation when this species was part of the dual-species biofilm, while L. monocytogenes inactivation was not influenced by the biofilm type, and (iii) for the 7 days old biofilms, CAP inactivation of both species became more efficient when they were part of the dual-species biofilms. It can be concluded that the efficacy of the CAP treatment is altered when cells become part of a dual-species biofilm, which is quite important with respect to a possible application of CAP for biofilm inactivation within the food industry.","authors":[{"name":"Marlies Govaert"},{"name":"Cindy Smet"},{"name":"James L Walsh"},{"name":"Jan F M Van Impe"}],"keywords":[{"word":"L. monocytogenes"},{"word":"S.

Here, oligomeric states of Hpa2 were explored, to understand the functional significance of oligomerization. Biochemical analysis suggests that Hpa2 exists as dimer in solution and self-assembles into tetramer in the spermine, spermidine and kanamycin bound form. Stability analysis with denaturants concludes that homo-oligomerization of Hpa2 relies on bound substrate and not on experimental conditions. Homo-oligomerization in Hpa2 depicts direct correlation with its polyamine acetylating capacity. This correlation and in silico model structures suggest that oligomerization of Hpa2 is associated with the hastening of acetylation process.

To prevent microbial infections, flower nectars and stigma exudates contain various antimicrobial compounds. Erwinia amylovora, the causing bacterium of the devastating fire blight apple disease, is the model pathogen that multiplies in flower secretions and infects through the nectaries. Although Erwinia-resistant apples are not available, certain cultivars are tolerant. It was reported that in flower infection assay, the 'Freedom' cultivar was Erwinia tolerant, while the 'Jonagold' cultivar was susceptible. We hypothesized that differences in the nectar protein compositions lead to different susceptibility. Indeed, we found that an acidic chitinase III protein (Machi3-1) selectively accumulates to very high levels in the nectar and the stigma exudate of the 'Freedom' cultivar. We show that three different Machi3-1 alleles exist in apple cultivars and that only the 5B-Machi3-1 allele expresses the Machi3-1 protein in the nectar and the stigma exudate. We demonstrate that the 5B-Machi3-1 allele was introgressed from the Malus floribunda 821 clone into different apple cultivars including the 'Freedom'. Our data suggest that MYB-binding site containing repeats of the 5B-Machi3-1 promoter is responsible for the strong nectar- and stigma exudate-specific expression. As we found that in vitro, the Machi3-1 protein impairs growth and biofilm formation of Erwinia at physiological concentration, we propose that the Machi3-1 protein could partially protect 5B-Machi3-1 allele containing cultivars against Erwinia by inhibiting the multiplication and biofilm formation of the pathogen in the stigma exudate and in the nectar.","authors":[{"name":"Anita Kurilla"},{"name":"Timea Toth"},{"name":"Laszlo Dorgai"},{"name":"Zsuzsanna Darula"},{"name":"Tamas Lakatos"},{"name":"Daniel Silhavy"},{"name":"Zoltan Kerenyi"},{"name":"Geza Dallmann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acidic chitinase"},{"word":"Antibacterial effect"},{"word":"Erwinia amylovora"},{"word":"MYB305"},{"word":"Nectar- and stigma-specific transcription"},{"word":"Promoter repeat"}]},"article252":{"pmid":"31781689","title":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in periodontal sites of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals in North Brazil: a cross-sectional study.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"This study aimed to investigate the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) prevalence and viral load in subgingival sites of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) positive (HIV+) individuals, correlating subgingival EBV load to the clinical periodontal condition, HIV systemic load, EBV systemic load, and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).","authors":[{"name":"Humberto Jácome-Santos"},{"name":"Thalita de Almeida Amanajás"},{"name":"Samara Tatielle Monteiro Gomes"},{"name":"Luiz Fernando Almeida Machado"},{"name":"Armando Rodrigues Lopes Pereira Neto"},{"name":"Sérgio de Melo Alves Junior"},{"name":"João de Jesus Viana Pinheiro"},{"name":"Bruno Pereira Alves"},{"name":"Ana Cláudia Braga Amoras-Alves"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)"},{"word":"antiretroviral therapy"},{"word":"human herpesvirus-4"},{"word":"periodontal pocket"},{"word":"﻿HIV-1"},{"word":"﻿periodontal diseases"}]},"article253":{"pmid":"31781595","title":"Effects of Norspermidine on Dual-Species Biofilms Composed of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"The present study aimed at investigating the influence of norspermidine on the formation of dual-species biofilms composed of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis).

Nucleic acids and the complexes that they form with proteins-including chromatin and ribonucleoproteins-are the main autoantigens in the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). How these nuclear molecules become available to the immune system for recognition, presentation, and targeting is an area of research where complexities remain to be disentangled. In this review, we discuss how bacterial infections participate in the exposure of nuclear autoantigens to the immune system in SLE. Infections can instigate pro-inflammatory cell death programs including pyroptosis and NETosis, induce extracellular release of host nuclear autoantigens, and promote their recognition in an immunogenic context by activating the innate and adaptive immune systems. Moreover, bacterial infections can release bacterial DNA associated with other bacterial molecules, complexes that can elicit autoimmunity by acting as innate stimuli of pattern recognition receptors and activating autoreactive B cells through molecular mimicry. Recent studies have highlighted SLE disease activity-associated alterations of the gut commensals and the expansion of pathobionts that can contribute to chronic exposure to extracellular nuclear autoantigens. A novel field in the study of autoimmunity is the contribution of bacterial biofilms to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Biofilms are multicellular communities of bacteria that promote colonization during chronic infections. We review the very recent literature highlighting a role for bacterial biofilms, and their major components, amyloid/DNA complexes, in the generation of anti-nuclear autoantibodies and their ability to stimulate the autoreactive immune response. The best studied bacterial amyloid is curli, produced by enteric bacteria that commonly cause infections in SLE patients, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella spps. Evidence suggests that curli/DNA complexes can trigger autoimmunity by acting as danger signals, molecular mimickers, and microbial chaperones of nucleic acids.","authors":[{"name":"Connie C Qiu"},{"name":"Roberto Caricchio"},{"name":"Stefania Gallucci"}],"keywords":[{"word":"autoantibodies"},{"word":"autoantigens"},{"word":"bacterial infections"},{"word":"extracellular DNA"},{"word":"lupus (SLE)"}]},"article255":{"pmid":"31781106","title":"Host-Microbial Interactions in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Periodontitis.","date":"2020-03-05","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Larissa Pessoa"},{"name":"Gajender Aleti"},{"name":"Saibyasachi Choudhury"},{"name":"Daniel Nguyen"},{"name":"Tina Yaskell"},{"name":"Yun Zhang"},{"name":"Weizhong Li"},{"name":"Karen E Nelson"},{"name":"Leopoldo Luiz Santos Neto"},{"name":"Adriana C P Sant'Ana"},{"name":"Marcelo Freire"}],"keywords":[{"word":"autoimmunity"},{"word":"cytokines"},{"word":"gingival crevicular fluid"},{"word":"host-microbes"},{"word":"oral-systemic"},{"word":"periodontal diseases"}]},"article256":{"pmid":"31781084","title":"A Field Study Into Hong Kong's Wet Markets: Raised Questions Into the Hygienic Maintenance of Meat Contact Surfaces and the Dissemination of Microorganisms Associated With Nosocomial Infections.","date":"2019-12-01","abs":"Millions every day purchase their raw meat in wet markets around the globe, especially in Hong Kong city, where modern and a traditional way of living is made possible.

Due to emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance, we evaluated in vitro the activity of fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, alone and in combinations, against E. coli and P. aeruginosa biofilms. Conventional microbiological tests and isothermal microcalorimetry were applied to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of the selected antibiotics against standard laboratory strains as well as clinical strains isolated from patients with prosthetic joint associated infections. The biofilm susceptibility to each antibiotic varied widely among strains, while fosfomycin presented a poor anti-biofilm activity against P. aeruginosa. Synergism of two-pair antibiotic combinations was observed against different clinical strains from both species. Highest synergism was found for the fosfomycin/gentamicin combination against the biofilm of E. coli strains (75%), including a gentamicin-resistant but fosfomycin-susceptible strain, whereas the gentamicin/ciprofloxacin combination presented synergism with higher frequency against the biofilm of P. aeruginosa strains (71.4%). A hypothetical bacteriolysis effect of gentamicin could explain why combinations with this antibiotic seem to be particularly effective. Still, the underlying mechanism of the synergistic effect on biofilms is unknown.

Both eDNA and eRNA was detected in biofilms collected at the end of the experiment (day 21). This suggests binding with organic or inorganic compounds or stabilization of these molecules in the biofilm matrix. The finding of the prolonged persistence of eRNA may provide new opportunities for improved biodiversity surveys through reducing false positives caused by legacy DNA and could also facilitate new research on environmental transcriptomics.","authors":[{"name":"Susanna A Wood"},{"name":"Laura Biessy"},{"name":"Janie L Latchford"},{"name":"Anastasija Zaiko"},{"name":"Ulla von Ammon"},{"name":"François Audrezet"},{"name":"Melania E Cristescu"},{"name":"Xavier Pochon"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biomonitoring"},{"word":"Detection"},{"word":"Droplet digital PCR"},{"word":"Species detection"}]},"article263":{"pmid":"31780159","title":"Nitrite accumulation stability evaluation for low-strength ammonium wastewater by adsorption and biological desorption of zeolite under different operational temperature.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"How to achieve stable nitrite accumulation was still a huge challenge for low-carbon and energy-saving biological nitrogen removal of low-strength ammonium wastewater.

They are promising novel antimicrobials since they have shown bactericidal effects against multiresistant bacteria. Their amphiphilic structure with hydrophobic and cationic regions drives their interaction with anionic bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, which leads to their disruption. In this work two synthetic designed AMPs, P5 and P6.2, which have been previously analyzed in their ability to interact with bacterial or eukaryotic membranes, were evaluated in their anti-biofilm and in vivo antibacterial activity. In a first step, a time-kill kinetic assay against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and a curve for hemolytic activity were performed in order to determine the killing rate and the possible undesirable toxic effect, respectively, for both peptides. The biofilm inhibitory activity was quantified at sub MIC concentrations of the peptides and the results showed that P5 displayed antibiofilm activity on both strains while P6.2 only on S. aureus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of bacteria treated with peptides at their MIC revealed protruding blisters on Gam-negative P. aeruginosa strain, but almost no visible surface alteration on Gram-positive S. aureus. These micrographs highlighted different manifestations of the membrane-disrupting activity that these kinds of peptides possess. Finally, both peptides were analyzed in vivo, in the lungs of neutropenic mice previously instilled with P. aeruginosa. Mice lungs were surgically extracted and bacteria and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-β, IL-6 and TNF-α) were quantified by colony forming units and ELISA, respectively. Results showed that instillation of the peptides produced a significant decrease in the number of living bacteria in the lungs, concomitant with a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Overall, the results presented here suggest that these two new peptides could be good candidates for future drug development for anti-biofilm and anti-infective therapy.","authors":[{"name":"Melina Martínez"},{"name":"Axel Polizzotto"},{"name":"Naiquén Flores"},{"name":"Liliana Semorile"},{"name":"Paulo César Maffía"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-Biofilm"},{"word":"Anti-inflammatory"},{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"Lung infection"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}]},"article271":{"pmid":"31778647","title":"Profiling Vaccinium macrocarpon components and metabolites in human urine and the urine ex-vivo effect on Candida albicans adhesion and biofilm-formation.","date":"2020-02-24","abs":"The aim of this work was to profile, by using an HPLC-MS/MS method, cranberry compounds and metabolites found in human urine after ingestion of a highly standardized cranberry extract (Anthocran®).

The Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), a Pa quorum sensing molecule, also chelates Fe, and delivers Fe to the Pa cell membrane using Pa siderophores. In models of Af biofilm formation or preformed biofilms, PQS inhibited Af in a low Fe environment. AfΔsidA (mutant unable to produce siderophores) biofilm was more sensitive to PQS inhibition than wild-type (WT), as was planktonic AfΔsidA growth. PQS decreased WT Af growth on agar. All these inhibitory actions were reversed by Fe. The Pa siderophore pyoverdin, or Af siderophore inhibitor celastrol, act cooperatively with PQS in Af inhibition. These findings all indicate PQS inhibition is owing to Fe chelation. Remarkably, in high Fe environments, PQS enhanced Af biofilm at 1/100 to 1/2000 Fe concentration required for Fe alone to enhance. Planktonic Af growth, and on agar, Af conidiation, were also enhanced by PQS+Fe compared to Fe alone. In contrast, neither AfΔsidA biofilm, nor planktonic AfΔsidA, were enhanced by PQS-Fe compared to Fe. When Af siderophore ferricrocin (FC),+PQS, were added to AfΔsidA, Af was then boosted more than by FC alone. Moreover, FC+PQS+Fe boosted AfΔsidA more than Fe, FC, FC+Fe, PQS+FC or PQS+Fe. Thus PQS-Fe maximal stimulation requires Af siderophores. PQS inhibits Af via chelation under low Fe conditions. In a high Fe environment, PQS paradoxically stimulates Af efficiently, and this involves Af siderophores. PQS production by Pa could stimulate Af in cystic fibrosis airways, where Fe homeostasis is altered and Fe levels increase, supporting fungal growth.","authors":[{"name":"Hasan Nazik"},{"name":"Gabriele Sass"},{"name":"Shajia R Ansari"},{"name":"Reyhan Ertekin"},{"name":"Hubertus Haas"},{"name":"Eric Déziel"},{"name":"David A Stevens"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aspergillus"},{"word":"Iron"},{"word":"PQS"},{"word":"Pseudomonas"}]},"article275":{"pmid":"31778072","title":"Bioactive extracts of Carum copticum and thymol inhibit biofilm development by multidrug-resistant extended spectrum β-lactamase producing enteric bacteria.","date":"2020-03-11","abs":"The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria is a clinical problem that requires novel anti-infective agents.

A currently promising additive is chitosan (CS), the deacetylated form of the biogenic scaffolding material chitin. Due to its hydrophilicity, chitosan is not compatible with most of the thermoplastic bio-based polymers like poly(lactic acid) (PLA) or polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). In this work, compatibilization between chitosan and two selected bio-based polyesters, PLA and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), was enhanced by grafting maleic anhydride (MAH) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), respectively, onto polymer chains using peroxide. The success of grafting was confirmed via titration methods. The effects of grafting agent and peroxide concentrations on grafting reaction and the physical and thermal properties of the functionalized polyesters were investigated. Compounding of the functionalized polyesters with different weight portions of chitosan was accomplished in a discontinuous internal mixer by in-situ functionalization, followed by blending with chitosan. The titration method, scanning electron microscopy, DSC, FTIR and mechanical characterization of the composites showed good interfacial adhesion and suggest the formation of covalent bonds between functional groups of the polyesters and chitosan, especially for the samples functionalized with GMA. The molecular weights (Mw) of the samples showed a change in the molecular weight related to the thermal degradation of the sample. The Mw of the samples grafted with MAH are lower than those functionalized with GMA. Furthermore, integration of chitosan into non-functionalized PLA polymer matrix showed a nucleating effect, while for PHBV, the increase of crystallinity with the content of chitosan was only observed for grafted PHBV.","authors":[{"name":"Oscar Vernaez"},{"name":"Katharina Julia Neubert"},{"name":"Rodion Kopitzky"},{"name":"Stephan Kabasci"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PHBV"},{"word":"bio-based polyesters"},{"word":"chitosan"},{"word":"glycidyl methacrylate"},{"word":"grafting onto"},{"word":"maleic anhydride"}]},"article284":{"pmid":"31775200","title":"Characteristic profiles of biofilm, enterotoxins and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from dairy cows in Xinjiang Province, China.","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"As an important zoonotic pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus has led to serious mastitis and endometritis in infected dairy cows.

To search for a new preventive material for oral biofilm-associated diseases, including dental caries, we investigated the effects of polypyrrole, which contains an electrochemical polymer and causes protonation and incorporation of anion under low pH condition, on the biofilm formation of S. mutans and other streptococci. In this study, polypyrrole was applied in biofilm formation assays with the S. mutans strains UA159 and its gtfB and gtfC double mutant (gtfBC mutant), S. sanguinis, S. mitis and S. gordonii on human saliva and bovine serum albumin-coated 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 0.25% sucrose. The effects of polypyrrole on biofilm formation were quantitatively and qualitatively observed. High concentrations of polypyrrole significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of S. mutans UA159 and S. sanguinis. As an inhibition mechanism, polypyrrole attached to the surface of bacterial cells, increased chains and aggregates, and incorporated proteins involving GTF-I and GTF-SI produced by S. mutans. In contrast, the biofilm formation of gtfBC mutant, S. sanguinis, S. mitis and S. gordonii was temporarily induced by the addition of low polypyrrole concentrations on human saliva-coated plate but not on the uncoated and bovine serum albumin-coated plates. Moreover, biofilm formation depended on live cells and, likewise, specific interaction between cells and binding components in saliva. However, these biofilms were easily removed by increased frequency of water washing. In this regard, the physical and electrochemical properties in polypyrrole worked effectively in the removal of streptococci biofilms.

We have observed that caffeine shows substantial antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa wherein the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of caffeine was found to be 200 μg/mL. The antibiofilm activity of caffeine was determined by performing a series of experiments using its sub-MIC concentrations (40 and 80 μg/mL). The results revealed that caffeine can significantly inhibit the biofilm development of P. aeruginosa. Caffeine has been found to interfere with the quorum sensing of P. aeruginosa by targeting the swarming motility. Molecular docking analysis further indicated that caffeine can interact with the quorum sensing proteins namely LasR and LasI. Thus, the result indicated that caffeine could inhibit the formation of biofilm by interfering with the quorum sensing of the organism. Apart from biofilm inhibition, caffeine has also been found to reduce the secretion of virulence factors from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Taken together, the results revealed that in addition to biofilm inhibition, caffeine can also decrease the spreading of virulence factors from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","authors":[{"name":"Poulomi Chakraborty"},{"name":"Debabrata Ghosh Dastidar"},{"name":"Payel Paul"},{"name":"Sutirtha Dutta"},{"name":"Debajjyoti Basu"},{"name":"Senjuti Roy Sharma"},{"name":"Shreosi Basu"},{"name":"Ranojit Kumar Sarker"},{"name":"Aparna Sen"},{"name":"Amit Sarkar"},{"name":"Prosun Tribedi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Caffeine"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"Virulence factor"}]},"article290":{"pmid":"31772594","title":"Biological Properties and Bioactive Components of Mentha spicata L.

The quantity and composition of EO from M. spicata cultivated in Palestine were analyzed seasonally over a three-year period. A significantly higher EO content was produced in summer and fall months (2.54-2.79%). Chemical analysis of EO revealed 31 compounds with oxygenated monoterpenes (90%) as the most abundant components followed by sesquiterpene and monoterpene hydrocarbons (6 and 3%, respectively). M spicata can be characterized as a carvone chemotype (65%). EO and carvone have shown strong inhibitory activities against the principal enzymes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and overweight diseases (cholinesterase and porcine pancreatic lipase) and also shown strong antidermatophytic activity against Microsporum canis, Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum. The pancreatic lipase inhibition and the synergism showed the potential activity of M. spicata EO and carvone and that their combinations with standard drugs can be useful for the treatment of obesity and overweight.

Antimicrobial treatment of these infections often fails, leading to expensive surgical intervention and increased risk of mortality to the patient. The challenge in treating these infections is associated with the high tolerance of S. aureus biofilm to antibiotics. MazEF, a toxin-antitoxin system, is thought to be an important regulator of this phenotype, but its physiological function in S. aureus is controversial. Here, we examined the role of MazEF in developing chronic infections by comparing growth and antibiotic tolerance phenotypes in three S. aureus strains to their corresponding strains with disruption of mazF expression. Strains lacking mazF production showed increased biofilm growth and decreased biofilm antibiotic tolerance. Deletion of icaADBC in the mazF::Tn background suppressed the growth phenotype observed with mazF-disrupted strains, suggesting the phenotype was ica dependent. We confirmed these phenotypes in our murine animal model. Loss of mazF resulted in increased bacterial burden and decreased survival rate of mice compared to its wild-type strain demonstrating that loss of the mazF gene caused an increase in S. aureus virulence. Although lack of mazF gene expression increased S. aureus virulence, it was more susceptible to antibiotics in vivo Combined, the ability of mazF to inhibit biofilm formation and promote biofilm antibiotic tolerance plays a critical role in transitioning from an acute to chronic infection that is difficult to eradicate with antibiotics alone.","authors":[{"name":"Dongzhu Ma"},{"name":"Jonathan B Mandell"},{"name":"Niles P Donegan"},{"name":"Ambrose L Cheung"},{"name":"Wanyan Ma"},{"name":"Scott Rothenberger"},{"name":"Robert M Q Shanks"},{"name":"Anthony R Richardson"},{"name":"Kenneth L Urish"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MazF"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"icaADBC"},{"word":"periprosthetic joint infection"},{"word":"surgical infection"},{"word":"toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems"}]},"article292":{"pmid":"31772058","title":"Evolution and Global Transmission of a Multidrug-Resistant, Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Lineage from the Indian Subcontinent.","date":"2020-02-07","abs":"The evolution and global transmission of antimicrobial resistance have been well documented for Gram-negative bacteria and health care-associated epidemic pathogens, often emerging from regions with heavy antimicrobial use. However, the degree to which similar processes occur with Gram-positive bacteria in the community setting is less well understood. In this study, we traced the recent origins and global spread of a multidrug-resistant, community-associated Staphylococcus aureus lineage from the Indian subcontinent, the Bengal Bay clone (ST772). We generated whole-genome sequence data of 340 isolates from 14 countries, including the first isolates from Bangladesh and India, to reconstruct the evolutionary history and genomic epidemiology of the lineage. Our data show that the clone emerged on the Indian subcontinent in the early 1960s and disseminated rapidly in the 1990s. Short-term outbreaks in community and health care settings occurred following intercontinental transmission, typically associated with travel and family contacts on the subcontinent, but ongoing endemic transmission was uncommon. Acquisition of a multidrug resistance integrated plasmid was instrumental in the emergence of a single dominant and globally disseminated clade in the early 1990s. Phenotypic data on biofilm, growth, and toxicity point to antimicrobial resistance as the driving force in the evolution of ST772. The Bengal Bay clone therefore combines the multidrug resistance of traditional health care-associated clones with the epidemiological transmission of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Our study demonstrates the importance of whole-genome sequencing for tracking the evolution of emerging and resistant pathogens. It provides a critical framework for ongoing surveillance of the clone on the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere.","authors":[{"name":"Eike J Steinig"},{"name":"Sebastian Duchene"},{"name":"D Ashley Robinson"},{"name":"Stefan Monecke"},{"name":"Maho Yokoyama"},{"name":"Maisem Laabei"},{"name":"Peter Slickers"},{"name":"Patiyan Andersson"},{"name":"Deborah Williamson"},{"name":"Angela Kearns"},{"name":"Richard V Goering"},{"name":"Elizabeth Dickson"},{"name":"Ralf Ehricht"},{"name":"Margaret Ip"},{"name":"Matthew V N O'Sullivan"},{"name":"Geoffrey W Coombs"},{"name":"Andreas Petersen"},{"name":"Grainne Brennan"},{"name":"Anna C Shore"},{"name":"David C Coleman"},{"name":"Annalisa Pantosti"},{"name":"Herminia de Lencastre"},{"name":"Henrik Westh"},{"name":"Nobumichi Kobayashi"},{"name":"Helen Heffernan"},{"name":"Birgit Strommenger"},{"name":"Franziska Layer"},{"name":"Stefan Weber"},{"name":"Hege Vangstein Aamot"},{"name":"Leila Skakni"},{"name":"Sharon J Peacock"},{"name":"Derek Sarovich"},{"name":"Simon Harris"},{"name":"Julian Parkhill"},{"name":"Ruth C Massey"},{"name":"Mathew T G Holden"},{"name":"Stephen D Bentley"},{"name":"Steven Y C Tong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bengal Bay"},{"word":"CA-MRSA"},{"word":"India"},{"word":"ST772"},{"word":"South Asia"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"WGS"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"genomic epidemiology"},{"word":"global transmission"},{"word":"phenotyping"},{"word":"phylodynamics"}]},"article293":{"pmid":"31772020","title":"Mechanical stress compromises multicomponent efflux complexes in bacteria.","date":"2020-03-25","abs":"Physical forces have a profound effect on growth, morphology, locomotion, and survival of organisms. At the level of individual cells, the role of mechanical forces is well recognized in eukaryotic physiology, but much less is known about prokaryotic organisms. Recent findings suggest an effect of physical forces on bacterial shape, cell division, motility, virulence, and biofilm initiation, but it remains unclear how mechanical forces applied to a bacterium are translated at the molecular level. In Gram-negative bacteria, multicomponent protein complexes can form rigid links across the cell envelope and are therefore subject to physical forces experienced by the cell. Here we manipulate tensile and shear mechanical stress in the bacterial cell envelope and use single-molecule tracking to show that octahedral shear (but not hydrostatic) stress within the cell envelope promotes disassembly of the tripartite efflux complex CusCBA, a system used by Escherichia coli to resist copper and silver toxicity. By promoting disassembly of this protein complex, mechanical forces within the cell envelope make the bacteria more susceptible to metal toxicity. These findings demonstrate that mechanical forces can inhibit the function of cell envelope protein assemblies in bacteria and suggest the possibility that other multicomponent, transenvelope efflux complexes may be sensitive to mechanical forces including complexes involved in antibiotic resistance, cell division, and translocation of outer membrane components. By modulating the function of proteins within the cell envelope, mechanical stress has the potential to regulate multiple processes required for bacterial survival and growth.","authors":[{"name":"Lauren A Genova"},{"name":"Melanie F Roberts"},{"name":"Yu-Chern Wong"},{"name":"Christine E Harper"},{"name":"Ace George Santiago"},{"name":"Bing Fu"},{"name":"Abhishek Srivastava"},{"name":"Won Jung"},{"name":"Lucy M Wang"},{"name":"Łukasz Krzemiński"},{"name":"Xianwen Mao"},{"name":"Xuanhao Sun"},{"name":"Chung-Yuen Hui"},{"name":"Peng Chen"},{"name":"Christopher J Hernandez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biomechanics"},{"word":"diffusion dynamics"},{"word":"extrusion loading"},{"word":"multicomponent efflux complex"},{"word":"single-molecule imaging"}]},"article294":{"pmid":"31771981","title":"Peptidoglycomics reveals compositional changes in peptidoglycan between biofilm- and planktonic-derived Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Peptidoglycan (PG) is a critical component of the bacterial cell wall and is composed of a repeating β-1,4-linked disaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid appended with a highly conserved stem peptide.

Finally, the potent antiviral activity observed converts these selenium derivatives into promising antiviral agents with potential medical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Gabriella Spengler"},{"name":"Annamária Kincses"},{"name":"Tímea Mosolygó"},{"name":"Małgorzata Anna Marć"},{"name":"Márta Nové"},{"name":"Márió Gajdács"},{"name":"Carmen Sanmartín"},{"name":"Helen E McNeil"},{"name":"Jessica M A Blair"},{"name":"Enrique Domínguez-Álvarez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida spp"},{"word":"HSV-2"},{"word":"Salmonella Typhimurium"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"antibacterials"},{"word":"antifungals"},{"word":"antivirals"},{"word":"biofilm inhibitors"},{"word":"selenoanhydrides"},{"word":"selenoesters"}]},"article303":{"pmid":"31770821","title":"Role of LuxR-type regulators in fish pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"LuxR-type transcriptional factors are essential in many bacterial physiological processes.

Our phenotypic assays revealed that (i) social trait expression profiles varied dramatically; (ii) correlations between traits were frequent, exclusively positive and sometimes habitat-specific; and (iii) heterogeneous (specialised) trait repertoires were rarer than homogeneous (unspecialised) repertoires.

FTIR spectroscopic data testified Zn complex formation and pointed out the absence of water molecule like that of zinc motif containing proteins. Hence, the complex may be termed as biomimetic.

In this context, supported lipid bilayers provide a suitable platform to investigate membrane proteins by a broad range of surface-sensitive techniques such as neutron reflectometry (NR), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and fluorescence microscopy. Nevertheless, the successful incorporation of membrane proteins in lipid bilayers with sufficiently high concentration and controlled orientation relative to the bilayer remains challenging. We propose the unconventional use of peptide discs made by phospholipids and amphipathic 18A peptides to mediate the formation of supported phospholipid bilayers with two different types of membrane proteins, CorA and tissue factor (TF). The membrane proteins are reconstituted in peptide discs, deposited on a solid surface, and the peptide molecules are then removed with extensive buffer washes. This leaves a lipid bilayer with a relatively high density of membrane proteins on the support surface. As a very important feature, the strategy allows membrane proteins with one large extramembrane domain to be oriented in the bilayer, thus mimicking the in vivo situation. The method is highly versatile, and we show its general applicability by characterizing with the above-mentioned surface-sensitive techniques two different membrane proteins, which were efficiently loaded in the supported bilayers with ∼0.6% mol/mol (protein/lipid) concentration corresponding to 35% v/v for CorA and 8% v/v for TF. Altogether, the peptide disc mediated formation of supported lipid bilayers with membrane proteins represents an attractive strategy for producing samples for structural and functional investigations of membrane proteins and for preparation of suitable platforms for drug testing or biosensor development.","authors":[{"name":"Alessandra Luchini"},{"name":"Frederik Grønbæk Tidemand"},{"name":"Nicolai Tidemand Johansen"},{"name":"Mario Campana"},{"name":"Javier Sotres"},{"name":"Michael Ploug"},{"name":"Marité Cárdenas"},{"name":"Lise Arleth"}],"keywords":[]},"article312":{"pmid":"31769530","title":"Intracellular survival and innate immune evasion of Burkholderia cepacia: Improved understanding of quorum sensing-controlled virulence factors, biofilm, and inhibitors.","date":"2020-02-06","abs":"Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are opportunistic pathogens implicated with nosocomial infections, and high rates of morbidity and mortality, especially in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).

F. keratoplasticum is able to adhere to an abiotic surface and form a dense biofilm in 72 h, with increased total biomass and matrix modulation with the presence of extracellular DNA, RNA, polysaccharides and proteins.

The best described CCR strategy, referred to here as classic CCR (cCCR), has been experimentally and theoretically studied using model organisms such as Escherichia coli. cCCR phenotypes are often used to generalize universal strategies for fitness, sometimes incorrectly. For instance, extremely competitive microorganisms, such as Pseudomonads, which arguably have broader global distributions than E. coli, have achieved their success using metabolic strategies that are nearly opposite of cCCR. These organisms utilize a CCR strategy termed 'reverse CCR' (rCCR), because the order of preferred substrates is nearly reverse that of cCCR. rCCR phenotypes prefer organic acids over glucose, may or may not select preferred substrates to optimize growth rates, and do not allocate intracellular resources in a manner that produces an overflow metabolism. cCCR and rCCR have traditionally been interpreted from the perspective of monocultures, even though most microorganisms live in consortia. Here, we review the basic tenets of the two CCR strategies and consider these phenotypes from the perspective of resource acquisition in consortia, a scenario that surely influenced the evolution of cCCR and rCCR.

Although considerable progress has been made in the understanding of its genome, the epigenome of C. difficile and its functional impact has not been systematically explored. Here, we perform a comprehensive DNA methylome analysis of C. difficile using 36 human isolates and observe a high level of epigenomic diversity. We discovered an orphan DNA methyltransferase with a well-defined specificity, the corresponding gene of which is highly conserved across our dataset and in all of the approximately 300 global C. difficile genomes examined. Inactivation of the methyltransferase gene negatively impacts sporulation, a key step in C. difficile disease transmission, and these results are consistently supported by multiomics data, genetic experiments and a mouse colonization model. Further experimental and transcriptomic analyses suggest that epigenetic regulation is associated with cell length, biofilm formation and host colonization. These findings provide a unique epigenetic dimension to characterize medically relevant biological processes in this important pathogen.

Here, we systematically investigate this question in the model organism Escherichia coli, varying cell density, cell length, and suspension confinement. The characteristics of the collective motion indicate that hydrodynamic interactions between swimmers made the primary contribution to its emergence. We observe that the chemotactic drift is moderately enhanced at intermediate cell densities, peaks, and is then strongly suppressed at higher densities. Numerical simulations reveal that this suppression occurs because the collective motion disturbs the choreography necessary for chemotactic sensing.

EET has been shown to contribute to virulence in some pathogenic organisms and is required for current generation in mediator-based fuel cells. In several species, components of the electron transport chain (ETC) have been implicated in electron shuttle reduction, raising the question of how shuttling-based metabolism is integrated with primary routes of metabolic electron flow. The clinically relevant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa can utilize carbon sources (i.e., electron donors) covering a broad range of reducing potentials and possesses a branched ETC that can be modulated to optimize respiratory efficiency. It also produces electron shuttles called phenazines that facilitate intracellular redox balancing, increasing the complexity of its metabolic potential. In this study, we investigated the reciprocal influence of respiratory metabolism and phenazine-associated physiology in P. aeruginosa PA14. We found that phenazine production affects respiratory activity and terminal oxidase gene expression and that carbon source identity influences the mechanisms enabling phenazine reduction. Furthermore, we found that growth in biofilms, a condition for which phenazine metabolism is critical to normal development and redox balancing, affects the composition of the P. aeruginosa phenazine pool.

The anti-adhesion efficacy of the demixed films were tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14). PS/PCL and PCL/PMMA demixed films showed a significant reduction in cell counts adhered on their surfaces compared to pure polymer control films, while no reduction was observed in the counts adhered on PS/PMMA demixed films.

As such, when examining the existing literature on the antibiofilm effects of nanoparticles, attention should be paid to the specific mechanisms of action at different stages of oral biofilm formation, as well as relevant influencing factors, in order to achieve an objective and comprehensive evaluation. This review is intended to detail the antibacterial mechanisms of nanoparticles during the four stages of the formation of oral biofilms: 1) acquired film formation; 2) bacterial adhesion; 3) early biofilm development; and 4) biofilm maturation. In addition, factors influencing the antibiofilm properties of nanoparticles are summarized from the aspects of nanoparticles themselves, biofilm models, and host factors. The limitations of current research and possible trends for future research are also discussed. In summary, nanoparticles are a promising antioral biofilm strategy. It is hoped that this review can serve as a reference and inspire ideas for further research on the application of nanoparticles for effectively targeting and treating oral biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Chen Hu"},{"name":"Lin-Lin Wang"},{"name":"Yu-Qing Lin"},{"name":"Hui-Min Liang"},{"name":"Shan-Yu Zhou"},{"name":"Fen Zheng"},{"name":"Xiao-Li Feng"},{"name":"Yong-Yu Rui"},{"name":"Long-Quan Shao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial biomaterials"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"oral biofilms"}]},"article344":{"pmid":"31763773","title":"The influence of nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide on the initial adhesion of Streptococcus mitis and mutans.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"The use of nanoscale surface modifications offers a possibility to regulate the bacterial adherence behavior.

This approach interferes with the early steps of natural biofilm formation affecting how the community is finally developed. It is based on a multilayer artificial biofilm, composed of electrostatically modified bacterial cells, producing antimicrobial compounds, extracellular antimicrobial polyelectrolyte matrix, and a water-proof rubber elastomer barrier. The artificial biofilm is constructed layer-by-layer (LBL) by manipulating the electrostatic interactions between microbial cells and material surfaces. Field testing on standard steel coupons exposed in the sea for more than 30 days followed by laboratory analyses using molecular-biology tools demonstrate that the preapplied artificial biofilm affects the phylogenetic structure of the developing natural biofilm, reducing phylogenetic diversity and excluding MIC-related bacteria.

Simultaneously acquiring chemical and structural information within the biofilm matrix is vital for the cognition and regulation of biofilms, yet it remains a great challenge due to the sample complexity and the limited approaches. In this study, confocal Raman microscopy and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) analysis were combined to investigate spatiotemporal organization of Escherichia coli biofilms during development at molecular-level detail. The alternating non-negative least-squares (ANLS) approach was incorporated with the sequential coordinate-wise descent (SCD) algorithm to realize the NMF analysis for the large-scale hyperspectral data set. As a result, three components, including bacteria, protein, and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), were successfully resolved from the spectra of E. coli biofilm. Furthermore, the structural changes of biofilms could be visualized and quantified by their abundances derived from the NMF analysis, which might be related to the nutrient and oxygen gradient and physiological functions. This methodology provides a comprehensive understanding of the chemical constituents and their spatiotemporal distribution within the biofilm matrix. Furthermore, it also shows great potential for the analysis of unknown and complex biological samples with 3D Raman mapping.","authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Yang Liu"},{"name":"Shuxia Guo"},{"name":"Anuradha Ramoji"},{"name":"Thomas Bocklitz"},{"name":"Petra Rösch"},{"name":"Jürgen Popp"},{"name":"Han-Qing Yu"}],"keywords":[]},"article351":{"pmid":"31762055","title":"Titanium particles and ions favor dysbiosis in oral biofilms.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"To evaluate the effect of titanium (Ti) particles and ions on oral biofilm growth and composition.","authors":[{"name":"João G S Souza"},{"name":"Bárbara E Costa Oliveira"},{"name":"Martinna Bertolini"},{"name":"Carolina Veloso Lima"},{"name":"Belén Retamal-Valdes"},{"name":"Marcelo de Faveri"},{"name":"Magda Feres"},{"name":"Valentim A R Barão"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"ions"},{"word":"particle"},{"word":"titanium"}]},"article352":{"pmid":"31761480","title":"In vitro time-kill kinetics of dalbavancin against Staphylococcus spp. biofilms over prolonged exposure times.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are leading pathogens of biofilm-related infections and represent the most common cause of osteomyelitis and biomedical implants infections.

At 18 h, the appearance of several r-proteins and glycolytic adhesive moonlighters, possibly via an autolysin (AtlA)-mediated release, was demonstrated in all materials, whereas classical surface adhesins, resistance- and virulence-associated proteins displayed greater variation in their abundances depending on the used material. Hydroxyapatite-associated biofilms were more susceptible to antibiotics than biofilms formed on titanium, but no clear correlation between the tolerance and biofilm age was observed. Thus, other factors, possibly the adhesive moonlighters, could have contributed to the observed chemotolerant phenotype. In addition, a protein-dependent matrix network was observed to be already well-established at the 18 h time point.

Although debridement and long-term administration of antibiotics are the gold standard for osteomyelitis treatment, the increase in prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains limits the ability of clinicians to effectively treat infection. Bacteriophages (phages), viruses that in a lytic state can effectively kill bacteria, have gained recent attention for their high specificity, abundance in nature, and minimal risk of host toxicity. Previously, we have shown that CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing techniques could be utilized to expand temperate bacteriophage host range and enhance bactericidal activity through modification of the tail fiber protein. In a dermal infection study, these CRISPR-Cas9 phages reduced bacterial load relative to unmodified phage. Thus we hypothesized this temperate bacteriophage, equipped with the CRISPR-Cas9 bactericidal machinery, would be effective at mitigating infection from a biofilm forming S. aureus strain in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, qualitative fluorescent imaging demonstrated superiority of phage to conventional vancomycin and fosfomycin antibiotics against S. aureus biofilm. Quantitative antibiofilm effects increased over time, at least partially, for all fosfomycin, phage, and fosfomycin-phage (dual) therapeutics delivered via alginate hydrogel. We developed an in vivo rat model of osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection that was reproducible and challenging and enabled longitudinal monitoring of infection progression. Using this model, phage (with and without fosfomycin) delivered via alginate hydrogel were successful in reducing soft tissue infection but not bone infection, based on bacteriological, histological, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Notably, the efficacy of phage at mitigating soft tissue infection was equal to that of high dose fosfomycin. Future research may utilize this model as a platform for evaluation of therapeutic type and dose, and alternate delivery vehicles for osteomyelitis mitigation.","authors":[{"name":"Leah H Cobb"},{"name":"JooYoun Park"},{"name":"Elizabeth A Swanson"},{"name":"Mary Catherine Beard"},{"name":"Emily M McCabe"},{"name":"Anna S Rourke"},{"name":"Keun Seok Seo"},{"name":"Alicia K Olivier"},{"name":"Lauren B Priddy"}],"keywords":[]},"article375":{"pmid":"31756182","title":"A simple way to improve a conventional A/O-MBR for high simultaneous carbon and nutrient removal from synthetic municipal wastewater.","date":"2020-03-23","abs":"In this study, two anoxic-oxic membrane bioreactor (A/O-MBR) systems, i.e. conventional and biofilm anoxic-oxic-membrane bioreactors (C-A/O-MBR and BF-A/O-MBR, respectively), were operated in parallel under conditions of complete sludge retention for the purposes of comparing system performance and microbial community composition.

When in contact with the model bacterium, Escherichia coli, the GO-coated membrane exhibited enhanced biofouling resistance compared to that of the GO-blended membrane, as evidenced by lower viable cells in static adsorption experiments, and lower water flux decline and higher flux recovery in dynamic biofouling experiments. Moreover, the development of biofilm on the GO-coated membrane was also inhibited to a greater extent than on the GO-blended membrane.

It is recognized to be associated with infectious bacterial communities called biofilms. Currently used conventional antibiotics alone often reveal themselves ineffective, since they do not specifically target the wound biofilm. Here, we report a new conceptual tool aimed at overcoming this drawback: an antibiofilm drug delivery system targeting the bacterial biofilm as a whole, by inhibiting its formation and/or disrupting it once it is formed. The system consists of a micro/nanostructured poly(butylene-succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA)-based asymmetric membrane (AM) with controlled porosity. By the incorporation of hydrophilic porogen agents, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), we were able to obtain AMs with high levels of porosity, exhibiting interconnections between pores. The PBSA-PEG membrane presented a dense upper layer with pores small enough to block bacteria penetration. Upon using such porogen agents, under dry and wet conditions, membrane's integrity and mechanical properties were maintained. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein, we demonstrated that protein loading and release from PBSA membranes were affected by the membrane structure (porosity) and the presence of residual porogen. Furthermore, the release curve profile consisted of a fast initial slope followed by a second slow phase approaching a plateau within 24 h. This can be highly beneficial for the promotion of wound healing. Cross-sectional confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images revealed a heterogeneous distribution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled BSA throughout the entire membrane. PBSA membranes were loaded with dispersin B (DB), a specific antibiofilm matrix enzyme. Studies using a Staphylococcus epidermidis model, indicate significant efficiency in both inhibiting or dispersing preformed biofilm (up to 80 % eradication). The asymmetric PBSA membrane prepared with the PVP porogen (PBSA-PVP) displayed highest antibiofilm activity. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity assays using HaCaT and reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) models revealed that unloaded and DB-loaded PBSA-PVP membranes had excellent biocompatibility suitable for wound dressing applications.","authors":[{"name":"Naila Bou Haidar"},{"name":"Stéphane Marais"},{"name":"Emmanuelle Dé"},{"name":"Annick Schaumann"},{"name":"Magalie Barreau"},{"name":"Marc G J Feuilloley"},{"name":"Anthony C Duncan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biocompatibility"},{"word":"Biofilm inhibition or dispersion"},{"word":"Biofilm-targeted therapies"},{"word":"Chronic wound dressings"},{"word":"Polymeric asymmetric membranes"},{"word":"Protein adsorption"}]},"article386":{"pmid":"31752998","title":"Compositional homogeneity in the pathobiome of a new, slow-spreading coral disease.","date":"2020-02-24","abs":"Coral reefs face unprecedented declines in diversity and cover, a development largely attributed to climate change-induced bleaching and subsequent disease outbreaks.

The ESKAPEE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacterbaumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli), in particular, have proven to be especially challenging to treat, due to their intrinsic and acquired ability to rapidly develop resistance mechanisms in response to environmental threats. The development of biofilm has been characterised as an essential contributing factor towards antimicrobial-resistance and tolerance. Several studies have implicated the involvement of efflux pumps in antibiotic resistance, both directly, via drug extrusion and indirectly, through the formation of biofilm. As a result, the underlying mechanism of these pumps has attracted considerable interest due to the potential of targeting these protein structures and developing novel adjunct therapies. Subsequent investigations have revealed the ability of efflux pump-inhibitors (EPIs) to block drug-extrusion and disrupt biofilm formation, thereby, potentiating antibiotics and reversing resistance of pathogen towards them. This review will discuss the potential of EPIs as a possible solution to antimicrobial resistance, examining different challenges to the design of these compounds, with an emphasis on Gram-negative ESKAPEE pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Akif Reza"},{"name":"J Mark Sutton"},{"name":"Khondaker Miraz Rahman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"ESKAPEE pathogens"},{"word":"Gram-negative bacteria"},{"word":"antibiotic potentiation"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"efflux pump inhibitors"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"31752079","title":"The Analogs of Temporin-GHa Exhibit a Broader Spectrum of Antimicrobial Activity and a Stronger Antibiofilm Potential against Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"The abuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, which is becoming a serious worldwide problem people have to face.

In order to improve its therapeutic potential, we used a template-based and a database-assisted design to obtain three derived peptides by replacing the histidine at both ends of GHa with lysine, which exhibited faster and stronger bactericidal activity and a broader spectrum than the parent peptide. GHaK and GHa4K targeted to the bacterial membrane to exert their antibacterial activities at a faster membrane damage rate. The derived peptides inhibited the initial adhesion and the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, and eradicated the mature biofilms, which indicated that the derived peptides effectively penetrated the biofilm and killed bacteria. The therapeutic index (TI) and cell selectivity index (CSI) of the derived peptides increased significantly, which means a broader therapeutic window of the derived peptides. The derived peptides with improved activity and cell selectivity have the potential to be the promising candidates for the treatment of S. aureus infections.

Their fundamental mismatch in structural and thermodynamic properties has imposed a significant challenge on the effective coupling at the biotic/abiotic interface, which is central to the design and development of bioelectronic devices and their translation toward various engineering applications. Using electrochemically active bacteria, such as G. sulfurreducens, as a model system, here we report a bottom-up, biosynthetic approach to synergize the electron transport and significantly enhance the coupling at the heterogeneous junction. In particular, graphene oxide was exploited as the respiratory electron acceptors, which can be directly reduced by G. sulfurreducens through extracellular electron transfer, closely coupled with outer membrane cytochromes in electroactive conformation, and actively wire the redox centers to external electrical contacts. Through this strategy, the contact resistance at the biofilm/electrode interface can be effectively reduced by 90%. Furthermore, the cyclic voltammetry reveals that the electron transfer of the DL-1 biofilm transformed from a low-current (∼0.36 μA), rate-limited profile to a high-current (∼5 μA), diffusion-limited profile. These results suggested that the integration of rGO can minimize the charge transfer barriers at the biofilm/electrode interface. The more transparent contact at the DL-1/electrode interface also enables unambiguous characterization of the inherent electron transport kinetics across the electroactive biofilm independent of cell/electrode interactions. The current work represents a strategically new approach toward the seamless integration of biological and artificial electronics, which is expected to provide critical insights into the fundamentals of biological electron transport and open up new opportunities for applications in biosensing, biocomputing, and bioenergy conversion.","authors":[{"name":"Leo Huan-Hsuan Hsu"},{"name":"Yixin Zhang"},{"name":"Pu Deng"},{"name":"Xiaochuan Dai"},{"name":"Xiaocheng Jiang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Extracellular electron transfer"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"bioreduction"},{"word":"electron hopping"},{"word":"graphene oxide"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"31750644","title":"Processivity in Bacterial Glycosyltransferases.","date":"2020-01-22","abs":"Extracellular polysaccharides and glycoproteins of pathogenic bacteria assist in adherence, autoaggregation, biofilm formation, and host immune system evasion.
