The culture's performance was evaluated in experiments using either glucose or xylose, as single carbon sources, and compared with the substrate (glycerol) used in previous studies. The highest EPS production (13.23 g L(-1)) was obtained in the glucose fed assay, with a volumetric productivity of 3.38 g L(-1) day(-1). The use of xylose resulted in lower productivity (1.39 g L(-1) day(-1)). The synthesised polymers have the same main sugar monomers (fucose, glucose, galactose and glucuronic acid), but their relative proportion varied with the substrate used. The acyl groups' content and composition were also affected by the substrate used. The polymers produced from glycerol (EPS-s) and glucose (EPS-g) had identical shear-thinning behaviour and good emulsion-stabilising capacity and their films had similar mechanical and water vapour properties. However, the emulsions stabilised with EPS-g were less stable and destabilised within short periods of time or when subjected to heat and freezing/thawing procedures. On the other hand, the polymer produced from xylose had little emulsion-stabilising capacity and lower apparent viscosity than EPS-s and EPS-g, but its films were considerably more elastic.

A stable aerobic granulation of activated sludge was achieved with an anaerobic plug flow operation (PI) and a fast influent step followed by an anaerobic mixing phase (PII). Two lab scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated to test the different operation modes. PI with plug flow and a reactor H/D (height/diameter) ratio of 9 achieved a biomass concentration of 20 g(TSS)/L and an effluent TSS concentration of 0.10 g(TSS)/L. PII with the mixed anaerobic phase directly after feeding and a reactor H/D ratio of 2 achieved a biomass concentration of 9 g(TSS)/L and an effluent quality of 0.05 g(TSS)/L. Furthermore, it is shown that the plug flow regime during anaerobic feeding together with the lower H/D ratio of 2 led to channeling effects, which resulted in lower storage of organic carbon and a general destabilization of the granulation process. Compared to the plug flow regime (PI), the anaerobic mixing (PII) provided lower substrate gradients within the biofilm.

Silicified virus-like nanoparticles, 40-200 nm in diameter, are common inside the microbial cells and the extracellular polymeric substances around the cells. These nanoparticles, which are formed of a core encased by a silica cortex, are morphologically akin to known viruses and directly comparable to silicified virus-like particles that were produced in biofilms cultured in the laboratory. The information obtained from examination of the natural and laboratory-produced samples suggests that viruses can be preserved by silicification, especially while they are still encased in their host cells.

The role of another major component of the V. vulnificus extracellular matrix, capsular polysaccharide (CPS), which contributes to colony opacity, has been characterized in biofilm formation. A CPS-deficient mutant, whose wbpP gene encoding UDP-GlcNAc C4-epimerase was knocked out, formed significantly more biofilm than wild type, due to increased hydrophobicity of the cell surface, adherence to abiotic surfaces and cell aggregation. To elucidate the direct effect of CPS on biofilm structure, extracted CPS and a CPS-degrading enzyme, α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, were added in biofilm assays, resulting in reduction and increment of biofilm sizes respectively. Therefore, it is suggested that CPS play a critical role in determining biofilm size by restricting continual growth of mature biofilms. Since CPS is required after maturation, CPS biosynthesis should be controlled in a cell density-dependent manner, e.g. by quorum-sensing (QS) regulation. Analysing transcription of the CPS gene cluster revealed that it was activated by SmcR, a QS master regulator, via binding to the upstream region of the cluster. Therefore, CPS was produced when biofilm cell density reached high enough to turn on QS regulation and limited biofilms to appropriate sizes.

Besides its capacity to grow in a wide range of environmental and stressful conditions, L. monocytogenes has the ability to adhere to and colonize surfaces. Morphotype variation to elongated cells forming rough colonies has been reported for different clinical and environmental isolates, including biofilms. This cell differentiation is mainly attributed to the reduced secretion of two SecA2-dependent cell-wall hydrolases, CwhA and MurA. SecA2 is a non-essential SecA paralogue forming an alternative translocase with the primary Sec translocon. Following investigation at temperatures relevant to its ecological niches, i.e. infection (37°C) and environmental (20°C) conditions, inactivation of this SecA2-only protein export pathway led, despite reduced adhesion, to the formation of filamentous biofilm with aerial structures. Compared to the wild type strain, inactivation of the SecA2 pathway promoted extensive cell aggregation and sedimentation. At ambient temperature, this effect was combined with the abrogation of cell motility resulting in elongated sedimented cells, which got knotted and entangled together in the course of filamentous-biofilm development. Such a cell differentiation provides a decisive advantage for listerial surface colonization under environmental condition. As further discussed, this morphotypic conversion has strong implication on listerial physiology and is also of potential significance for asymptomatic human/animal carriage.

Generally, the success of this bacterium as a pathogen is attributed to its ability to adhere to surfaces and remain there, under the protection of an extracellular matrix known as biofilm. To combat MRSA with regular doses of vancomycin, efforts are continuously underway to increase its effectiveness. A promising technique is to use combinational therapeutics. In vitro experiments showed that farnesol can be used as an adjuvant with conventional antibiotics. Farnesol is a natural sesquiterpenoid and quorum-sensing molecule. The biggest obstacle to using this concept is that farnesol is highly water insoluble. This compromises its bioavailability if it were to be used along with vancomycin at the site of infection when the treatment needs to be administered in vivo. Herein we designed an efficient therapeutic strategy for the simultaneous delivery of both antibiotic and adjuvant in order to treat MRSA infections. We demonstrate that sufficient quantities of both vancomycin and farnesol can be incorporated into sol-gel silica applied as thin films on an implant surface. The incorporation of the hydrophobic farnesol does not affect the stability of the thin films and neither does it affect the controlled release of vancomycin. The data demonstrate the potent adjuvant effect of farnesol on vancomycin in inhibiting MRSA infection. In vitro experiments show the complete inhibition (10(6) fold reduction in growth compared to control) of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) when the ratio of vancomycin to farnesol in the sol-gel silica films is optimized. The local delivery of antibiotics minimizes the need for systemic antibiotics. The incorporation of vancomycin and farnesol into thin sol-gel films represents a new treatment paradigm for the topical delivery of antibiotics with adjuvant.

Three indels correspond to expected Φ11, 12, 13 excisions, one indel is explained by a sequence assembly artifact, and the final indel (Δ63bp) in the spa-sarS intergenic region is common to only a sub-lineage of 8325-4 strains including SH1000. This deletion was found to significantly decrease (75%) steady state sarS but not spa transcript levels in post-exponential phase. The sub-lineage 8325-4 was also found to harbor 4 additional SNPs.

The IAA pre-treatment did not influence the nodulation ability of B. japonicum. The data provide a comprehensive overview of the potential transcriptional responses of the symbiotic bacterium when exposed to the ubiquitous hormone of its plant host.

In the oral cavity F. alocis colonizes polymicrobial biofilm communities; however, little is known regarding the nature of the interactions between F. alocis and other oral biofilm bacteria. Here we investigate the community interactions of two strains of F. alocis with Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, organisms with differing pathogenic potential in the oral cavity. In an in vitro community development model, S. gordonii was antagonistic to the accumulation of F. alocis into a dual species community. In contrast, F. nucleatum and the type strain of F. alocis formed a synergistic partnership. Accumulation of a low passage isolate of F. alocis was also enhanced by F. nucleatum. In three species communities of S. gordonii, F. nucleatum and F. alocis, the antagonistic effects of S. gordonii superseded the synergistic effects of F. nucleatum toward F. alocis. The interaction between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. alocis was strain specific and A. actinomycetemcomitans could either stimulate F. alocis accumulation or have no effect depending on the strain. P. gingivalis and F. alocis formed heterotypic communities with the amount of P. gingivalis greater than in the absence of F. alocis. However, while P. gingivalis benefited from the relationship, levels of F. alocis in the dual species community were lower compared to F. alocis alone. The inhibitory effect of P. gingivalis toward F. alocis was dependent, at least partially, on the presence of the Mfa1 fimbrial subunit. In addition, AI-2 production by P. gingivalis helped maintain levels of F. alocis. Collectively, these results show that the pattern of F. alocis colonization will be dictated by the spatial composition of microbial microenvironments, and that the organism may preferentially accumulate at sites rich in F. nucleatum.

In this study we have investigated the role of OMVs of the Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor A1552 strain in resistance to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). To assess this potential role, we grew V. cholerae with sub-lethal concentrations of Polymyxin B (PmB) or the AMP LL-37 and analyzed the OMVs produced and their effects on AMP resistance. Our results show that growing V. cholerae in the presence of AMPs modifies the protein content of the OMVs. In the presence of PmB, bacteria release OMVs that are larger in size and contain a biofilm-associated extracellular matrix protein (Bap1). We demonstrated that Bap1 binds to the OmpT porin on the OMVs through the LDV domain of OmpT. In addition, OMVs from cultures incubated in presence of PmB also provide better protection for V. cholerae against LL-37 compared to OMVs from V. cholerae cultures grown without AMPs or in presence of LL-37. Using a bap1 mutant we showed that cross-resistance between PmB and LL-37 involved the Bap1 protein, whereby Bap1 on OMVs traps LL-37 with no subsequent degradation of the AMP.

Bacterial macrocolony biofilms, which form intricate three-dimensional structures, such as large and often radially oriented ridges, concentric rings, and elaborate wrinkles, provide a unique opportunity to understand this interplay of nature and nurture in morphogenesis at the molecular level. Macrocolony morphology depends on self-produced extracellular matrix components. In Escherichia coli, these are stationary phase-induced amyloid curli fibers and cellulose. While the widely used domesticated E. coli K-12 laboratory strains are unable to generate cellulose, we could restore cellulose production and macrocolony morphology of E. coli K-12 strain W3110 by repairing a single chromosomal SNP in the bcs operon. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy, cellulose filaments, sheets and nanocomposites with curli fibers were localized in situ at cellular resolution within the physiologically two-layered macrocolony biofilms of this de-domesticated strain. As an architectural element, cellulose confers cohesion and elasticity, i.e., tissue-like properties that-together with the cell-encasing curli fiber network and geometrical constraints in a growing colony-explain the formation of long and high ridges and elaborate wrinkles of wild-type macrocolonies. In contrast, a biofilm matrix consisting of the curli fiber network only is brittle and breaks into a pattern of concentric dome-shaped rings separated by deep crevices. These studies now set the stage for clarifying how regulatory networks and in particular c-di-GMP signaling operate in the three-dimensional space of highly structured and tissue-like bacterial biofilms.

One such regulator, the NtrC-like response regulator SypG, controls biofilm formation and host colonization by V. fischeri via its impact on transcription of the symbiosis polysaccharide (syp) locus. SypG is predicted to activate syp transcription by binding to the syp enhancer (SE), a conserved sequence located upstream of four syp promoters. In this study, we performed an in-depth analysis of the sequences necessary for SypG to promote syp transcription and biofilm formation. We found that the SE sequence is necessary for SypG-mediated syp transcription, identified individual bases necessary for efficient activation, and determined that SypG is able to bind to syp promoter regions. We also identified SE sequences outside the syp locus and established that SypG recognizes these sequences as well. Finally, deletion of the SE sequence upstream of sypA led to defects in both biofilm formation and host colonization that could be restored by reintroducing the SE sequence into its native location in the chromosome. This work thus fills in critical gaps in knowledge of the Syp regulatory circuit by demonstrating a role for the SE sequence in SypG-dependent control of biofilm formation and host colonization and by identifying new putative regulon members. It may also provide useful insights into other bacteria, such as Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, that have syp-like loci and conserved SE sequences.

We also show that D-amino acids inhibited growth and the expression of biofilm matrix genes at concentrations that inhibit biofilm formation. Finally, we report that the strain routinely used to study biofilm formation has a mutation in the gene (dtd) encoding D-tyrosyl-tRNA deacylase, an enzyme that prevents the misincorporation of D-amino acids into protein in B. subtilis. When we repaired the dtd gene, B. subtilis became resistant to the biofilm-inhibitory effects of D-amino acids without losing the ability to incorporate at least one noncanonical D-amino acid, D-tryptophan, into the peptidoglycan peptide side chain. We conclude that the susceptibility of B. subtilis to the biofilm-inhibitory effects of D-amino acids is largely, if not entirely, due to their toxic effects on protein synthesis.","authors":[{"name":"Sara A Leiman"},{"name":"Janine M May"},{"name":"Matthew D Lebar"},{"name":"Daniel Kahne"},{"name":"Roberto Kolter"},{"name":"Richard Losick"}],"keywords":[]},"article27":{"pmid":"24097390","title":"Complementary mass spectrometric approaches and scanning electron microscopy to study the structural stability of polyurethane tunneled dialysis catheters after exposure to ethanol solutions.","date":"2013-10-07","abs":"Ethanol lock is an emerging therapeutic option for preventing and/or controlling catheter-associated infection.

Due to its relatively large genome and flexible metabolic capabilities, this organism exploits numerous environmental niches. It is an opportunistic pathogen that sets upon the human host when the normal immune defenses are disabled. Its deadliness is most apparent in cystic fibrosis patients, but it also is a major problem in burn wounds, chronic wounds, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, surface growth on implanted biomaterials, and within hospital surface and water supplies, where it poses a host of threats to vulnerable patients (Peleg and Hooper, N Engl J Med 362:1804-1813, 2010; Breathnach et al., J Hosp Infect 82:19-24, 2012). Once established in the patient, P. aeruginosa can be especially difficult to treat. The genome encodes a host of resistance genes, including multidrug efflux pumps (Poole, J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol 3:255-264, 2001) and enzymes conferring resistance to beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibotics (Vahdani et al., Annal Burns Fire Disast 25:78-81, 2012), making therapy against this gram-negative pathogen particularly challenging due to the lack of novel antimicrobial therapeutics (Lewis, Nature 485: 439-440, 2012). This challenge is compounded by the ability of P. aeruginosa to grow in a biofilm, which may enhance its ability to cause infections by protecting bacteria from host defenses and chemotherapy. Here, we review recent studies of P. aeruginosa biofilms with a focus on how this unique mode of growth contributes to its ability to cause recalcitrant infections.

Initially, we thought that M. hominis does not affect the fitness of UPEC, including the growth and production of signaling molecules, such as autoinducer-2 and indole. We found, however, that the presence of M. hominis significantly decreased the degree of biofilm formation by UPEC CFT073 (approximately a 60% reduction for 10(5) ccu/mL of M. hominis as compared with UPEC alone). We also found that it had a slight effect in inhibiting the attachment and cytotoxicity of UPEC CFT073. These findings are specific to these UPEC strains rather than to enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strains, found in normal intestinal flora. In addition, we performed whole-transcriptome profiling and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. This indicated that the PhoPQ system and the anti-termination protein (encoded by ybcQ) were involved in the reduction of biofilm formation by M. hominis (corroborated by qRT-PCR). Furthermore, our results indicate that M. hominis raises the degree of transcription of toxin genes, including hha and pasT. Hence, we suggest a possible role of M. hominis in affecting the formation of biofilms by UPEC in the urinary tract.

However, while the mode of action of antimicrobial peptides is relatively well described, resistance mechanisms potentially induced or selected by these peptides are still poorly understood. In this work, we studied the mechanisms of action and resistance potentially induced by ApoEdpL-W, a new antimicrobial peptide derived from human apolipoprotein E. Investigation of the genetic response of Escherichia coli upon exposure to sublethal concentrations of ApoEdpL-W revealed that this antimicrobial peptide triggers activation of RcsCDB, CpxAR, and σ(E) envelope stress pathways. This genetic response is not restricted to ApoEdpL-W, since several other antimicrobial peptides, including polymyxin B, melittin, LL-37, and modified S4 dermaseptin, also activate several E. coli envelope stress pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that induction of the CpxAR two-component system directly contributes to E. coli tolerance toward ApoEdpL-W, polymyxin B, and melittin. These results therefore show that E. coli senses and responds to different antimicrobial peptides by activation of the CpxAR pathway. While this study further extends the understanding of the array of peptide-induced stress signaling systems, it also provides insight into the contribution of Cpx envelope stress pathway to E. coli tolerance to antimicrobial peptides.

We applied five different RNA-extraction protocols to nine taxonomic diverse bacterial species. Chosen methods are based on various lysis and extraction principles. We found that the extraction efficiency of different methods depends strongly on the target organism. RNA isolation of gram-positive bacteria was characterized by low yield whilst from gram-negative species higher concentrations can be obtained.

However, the mechanism of inhibition and the physiological conditions under which nitrite impacts the performance of anammox bioreactors are still unknown. This study investigates the role of pre-exposing anammox bacteria to nitrite alone on their subsequent activity and metabolism after ammonium has been added. Batch experiments were carried out with anammox granular biofilm pre-exposed to nitrite over a range of concentrations and durations in the absence of ammonium. The effect of pre-exposure to nitrite alone compared to nitrite simultaneously fed with ammonium was evaluated by measuring the anammox activity and the accumulation of the intermediate, nitric oxide. The results show that the inhibitory effect was more dramatic when bacteria were pre-exposed to nitrite in absence of ammonium, as revealed by the lower activity and the higher accumulation of nitric oxide. The nitrite concentration causing 50% inhibition was 53 and 384 mg N L(-1) in the absence or the presence of ammonium, respectively. The nitrite inhibition was thus 7.2-fold more severe in the absence of ammonium. Biomass exposure to nitrite (25 mg N L(-1)), in absence of ammonium, led to accumulation of nitric oxide. On the other hand when the biomass was exposed to nitrite in presence of ammonium, accumulation of nitric oxide was only observed at much higher nitrite concentrations (500 mg N L(-1)). The inhibitory effect of nitrite in the absence of ammonium was very rapid. The rate of decay of the anammox activity was equivalent to the diffusion rate of nitrite up to 46% of activity loss. The results taken as a whole suggest that nitrite inhibition is more acute when anammox cells are not actively metabolizing. Accumulation of nitric oxide in the headspace most likely indicates disruption of the anammox biochemistry by nitrite inhibition, caused by an interruption of the hydrazine synthesis step.","authors":[{"name":"José M Carvajal-Arroyo"},{"name":"Daniel Puyol"},{"name":"Guangbin Li"},{"name":"Armando Lucero-Acuña"},{"name":"Reyes Sierra-Álvarez"},{"name":"Jim A Field"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anaerobic"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Mechanism"},{"word":"Nitric oxide"},{"word":"Nitrogen removal"},{"word":"Toxicity"}]},"article45":{"pmid":"24090835","title":"Block copolymer mixtures as antimicrobial hydrogels for biofilm eradication.","date":"2013-10-14","abs":"Current antimicrobial strategies have mostly been developed to manage infections due to planktonic cells. However, microbes in their nature state will tend to exist by attaching to and growing on living and inanimate surfaces that result in the formation of biofilms. Conventional therapies for treating biofilm-related infections are likely to be insufficient due to the lower susceptibility of microbes that are embedded in the biofilm matrix. In this study, we report the development of biodegradable hydrogels from vitamin E-functionalized polycarbonates for antimicrobial applications. These hydrogels were formed by incorporating positively-charged polycarbonates containing propyl and benzyl side chains with vitamin E moiety into physically cross-linked networks of ABA-type polycarbonate and poly(ethylene glycol) triblock copolymers. Investigations of the mechanical properties of the hydrogels showed that the G' values ranged from 1400 to 1600 Pa and the presence of cationic polycarbonate did not affect the stiffness of the hydrogels. Shear-thinning behavior was observed as the hydrogels displayed high viscosity at low shear rates that dramatically decreased as the shear rate increased. In vitro antimicrobial studies revealed that the more hydrophobic VE/BnCl(1:30)-loaded hydrogels generally exhibited better antimicrobial/antifungal effects compared to the VE/PrBr(1:30) counterpart as lower minimum biocidal concentrations (MBC) were observed in Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Candida albicans (fungus) (156.2, 312.5, 312.5 mg/L for VE/BnCl(1:30) and 312.5, 2500 and 625 mg/L for VE/PrBr(1:30) respectively). Similar trends were observed for the treatment of biofilms where VE/BnCl(1:30)-loaded hydrogels displayed better efficiency with regards to eradication of biomass and reduction of microbe viability of the biofilms. Furthermore, a high degree of synergistic antimicrobial effects was also observed through the co-delivery of antimicrobial polycarbonates with a conventionally-used antifungal agent, fluconazole. These hydrogels also displayed excellent compatibility with human dermal fibroblasts with cell viability >80% after treatment with hydrogels loaded with cationic polymers and/or fluconazole at minimum biocidal concentrations (MBC).","authors":[{"name":"Ashlynn L Z Lee"},{"name":"Victor W L Ng"},{"name":"Weixin Wang"},{"name":"James L Hedrick"},{"name":"Yi Yan Yang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Block copolymers"},{"word":"Hydrogel"},{"word":"Poly(ethylene glycol)"},{"word":"Polycarbonate"}]},"article46":{"pmid":"24090475","title":"Biological noise abatement: coordinating the responses of autonomous bacteria in a synthetic biofilm to a fluctuating environment using a stochastic bistable switch.","date":"2014-05-22","abs":"Noise is inherent to single cell behavior. Its origins can be traced to the stochasticity associated with a few copies of genes and low concentrations of protein and ligands. We have studied the mechanisms by which the response of noisy elements can be entrained for biological signal processing. To elicit predictable biological function, we have engineered a gene environment that incorporates a gene regulatory network with the stringently controlled microenvironment found in a synthetic biofilm. The regulatory network leverages the positive feedback found in quorum-sensing regulatory components of the lux operon, which is used to coordinate cellular responses to environmental fluctuations. Accumulation of the Lux receptor in cells, resulting from autoregulation, confers a rapid response and enhanced sensitivity to the quorum-sensing molecule that is retained after cell division as epigenetic memory. The memory of the system channels stochastic noise into a coordinated response among quorum-sensing signal receivers in a synthetic biofilm in which the noise diminishes with repeated exposure to noisy transmitters on the input of a signaling cascade integrated into the same biofilm. Thus, gene expression in the receivers, which are autonomous and do not communicate with each other, is synchronized to fluctuations in the environment.

Their dendritic structure reaches into the terrestrial landscape and accumulates water and sediment en route from abundant headwater streams to a single river mouth. The prevailing view over the last decades has been that biological diversity also accumulates downstream. Here, we show that this pattern does not hold for fluvial biofilms, which are the dominant mode of microbial life in streams and rivers and which fulfil critical ecosystem functions therein. Using 454 pyrosequencing on benthic biofilms from 114 streams, we found that microbial diversity decreased from headwaters downstream and especially at confluences. We suggest that the local environment and biotic interactions may modify the influence of metacommunity connectivity on local biofilm biodiversity throughout the network. In addition, there was a high degree of variability in species composition among headwater streams that could not be explained by geographical distance between catchments. This suggests that the dendritic nature of fluvial networks constrains the distributional patterns of microbial diversity similar to that of animals. Our observations highlight the contributions that headwaters make in the maintenance of microbial biodiversity in fluvial networks.

Using transposon mutagenesis screening, we found a symbiosis-deficient mutant that was able to colonize the host insect but failed to induce normal development of host's symbiotic organ. The disrupted gene was identified as purL involved in purine biosynthesis. In vitro growth impairment of the purL mutant and its growth dependency on adenine and adenosine confirmed the functional disruption of the purine synthesis gene. The purL mutant also showed defects in biofilm formation, and this defect was not rescued by supplementation of purine derivatives. When inoculated to host insects, the purL mutant was initially able to colonize the symbiotic organ but failed to attain a normal infection density. The low level of infection density of the purL mutant attenuated the development of the host's symbiotic organ at early instar stages and reduced the host's fitness throughout the nymphal stages. Another symbiont mutant-deficient in a purine biosynthesis gene, purM, showed phenotypes similar to those of the purL mutant both in vitro and in vivo, confirming that the purL phenotypes are due to disrupted purine biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that the purine biosynthesis genes of the Burkholderia symbiont are critical for the successful accommodation of symbiont within the host, thereby facilitating the development of the host's symbiotic organ and enhancing the host's fitness values.

Some biofilm inhibitors have been screened from natural products or modified from natural compounds. Ginger has been used as a medicinal herb to treat infectious diseases for thousands of years, which leads to the hypothesis that it may contain chemicals inhibiting biofilm formation. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated ginger's ability to inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 biofilm formation. A static biofilm assay demonstrated that biofilm development was reduced by 39-56% when ginger extract was added to the culture. In addition, various phenotypes were altered after ginger addition of PA14. Ginger extract decreased production of extracellular polymeric substances. This finding was confirmed by chemical analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, ginger extract formed noticeably less rugose colonies on agar plates containing Congo red and facilitated swarming motility on soft agar plates. The inhibition of biofilm formation and the altered phenotypes appear to be linked to a reduced level of a second messenger, bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate. Importantly, ginger extract inhibited biofilm formation in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Also, surface biofilm cells formed with ginger extract detached more easily with surfactant than did those without ginger extract. Taken together, these findings provide a foundation for the possible discovery of a broad spectrum biofilm inhibitor.

This unique physiologic adaptation limits penetration of antimicrobial molecules and innate immune effectors to the infectious focus, increasing the likelihood of treatment failure and progression to chronic infection. Investigation of mechanisms of biofilm formation and dispersal, as well as the physiologic adaptations to the biofilm lifestyle, is therefore critical to developing new therapies to combat MRSA infections. In this chapter, we describe two in vitro methods for the investigation of staphylococcal biofilm formation, a microtiter plate-based assay of biofilm formation under static conditions and a flow cell-based assay of biofilm formation under fluid shear. We also detail an in vivo murine model of catheter-associated biofilm formation that is amenable to imaging and microbiologic analyses.

An infection occurs when planktonic bacteria adhere to external fixator pins and subsequently produce a biofilm which protects the bacteria from host defences. The most commonly implicated organisms are Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Once an infection occurs, treatment is difficult. Systemic antibiotics have limited benefits and considerable side-effects. The only definitive management is removal of the pin. This review will consider the current and potential future strategies for reducing pin site infection. Techniques to prevent infection must prevent bacterial adhesion, allow good osteointegration and have a low toxicity. Current areas of interest reviewed are titanium-copper alloys, nanosilver coatings, nitric oxide coatings, chitosan coatings, chlorhexidine and iodine, hydroxyapatite and antibiotic coatings. At present there is no consensus on the prevention of pin site infection, and there is a paucity of randomized controlled trials on which to draw a conclusion. Whilst a number of these strategies have potential future use, many of the above strategies need further studies in animal models to ensure no cytotoxicity and prevention of osteointegration. Following this, well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials are required to give future ways to prevent external fixator pin site infections.

Here, we show for the first time that analysis of (13)C and (14)C of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) effectively characterises dissolved OM through a water treatment works. At the sites investigated: post-clarification, DOC becomes isotopically lighter, due to an increased proportion of relatively hydrophilic DOC. Filtration adds 'old' (14)C-DOC from abrasion of the filter media, whilst the use of activated carbon adds 'young' (14)C-DOC, most likely from the presence of biofilms. Overall, carbon isotopes provide clear evidence for the first time that new sources of organic carbon are added within the treatment processes, and that treated water is isotopically lighter and typically younger in (14)C-DOC age than untreated water. We anticipate our findings will precipitate real-time monitoring of treatment performance using stable carbon isotopes, with associated improvements in energy and carbon footprint (e.g. isotopic analysis used as triggers for filter washing and activated carbon regeneration) and public health benefits resulting from improved carbon removal.

Our results showed that TbdR1 was involved in hemin iron acquisition and the tbdR1 deletion significantly reduced biofilm formation and adhesion to and invasion of Vero cells. Animal experiments indicated that the median lethal dose of the CH3ΔtbdR1 mutant in ducklings was about 45-fold higher than that of the wild-type CH3 strain. Additional analysis indicated that bacterial loads in blood, liver, and brain tissues in CH3ΔtbdR1-infected ducklings were decreased significantly compared to those in wild-type CH3-infected ducklings.

By using Ca(2+)-binding photoprotein aequorin, we determined that the concentration of free intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]in) is 0.14±0.05μM.

Recently, the ability of a novel alginate oligomer (OligoG) to potentiate the effect of antibiotics against gram-negative, multi-drug-resistant bacteria and inhibit biofilm formation in vitro has been described. Interaction of OligoG with the cell surface of PA was characterized at the nanoscale using atomic force microscopy (AFM), zeta potential measurement (surface charge), and sizing measurements (dynamic light scattering). The ability of OligoG to modify motility was studied in motility assays. AFM demonstrated binding of OligoG to the bacterial cell surface, which was irreversible after exposure to hydrodynamic shear (5,500 × g). Zeta potential analysis (pH 5-9; 0.1-0.001 M NaCl) demonstrated that binding was associated with marked changes in the bacterial surface charge (-30.9 ± 0.8 to -47.0 ± 2.3 mV; 0.01 M NaCl [pH 5]; P < 0.001). Sizing analysis demonstrated that alteration of surface charge was associated with cell aggregation with a 2- to 3-fold increase in mean particle size at OligoG concentrations greater than 2% (914 ± 284 to 2599 ± 472 nm; 0.01 M NaCl [pH 5]; P < 0.001). These changes were associated with marked dose-dependent inhibition in bacterial swarming motility in PA and Burkholderia spp. The ability of OligoG to bind to a bacterial surface, modulate surface charge, induce microbial aggregation, and inhibit motility represents important direct mechanisms by which antibiotic potentiation and biofilm disruption is affected. These results highlight the value of combining multiple nanoscale technologies to further our understanding of the mechanisms of action of novel antibacterial therapies.

After 7 d, the secreted mucilage became entangled, forming adhesive strands that crisscrossed the substratum surface. In the initial secreted mucilage atomic force microscopy identified a high proportion of adhesive molecules without regular retraction curves and some modular-like adhesive molecules, in the 7 d old biofilm, the adhesive molecules were longer with fewer adhesive events but greater adhesive strength.

Unexpectedly, while diatoms strongly dominated microphytobenthic communities in terms of biomass, HPLC results hinted that rotifers selectively ingested benthic filamentous cyanobacteria. In doing so, rotifers could daily remove a substantial fraction (up to 28%) of this cyanobacterial biomass. The possibility that the rotifers hosted symbiotic myxoxanthophyll-containing cyanobacteria was examined by localisation of chlorophyll fluorescence within rotifers using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).

Here, a high throughput phenotypic platform was utilized to screen for the inhibitory activity of 500 flavonoids, including natural and synthetic derivatives, against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Since discrepancies among results from earlier antibacterial studies on flavonoids had been noted, the current study aimed to minimize sources of variations.

Further, exclusion criteria combining bioactivity and selectivity identified two synthetic flavans as the most promising. The body of data reported here serves three main purposes.

The antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and its fragments KS-30, KR-20 and KR-12 against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii were evaluated. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of LL-37 against MDR A. baumannii isolates ranged from 16 to 32 μg/mL. The MIC of KS-30 fragment varied from 8.0 to 16 μg/mL and the KR-20 fragment MIC ranged from 16 to 64 μg/mL. LL-37 and KS-30 fragment exhibited 100% bactericidal activity against five A. baumannii strains, including four MDR clinical isolates, within 30 min at concentrations of 0.25-1 μg/mL. By 0.5h, the fragments KR-20 and KR-12 eliminated all tested strains at 8 and 64 μg/mL respectively. LL-37 and its fragments displayed anti-adherence activities between 32-128 μg/mL. A minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) biofilm assay demonstrated that LL-37 inhibited and dispersed A. baumannii biofilms at 32 μg/mL respectively. Truncated fragments of LL-37 inhibited biofilms at concentrations of 64-128 μg/mL. KS-30, the truncated variant of LL-37, effectively dispersed biofilms at 64 μg/mL. At 24h, no detectable toxicity was observed at the efficacious doses when cytotoxicity assays were performed. Thus, LL-37, KS-30 and KR-20 exhibit significant antimicrobial activity against MDR A. baumannii. The prevention of biofilm formation in vitro by LL-37, KS-30 and KR-20 adds significance to their efficacy. These peptides can be potential therapeutics against MDR A. baumannii infections.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaorong Feng"},{"name":"Karthik Sambanthamoorthy"},{"name":"Thomas Palys"},{"name":"Chrysanthi Paranavitana"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acinetobacter baumannii"},{"word":"Anti-infective"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cathelicidin"}]},"article89":{"pmid":"24071026","title":"Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.","date":"2013-12-02","abs":"Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285(®) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R(®) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.

Parent compounds, transformation products and other non-targeted compounds yield mixtures whose composition can only be partially identified by monitoring, while a substantial proportion remains unknown. In this context, risk assessment based on the application of additive ecotoxicity models, such as concentration addition (CA), is rendered somewhat misleading. Here, we show that ecotoxicity risk information can be better understood upon consideration of the probabilistic distribution of risk among the different compounds. Toxic units of the compounds identified in a sample fit a lognormal probability distribution. The parameters characterizing this distribution (mean and standard deviation) provide information which can be tentatively interpreted as a measure of the toxic load and its apportionment among the constituents in the mixture (here interpreted as mixture complexity). Furthermore, they provide information for compound prioritization tailored to each site and enable prediction of some of the functional and structural biological variables associated with the receiving ecosystem. The proposed approach was tested in the Llobregat River basin (NE Spain) using exposure and toxicity data (algae and Daphnia) corresponding to 29 pharmaceuticals and 22 pesticides, and 5 structural and functional biological descriptors related to benthic macroinvertebrates (diversity, biomass) and biofilm metrics (diatom quality, chlorophyll-a content and photosynthetic capacity). Aggregated toxic units based on Daphnia and algae bioassays provided a good indication of the pollution pattern of the Llobregat River basin. Relative contribution of pesticides and pharmaceuticals to total toxic load was variable and highly site dependent, the latter group tending to increase its contribution in urban areas. Contaminated sites' toxic load was typically dominated by fewer compounds as compared to cleaner sites where more compounds contribute.

It was found that although discharge oxygen, nitrogen and argon all demonstrated excellent antibacterial and antibiofilm activity, gases with distinct chemical/physical properties underwent different mechanisms of action. Discharge oxygen- and nitrogen-mediated decontamination was associated with strong etching effects, which can cause live bacteria to relocate thus spreading contamination. On the contrary, although discharge argon at low powers maintained excellent antibacterial ability, it had negligible etching effects. Based on these results, an effective decontamination approach using discharge argon was established in which bacteria and biofilms were killed in situ and then removed from the contaminated biomaterials. This novel procedure is applicable for a wide range of biomaterials and biomedical devices in an in vivo and clinical setting.

These processes will lead to deterioration of the water quality during distribution. In extreme conditions, pathogens and opportunistic pathogens may proliferate and pose a health risk to consumers. It is, therefore, necessary to understand the bacteriology of DWDSs to develop effective strategies that can ensure the water quality at consumers' taps. The bacteriology of DWDSs, both the quantitative growth and the qualitative bacterial community, has attracted considerable research attention. However, the researchers have focused mainly on the pipe wall biofilm. In this review, DWDS bacteriology has been reviewed multidimensionally, including both the bacterial quantification and identification. For the first time, the available literature was reviewed with an emphasis on the subdivision of DWDS into four phases: bulk water, suspended solids, loose deposits, and pipe wall biofilm. Special concentration has been given to potential contribution of particulate matter: suspended particles and loose deposits. Two highlighted questions were reviewed and discussed: (1) where does most of the growth occur? And (2) what is the contribution of particle-associated bacteria to DWDS bacteriology and ecology?

The effect of photon energy was examined using both tunable synchrotron and laser sources of VUV radiation. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to the MS data to differentiate species in Escherichia coli-Saccharomyces cerevisiae coculture biofilms. PCA of LDPI-MS also differentiated individual E. coli strains in a biofilm comprised of two interacting gene deletion strains, even though these strains differed from the wild type K-12 strain by no more than four gene deletions each out of approximately 2000 genes. PCA treatment of 7.87 eV LDPI-MS data separated the E. coli strains into three distinct groups, two pure groups, and a mixed region. Furthermore, the pure regions of the E. coli cocultures showed greater variance by PCA at 7.87 eV photon energies compared to 10.5 eV radiation. This is consistent with the expectation that the 7.87 eV photoionization selects a subset of low ionization energy analytes while 10.5 eV is more inclusive, detecting a wider range of analytes. These two VUV photon energies therefore give different spreads via PCA and their respective use in LDPI-MS constitute an additional experimental parameter to differentiate strains and species.

In this study, willows were planted in contaminated and non-contaminated soils in a greenhouse, and the active microbial communities and the expression of functional genes in the rhizosphere and bulk soil were compared. Ion Torrent sequencing of 16S rRNA and Illumina sequencing of mRNA were performed. Genes related to carbon and amino-acid uptake and utilization were upregulated in the willow rhizosphere, providing indirect evidence of the compositional content of the root exudates. Related to this increased nutrient input, several microbial taxa showed a significant increase in activity in the rhizosphere. The extent of the rhizosphere stimulation varied markedly with soil contamination levels. The combined selective pressure of contaminants and rhizosphere resulted in higher expression of genes related to competition (antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation) in the contaminated rhizosphere. Genes related to hydrocarbon degradation were generally more expressed in contaminated soils, but the exact complement of genes induced was different for bulk and rhizosphere soils. Together, these results provide an unprecedented view of microbial gene expression in the plant rhizosphere during phytoremediation.

A key player in the development of a bacterial biofilm is the second messenger c-di-GMP, whose intracellular levels are modulated by the opposite activity of diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases. Given the huge impact of bacterial biofilms on human health, understanding the molecular details of c-di-GMP metabolism represents a critical step in the development of novel therapeutic approaches against biofilms. In this study, we present a detailed biochemical characterization of two c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases of the HD-GYP subtype from the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, namely PA4781 and PA4108. Upstream of the catalytic HD-GYP domain, PA4781 contains a REC domain typical of two-component systems, while PA4108 contains an uncharacterized domain of unknown function. Our findings shed light on the activity and catalytic mechanism of these phosphodiesterases. We show that both enzymes hydrolyse c-di-GMP in a two-step reaction via the linear intermediate pGpG and that they produce GMP in vitro at a surprisingly low rate. In addition, our data indicate that the non-phosphorylated REC domain of PA4781 prevents accessibility of c-di-GMP to the active site. Both PA4108 and phosphorylated PA4781 are also capable to use pGpG as an alternative substrate and to hydrolyse it into GMP; the affinity of PA4781 for pGpG is one order of magnitude higher than that for c-di-GMP. These results suggest that these enzymes may not work (primarily) as genuine phosphodiesterases. Moreover, the unexpected affinity of PA4781 for pGpG may indicate that pGpG could also act as a signal molecule in its own right, thus further widening the c-di-GMP-related signalling scenario.

The biofilms were developed on glass plates (0.48 m(2)) previously coated with a fine layer of stearic acid and supported by a PVC tube that was submersed in the river 20 cm above the river bottom. After a certain period of incubation time, the biofilm growth was scraped from the plates and analyzed for the following fecal steroids: coprostanol (5β-cholestan-3β-ol), epicoprostanol (5β-cholestan-3α-ol), cholesterol (5,6-cholesten-3β-ol), cholestanol (5α-cholestan-3β-ol), stigmastanol (24β-ethyl-5α-cholestan-3β-ol) and coprostanone (5β-cholestan-3-one). Six samples were collected between March 2012 and June 2012. All analyzed compounds were detected, and in general, cholesterol was present in high amounts (23 160-41.9 ng g(-1) dry biofilm). Variation among campaigns was observed in the distribution of sterols, with cholestanol showing the least variation among the samples. Sterol ratios that are commonly used for evaluating sewage contamination were calculated; these ratios indicated some periods of potential sewage influence. However, these sterol ratios are intended to be applied primarily for sediments and not for biological compartments; thus, the results must be carefully interpreted.

The results indicated: during the stage 1 (before day 1), the microbial communities in the activated sludge (AS), cake sludge (CS) and biofilm (BF) were similar to each other, and the adsorption of microbes and the metabolic products was the main factor that led to TMP increase; during the stage 2 (between day 1 and day 7), the cake layer begun to form and the TMP continued to rise gradually at a reduced rate compared to stage 1, at this point a characteristic microbial community colonized the CS with microorganisms such as Saprospiraceae and Comamonadaceae thriving on the membrane surface (BF) probably due to greater nutrient availability, and the predominance of these species in the microbial population led to the accumulation of biofouling metabolic products in the CS, which resulted in membrane fouling and the associated rise in TMP; during the final stage (after day 7), the biofilm had matured, and the activity of anaerobes stimulated cake compaction. The statistical analysis showed a correlation between the TMP changing rate and the carbonhydrates of soluble microbial products (SMPc) content in the CS. When the SMPc concentration rose slowly there was a low level of biofouling. However, when the SMPc accumulating rate was greater, it resulted in the more severe biofouling associated with the TMP jump. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient for the TMP increase and protein concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSp) in the CS was highly significant. The cluster analysis suggested that the AS microbial community remained stable during the three TMP change stages, while the CS and BF community were changed accompanied with the TMP change. The interaction between the microbial communities and the metabolic products lead to the significant correlation between them. The EPSp in conjunction with the SMPc were the main factors that accelerate the membrane fouling. The rapid rise of SMPc triggered a sudden increase in the TMP, while the accumulation of EPSp caused the sustained rise in TMP.

This study investigates the effects of Shewanella oneidensis (an HOB and IRB model organism) on the corrosion rate by looking at carbon steel dissolution in the presence of H2 as the sole electron donor. Bacterial effect is evaluated by means of geochemical and electrochemical techniques. Both showed that the corrosion rate is enhanced by a factor of 2-3 in the presence of bacteria. The geochemical experiments indicated that the composition and crystallinity of the solid corrosion products (magnetite and vivianite) are modified by bacteria. Moreover, the electrochemical experiments evidenced that the bacterial activity can be stimulated when H2 is generated in a small confinement volume. In this case, a higher corrosion rate and mineralization (vivianite) on the carbon steel surface were observed. The results suggest that the mechanism likely to influence the corrosion rate is the bioreduction of Fe(III) from magnetite coupled to the H2 oxidation.

Twenty-four and 48 h mixed-biofilms were formed using the isolated phenotypes of phage-resistant P. aeruginosa and these were compared with similar experiments using other P. aeruginosa strains with a defined lipopolysaccharide (LPS) deficiency based on chromosomal knockout of specific LPS biosynthetic genes. Overall, the results showed that the variants of phage-resistant P. aeruginosa and LPS mutants were both less effective in inhibiting the growth of C. albicans in mixed-biofilms compared to the wild-type strains of P. aeruginosa. Conversely, the proliferation of P. aeruginosa was not influenced by the presence of C. albicans. In conclusion, the ability of strains of P. aeruginosa to inhibit the formation of a biofilm of C. albicans appears to be correlated with the LPS chain lengths of phenotypes of P. aeruginosa, suggesting that LPS has a suppressive effect on the growth of C. albicans.

As currently available antifungals have minimal activity against biofilms, new drugs to treat these recalcitrant infections are urgently needed. Recent investigations have begun to shed light on the mechanisms behind the profound resistance associated with the biofilm mode of growth. This resistance appears to be multifactorial, involving both mechanisms similar to conventional, planktonic antifungal resistance, such as increased efflux pump activity, as well as mechanisms specific to the biofilm lifestyle. A unique biofilm property is the production of an extracellular matrix. Two components of this material, β-glucan and extracellular DNA, promote biofilm resistance to multiple antifungals. Biofilm formation also engages several stress response pathways that impair the activity of azole drugs. Resistance within a biofilm is often heterogeneous, with the development of a subpopulation of resistant persister cells. In this article we review the molecular mechanisms underlying Candida biofilm antifungal resistance and their relative contributions during various growth phases.

The research has shown that mercury present in the environment becomes associated with styrofoam debris. The median for mercury concentrations in virgin styrofoam samples (0.23 ng g(-1) dry weight (d.w.)) and in beach sand samples (0.69 ng g(-1) d.w.) was an order of magnitude lower than in the styrofoam debris (5.20 ng g(-1) d.w.). The highest mercury content observed in styrofoam debris (3,863 ng g(-1) d.w.) exceeded the standards for bottom sediment and soil. The binding of mercury to styrofoam debris takes place in water, and presumably also through contact with the ground. A significant role in this process was played by biotic factors, such as the presence of biofilm and abiotic ones, such as solar radiation and the transformations of mercury forms related to it. As a result, mercury content in styrofoam debris underwent seasonal changes, peaking in summertime. Furthermore, the regional changes of mercury content in the studied debris seem to reflect the pollution levels of the environment.","authors":[{"name":"Bożena Graca"},{"name":"Magdalena Bełdowska"},{"name":"Patrycja Wrzesień"},{"name":"Aleksandra Zgrundo"}],"keywords":[]},"article123":{"pmid":"24057941","title":"Real-time measurement of quorum-sensing signal autoinducer 3OC6HSL by a FRET-based nanosensor.","date":"2014-04-22","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) is involved in many important biological functions such as luminescence, antibiotic production, and biofilm formation.

Force curves recorded between single bacterial and fungal germ tubes showed large adhesion forces (~5 nN) with extended rupture lengths (up to 500 nm).

The M6 microbial biofilm community structure was similar to that of M7, dissimilar to that of M9. Dissolved oxygen and nitrogen was probably major factors to influence the microbial biofilm communities. Nitrospiraes in M6 biofilm and Firmicutes in M8 biofilm were crucial to remove ammonia nitrogen and nitrate in raw water. How to enrich functional microbes in biofilm to pretreat raw water is an important area of future research.

Biocidal TBT alternatives, such as diuron and Irgarol 1051®, have proved to be environmentally damaging to marine organisms. The issue regarding the use of biocides is that concerning the half-life of the compounds which allow a perpetuation of the toxic effects into the marine food chain, and initiate changes in the early stages of the organisms' life-cycle. In addition, the break-down of biocides can result in metabolites with greater toxicity and longevity than the parent compound. Functionalized coatings have been designed to repel the settlement and permanent attachment of fouling organisms via modification of either or both surface topography and surface chemistry, or by interfering with the natural mechanisms via which fouling organisms settle upon and adhere to surfaces. A large number of technologies are being developed towards producing new coatings that will be able to resist biofouling over a period of years and thus truly replace biocides as antifouling systems. In addition urgent research is directed towards the exploitation of mechanisms used by living organisms designed to repel the settlement of fouling organisms. These biomimetic strategies include the production of antifouling enzymes and novel surface topography that are incompatible with permanent attachment, for example, by mimicking the microstructure of shark skin. Other research seeks to exploit chemical signals and antimicrobial agents produced by diverse living organisms in the environment to prevent settlement and growth of fouling organisms on vulnerable surfaces. Novel polymer-based technologies may prevent fouling by means of unfavourable surface chemical and physical properties or by concentrating antifouling compounds around surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Jeanette E Gittens"},{"name":"Thomas J Smith"},{"name":"Rami Suleiman"},{"name":"Robert Akid"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Coatings"},{"word":"Environmentally-friendly antifouling"},{"word":"Marine"},{"word":"Non-biocidal"},{"word":"Non-polluting technology"},{"word":"Steel"}]},"article136":{"pmid":"24051005","title":"You get what you select for: better swarming through more flagella.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"In a recent Cell Reports paper by van Ditmarsch et al., the authors aim to conduct experimental evolution in Pseudomonas aeruginosa but instead conduct classical forward genetics and select for mutations in a single gene that improves swarming motility at the expense of biofilm formation.

The short palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone (SPLUNC)1 protein is secreted in respiratory tracts and is a member of the bacterial/permeability increasing (BPI) fold-containing protein family, which shares structural similarities with BPI-like proteins. On the basis of its homology with BPIs and restricted expression of SPLUNC1 in serous cells of submucosal glands and surface epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, SPLUNC1 is thought to possess antimicrobial activity in host defense. SPLUNC1 is also reported to have surfactant properties, which may contribute to anti-biofilm defenses. The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo functions of SPLUNC1 following Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and to elucidate the underlying mechanism by using a knockout (KO) mouse model with a genetic ablation of Splunc1. Splunc1 KO mice showed accelerated mortality and increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection with significantly decreased survival rates, increased bacterial burdens, exaggerated tissue injuries, and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels as compared with those of their wild-type littermates. Increased neutrophil infiltration in Splunc1 KO mice was accompanied by elevated chemokine levels, including Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Ccl20. Furthermore, the expression of several epithelial secretory proteins and antimicrobial molecules was considerably suppressed in the lungs of Splunc1 KO mice. The deficiency of Splunc1 in mouse airway epithelium also results in increased biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Taken together, our results support that the ablation of Splunc1 in mouse airways affects the mucociliary clearance, resulting in decreased innate immune response during Pseudomonas-induced respiratory infection.

This research analyzes the impact of the triazole fungicide tebuconazole (TBZ) on natural biofilm and plankton microbial communities from sites presenting different degrees of agricultural contamination. Biofilm and plankton communities from less-polluted (LP) and polluted (P) sites were exposed to nominal concentrations of 0 (control), 2 and 20 μg TBZ L(-1) in 3-week microcosm experiments. Descriptors of microbial community structure (bacterial density and chlorophyll-a concentration) and function (bacterial respiration and production and photosynthesis) were analyzed to chart the effects of TBZ and the kinetics of TBZ attenuation in water during the experiments. The results showed TBZ-induced effects on biofilm function (inhibition of substrate-induced respiration and photosynthetic activity), especially in LP-site communities, whereas plankton communities experienced a transitory stimulation of bacterial densities in communities from both LP and P sites. TBZ attenuation was stronger in biofilm (60-75%) than plankton (15-18%) experiments, probably due to greater adsorption on biofilms. The differences between biofilm and plankton responses to TBZ were likely explained by differences in community structure (presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix) and microbial composition. Biofilm communities also exhibited different sensitivity levels according to their in-field pre-exposure to fungicide, with P-site communities demonstrating adaptation capacities to TBZ. This study indicates that TBZ toxicity to non-targeted aquatic microbial communities essentially composed by microalgae and bacteria was moderate, and that its effects varied between stream and lake microbial communities.","authors":[{"name":"J Artigas"},{"name":"N Pascault"},{"name":"A Bouchez"},{"name":"J Chastain"},{"name":"D Debroas"},{"name":"J F Humbert"},{"name":"J Leloup"},{"name":"R D Tadonleke"},{"name":"A ter Halle"},{"name":"S Pesce"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adaptation"},{"word":"Algae"},{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Fungicide"},{"word":"Photosynthetic efficiency"},{"word":"Substrate-induced respiration"}]},"article142":{"pmid":"24047682","title":"Separation of competitive microorganisms using anaerobic membrane bioreactors as pretreatment to microbial electrochemical cells.","date":"2016-11-25","abs":"Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) as pretreatment to microbial electrochemical cells (MECs) were first assessed for improving energy recovery.

QS is mediated by small molecules, autoinducers (AIs), including AI-2 that is secreted by both Gram-positive and -negative microbes. LsrR is a key transcriptional regulator that governs the varied downstream processes by perceiving AI-2 signal, but its activation via autoinducer-binding remains poorly understood. Here, we provide detailed regulatory mechanism of LsrR from the crystal structures in complexes with the native signal (phospho-AI-2, D5P) and two quorum quenching antagonists (ribose-5-phosphate, R5P; phospho-isobutyl-AI-2, D8P). Interestingly, the bound D5P and D8P molecules are not the diketone forms but rather hydrated, and the hydrated moiety forms important H-bonds with the carboxylate of D243. The D5P-binding flipped out F124 of the binding pocket, and resulted in the disruption of the dimeric interface-1 by unfolding the α7 segment. However, the same movement of F124 by the D8P'-binding did not cause the unfolding of the α7 segment. Although the LsrR-binding affinity of R5P (Kd, ∼1 mM) is much lower than that of D5P and D8P (∼2.0 and ∼0.5 μM), the α-anomeric R5P molecule fits into the binding pocket without any structural perturbation, and thus stabilizes the LsrR tetramer. The binding of D5P, not D8P and R5P, disrupted the tetrameric structure and thus is able to activate LsrR. The detailed structural and mechanistic insights from this study could be useful for facilitating design of new antivirulence and antibiofilm agents based on LsrR.

We recognize four stromatolite morphotypes, including domical, conical, columnar, and flat-laminated structures. Observations of morphological and textural variations among the different morphotypes reveal significant diversity and complexity in the nature of interactions between microorganisms, gypsum deposition, and gypsum crystal growth. Nonbiological processes (detrital gypsum deposition, in situ crust precipitation, syntaxial crystal growth, subsurface crystal growth, and recrystallization) interacted with inferred microbial processes (including localized growth of biofilms, trapping and binding of grains in mats, nucleation of gypsum on cells) to produce distinct morphological-textural assemblages. Evidence for biological origins is clear in some stromatolite morphotypes and can come from the presence of microfossils, the spatial distribution of organic matter, and stromatolite morphology. In one stromatolite morphotype, the presence of the stromatolite, or the biota associated with it, may have determined the morphology of gypsum crystals. In some stromatolite morphotypes, definitive evidence of a microbial influence is not as clear. There are broad similarities between the Messinian gypsum stromatolites and carbonate stromatolites elsewhere in the geologic record, such as the formation of precipitated and granular layers; the development of domed, columnar, and conical morphotypes; the potential for microbes to influence mineral precipitation; and the recrystallization of deposits during burial. However, in detail the array of microbial-sedimentary-diagenetic process interactions is quite distinct in gypsiferous systems due to differences in the way gypsum typically forms and evolves in the paleoenvironment compared to carbonate. Unique aspects of the taphonomy of gypsum compared to carbonate chemical sediments, generally speaking, include the following: the potential for growth of individual crystals to determine the shape of a stromatolite (and possibly vice versa), a more diverse set of outcomes relating to preservation versus destruction of textures through crystal growth and recrystallization, and a greater likelihood of preserving microfossils through encapsulation in large crystals. These insights gained from the study of terrestrial gypsum sedimentary rocks provide valuable guidance for the search for clues to past life in sulfate chemical sediments on Mars.","authors":[{"name":"A C Allwood"},{"name":"I W Burch"},{"name":"J M Rouchy"},{"name":"M Coleman"}],"keywords":[]},"article148":{"pmid":"24047052","title":"Deciphering bacterial universal language by detecting the quorum sensing signal, autoinducer-2, with a whole-cell sensing system.","date":"2013-10-15","abs":"Bacteria communicate with neighboring bacteria of the same species or of other species by means of chemical signaling molecules. The concentration of such signaling molecules is proportional to the bacterial population size; upon reaching a threshold concentration, corresponding to a threshold cell density, certain specialized genes are expressed.

Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a QS signaling molecule that is used for interspecies communication by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria are known to play an important role in many diseases, from infections to chronic inflammation. Therefore, QS is involved in a variety of disorders of bacterial origin or where bacteria play a crucial pathogenic role.

The addition of macrophages to S. aureus static biofilms led to a global suppression of the biofilm transcriptome with a wide variety of genes downregulated. Notably, genes involved in metabolism, cell wall synthesis/structure, and transcription/translation/replication were among the most highly downregulated, which was most dramatic at 1 h compared to 24 h following macrophage addition to biofilms. Unexpectedly, few genes were enhanced in biofilms after macrophage challenge. Unlike coculture with macrophages, coculture of S. aureus static biofilms with neutrophils did not greatly influence the biofilm transcriptome.

In this study we report a novel modification to the EBPR approach, namely enhanced biological phosphorus removal and recovery (EBPR-r) that facilitates biological recovery of P from wastewater using a post denitrification configuration. The novel approach consists of two major steps. In the first step, a biofilm of phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) is exposed to a wastewater stream in the absence of active aeration, during which P is taken up by the biofilm using nitrate and residual dissolved oxygen as electron acceptors. Thus, P and nitrogen (N) removal from wastewater is achieved. During the second step, the P enriched biofilm is exposed to a smaller recovery stream supplemented with an external carbon source to facilitate P release under anaerobic conditions. This allows P to be recovered as a concentrated liquid. The EBPR-r process was able to generate a P recovery stream four time more concentrated (28 mg-P/L) than the wastewater stream (7 mg-P/L), while removing nitrate (denitrification) from the wastewater stream. Repeated exposure of the biofilm (10 P-uptake and release cycles) to a recovery stream yielded up to 100 mg-P/L. Overall, EBPR-r is the first post denitrification strategy that can also facilitate P recovery during secondary wastewater treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Pan Yu Wong"},{"name":"Ka Yu Cheng"},{"name":"Anna H Kaksonen"},{"name":"David C Sutton"},{"name":"Maneesha P Ginige"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms"},{"word":"Enhanced biological phosphorus removal"},{"word":"Phosphorus recovery"},{"word":"Phosphorus removal"},{"word":"Polyphosphate accumulating organisms"},{"word":"Post denitrification"},{"word":"Wastewater treatment"}]},"article158":{"pmid":"24041248","title":"Interspecies interaction extends bacterial survival at solid-air interfaces.","date":"2013-09-26","abs":"Despite the ubiquity of biofilms in natural and man-made environments, research on surface-associated cells has focused primarily on solid-liquid interfaces.

Transition from the yeast form to the hyphal form is one of the key virulence factors in C. albicans contributing to macrophage evasion, tissue invasion and biofilm formation. Nontoxic small molecules that inhibit C. albicans yeast-to-hypha conversion and hyphal growth could represent a valuable source for understanding pathogenic fungal morphogenesis, identifying drug targets and serving as templates for the development of novel antifungal agents. Here, we have identified the triterpenoid saponin family of gymnemic acids (GAs) as inhibitor of C. albicans morphogenesis. GAs were isolated and purified from Gymnema sylvestre leaves, the Ayurvedic traditional medicinal plant used to treat diabetes. Purified GAs had no effect on the growth and viability of C. albicans yeast cells but inhibited its yeast-to-hypha conversion under several hypha-inducing conditions, including the presence of serum. Moreover, GAs promoted the conversion of C. albicans hyphae into yeast cells under hypha inducing conditions. They also inhibited conidial germination and hyphal growth of Aspergillus sp. Finally, GAs inhibited the formation of invasive hyphae from C. albicans-infected Caenorhabditis elegans worms and rescued them from killing by C. albicans. Hence, GAs could be useful for various antifungal applications due to their traditional use in herbal medicine.

Expression of the agn43 gene is characterized by a regulated reversible switch or phase variation between the agn43 ON and agn43 OFF states. Although the agn43 regulatory switch leads to a heterogeneous population of ON and OFF bacteria, studies of Ag43 seldom consider potential biases associated with phase variation. We monitored agn43 ON/OFF phase-variation status genetically and phenotypically and we show that the use of populations with random agn43 ON or OFF status could result in misleading conclusions about Ag43 function or regulation. In particular, we demonstrate that Lrp and MqsR, previously identified as agn43 regulators, do not regulate agn43 expression or ON/OFF switch frequency. We also show that biofilm formation in dynamic flow conditions does not influence agn43 ON/OFF switching but physically selects aggregating agn43 ON cells. This indicates that misinterpretation is possible when studying gene expression within biofilms. Finally, we provide evidence that ignoring the initial agn43 ON/OFF status of the E. coli populations studied is likely to bias analyses of phenotypes associated with other E. coli adhesins. This study therefore emphasizes the importance of monitoring Ag43 phase variation and indicates that caution is required when interpreting experiments using strains that are neither deleted for agn43 nor carefully assessed for agn43 ON/OFF status.

CLR susceptibility of H. pylori intermediate (2-day) and mature (3-day) biofilms on glass coverslips was determined at concentrations from 0.03 to 0.5 µg/ml. H. pylori biofilm biomass was increased after treatment with CLR at minimum inhibitory concentration levels by up to 4-fold (2-day biofilm) and 16-fold (3-day biofilm). Minimum bactericidal concentrations of CLR against cells in a biofilm were higher (1.0 µg/ml) than that for planktonic cells (0.25 µg/ml). It was shown that the expression of efflux pump genes was significantly increased in biofilm cells. In addition, exposure of biofilms to CLR resulted in high level resistance generation compared to planktonic cells with increased resistance associated with the presence of a point mutation at either position 2142 or 2143 in the domain V loop of the 23S rRNA gene. These results demonstrate that H. pylori biofilm formation decreases the susceptibility to CLR and that H. pylori CLR resistance mutations are more frequently generated in biofilms than in planktonic cells.

The signal molecule cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) has been linked to the regulation of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in many bacterial species, including A. tumefaciens. In this study, we identified two putative diguanylate cyclase genes, celR (atu1297) and atu1060, that influence production of cellulose in A. tumefaciens. Overexpression of either gene resulted in increased cellulose production, while deletion of celR, but not atu1060, resulted in decreased cellulose biosynthesis. celR overexpression also affected other phenotypes, including biofilm formation, formation of a polar adhesion structure, plant surface attachment, and virulence, suggesting that the gene plays a role in regulating these processes. Analysis of celR and Δcel mutants allowed differentiation between phenotypes associated with cellulose production, such as biofilm formation, and phenotypes probably resulting from c-di-GMP signaling, which include polar adhesion, attachment to plant tissue, and virulence.

To empirically examine the impact of labile DOM on the responses of bacteria to DON and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), bacterial abundance and community composition were examined in controlled laboratory microcosms subjected to various combinations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DON, and DIN treatments. Bacterial communities that had colonized glass beads incubated in a stream were treated with various glucose concentrations and combinations of inorganic and organic N (derived from algal exudate, bacterial protein, and humic matter). The results revealed a strong influence of C availability on bacterial utilization of DON and DIN, with preferential uptake of DON under low C concentrations. Bacterial DON uptake was affected by the concentration and by its chemical nature (labile versus recalcitrant). Labile organic N sources (algal exudate and bacterial protein) were utilized equally well as DIN as an N source, but this was not the case for the recalcitrant humic matter DON treatment. Clear differences in bacterial community composition among treatments were observed based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes. C, DIN, and DON treatments likely drove changes in bacterial community composition that in turn affected the rates of DON and DIN utilization under various C concentrations.

However, the effectiveness of conventional scaling and root planing (SRP) is affected by the local conditions and residual bacteria which may affect the healing process. We performed a randomized clinical trial to test our hypothesis that adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) plus SRP has significant effect compared with SRP alone, which can last for 1 year. The study included 136 sites in 16 patients with previously untreated chronic periodontitis, at least one premolar and one molar in every quadrant (minimum, four teeth/quadrant) and at least one tooth with attachment loss of ≥4 mm in every quadrant. In all patients, two randomly assigned quadrants were treated with SRP and the other two were treated with SRP + aPDT. The clinical parameters of probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were evaluated at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. There were no significant differences between the two groups at baseline. PPD and BOP showed significant reduction, and CAL showed significant gain from baseline for all three time points in both groups. In addition, there were significantly greater reduction and gain for SRP + aPDT than for SRP at all three time points. No adverse effects of aPDT were observed. These data demonstrate significant improvement in all evaluated clinical parameters for at least 1 year and suggest that aPDT as an adjunctive therapy to SRP represents a promising therapeutic concept for persistent periodontitis.

The cpsQ-mfpABC gene cluster is transcribed as two operons cpsQ-mfpABC and mfpABC in V. parahaemolyticus. MfpABC is a putative membrane fusion transporter that contributes to biofilm development.

Consequently, bone cements are often loaded with antibiotics in an effort to prevent bacterial colonization. However, current formulations may not release antibiotics into the environment at sufficient and sustained concentrations required to impede bacterial growth or may be incompatible with antibiotics that are effective against the colonizing organism. Thus, new cement formulation options are needed.

The antibiotic vancomycin and a novel Staphylococcus aureus RnpA inhibitor under pre-clinical development, RNPA1000, were included in these studies. Rheological testing characterized the workability of the glass polyalkenoate cement over a range of powder-to-liquid ratios and polyacrylic acid concentrations and revealed that the most suitable powder-to-liquid ratio was 2/1.25 with 40 wt% polyacrylic acid. Loading glass polyalkenoate cement with either 20-30% RNPA1000 or vancomycin prevented bacterial growth. However, longer incubations allowed for Staphylococcus aureus colonies to form near the vancomycin-infused cement, indicating that vancomycin may not be suitable for long-term biofilm inhibition in comparison to RNPA1000. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses confirmed successful incorporation RNPA1000 into the cement matrix and were indicative of its slow release.

The observed bacterial diversity was distributed over five different classes (Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria) with the greatest number of 16S rRNA gene sequence derived from the Gammaproteobacteria (77 %). Vibrio is found to be the dominant one among the different bacterial species isolated. The results suggest that the microorganisms in the environment are maintained in the viscera of the gastropods which may have a key role in the metabolic functions.

QS-controlled phenotypes appeared to be inhibited by indole and the aqsR mutant had the same phenotypes. We demonstrated that the turnover rate of AqsR became more rapid without the N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal, and that indole could increase the expression of many protease and chaperone proteins. The addition of exogenous indole decreased the expression of two AqsR-targeted genes: AOLE_03905 (putative surface adhesion protein) and AOLE_11355 (L-asparaginase). The overexpression of AqsR in Escherichia coli was impossible with the indole treatment. Surprisingly, our [(35)S]methionine pulse-labelling data demonstrated that the stability and folding of AqsR protein decreased in the presence of indole without changing aqsR mRNA expression in E. coli. Interestingly, indole resulted in a loss of TraR-dependent traG expression in an Agrobacterium tumefaciens indicator strain. However, when indole was added after incubation with exogenous AHL, indole could not inhibit the TraR-dependent expression of the traG promoter. This indicated that AHL-bound TraR could be protective against indole, but TraR without AHL could not be active in the presence of indole. Here, we provided evidence for the first time showing that the indole effect on QS-controlled bacterial phenotypes is due to inhibited QS regulator folding and not a reduced QS signal.","authors":[{"name":"Jisun Kim"},{"name":"Woojun Park"}],"keywords":[]},"article198":{"pmid":"24025603","title":"Use of a stainless steel washer platform to study Acinetobacter baumannii adhesion and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces.","date":"2019-12-16","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and has recently increased in incidence as the causative agent of severe disease in troops wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq.

A. baumannii can survive desiccation and during outbreaks has been recovered from various sites in the patients' environment. To better understand its prevalence in hospital settings, we used a stainless steel washer (SSW) platform to investigate A. baumannii biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that A. baumannii forms strong biofilms on stainless steel surfaces. This platform was combined with a colorimetric 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) reduction assay to observe the metabolic activity of bacterial cells, and to facilitate the manipulation and comparison of multiple A. baumannii clinical strains. A strong correlation between XTT and c.f.u. assays was demonstrated. To complement the cell viability assays, A. baumannii biofilm mass was measured by crystal violet staining. Furthermore, the effect of commonly used disinfectants and environmental stressors on A. baumannii biofilms and planktonic cells was compared and characterized. Biofilms on SSWs were significantly more resistant than their planktonic counterparts, providing additional evidence that may allow us to understand the high prevalence of this microbe in hospital settings. Our results validate that SSWs are a simple, versatile and innovative method to study A. baumannii biofilms in vitro.

On the basis of the estimated parameters from experiments, the model was established to describe the biofilm functions in aerobic granules, such as substrate transfer and substrate concentration variations within the granules. In the modeling at different chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations (100-1000 mg/L), the biofilm functions were affected by the characteristics of aerobic granules, such as diameter and density. The larger granules modeled higher substrate fluxes (1.8-14 mg/cm(2)-d) and deeper effective film thicknesses (0.18-1.3 cm). The multi-aspect simulation results demonstrated that the substrate either approaches zero in the film (at low concentration) or penetrates the granules (at high concentration). The sum of aerobic granules in the SBRs can be considered as a mass of biofilm, where the substrate approaches zero at sufficient depth. The steady-state biofilm model could be an effective prediction method for optimizing the aerobic granular sludge process.

Phosphate, an essential nutrient, has been recognized as an important signal that affects virulence in P. aeruginosa. In the current study we examined the connection between phosphate regulation and surface motility in P. aeruginosa. We focused on two important genes, pstS, which is involved in phosphate uptake, and phoB, a central regulator that responds to phosphate starvation. We found that a mutant lacking pstS is constantly starved for phosphate and has a hyper swarming phenotype. Phosphate starvation also induced swarming in the wild type. The phoB mutant, on the other hand, did not express phosphate starvation even when phosphate was limited and showed no swarming. A double mutant lacking both genes (pstS and phoB) showed a similar phenotype to the phoB mutant (i.e. no swarming). This highlights the role of phoB in controlling swarming motility under phosphate-depleted conditions. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that PhoB controls swarming by up-regulating the Rhl quorum sensing system in P. aeruginosa, which resulted in hyper production of rhamonlipids: biosurfactants that are known to induce swarming motility.

Tae4 (type VI amidase effector 4) and Tai4 (type VI amidase immunity 4) are newly identified T6SS effector-immunity (EI) pairs. We have recently solved the structures of StTae4-Tai4 and EcTae4-Tai4 complexes from the human pathogens Salmonella typhimurium and Enterobacter cloacae, respectively. It is very interesting and important to discover whether there is cross-neutralization between St- and EcTai4 and whether their effector inhibition mechanism is conserved. Here, we determined the crystal structure of StTae4 in complex with EcTai4. The solution conformation study revealed it is a compact heterotetramer that consists of an EcTai4 homodimer binding two StTae4 molecules in solution, different from that in crystal. A remarkable shift can be observed in both the flexible winding loop of StTae4 and protruding loop of EcTai4 and disulfide bonds are formed to stabilize their overall conformations. The in vitro and in vivo interactions studies showed EcTai4 can efficiently rescue the cells from the toxicity of its cognate effectors StTae4, but can not neutralize the toxic activities of the effectors from other families. These findings provide clear structural evidence to support the previous observation of cross-immunity within T6SS families and provide a basis for understanding their important roles in polymicrobial environments.

Despite the economic importance of BFB, little is known about pathogenicity and fitness strategies of the bacterium. We have observed the phenomenon of phenotypic variation in A. citrulli. Here we report the characterization of phenotypic variants (PVs) of two strains, M6 and 7a1, isolated from melon and watermelon, respectively. Phenotypic variation was observed following growth in rich medium, as well as upon isolation of bacteria from inoculated plants or exposure to several stresses, including heat, salt and acidic conditions. When grown on nutrient agar, all PV colonies possessed a translucent appearance, in contrast to parental strain colonies that were opaque. After 72 h, PV colonies were bigger than parental colonies, and had a fuzzy appearance relative to parental strain colonies that are relatively smooth. A. citrulli colonies are generally surrounded by haloes detectable by the naked eye. These haloes are formed by type IV pilus (T4P)-mediated twitching motility that occurs at the edge of the colony. No twitching haloes could be detected around colonies of both M6 and 7a1 PVs, and microscopy observations confirmed that indeed the PVs did not perform twitching motility. In agreement with these results, transmission electron microscopy revealed that M6 and 7a1 PVs do not produce T4P under tested conditions. PVs also differed from their parental strain in swimming motility and biofilm formation, and interestingly, all assessed variants were less virulent than their corresponding parental strains in seed transmission assays. Slight alterations could be detected in some DNA fingerprinting profiles of 7a1 variants relative to the parental strain, while no differences at all could be seen among M6 variants and parental strain, suggesting that, at least in the latter, phenotypic variation is mediated by slight genetic and/or epigenetic alterations.

We describe a thermodynamic model that integrates geochemical and metagenomic data for biofilms sampled at five sites along a thermal and chemical gradient in the outflow channel of the hot spring known as Bison Pool in Yellowstone National Park. The relative abundances of major phyla in individual communities sampled along the outflow channel are modeled by computing metastable equilibrium among model proteins with amino acid compositions derived from metagenomic sequences. Geochemical conditions are represented by temperature and activities of basis species, including pH and oxidation-reduction potential quantified as the activity of dissolved hydrogen. By adjusting the activity of hydrogen, the model can be tuned to closely approximate the relative abundances of the phyla observed in the community profiles generated from BLAST assignments. The findings reveal an inverse relationship between the energy demand to form the proteins at equal thermodynamic activities and the abundance of phyla in the community. The distance from metastable equilibrium of the communities, assessed using an equation derived from energetic considerations that is also consistent with the information-theoretic entropy change, decreases along the outflow channel. Specific divergences from metastable equilibrium, such as an underprediction of the relative abundances of phototrophic organisms at lower temperatures, can be explained by considering additional sources of energy and/or differences in growth efficiency. Although the metabolisms used by many members of these communities are driven by chemical disequilibria, the results support the possibility that higher-level patterns of chemotrophic microbial ecosystems are shaped by metastable equilibrium states that depend on both the composition of biomass and the environmental conditions.

Collections of mRNA from planktonic (both exponential and stationary phase cultures) and sessile (biofilm) cells were sequenced. Six mRNA libraries were prepared following the mRNA-Seq protocols from Illumina. Reads were obtained in a HiScanSQ platform and mapped against the complete genome to describe the complete mRNA transcriptomes of planktonic and sessile cells. The results showed that the gene expression pattern of A. baumannii biofilm cells was distinct from that of planktonic cells, including 1621 genes over-expressed in biofilms relative to stationary phase cells and 55 genes expressed only in biofilms. These differences suggested important changes in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, motility, active transport, DNA-methylation, iron acquisition, transcriptional regulation, and quorum sensing, among other processes. Disruption or deletion of five of these genes caused a significant decrease in biofilm formation ability in the corresponding mutant strains. Among the genes over-expressed in biofilm cells were those in an operon involved in quorum sensing.

Pneumolysin (Ply) is a toxin that contributes significantly to the virulence of S. pneumoniae and is an important candidate as a serotype-independent vaccine target. Having previously demonstrated that a luxS knockout mutant was unable to form early biofilms and expressed less ply mRNA than the wild type, we conducted a study to investigate the role of Ply in biofilm formation. We found that Ply was expressed in early phases of biofilm development and localized to cellular aggregates as early as 4 h postinoculation. S. pneumoniae ply knockout mutants in D39 and TIGR4 backgrounds produced significantly less biofilm biomass than wild-type strains at early time points, both on polystyrene and on human respiratory epithelial cells, cultured under static or continuous-flow conditions. Ply's role in biofilm formation appears to be independent of its hemolytic activity, as S. pneumoniae serotype 1 strains, which produce a nonhemolytic variant of Ply, were still able to form biofilms. Transmission electron microscopy of biofilms grown on A549 lung cells using immunogold demonstrated that Ply was located both on the surfaces of pneumococcal cells and in the extracellular biofilm matrix.

The pathophysiology might involve both defects of the innate follicular immunity and overreaction to coagulase negative Staphylococcus. Treatment depends on the morphology, extent, severity, and duration. Topical clindamycin and dapsone are often adequate for treating mild HS. For Stage 1 and 2 HS, first line treatment combines rifampin with either oral clindamycin or minocycline. Other HS treatments include: fluoroquinolones with metronidazole and rifampin, oral dapsone, zinc, acitretin, hormone blockers (oral contraceptive pills, spironolactone, finasteride, and dutasteride), and oral prednisone. For severe HS, cyclosporine, adalimumab, or infliximab (used at double psoriatic doses) and intravenous carbapenems or cephalosporins are often required.

The reprogrammed E. coli degraded the mature biofilm matrix and killed the latent cells encapsulated within by expressing and secreting the antimicrobial peptide microcin S and the nuclease DNaseI upon the detection of quorum sensing molecules naturally secreted by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the reprogrammed E. coli exhibited directed motility toward the pathogen through regulated expression of CheZ in response to the quorum sensing molecules.

Structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy revealed that L. johnsonii FI9785 can produce two types of exopolysaccharide: EPS-1 is a branched dextran with the unusual feature that every backbone residue is substituted with a 2-linked glucose unit, and EPS-2 was shown to have a repeating unit with the following structure: -6)-α-Glcp-(1-3)-β-Glcp-(1-5)-β-Galf-(1-6)-α-Glcp-(1-4)-β-Galp-(1-4)-β-Glcp-(1-. Sites on both polysaccharides were partially occupied by substituent groups: 1-phosphoglycerol and O-acetyl groups in EPS-1 and a single O-acetyl group in EPS-2. Analysis of a deletion mutant (ΔepsE) lacking the putative priming glycosyltransferase gene located within a predicted eps gene cluster revealed that the mutant could produce EPS-1 but not EPS-2, indicating that epsE is essential for the biosynthesis of EPS-2. Atomic force microscopy confirmed the localization of galactose residues on the exterior of wild type cells and their absence in the ΔepsE mutant. EPS2 was found to adopt a random coil structural conformation. Deletion of the entire 14-kb eps cluster resulted in an acapsular mutant phenotype that was not able to produce either EPS-2 or EPS-1. Alterations in the cell surface properties of the EPS-specific mutants were demonstrated by differences in binding of an anti-wild type L. johnsonii antibody. These findings provide insights into the biosynthesis and structures of novel exopolysaccharides produced by L. johnsonii FI9785, which are likely to play an important role in biofilm formation, protection against harsh environment of the gut, and colonization of the host.

It has been previously reported that growth in high-salt medium, containing 0.8 M NaCl, leads to modifications in the cell envelope of this bacterium. In this study, we report that L. casei BL23 has an increased ability to form biofilms and to bind cations in high-salt conditions. This behaviour correlated with modifications of surface properties involving teichoic acids, which are important cell wall components. We also showed that, in these high-salt conditions, L. casei BL23 produces less of the cell wall polymer lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and that this anionic polymer has a shorter mean chain length and a lower level of d-alanyl-substitution. Analysis of the transcript levels of the dltABCD operon, encoding the enzymes required for the incorporation of d-alanine into anionic polymers, showed a 16-fold reduction in mRNA levels, which is consistent with a decrease in d-alanine substitutions on LTA. Furthermore, a 13-fold reduction in the transcript levels was observed for the gene LCABL_09330 coding for a putative LTA synthase. To provide further experimental evidence that LCABL_09330 is a true LTA synthase (LtaS) in L. casei BL23, the enzymic domain was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The purified protein was able to hydrolyse the membrane lipid phosphatidylglycerol as expected for an LTA synthase enzyme, and hence LCABL_09330 was renamed LtaS. The purified enzyme showed Mn(2+)-ion dependent activity, and its activity was modulated by differences in NaCl concentration. The decrease in both ltaS transcript levels and enzyme activity observed in high-salt conditions might influence the length of the LTA backbone chain. A putative function of the modified LTA structure is discussed that is compatible with the growth under salt-stress conditions and with the overall envelope modifications taking place during this stress condition.

Most solid surfaces exposed to seawater or physiological fluids become fouled by organic conditioning films and biofilms within minutes. Understanding the binding mechanisms of Mfps to organic films with known chemical and physical properties therefore is of considerable theoretical and practical interest. Using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on atomically smooth gold substrates and the surface forces apparatus, we explored the force-distance profiles and adhesion energies of three different Mfps, Mfp-1, Mfp-3, and Mfp-5, on (i) hydrophobic methyl (CH3)- and (ii) hydrophilic alcohol (OH)-terminated SAM surfaces between pH 3 and pH 7.5. At acidic pH, all three Mfps adhered strongly to the CH3-terminated SAM surfaces via hydrophobic interactions (range of adhesive interaction energy = -4 to -9 mJ/m(2)) but only weakly to the OH-terminated SAM surfaces through H- bonding (adhesive interaction energy ≤ -0.5 mJ/m(2)). 3, 4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) residues in Mfps mediate binding to both SAM surface types but do so through different interactions: typical bidentate H-bonding by Dopa is frustrated by the longer spacing of OH-SAMs; in contrast, on CH3-SAMs, Dopa in synergy with other nonpolar residues partitions to the hydrophobic surface. Asymmetry in the distribution of hydrophobic residues in intrinsically unstructured proteins, the distortion of bond geometry between H-bonding surfaces, and the manipulation of physisorbed binding lifetimes represent important concepts for the design of adhesive and nonfouling surfaces.

Thus, in standard culture using aerated 7H9 Middlebrook broth supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80, a dramatic CFU decrease was observed at the end of the exponential phase. This phase was followed by a stable stationary phase that led to dissociation between the optical density (O.D.) and CFU values, together with the formation of opaque colonies in solid culture. Further analysis revealed that this was due to cording. Scanning electron microscopy showed that cording led to the formation of very stable coiled structures and corded cell aggregations which proved impossible to disrupt by any of the physical means tested. Modulation of cording with a high but non-toxic concentration of Tween 80 led to a slower growth rate, avoidance of a sudden drop-off to the stationary phase, the formation of weaker cording structures and the absence of opaque colonies, together with a lower survival at later time-points. An innovative automated image analysis technique has been devised to characterize the cording process. This analysis has led to important practical consequences for the elaboration of M. tuberculosis inocula and suggests the importance of biofilm formation in survival of the bacilli in the extracellular milieu.

The antibiotic of choice for treating EAEC infections is ciprofloxacin. EAEC differs from other subgroups of pathogenic E. coli by having a surface protein, dispersin, which has previously been shown to play an important role in ciprofloxacin susceptibility for EAEC model strain 042. To investigate further the role of dispersin in ciprofloxacin susceptibility, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for 25 clinical isolates, including 15 with dispersin and 10 without. Dispersin-positive strains had a lower MIC than dispersin-negative strains. The mechanism of action behind this observation may be caused by dispersin (i) increasing the bacteria-antibiotic interaction or (ii) facilitating ciprofloxacin access to the intracellular target, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase. To test the role of dispersin in ciprofloxacin sensitivity, EAEC 042 as well as its isogenic mutants, dispersin mutant (042aap) and a mutant in the transporter apparatus gene aatA, believed to be involved in dispersin transport to the bacterial surface (042aatA), were utilised. As predicted, 042 had a higher sensitivity to ciprofloxacin than 042aap, but it was also found that the MIC of 042aatA was similar to 042aap. To address the question of the role of dispersin in ciprofloxacin susceptibility, the concentration of ciprofloxacin bound in biofilms of 042 and 042aap was quantified by treating bacteria with radiolabelled 2-(14)C-ciprofloxacin. The results showed that dispersin did not increase the amount of bound ciprofloxacin as a function of biomass, indicating instead that dispersin facilitates ciprofloxacin access to the intracellular target leading to increased antibiotic susceptibility.

In citrus, it causes Citrus Variegated Chlorosis (CVC). The mechanism of pathogenicity of this bacterium is associated with its capacity to colonize and form a biofilm in the xylem vessels of host plants, and there is not yet any method to directly reduce populations of this pathogen in the field. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a cysteine analogue used mainly to treat human diseases, on X. fastidiosa in different experimental conditions. Concentrations of NAC over 1 mg/mL reduced bacterial adhesion to glass surfaces, biofilm formation and the amount of exopolysaccharides (EPS). The minimal inhibitory concentration of NAC was 6 mg/mL. NAC was supplied to X. fastidiosa-infected plants in hydroponics, fertigation, and adsorbed to organic fertilizer (NAC-Fertilizer). HPLC analysis indicated that plants absorbed NAC at concentrations of 0.48 and 2.4 mg/mL but not at 6 mg/mL. Sweet orange plants with CVC symptoms treated with NAC (0.48 and 2.4 mg/mL) in hydroponics showed clear symptom remission and reduction in bacterial population, as analyzed by quantitative PCR and bacterial isolation. Experiments using fertigation and NAC-Fertilizer were done to simulate a condition closer to that normally is used in the field. For both, significant symptom remission and a reduced bacterial growth rate were observed. Using NAC-Fertilizer the lag for resurgence of symptoms on leaves after interruption of the treatment increased to around eight months. This is the first report of the anti-bacterial effect of NAC against a phytopathogenic bacterium. The results obtained in this work together with the characteristics of this molecule indicate that the use of NAC in agriculture might be a new and sustainable strategy for controlling plant pathogenic bacteria.

Currently, the 'polyphasic taxonomy' based on the integration of phenotypic and genotypic data seems to be the most appropriate approach. In fact, even if phenotypic characters often overlap among genetically different species, the molecular methods alone are frequently not able to establish distinct boundaries among phylogenetically related species. Thus, a valid scheme for the identification of a probiotic strain should be currently based on its morphological, physiological, and biochemical features as well as on aspects of its genetic profile. It is important that the identity of specific probiotic strains appearing on the product label is the result of a carefully selected combination of suitable phenotypic and genotypic analytical methods. Only adoption of such a policy could give the right emphasis to the significance of strain-specificity and thus provide health authorities with accurate tools to better evaluate the health benefits claimed by each probiotic-based product.

The modified WD was achieved by submerging the dressing pieces into a nanofluid composed of functionalized magnetite nanoparticles and Satureja hortensis (SO) essential oil (EO).

The fabricated nanostructure was characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). The analysis of the colonized surfaces using (Scanning Electron Microscopy) SEM revealed that C. albicans adherence and subsequent biofilm development are strongly inhibited on the surface of wound dressing fibers coated with the obtained nanofluid, comparing with regular uncoated materials. The results were also confirmed by the assay of the viable fungal cells embedded in the biofilm. Our data demonstrate that the obtained phytonanocoating improve the resistance of wound dressing surface to C. albicans colonization, which is often an etiological cause of local infections, impairing the appropriate wound healing.

Dentin-composite disks were made using bovine incisor roots filled with Z100(TM) or Filtek(TM) LS (3M ESPE). The disks were incubated for 72 h in paired CDC biofilm reactors, using a previously published protocol. One reactor was pulsed with sucrose, and the other was not. A sterile saliva-only control group was run with sucrose pulsing. The disks were fractured under diametral compression to evaluate their interfacial bond strength. The surface deformation of the disks was mapped using digital image correlation to ascertain the fracture origin. Fracture surfaces were examined using scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to assess demineralization and interfacial degradation. Dentin demineralization was greater under sucrose-pulsed biofilms, as the pH dropped <5.5 during pulsing, with LS and Z100 specimens suffering similar degrees of surface mineral loss. Biofilm growth with sucrose pulsing also caused preferential degradation of the composite-dentin interface, depending on the composite/adhesive system used. Specifically, Z100 specimens showed greater bond strength reduction and more frequent cohesive failure in the adhesive layer. This was attributed to the inferior dentin coverage by Z100 adhesive, which possibly led to a higher level of chemical and enzymatic degradation. The results suggested that factors other than dentin demineralization were also responsible for interfacial degradation. A clinically relevant in vitro biofilm model was therefore developed, which would effectively allow assessment of the degradation of the dentin-composite interface subjected to multi-species biofilm challenge.","authors":[{"name":"Y Li"},{"name":"C Carrera"},{"name":"R Chen"},{"name":"J Li"},{"name":"P Lenton"},{"name":"J D Rudney"},{"name":"R S Jones"},{"name":"C Aparicio"},{"name":"A Fok"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bond strength"},{"word":"Dental restoration"},{"word":"Interfacial Degradation"},{"word":"Multi-species biofilm"},{"word":"Resin composite"}]},"article261":{"pmid":"24007718","title":"Modification of the surfaces of medical devices to prevent microbial adhesion and biofilm formation.","date":"2013-09-20","abs":"The development of devices with surfaces that have an effect against microbial adhesion or viability is a promising approach to the prevention of device-related infections.","authors":[{"name":"C Desrousseaux"},{"name":"V Sautou"},{"name":"S Descamps"},{"name":"O Traoré"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Medical devices"},{"word":"Microbial adhesion"},{"word":"Nanostructures"}]},"article262":{"pmid":"24006838","title":"Role of size and shape on biofilm eradication for nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles.","date":"2013-10-09","abs":"Nitric oxide (NO), a reactive free radical, has proven effective in eradicating bacterial biofilms with reduced risk of fostering antibacterial resistance.

The microalgae included 10 different species of green algae and diatoms from both freshwater and saltwater environments while the substrata included glass, indium-tin oxide (ITO), stainless steel, polycarbonate, polyethylene, and polystryrene. The results indicated that acid-base interactions were the dominating mechanism of interaction for microalgae. For green algae, if at least one of the interacting surfaces was hydrophobic, adhesion at primary minimum was predicted without any energy barrier. However, most diatom systems featured energy barriers for adhesion due to repulsive van der Waals interactions. The results reported in this study are expected to provide useful data and insight into the interaction mechanisms of microalgae cells with each other and with substrata for a number of practical applications including prevention of biofouling of photobioreactors and other man-made surfaces, promotion of biofilm formation in algal biofilm photobioreactors, and developing bioflocculation strategies for energy efficient harvesting of algal biomass. Particularly, Botryococcus braunii and Cerithiopsis fusiformis were identified as promising species for biofloccuation and biofilm formation in freshwater and saltwater aquatic systems, respectively.

Type 1 pili are important virulence factors in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which cause the majority of urinary tract infections (UTI). FimH, the type 1 adhesin, binds mannosylated glycoproteins on the surface of human and murine bladder cells, facilitating bacterial colonization, invasion, and formation of biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities. The mannose-binding pocket of FimH is invariant among UPEC. We discovered that pathoadaptive alleles of FimH with variant residues outside the binding pocket affect FimH-mediated acute and chronic pathogenesis of two commonly studied UPEC strains, UTI89 and CFT073. In vitro binding studies revealed that, whereas all pathoadaptive variants tested displayed the same high affinity for mannose when bound by the chaperone FimC, affinities varied when FimH was incorporated into pilus tip-like, FimCGH complexes. Structural studies have shown that FimH adopts an elongated conformation when complexed with FimC, but, when incorporated into the pilus tip, FimH can adopt a compact conformation. We hypothesize that the propensity of FimH to adopt the elongated conformation in the tip corresponds to its mannose binding affinity. Interestingly, FimH variants, which maintain a high-affinity conformation in the FimCGH tip-like structure, were attenuated during chronic bladder infection, implying that FimH's ability to switch between conformations is important in pathogenesis. Our studies argue that positively selected residues modulate fitness during UTI by affecting FimH conformation and function, providing an example of evolutionary tuning of structural dynamics impacting in vivo survival.

The levels of the phospholipid platelet-activating factor (PAF) in the saliva, gingival crevicular fluid, and periodontal tissues are significantly increased during inflammatory conditions, such as PD, but the exact mechanism that links PAF to alveolar bone resorption is not well understood. In the current study, alveolar bone resorption was induced by experimental PD through the oral inoculation of A. actinomycetemcomitans in wild-type (WT) and PAF receptor knockout (Pafr(-/-)) mice. In vitro experiments using A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells treated with a PAF receptor antagonist (UK74505) were also performed. The expression of lyso-PAF acetyltransferase in periodontal tissues was significantly increased 3 h after A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS injection in mice. WT and Pafr(-/-) mice that were subjected to oral inoculation of A. actinomycetemcomitans presented neutrophil accumulation and increased levels of CXCL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in periodontal tissues. However, Pafr(-/-) mice presented less alveolar bone loss than WT mice. The in vitro blockade of the PAF receptor impaired the resorptive activity of A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS-activated osteoclasts. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that the blockade of PAF receptor may contribute to the progression of PD triggered by A. actinomycetemcomitans by directly affecting the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts.

One approach is to selectively attenuate bacterial pathogenicity by interfering with bacterial cell-to-cell communication known as quorum sensing. The PQS quorum sensing system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa employs as signal molecule the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS; 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-(1H)-quinolone), a key contributor to virulence and biofilm formation. Thus, interference with PQS production is considered as promising approach for the development of novel anti-infectives. Therefore, in this study, we developed and validated an ultra-high performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric approach for reliable quantification of PQS in P. aeruginosa cultures for activity determination of new quorum sensing inhibitors. The poor chromatographic properties of PQS reported by others could be overcome by fast microwave-assisted acetylation. The validation procedure including matrix effects, recovery, process efficiency, selectivity, carry-over, accuracy and precision, stability of the processed sample, and limit of quantification demonstrated that the method fulfilled all requirements of common validation guidelines. Its applicability was successfully proven in routine testing. In addition, two-point calibration was shown to be applicable for fast and reliable PQS quantification saving time and resources. In summary, the described method provides a powerful tool for the discovery of new quorum sensing inhibitors as potential anti-infectives and illustrated the usefulness of chemical derivatization, acetylation, in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.

Moreover, the zeta and surface potentials of all species were determined using electrophoretic mobility measurements along with using Smoluchowski's model. Finally, the free energy of cohesion of the microalgae was also determined based on the calculated surface energy properties. The results showed that the electron donor parameter correlated well with the free energy of cohesion in all groups of microalgae.

Larvae exposed to sediment detritus had the highest Se concentrations after 10 d of exposure (15.6 ± 1.9 µg/g dry wt) compared with larvae exposed to whole-sediment (12.9 ± 1.7 µg/g dry wt) or biofilm (9.9 ± 1.6 µg/g dry wt). Detritus and biofilm appear to be enriched sources of organic Se, which are more bioaccumulative than inorganic Se. Midge larvae from the reference treatment contained elevated concentrations of diselenides (i.e., selenocystine), while larvae from the biofilm treatment had the highest concentrations of selenomethionine-like compounds, which may be a biomarker of elevated Se exposures derived from anthropogenic sources. Whenever possible, Se concentrations in the organic fraction of sediment should be measured separately from whole-sediment Se and used for more accurate ecological risk assessments of potential Se impacts on aquatic ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"Eric D Franz"},{"name":"Cheryl I E Wiramanaden"},{"name":"Mercedes Gallego-Gallegos"},{"name":"Justin J Tse"},{"name":"James Phibbs"},{"name":"David M Janz"},{"name":"Ingrid J Pickering"},{"name":"Karsten Liber"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bioaccumulation"},{"word":"Chironomid"},{"word":"Selenium"},{"word":"Selenomethionine"},{"word":"Speciation"}]},"article290":{"pmid":"23996303","title":"Aeromonas punctata derived depolymerase that disrupts the integrity of Klebsiella pneumoniae capsule: optimization of depolymerase production.","date":"2014-07-21","abs":"Formation of dense, highly hydrated biofilm structures pose a risk for public and environmental health.

However, during the first week, all Pseudoalteromonas strains facilitated rather than prevented bacterial attachment when used to coat stainless steel surfaces and submerged in mesocosms with natural seawater. The bacterial density on surfaces coated with sterile growth medium was 10(5) cells/cm(2) after 7 days, whereas counts on surfaces precoated with Pseudoalteromonas were significantly higher, at 10(6) to 10(8) cells/cm(2). However, after 53 days, seven of eight Pseudoalteromonas strains had reduced total bacterial adhesion compared to the control. P. piscicida, P. antarctica, and P. ulvae remained on the surface, at levels similar to those in the initial coating, whereas P. tunicata could not be detected.

While multiple factors are thought to contribute to the high level of antimicrobial tolerance of biofilms, little is known about the timing of induction of biofilm tolerance. Here, we asked when over the course of their development do biofilms gain their tolerance to antimicrobial agents? We demonstrate that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, biofilm tolerance is linked to biofilm development, with transition to the irreversible attachment stage regulated by the two-component hybrid SagS, marking the timing when biofilms switch to the high-level tolerance phenotype. Inactivation of sagS rendered biofilms but not planktonic cells more susceptible to tobramycin, norfloxacin, and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, inactivation of sagS also eliminated the recalcitrance of biofilms to killing by bactericidal antimicrobial agents, a phenotype comparable to that observed upon inactivation of brlR, which encodes a MerR-like transcriptional regulator required for biofilm tolerance. Multicopy expression of brlR in a ΔsagS mutant restored biofilm resistance and recalcitrance to killing by bactericidal antibiotics to wild-type levels. In contrast, expression of sagS did not restore the susceptibility phenotype of ΔbrlR mutant biofilms to wild-type levels, indicating that BrlR functions downstream of SagS. Inactivation of sagS correlated with reduced BrlR levels in biofilms, with the produced BrlR being impaired in binding to the previously described BrlR-activated promoters of the two multidrug efflux pump operons mexAB-oprM and mexEF-oprN. Our findings demonstrate that biofilm tolerance is linked to early biofilm development and SagS, with SagS contributing indirectly to BrlR activation.

To determine homotypic and polymicrobial biofilm formation a flow cell system was employed and the biofilms imaged and quantified by fluorescent in situ hybridization using DNA species-specific probes and confocal scanning laser microscopy imaging. Of the three species, only P. gingivalis and T. denticola formed mature, homotypic biofilms, and a strong synergy was observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola in polymicrobial biofilm formation. This synergy was demonstrated by significant increases in biovolume, average biofilm thickness and maximum biofilm thickness of both species. In addition there was a morphological change of T. denticola in polymicrobial biofilms when compared with homotypic biofilms, suggesting reduced motility in homotypic biofilms. P. gingivalis gingipains were shown to play an essential role in synergistic polymicrobial biofilm formation with T. denticola.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of herbal extracts against normal oral streptococci, planktonic and biofilm of S. mutans. Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, and S. mutans were cultivated with brain heart infusion broth and susceptibility assay for the herbal extracts was performed according to the protocol of Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute. Also, S. mutans biofilm was formed on a polystyrene 12-well plate and 8-well chamber glass slip using BHI broth containing 2% sucrose and 1% mannose after conditioning the plate and the glass slip with unstimulated saliva. The biofilm was treated with the herbal extracts in various concentrations and inoculated on Mitis-Salivarius bacitracin agar plate for enumeration of viable S. mutans by counting colony forming units. Planktonic S. mutans showed susceptibility to all of the extracts and S. mutans biofilm exhibited the highest level of sensitivity for the extracts of S. flavescens. The normal oral streptococci exhibited a weak susceptibility in comparison to S. mutans. S. oralis, however, was resistant to all of the extracts. In conclusion, the extract of S. flavescens may be a potential candidate for prevention and management of dental caries.

However, very few reports are available on ARE isolates from canine clinical cases. The objective of this study was to characterize ARE strains of canine clinical origin from a veterinary teaching hospital in Canada and to compare them with human strains. Ten ARE strains from dogs and humans were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), antibiotic susceptibility and biofilm activities, presence of rep-families, CRISPR-cas and putative virulence genes. All ARE strains (n = 10) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and lincomycin. Resistances to tetracycline (n = 6), macrolides (n = 6), and to high concentrations of gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin (n = 5) were also observed. Canine ARE isolates were found to be susceptible to vancomycin whereas resistance to this antibiotic was observed in human strains. Ampicillin resistance was linked to PBP5 showing mutations at 25 amino acid positions. Fluoroquinolone resistance was attributable to ParC, GyrA, and GyrB mutations. Data demonstrated that all canine ARE were acm (collagen binding protein)-positive and that most harbored the efaAfm gene, encoding for a cell wall adhesin. Biofilm formation was observed in two human strains but not in canine strains. Two to five rep-families were observed per strain but no CRISPR sequences were found. A total of six STs (1, 18, 65, 202, 205, and 803) were found with one belonging to a new ST (ST803). These STs were identical or closely related to human hospital-associated lineages.

The major constituent of Hypericum perforatum is an unstable compound named hyperforin (1); for this reason it was not believed to play a significant role in the pharmacological effects. In this investigation a hydrogenated hyperforin analogue (2) was tested on several ATCC and clinical isolate strains, in their planktonic and biofilm form (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, and Enterococcus faecalis). Compound 2 was effective against planktonic and biofilm cultures, probably due to higher stability, showing the percentage of cells killed in the range from 45% to 52%. These results are noteworthy from the point of view of future development of these polyprenylated phloroglucinols as potential antibiotics.

Uncultured Crenarchaea are prominent in SBS, and their IPLs contain both glycosidic and mixed glyco-phospho head groups with tetraether cores, having 0-4 rings. Archaeal IPL contributions increase with increasing temperature and comprise up to one-fourth of the total IPL inventory at >84 °C. At elevated temperatures, bacterial IPLs contain abundant glycosidic glycerol diether lipids. Diether and diacylglycerol (DAG) lipids with aminopentanetetrol and phosphatidylinositol head groups were identified as lipids diagnostic of Aquificales, while DAG glycolipids and glyco-phospholipids containing N-acetylgycosamine as head group were assigned to members of the Thermales. With decreasing temperature and concomitant changes in water chemistry, IPLs typical of phototrophic bacteria, such as mono-, diglycosyl, and sulfoquinovosyl DAG, which are specific for cyanobacteria, increase in abundance, consistent with genomic data from the same samples. Compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis of IPL breakdown products reveals a large isotopic diversity among SBCs in different hot springs. At two of the hot springs, 'Bison Pool' and Flat Cone, lipids derived from Aquificales are enriched in (13) C relative to biomass and approach values close to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (approximately 0‰), consistent with fractionation during autotrophic carbon fixation via the reversed tricarboxylic acid pathway. At a third site, Octopus Spring, the same Aquificales-diagnostic lipids are 10‰ depleted relative to biomass and resemble stable carbon isotope values of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), indicative of heterotrophy. Other bacterial and archaeal lipids show a similar variance, with values resembling the DIC or DOC pool or a mixture thereof. This variance cannot be explained by hot spring chemistry or temperature alone, but instead, we argue that intermittent input of exogenous organic carbon can result in metabolic shifts of the chemotrophic communities from autotrophy to heterotrophy and vice versa.

In addition, to identify whether pre-exposure to experimental conditions can alter experimental outcomes we explicitly tested for differential effects on L. littorea pre-exposed to experimental conditions for two weeks and five months. In contrast to predictions based on metabolic theory, the combination of elevated temperature and CO2 over a five-week period caused a decrease in the amount of primary productivity consumed by grazers, while the abundance of biofilms increased. However, long-term pre-exposure to experimental conditions (five months) altered this effect, with grazing rates in these animals being greater than in animals exposed only for two weeks. We suggest that the structure of future ecosystems may not be predictable using short-term laboratory experiments alone owing to potentially confounding effects of exposure time and effects of being held in an artificial environment over prolonged time periods. A combination of laboratory (physiology responses) and large, long-term experiments (ecosystem responses) may therefore be necessary to adequately predict the complex and interactive effects of climate change as organisms may acclimate to conditions over the longer term.

The previously described CsrA family member in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (RsmA) plays a central role in determining infection modality by reciprocally regulating processes associated with acute (type III secretion and motility) and chronic (type VI secretion and biofilm formation) infection. Here we describe a second, structurally distinct RsmA homolog in P. aeruginosa (RsmF) that has an overlapping yet unique regulatory role. RsmF deviates from the canonical 5 β-strand and carboxyl-terminal α-helix topology of all other CsrA proteins by having the α-helix internally positioned. Despite striking changes in topology, RsmF adopts a tertiary structure similar to other CsrA family members and binds a subset of RsmA mRNA targets, suggesting that RsmF activity is mediated through a conserved mechanism of RNA recognition. Whereas deletion of rsmF alone had little effect on RsmA-regulated processes, strains lacking both rsmA and rsmF exhibited enhanced RsmA phenotypes for markers of both type III and type VI secretion systems. In addition, simultaneous deletion of rsmA and rsmF resulted in superior biofilm formation relative to the wild-type or rsmA strains. We show that RsmF translation is derepressed in an rsmA mutant and demonstrate that RsmA specifically binds to rsmF mRNA in vitro, creating a global hierarchical regulatory cascade that operates at the posttranscriptional level.

Understanding these processes is crucial for control of biofilm-mediated disease. Though chronic wound infections are often polymicrobial in nature, much of the research on chronic wound-related microbes has focused on single-species models. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are microbes that are often found together in wound isolates and are able to form stable in vitro biofilms, despite the antagonistic nature of P. aeruginosa with other organisms. Mutants of the K. pneumoniae strain IA565 lacking the plasmid-borne mrkD1P gene were less competitive than the wild type in an in vitro dual-species biofilm model with P. aeruginosa (PAO1). PAO1 spent medium inhibited the formation of biofilm of mrkD1P-deficient mutants and disrupted preestablished biofilms, with no effect on IA565 and no effect on the growth of the wild type or mutants. A screen using a two-allele PAO1 transposon library identified the LasB elastase as the secreted effector involved in biofilm disruption, and a purified version of the protein produced results similar to those with PAO1 spent medium. Various other proteases had a similar effect, suggesting that the disruption of the mrkD1P gene causes sensitivity to general proteolytic effects and indicating a role for MrkD1P in protection against host antibiofilm effectors. Our results suggest that MrkD1P allows for competition of K. pneumoniae with P. aeruginosa in a mixed-species biofilm and provides defense against microbial and host-derived proteases.

When unknown, genotypes were documented through multilocus sequence typing. The biological parameters evaluated included twitching, swimming, and swarming motility, biofilm formation, production of pyoverdine and pyocyanin, spontaneous mutant frequencies, and the in vitro competition index (CI) obtained with a flow cytometry assay. All 20 (100%) XDR, 8 (40%) MDR, and 1 (5%) ModR bloodstream isolate from the multicenter study belonged to high-risk clones.

However, little is known about the metabolic pathways required for pathogenic microbes to colonize and persist in their hosts. In this study, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to generate a high-resolution transcriptome of the opportunistic pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in vivo. We identified 691 A. actinomycetemcomitans transcriptional start sites and 210 noncoding RNAs during growth in vivo and as a biofilm in vitro. Compared to in vitro biofilm growth on a defined medium, ∼14% of the A. actinomycetemcomitans genes were differentially regulated in vivo. A disproportionate number of genes coding for proteins involved in metabolic pathways were differentially regulated in vivo, suggesting that A. actinomycetemcomitans in vivo metabolism is distinct from in vitro growth. Mutational analyses of differentially regulated genes revealed that formate dehydrogenase H and fumarate reductase are important A. actinomycetemcomitans fitness determinants in vivo. These results not only provide a high-resolution genomic analysis of a bacterial pathogen during in vivo growth but also provide new insight into metabolic pathways required for A. actinomycetemcomitans in vivo fitness.

The aims of this study were to investigate and compare the antibiotic susceptibilities of methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated from catheters, in planktonic and biofilm forms, and to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of antibiotics on those forms alone and in combinations. A total of 30 strains [15 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 15 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CNS)] isolated from catheter cultures of patients hospitalized in different clinics and intensive care units in Baskent University Medical School Hospital between 2006-2009, were included in the study. The antibiotic sensitivities of MRSA and MR-CNS isolates were investigated in vitro in planktonic phase and on sessile cells after biofilm was formed. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, gentamicin, meropenem, tigecycline, linezolid, ceftazidime and cephazolin were used for antibiotic susceptibility testing. The sensitivity of planktonic cells to antibiotics was primarily investigated, so that minimal inhibitor concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined by broth microdilution method. Afterwards, each strain was transformed to sessile cell in a biofilm environment, and MIC and MBC values were also determined for sessile cells. Double and triple antibiotic combinations were prepared, the effectiveness of combinations were studied on both planktonic and biofilm cells with multiple-combination bactericidal testing (MCBT) method. The data set obtained from planktonic and biofilm cells for each antibiotic analyzed via two proportion z test. Statistically significant decreases were found in the sensitivities of sessile cells when compared to planktonic cells (p< 0.01). The tests performed with the use of double and triple antibiotic combinations also showed the susceptibility decrease between planktonic and biofilm forms to be significant in most of the combinations (p< 0.01). The comparison of double and triple antibiotic combinations against planktonic and sessile cells as determined by the inhibition of more than 90% of the strains, revealed no significant difference . Vancomycin and tigecycline were the most effective antibiotics for all isolates in planktonic and sessile cells. Combinations containing vancomycin and rifampicin showed the best activity both double and triple antibiotic combinations against biofilm. In conclusion, our data indicated that combination therapy, especially double combinations of antibiotics seem to be a rational approach for biofilm-related infections.

In this study we evaluated the phenotypic switching ability of C. tropicalis and analyzed the effect of switching on biological properties related to virulence factors. We demonstrated that C. tropicalis switched spontaneously, reversibly and at high frequency (10(-1) to 10(-3)) when grown on yeast extract-peptone-D-glucose (YPD) agar medium. Phenotypic switching in five clinical isolates of C. tropicalis resulted in colonies exhibiting the following morphologies: crepe, rough, crater, irregular center, mycelial and diffuse. The majority of the variant colonies were associated with higher percentages of filamentous growth relative to their parental unswitched isolates. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in the production of hemolytic factor were found between most of the switched variants and their respective parental counterparts. Variant colonies exhibiting the crepe (derived from isolates 49.07 and 100.10) and rough phenotype (derived from isolate 49.07) had higher biofilm formation than their parental counterparts exhibiting a smooth dome surface (P < 0.05). Our data revealed that switching was correlated with changes in the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a subset of the switched variants phenotypes to itraconazole. While the MIC to itraconazole was higher for crepe variant compared with its parental isolate 49.07, the rough variant of 100.10 had a lower MIC to this antifungal agent.

However, their ecosystem function is threatened by direct anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Oil sands surface mining in the boreal regions of Western Canada denudes tracts of land of organic materials, leaves large areas in need of reclamation, and generates considerable quantities of extraction process-affected materials. Knowledge and validation of reclamation techniques that lead to self-sustaining wetlands has lagged behind development of protocols for reclaiming terrestrial systems. It is important to know whether wetlands reclaimed with oil sands process materials can be restored to levels equivalent to their original ecosystem function. We approached this question by assessing carbon flows and food web structure in naturally formed and oil sands-affected wetlands constructed in 1970-2004 in the postmining landscape. We evaluated whether a prescribed reclamation strategy, involving organic matter amendment, accelerated reclaimed wetland development, leading to wetlands that were more similar to their natural marsh counterparts than wetlands that were not supplemented with organic matter. We measured compartment standing stocks for bacterioplankton, microbial biofilm, macrophytes, detritus, and zoobenthos; concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and residual naphthenic acids; and microbial production, gas fluxes, and aquatic-terrestrial exports (i.e., aquatic insect emergence). The total biomass of several biotic compartments differed significantly between oil sands and reference wetlands. Submerged macrophyte biomass, macroinvertebrate trophic diversity, and predator biomass and richness were lower in oil sands-affected wetlands than in reference wetlands. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that wetland age and wetland amendment with peat-mineral mix mitigate effects of oil sands waste materials on the fully aquatic biota.

The ability of microorganisms to produce biofilm facilitates them to withstand the host immune response and is recognized as one factor contributing to chronic or persistent infections. It was demonstrated that the ica-encoded genes lead to the biosynthesis of polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA) molecules, and may be involved in the accumulation phase of biofilm formation. Different studies have shown the decisive role of the ica gene as virulence factors in staphylococcal infections. This study was carried out to demonstrate the relationship between ica gene and production of slime layer in S. aureus strains. Sixty S. aureus strains were isolated from patients. The isolates were identified morphologically and biochemically following standard laboratory methods. After identification, the staphylococcal isolates were maintained in trypticase soy broth (TSB), to which 15% glycerol was added, and stored at -20°C. Slime formation and biofilm assay was monitored. A PCR assay was developed to identify the presence of icaD (intercellular adhesion gene) gene in all isolates. Thirty-nine slime producing colonies with CRA plates (65%) formed black colors, the remaining 21 isolates were pink (35%). In the quantitative biofilm assay 35 (58%) produced biofilm while 25 (42%) isolates did not exhibit this property. All isolates were positive for detection of icaD gene by PCR method.

The mechanical removal of plaque can only be performed partially due to limited accessibility. Therefore, plaque still represents one of the major therapeutic challenges. Even though antiseptic mouth rinses reduce the extent of biofilm temporarily, plaque removal remains incomplete and continuous usage can even result in side effects. Here we tested argon plasma produced by kinpen09 as one option to inactivate microorganisms and to eliminate plaque. S. sanguinis biofilms cultivated in either the European Biofilm Reactor (EUREBI) or in 24 well plates were treated with argon plasma. In both test systems a homogeneous, good analyzable and stable biofilm was produced on the surface of titan plates within 72 h (>6,9 log10 CFU/ml). Despite the significantly more powerful biofilm production in EUREBI, the difference of 0.4 log10 CFU/ml between EUREBI and the 24 well plates was practically not relevant. For that reason both test models were equally qualified for the analysis of efficacy of cold atmospheric pressure plasma. We demonstrate a significant reduction of the biofilm compared to the control in both test models. After plasma application of 180 s the biofilm produced in EUREBI or in 24 well plates was decreased by 0.6 log10 CFU/ml or 0.5 log10 CFU/ml, respectively. In comparison to recently published studies analyzing the efficacy of kinpen09, S. sanguinis produces a hardly removable biofilm. Future investigations using reduced distances between plasma source and biofilm, various compositions of plasma and alternative plasma sources will contribute to further optimization of the efficacy against S. sanguinis biofilms.

To develop novel therapeutic strategies the molecular adaption strategies of P. aeruginosa biofilms to the conditions of the urinary tract were investigated thoroughly at the systems level using transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and enzyme activity analyses. For this purpose biofilms were grown anaerobically in artificial urine medium (AUM). Obtained data were integrated bioinformatically into gene regulatory and metabolic networks. The dominating response at the transcriptome and proteome level was the adaptation to iron limitation via the broad Fur regulon including 19 sigma factors and up to 80 regulated target genes or operons. In agreement, reduction of the iron cofactor-dependent nitrate respiratory metabolism was detected. An adaptation of the central metabolism to lactate, citrate and amino acid as carbon sources with the induction of the glyoxylate bypass was observed, while other components of AUM like urea and creatinine were not used. Amino acid utilization pathways were found induced, while fatty acid biosynthesis was reduced. The high amounts of phosphate found in AUM explain the reduction of phosphate assimilation systems. Increased quorum sensing activity with the parallel reduction of chemotaxis and flagellum assembly underscored the importance of the biofilm life style. However, reduced formation of the extracellular polysaccharide alginate, typical for P. aeruginosa biofilms in lungs, indicated a different biofilm type for urinary tract infections. Furthermore, the obtained quorum sensing response results in an increased production of virulence factors like the extracellular lipase LipA and protease LasB and AprA explaining the harmful cause of these infections.

While a specific cause of enteritis is not determined in most cases, these kittens are often empirically administered probiotics that contain enterococci. The enterococci are members of the commensal intestinal microbiota but also can function as opportunistic pathogens. Given the complicated role of enterococci in health and disease, it would be valuable to better understand what constitutes a healthy enterococcal community in these kittens and how this microbiota is impacted by severe illness. In this study, we characterized the ileum mucosa-associated enterococcal community of 50 apparently healthy and 50 terminally ill foster kittens. In healthy kittens, Enterococcus hirae was the most common species of ileum mucosa-associated enterococci and was often observed to adhere extensively to the small intestinal epithelium. These E. hirae isolates generally lacked virulence traits. In contrast, non-E. hirae enterococci, notably Enterococcus faecalis, were more commonly isolated from the ileum mucosa of kittens with terminal illness. Isolates of E. faecalis had numerous virulence traits and multiple antimicrobial resistances. Moreover, the attachment of Escherichia coli to the intestinal epithelium was significantly associated with terminal illness and was not observed in any kitten with adherent E. hirae. These findings identify a significant difference in the species of enterococci cultured from the ileum mucosa of kittens with terminal illness compared to the species cultured from healthy kittens. In contrast to prior case studies that associated enteroadherent E. hirae with diarrhea in young animals, these controlled studies identified E. hirae as more often isolated from healthy kittens and adherence of E. hirae as more common and extensive in healthy kittens than in sick kittens.

The term quorum sensing was originally coined to describe the mechanism underlying the onset of luminescence production in cultures of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Luminescence and, more generally, quorum sensing are important for V. fischeri to form a mutualistic symbiosis with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. The symbiosis is established when V. fischeri cells migrate via flagella-based motility from the surrounding seawater into a specialized structure injuvenile squid called the light organ. The cells grow to high cell densities within the light organ where the infection persists over the lifetime of the animal. A hallmark of a successful symbiosis is the luminescence produced by V. fischeri that camouflages the squid at night by eliminating its shadow within the water column. While the regulatory networks governing quorum sensing are critical for properly regulating V. fischeri luminescence within the squid light organ, they also regulate luminescence-independent processes during symbiosis. In this review, we discuss the quorum-sensing network of V. fischeri and highlight its impact at various stages during host colonization.

The study included a control group, a contaminated group that did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis, and three contaminated groups that received: (i) intraperitoneal tigecycline, (ii) FS8-soaked graft, and (iii) tigecycline plus FS8-soaked graft, respectively. Each group included 15 animals. The infection burden was evaluated by using sonication and quantitative agar culture. Moreover, an in vitro binding-study was performed to quantify the how much FS8 was coated to the surface of the prosthesis. Tigecycline, combined with FS8, against the adherent bacteria showed MICs (2.00 mg/L) and MBCs (4.00 mg/L) four-fold lower with respect to tigecycline alone in in vitro studies. The rat groups treated with tigecycline showed the lowest bacterial numbers (4.4 x 104 ± 1.2 x 104 CFU/mL). The FS8-treated group showed a good activity and significant differences compared to control group with bacterial numbers of 6.8 x 104 ± 2.0 x 104 CFU/mL. A stronger inhibition of bacterial growth was observed in rats treated with a combined FS8 and tigecycline therapy than in those that were singly treated with bacterial numbers of 101 CFU/mL graft. In conclusion, the ability to affect biofilm formation as well, its property to be an antibiotic enhancer suggests FS8 as alternative or additional agent to use in conjunction with conventional antimicrobial for prevention of staphylococcal biofilm related infection.

Chemical mechanism(s) enhancing its formation remain an enigma because abiotic dolomite has been challenging to synthesize at low temperature in laboratory settings. Microbial enhancement of dolomite precipitation at low temperature has been reported; however, it is still unclear exactly how microorganisms influence reaction kinetics. Here we document the abiotic synthesis of low-temperature dolomite in laboratory experiments and constrain possible mechanisms for dolomite formation. Ancient and modern seawater solution compositions, with identical pH and pCO2, were used to precipitate an ordered, stoichiometric dolomite phase at 30 °C in as few as 20 d. Mg-rich phases nucleate exclusively on carboxylated polystyrene spheres along with calcite, whereas aragonite forms in solution via homogeneous nucleation. We infer that Mg ions are complexed and dewatered by surface-bound carboxyl groups, thus decreasing the energy required for carbonation. These results indicate that natural surfaces, including organic matter and microbial biomass, possessing a high density of carboxyl groups may be a mechanism by which ordered dolomite nuclei form. Although environments rich in organic matter may be of interest, our data suggest that sharp biogeochemical interfaces that promote microbial death, as well as those with high salinity may, in part, control carboxyl-group density on organic carbon surfaces, consistent with origin of dolomites from microbial biofilms, as well as hypersaline and mixing zone environments.

Iron is an important environmental parameter thought to play a central role in the development and maintenance of P. aeruginosa infections, for both anabolic and signaling purposes. Previous studies have focused on ferric iron [Fe(III)] as a target for antimicrobial therapies; however, here we show that ferrous iron [Fe(II)] is abundant in the CF lung (-39 µM on average for severely sick patients) and significantly correlates with disease severity (ρ = -0.56, P = 0.004), whereas ferric iron does not (ρ = -0.28, P = 0.179). Expression of the P. aeruginosa genes bqsRS, whose transcription is upregulated in response to Fe(II), was high in the majority of patients tested, suggesting that increased Fe(II) is bioavailable to the infectious bacterial population. Because limiting Fe(III) acquisition inhibits biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa in various oxic in vitro systems, we also tested whether interfering with Fe(II) acquisition would improve biofilm control under anoxic conditions; concurrent sequestration of both iron oxidation states resulted in a 58% reduction in biofilm accumulation and 28% increase in biofilm dissolution, a significant improvement over Fe(III) chelation treatment alone.

Legionella species causes Legionnaire's disease that is a potentially fatal respiratory disease often acquired through the aerosolization of contaminated water. Monochloramine has been used successfully in the municipal water systems to eradicate Legionella and there is currently limited data to support its use in the hospital setting. This technology appears to be affordable, safe and effective at penetrating biofilm in water distribution systems.

The effects of CHE on extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production, hydrophobicity and adhesion ability of Pseudomonas sp., Alteromonas sp. and Gallionella sp. and the antimicrobial activity of the extract against these bacteria were assessed. CHE was found to possess antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains and affected the EPS production. The CHE affected the growth of the biofilm-forming bacteria in a culture medium. The hydrophobicity of the bacterial cells was also changed due to the CHE treatment. The active compound of the CHE was characterised by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis. HPLC spectrum showed a single peak and the FT-IR spectrum indicated the presence of an OH-group-containing compound in the extract. In conclusion the CHE could be used as a source for the isolation of antifouling compounds.

The rifampin-resistant mutation frequencies were evaluated. Of the rifampin-based combinations, rifampin enhances the antibacterial activities of and even synergizes with fusidic acid, tigecycline, and, to a lesser extent, linezolid, fosfomycin, and minocycline against biofilm-embedded MRSA. Such combinations with weaker rifampin resistance induction activities may provide a therapeutic advantage in MRSA biofilm-related infections.

While genomic studies have provided a wealth of information about the alleles associated with adaptation to antibiotics, they do not provide essential information about the relative importance of genomic changes, their order of appearance, or potential epistatic relationships between adaptive changes. Here we used quantitative experimental evolution of a single polymorphic population in continuous culture with whole-genome sequencing and allelic frequency measurements to study daptomycin (DAP) resistance in the vancomycin-resistant clinical pathogen Enterococcus faecalis S613. Importantly, we sustained both planktonic and nonplanktonic (i.e., biofilm) populations in coculture as the concentration of antibiotic was raised, facilitating the development of more ecological complexity than is typically observed in laboratory evolution. Quantitative experimental evolution revealed a clear order and hierarchy of genetic changes leading to resistance, the signaling and metabolic pathways responsible, and the relative importance of these mutations to the evolution of DAP resistance. Despite the relative simplicity of this ex vivo approach compared to the ecological complexity of the human body, we showed that experimental evolution allows for rapid identification of clinically relevant adaptive molecular pathways and new targets for drug design in pathogens.

It forms biofilms to protect itself from the host and antibiotics. Biofilm and planktonic lifestyle are regulated by a complex quorum sensing system (QS) with the central regulator agr. To study biofilm formation and QS we set up a Boolean node interaction network (94 nodes, 184 edges) that included different two component systems such as agr, sae and arl. Proteins such as sar, rot and sigB were included. Each gene node represents the resulting activity of its gene products (mRNA and protein). Network consistency was tested according to previous knowledge and the literature. Regulator mutation combinations (agr-, sae-, sae-/agr-, sigB+, sigB+/sae-) were tested in silico in the model and compared regarding system changes and responses to experimental gene expression data. High connectivity served as a guide to identify master regulators, and their detailed behaviour was studied both in vitro and in the model. System analysis showed two stable states, biofilm forming versus planktonic, with clearly different sub-networks turned on. Predicted node activity changes from the in silico model were in line with microarray gene expression data of different knockout strains. Additional in silico predictions about node activity and biofilm formation were compared to new in vitro experiments (northern blots and biofilm adherence assays) which confirmed these. Further experiments in silico as well as in vitro showed the sae locus as the central modulator of biofilm production. Sae knockout strains showed stronger biofilms. Wild type phenotype was rescued by sae complementation. The in silico network provides a theoretical model that agrees well with the presented experimental data on how integration of different inputs is achieved in the QS of SA. It faithfully reproduces the behaviour of QS mutants and their biofilm forming ability and allows predictions about mutations and mutation combinations for any node in the network. The model and simulations allow us to study QS and biofilm formation in SA including behaviour of MRSA strains and mutants. The in vitro and in silico evidence stresses the role of sae and agr in fine-tuning biofilm repression and/or SA dissemination.","authors":[{"name":"Christof Audretsch"},{"name":"Daniel Lopez"},{"name":"Mugdha Srivastava"},{"name":"Christiane Wolz"},{"name":"Thomas Dandekar"}],"keywords":[]}}
