Swab samples were collected from the conjunctiva, nasal cavity, perianal area, and rectum for mammals while the sampling was done from the conjunctiva, oral mucosa, pericloacal area, and cloaca for birds. Isolation of CoNS was based on morphological and biochemical analyses along with molecular typing. Biofilm production was analyzed using 96-well plate based quantitative adherence assays. The studies demonstrated that CoNS of mammalian origin have higher biofilm-producing ability (70.4%) than the isolates from birds (62.5%). In particular, all methicillin-resistant (MR) CoNS isolated from mammals were capable of biofilm formation while only 63.3% of MR CoNS isolated from birds could produce biofilms. The MR CoNS isolated from mammals also had a significantly higher ability to form biofilms (100%) than methicillin susceptible CoNS (60.0%) than those isolates from birds.

Therefore, tight regulation of intracellular CDN concentration by counteracting the action of dinucleotide cyclases and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is critical. Here, we demonstrate that a putative stand-alone EAL domain PDE from Vibrio cholerae (VcEAL) is capable to degrade both the second messenger c-di-GMP and hybrid 3'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). To unveil their degradation mechanism, we have determined high-resolution crystal structures of VcEAL with Ca2+, c-di-GMP-Ca2+, 5'-pGpG-Ca2+ and cGAMP-Ca2+, the latter provides the first structural basis of cGAMP hydrolysis. Structural studies reveal a typical triosephosphate isomerase barrel-fold with substrate c-di-GMP/cGAMP bound in an extended conformation. Highly conserved residues specifically bind the guanine base of c-di-GMP/cGAMP in the G2 site while the semi-conserved nature of residues at the G1 site could act as a specificity determinant. Two metal ions, co-ordinated with six stubbornly conserved residues and two non-bridging scissile phosphate oxygens of c-di-GMP/cGAMP, activate a water molecule for an in-line attack on the phosphodiester bond, supporting two-metal ion-based catalytic mechanism. PDE activity and biofilm assays of several prudently designed mutants collectively demonstrate that VcEAL active site is charge and size optimized. Intriguingly, in VcEAL-5'-pGpG-Ca2+ structure, β5-α5 loop adopts a novel conformation that along with conserved E131 creates a new metal-binding site. This novel conformation along with several subtle changes in the active site designate VcEAL-5'-pGpG-Ca2+ structure quite different from other 5'-pGpG bound structures reported earlier.","authors":[{"name":"Malti Yadav"},{"name":"Kamalendu Pal"},{"name":"Udayaditya Sen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"cGAMP"},{"word":"crystallography"},{"word":"phosphodiesterase"},{"word":"second messenger"},{"word":"site-directed mutagenesis"}]},"article16":{"pmid":"31647407","title":"An invitro experimental study of the effect of fosfomycin in combination with amikacin, ciprofloxacin or meropenem on biofilm formation by multidrug-resistant urinary isolates of Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Sugalya Sugathan"},{"name":"Jharna Mandal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FIC"},{"word":"MDR E.coli"},{"word":"MIC"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"fosfomycin combination"}]},"article17":{"pmid":"31647218","title":"N-Benzyl Derivatives of Long-Chained 4-Amino-7-chloro-quionolines as Inhibitors of Pyocyanin Production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-02-21","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of nosocomial infections that are becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to the occurrence of antibiotic resistant strains.

More importantly, this synergistic effect was retained under the in vivo scenario, wherein the combination showed excellent efficacy in mice model of burn-wound infection with a drastic reduction of bacterial burden.

While the frequency of infection following elective orthopedic surgery is low, rates of reinfection are disturbingly high. Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for the majority of chronic osteomyelitis cases and is often considered to be incurable due to bacterial persistence deep within bone. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on clinical classifications of osteomyelitis and the ensuing treatment algorithm. Given the high patient morbidity, mortality, and economic burden caused by osteomyelitis, it is important to elucidate mechanisms of bone infection to inform novel strategies for prevention and curative treatment. Recent discoveries in this field have identified three distinct reservoirs of bacterial biofilm including: Staphylococcal abscess communities in the local soft tissue and bone marrow, glycocalyx formation on implant hardware and necrotic tissue, and colonization of the osteocyte-lacuno canalicular network (OLCN) of cortical bone. In contrast, S. aureus intracellular persistence in bone cells has not been substantiated in vivo, which challenges this mode of chronic osteomyelitis. There have also been major advances in our understanding of the immune proteome against S. aureus, from clinical studies of serum antibodies and media enriched for newly synthesized antibodies (MENSA), which may provide new opportunities for osteomyelitis diagnosis, prognosis, and vaccine development. Finally, novel therapies such as antimicrobial implant coatings and antibiotic impregnated 3D-printed scaffolds represent promising strategies for preventing and managing this devastating disease.

The remaining fragment was fixed and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In total, 20 patients with an average age of 73.3 years (± 13.1) participated in this study. These patients remained under endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation for an average of 6.4 (± 1.8) and 13.5 days (± 15), respectively. Of these patients, 45 % showed respiratory tract colonization by yeasts of the Candida genus, with C. albicans being the most frequently isolated species (66.7 %). Moreover, in almost 90 % of these patients, blastoconidia of the same yeast were found in the infra-cuff portion of the ET, as evidenced by SEM, strongly fixed on the ET surface. Yeasts isolated from both the infra-cuff region and the tracheobronchial secretions were susceptible to amphotericin B and fluconazole. In conclusion, our results show that the frequency of colonization by yeasts of the Candida genus in the tracheobronchial secretions of intubated patients within 48 hours is high, and that these species can also be found as a biofilm on the ET surface.","authors":[{"name":"Elenice Gomes Ferreira"},{"name":"Fabrício Yatsuda"},{"name":"Marcio Pini"},{"name":"Isabele Carrilho Jarros"},{"name":"Flávia Franco Veiga"},{"name":"Admilton Gonçalves de Oliveira"},{"name":"Melyssa Negri"},{"name":"Terezinha Inez Estivalet Svidzinski"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"intratracheal"},{"word":"intubation"},{"word":"mechanical"},{"word":"ventilators"}]},"article27":{"pmid":"31644974","title":"Covalent grafting of titanium with a cathelicidin peptide produces an osteoblast compatible surface with antistaphylococcal activity.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Bacterial infection of orthopaedic implants, often caused by Staphylococcus species, may ultimately lead to implant failure.

In this work, we show that biofilms formed by a non-pathogenic fungus Neurospora discreta, are fungal bio-composites (FBCs) that can be directed to self-organize through active stresses to achieve specific properties. We induced active stresses by systematically varying the agitation rate during the growth of FBCs. By growing FBCs that are strong enough to be conventionally tensile loaded, we find that as agitation rate increases, the elongation strain at which the FBCs break, increases linearly, and their elastic modulus correspondingly decreases. Using results from microstructural imaging and thermogravimetry, we rationalize that agitation increases the production of ECM, which concomitantly increases the water content of agitated FBCs up to 250% more than un-agitated FBCs. Water held in the nanopores of the ECM acts a plasticizer and controls the ductility of FBCs in close analogy with polyelectrolyte complexes. This paradigm shift in viewing biofilms as bio-composites opens up the possibility for their use as sustainable, biodegradable, low-modulus structural materials.","authors":[{"name":"R Aravinda Narayanan"},{"name":"Asma Ahmed"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Flowing Matter: Active Fluids"}]},"article31":{"pmid":"31642854","title":"Switchable modulation of bacterial growth and biofilm formation based on supramolecular tripeptide amphiphiles.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Design and fabrication of smart supramolecular peptide systems is an effective strategy to develop antibacterial agents that can be selectively activated/inactivated by external stimuli for combating bacterial resistance.

In Gram-negative bacteria, the periplasmic protein PgaB is responsible for partial de-N-acetylation of PNAG prior to its export to the extracellular space. In addition to de-N-acetylase activity found in the N-terminal domain, PgaB contains a C-terminal hydrolase domain that can disrupt dPNAG-dependent biofilms and hydrolyzes dPNAG but not fully acetylated PNAG. The role of this C-terminal domain in biofilm formation has yet to be determined in vivo. Further characterization of the enzyme's hydrolase activity has been hampered by a lack of specific dPNAG oligosaccharides.

Profound and updated knowledge of treatment of biofilm related infection is necessary to achieve optimal results in patients with implant-associated infections. Future challenges include improved decision support for combining surgical treatment with selection of proper antibiotics, as well as management of antibiotic resistance, drug-drug interactions and adverse effects of antibiotic treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Staffan Tevell"},{"name":"Bertil Christensson"},{"name":"Åsa Nilsdotter-Augustinsson"},{"name":"Cecilia Rydén"},{"name":"Ulf Ryding"},{"name":"Bo Söderquist"},{"name":"Börje Åkerlund"}],"keywords":[]},"article47":{"pmid":"31638028","title":"Response and remediation actions following the detection of Naegleria fowleri in two treated drinking water distribution systems, Louisiana, 2013-2014.","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"Naegleria fowleri causes the usually fatal disease primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), typically in people who have been swimming in warm, untreated freshwater.

In 2013, a case of PAM was reported for the first time in association with the exposure to water from a US treated drinking water system colonized with culturable N. fowleri. This system and another were found to have multiple areas with undetectable disinfectant residual levels. In response, the water distribution systems were temporarily converted from chloramine disinfection to chlorine to inactivate N. fowleri and reduced biofilm in the distribution systems. Once >1.0 mg/L free chlorine residual was attained in all systems for 60 days, water testing was performed; N. fowleri was not detected in water samples after the chlorine conversion. This investigation highlights the importance of maintaining adequate residual disinfectant levels in drinking water distribution systems. Water distribution system managers should be knowledgeable about the ecology of their systems, understand potential water quality changes when water temperatures increase, and work to eliminate areas in which biofilm growth may be problematic and affect water quality.","authors":[{"name":"Jennifer R Cope"},{"name":"Amy M Kahler"},{"name":"Jake Causey"},{"name":"John G Williams"},{"name":"Jennifer Kihlken"},{"name":"Caryn Benjamin"},{"name":"Amanda P Ames"},{"name":"Johan Forsman"},{"name":"Yuanda Zhu"},{"name":"Jonathan S Yoder"},{"name":"Chad J Seidel"},{"name":"Vincent R Hill"}],"keywords":[]},"article48":{"pmid":"31637837","title":"Unravelling interspecies interactions across heterogeneities in complex biofilm communities.","date":"2020-01-02","abs":"The importance of microbial biofilms has been well-recognized for several decades, and focus is now shifting towards investigating multispecies biofilm communities rather than mono- or dual-species biofilms.

Due to the complexity of the matrix, few information is present in the literature on details of its architecture including the spatial distribution of the macromolecular components which might give hints on the way the biofilm scaffold is built up by bacteria. In this study, we investigated the possibility to combine well-established microbiological procedures with advanced microscopies to get information on composition and distribution of the macromolecular components of biofilm matrices. To this, confocal microscopy, diffraction-limited infrared (IR) spectral imaging, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to explore biofilm produced by a clinical strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. IR imaging permitted to have clues on how the biofilm grows and spreads on surfaces, and the local distribution of the components within it. Through the analysis of the pure component spectra, it was possible to assess the chemical and structural composition of the saccaridic matrix, confirming the data obtained by NMR. It was also possible to follow the time course of biofilm from 6 up to 48 h when the biofilm grew into a 3-dimensional multi-layered structure, characteristic of colonies of bacteria linked together by a complex matrix.

Amyloid fibers gained their fame mostly due to their relation with neurodegenerative diseases in humans. However, secreted by lower organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, amyloid fibers play a functional role: for example, when they serve as cement in the extracellular matrix of biofilms. Originating either in humans or in microorganisms, the sequence of amyloid proteins is decorated with hexapeptides with high propensity to form fibers, known as steric zippers. We have found that steric zippers form globular structures on route to making fibers and exhibit a characteristic force-distance (F-D) fingerprint when pulled with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. Particularly, the F-D pulling curves showed force plateau steps, suggesting that the globular structures were composed of chains that were unwound like a yarn ball. Force plateau analysis showed that the F-D characteristic parameters were sequence sensitive, representing differences in the packing of the hexapeptides within the globules. These unprecedented findings show that steric zippers exhibit a characteristic nanomechanical signature in solution in addition to previously observed characteristic crystallographic structure.

These mutations were coanalyzed for the presence of stress survival islet 1 (SSI-1) and for the abilities of the isolates to invade Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and form biofilms on polystyrene. PMSC mutations were present in one-third of the isolates (predominantly those of serogroup 1/2a), and their presence was correlated with a noninvasive phenotype. The presence of SSI-1 and the ability to form biofilms were also linked to the 1/2a serogroup. Serogroup 4b isolates lacked inlA PMSC mutations and were invasive, but neither formed biofilms nor carried SSI-1. To expand upon these experimental findings, an in silico analysis was performed on L. monocytogenes genomes from Canadian databases of 278 food isolates and 607 clinical isolates. The prevalence of inlA PMSC mutations in genomes of food isolates was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than that in clinical isolates. Also, a three-codon deletion in inlA associated with a hyperinvasive phenotype was more prevalent in genomes from clinical isolates (primarily of clonal complex 6, serogroup 4b) than in those from food isolates (P < 0.001). In contrast, SSI-1 was significantly overrepresented (P < 0.001) in genomes from food isolates.

Dental caries remains the most common chronic disease worldwide, accompanied by a tremendous financial and social burden, despite widespread and efficacious fluoride and hygienic regimens. Over the past several decades, various precision approaches to combat dental caries, including vaccines, probiotics, and antimicrobial compounds, have been pursued. Despite the distinct overall conceptual strengths of each approach, for various reasons, there are currently no approved precision antibiotic therapeutics to prevent dental caries. Specifically targeted antimicrobial peptides (STAMPs) are synthetic molecules that combine the antibiotic moiety of a traditional antimicrobial peptide with a targeting domain to provide specificity against a particular organism. Conjoining the killing domain from the antimicrobial, novispirin G10, and a targeting domain derived from the Streptococcus mutans pheromone, CSP, the STAMP C16G2 was designed to provide targeted killing of S. mutans, widely considered the keystone species in dental caries pathogenesis. C16G2 was able to selectively eliminate S. mutans from complex ecosystems while leaving closely related, yet health-associated, oral species unharmed. This remodeling of the dental plaque community is expected to have significant advantages compared to conventional broad-spectrum mouthwashes, as the intact, surviving community is apt to prevent reinfection by pathogens. Following successful phase I clinical trials that evaluated the safety and basic microbiology of C16G2 treatments, the phase II trials of several C16G2 formulations are currently in progress.

Based on headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, esters accounted for the largest percentage of the VOCs produced by RS-25, MG-4, Z-14, and Pnf-4 (36.80%, 29.58%, 30.78%, and 36.26%, respectively). All the strains showed potent cellulase and protease activities, but no chitinase activity. RS-25, Z-14, and MG-4, but not Pnf-4, grew on chrome azurol S agar, and an orange halo was formed around the colonies. All the strains showed biofilm formation, fruit colonization, and lipopeptide production, which may be the main modes of action of the antagonists against B. cinerea on the fruit.

Antibiotic treatment of Shigella infections plays an essential role in reducing prevalence and death rates of the disease. However, treatment of these infections remains a challenge, due to the global rise in broad-spectrum resistance to many antibiotics. Drug resistance in Shigella spp. can result from many mechanisms, such as decrease in cellular permeability, extrusion of drugs by active efflux pumps, and overexpression of drug-modifying and -inactivating enzymes or target modification by mutation. Therefore, there is an increasing need for identification and evolution of alternative therapeutic strategies presenting innovative avenues against Shigella infections, as well as paying further attention to this infection.

Traditional antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement are difficult to determine whether the infected focus have been removed completely and whether the infection will recur.

Examples of such surfaces include rose petals, which possess hierarchical structures like the micropapillae measuring tens of microns and nanofolds that range in the size of 700 ± 100 nm. We duplicated the natural structures on rose petal surfaces via a simple UV-curable nanocasting technique and tested the efficacy of these artificial surfaces in preventing biofilm growth using clinically relevant bacteria strains. The rose petal-structured surfaces exhibited hydrophobicity (contact angle (CA) ≈ 130.8° ± 4.3°) and high CA hysteresis (∼91.0° ± 4.9°). Water droplets on rose petal replicas evaporated following the constant contact line mode, indicating the likely coexistence of both Cassie and Wenzel states (Cassie-Baxter impregnating the wetting state). Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis revealed the significantly lower attachment of Staphylococcus epidermidis (86.1 ± 6.2% less) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85.9 ± 3.2% less) on the rose petal-structured surfaces, compared with flat surfaces over a period of 2 h. An extensive biofilm matrix was observed in biofilms formed by both species on flat surfaces after prolonged growth (several days), but was less apparent on rose petal-biomimetic surfaces. In addition, the biomass of S. epidermidis (63.2 ± 9.4% less) and P. aeruginosa (76.0 ± 10.0% less) biofilms were significantly reduced on the rose petal-structured surfaces, in comparison to the flat surfaces. By comparing P. aeruginosa growth on representative unitary nanopillars, we demonstrated that hierarchical structures are more effective in delaying biofilm growth. The mechanisms are two-fold: (1) the nanofolds across the hemispherical micropapillae restrict initial attachment of bacterial cells and delay the direct contact of cells via cell alignment and (2) the hemispherical micropapillae arrays isolate bacterial clusters and inhibit the formation of a fibrous network. The hierarchical features on rose petal surfaces may be useful for developing strategies to control biofilm formation in medical and industrial contexts.","authors":[{"name":"Yunyi Cao"},{"name":"Saikat Jana"},{"name":"Leon Bowen"},{"name":"Xiaolong Tan"},{"name":"Hongzhong Liu"},{"name":"Nadia Rostami"},{"name":"James Brown"},{"name":"Nicholas S Jakubovics"},{"name":"Jinju Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article80":{"pmid":"31630018","title":"Constructing zwitterionic polymer brush layer to enhance gravity-driven membrane performance by governing biofilm formation.","date":"2019-11-06","abs":"In this study, zwitterionic polymer brushes with controlled architecture were grafted on the surface of gravity-driven membrane (GDM) via surface-initiated reaction to impart antifouling property.

Early implant-related infections often occur in the first 4 weeks post-operation. Inhibiting bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation at the early stage and promoting subsequent implant osseointegration are important for implant success. Our previous studies demonstrated that dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM) provided dental materials with antibacterial effects. In the present study, DMADDM and hydroxyapatite (HA) are loaded on to the titanium (Ti) surface via poly dopamine (PDA) self-polymerization. This local DMADDM-delivery Ti is referred as Ti-PHD. Here we report the two-staged capability of Ti-PHD: (1) in the first stage, releasing DMADDM during the high-infection-risk initial period post-implantation for 4 weeks; (2) then in the second stage, enhancing osteogenesis and promoting osseointegration. Ti-PHD has a porous surface with higher average roughness and greater hydrophilicity than pure Ti. Its biocompatibility is verified in vitro and in vivo. During the first 4 weeks of release, both DMADDM remaining on Ti surface and DMADDM released into the soaking medium greatly reduced the adherence and growth of pathogens. This is further confirmed by the prevention of bone destruction in a rat osteomyelitis model. After releasing DMADDM for 4 weeks, Ti-PHD promotes osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and new bone formation around the implants in vivo. This article represents the first report on the two-staged, time-dependent antibacterial and osteogenesis effects of Ti-PHD, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications to inhibit implant-associated infections.

Auto-aggregation was negatively affected in the ∆cpxR mutant, whereas the same mutant significantly out-performed its wild-type counterpart with respect to swarming motility, indicating that the CpxR plays a role in biofilm-associated phenotypes. Indeed, biofilm-related assays showed that the CpxR is of critical importance in biofilm development under both static (microtiter plate) and dynamic (flow cell) media flow conditions. In contrast, the RpoE sigma factor showed no significant role in biofilm development under dynamic conditions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the cpxR mutation negatively affected the constitutive expression of the operons critical for biosynthesis of O-antigen and adherence, but positively affected the expression of virulence genes critical for Salmonella-mediated endocytosis. Conversely, CpxR induced the expression of curli csgAB and fimbrial stdAC operons only during biofilm development and flagellar motAB and fliL operons exclusively during the planktonic phase, indicating a responsive biofilm-associated loop of the CpxR regulator.","authors":[{"name":"Deeksha Shetty"},{"name":"Juan E Abrahante"},{"name":"Samuel M Chekabab"},{"name":"Xuxiaochen Wu"},{"name":"Darren R Korber"},{"name":"Sinisa Vidovic"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CpxR"},{"word":"Salmonella Enteritidis"},{"word":"Salmonella pathogenicity island"},{"word":"biofilm development"},{"word":"extracytoplasmic stress response"}]},"article92":{"pmid":"31626631","title":"PilT and PilU are homohexameric ATPases that coordinate to retract type IVa pili.","date":"2020-02-14","abs":"Bacterial type IV pili are critical for diverse biological processes including horizontal gene transfer, surface sensing, biofilm formation, adherence, motility, and virulence. These dynamic appendages extend and retract from the cell surface. In many type IVa pilus systems, extension occurs through the action of an extension ATPase, often called PilB, while optimal retraction requires the action of a retraction ATPase, PilT. Many type IVa systems also encode a homolog of PilT called PilU. However, the function of this protein has remained unclear because pilU mutants exhibit inconsistent phenotypes among type IV pilus systems and because it is relatively understudied compared to PilT. Here, we study the type IVa competence pilus of Vibrio cholerae as a model system to define the role of PilU. We show that the ATPase activity of PilU is critical for pilus retraction in PilT Walker A and/or Walker B mutants. PilU does not, however, contribute to pilus retraction in ΔpilT strains. Thus, these data suggest that PilU is a bona fide retraction ATPase that supports pilus retraction in a PilT-dependent manner. We also found that a ΔpilU mutant exhibited a reduction in the force of retraction suggesting that PilU is important for generating maximal retraction forces. Additional in vitro and in vivo data show that PilT and PilU act as independent homo-hexamers that may form a complex to facilitate pilus retraction. Finally, we demonstrate that the role of PilU as a PilT-dependent retraction ATPase is conserved in Acinetobacter baylyi, suggesting that the role of PilU described here may be broadly applicable to other type IVa pilus systems.","authors":[{"name":"Jennifer L Chlebek"},{"name":"Hannah Q Hughes"},{"name":"Aleksandra S Ratkiewicz"},{"name":"Rasman Rayyan"},{"name":"Joseph Che-Yen Wang"},{"name":"Brittany E Herrin"},{"name":"Triana N Dalia"},{"name":"Nicolas Biais"},{"name":"Ankur B Dalia"}],"keywords":[]},"article93":{"pmid":"31626589","title":"Pangenome of Acinetobacter baumannii uncovers two groups of genomes, one of them with genes involved in CRISPR/Cas defence systems associated with the absence of plasmids and exclusive genes for biofilm formation.","date":"2020-02-21","abs":"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic bacterium that causes hospital-acquired infections with a high mortality and morbidity, since there are strains resistant to virtually any kind of antibiotic.

One of these groups rarely has plasmids, and bears clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) sequences, in addition to CRISPR-associated genes (cas genes) or restriction-modification system genes. This fact strongly supports the lack of plasmids. Furthermore, the scarce plasmids in this group also bear CRISPR sequences, and specifically contain genes involved in prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin systems that could either act as the still little known CRISPR type IV system or be the precursors of other novel CRISPR/Cas systems. In addition, a limited set of strains present a new cas9-like gene, which may complement the other cas genes in inhibiting the entrance of new plasmids into the bacteria.

To model the forces being exerted by nanovibrational stimulation, laser interferometry was performed to measure the amplitudes produced across the Petri dish surfaces.

Some bacteria produce antibiotics in biofilms; however, since the diffusion of antibiotics is generally hindered in biofilms by extracellular polymeric substances, i.e., the biofilm matrix, their function remains unclear. The Bacillus subtilis yitPOM operon is a paralog of the sdpABC operon, which produces the secreted peptide toxin SDP. Unlike sdpABC, yitPOM is induced in biofilms by the DegS-DegU two-component regulatory system. High yitPOM expression leads to the production of a secreted toxin called YIT. Expression of yitQ, which lies upstream of yitPOM, confers resistance to the YIT toxin, suggesting that YitQ is an anti-toxin protein for the YIT toxin. The alternative sigma factor SigW also contributes to YIT toxin resistance. In a mutant lacking yitQ and sigW, the YIT toxin specifically inhibits biofilm formation, and the extracellular neutral protease NprB is required for this inhibition. The requirement for NprB is eliminated by Δeps and ΔbslA mutations, either of which impairs production of biofilm matrix polymers. Overexpression of biofilm matrix polymers prevents the action of the SDP toxin but not the YIT toxin. These results indicate that, unlike the SDP toxin and many conventional antibiotics, the YIT toxin can pass through layers of biofilm matrix polymers to attack cells within biofilms with assistance from NprB. When the wild-type strain and the YIT-sensitive mutant were grown together on a solid medium, the wild-type strain formed biofilms that excluded the YIT-sensitive mutant. This observation suggests that the YIT toxin protects B. subtilis biofilms against competitors. Several bacteria are known to produce antibiotics in biofilms. We propose that some bacteria including B. subtilis may have evolved specialized antibiotics that can function within biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Kazuo Kobayashi"},{"name":"Yukako Ikemoto"}],"keywords":[]},"article112":{"pmid":"31622303","title":"The antibiofilm activity of Acetylsalicylic acid, Mefenamic acid, Acetaminophen against biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"To evaluate the antibacterial activity of Aspirin, Mefenamic acid and Acetaminophen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Syed Hani Abidi"},{"name":"Khalid Ahmed"},{"name":"Shahana Urooj Kazmi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiofilm activity, Aspirin, Mefenamic acid, Acetaminophen, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis biofilms.

Thus, the development of antibacterial materials that integrate bactericidal and antifouling properties is a promising approach to prevent biomaterial-associated infections. In this study, two types of dopamine-modified polymers, dopamine-terminated quaternary ammonium salt polymer (D-PQAs) with various lengths of N-alkyl chain (D-PQA4C, D-PQA8C, and D-PQA12C) and dopamine-terminated poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (D-PSBMA), were synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Mixed polymer brushes of D-PQAs and D-PSBMA with various ratios were well-integrated onto the surface of a silicon wafer via a facile mussel-inspired adhesion. We demonstrate that the synergistic antibacterial effect depends on both the ratio of the two components and the surface structures of the mixed polymer brushes, originating from the interactions between D-PQAs and D-PSBMA. The N-alkyl chain length of D-PQAs influenced the distribution and orientation of the alkyl chain on the mixed polymer brushes. A chart of the antibacterial efficiency of the mixed polymer brushes was obtained to reveal the synergistic role of their cationic and zwitterionic chains to resist S. aureus.

The biodiversity was characterized by metabarcoding using two universal barcode markers (16S and 18S) along with two algal specific markers (UPA and rbcL) and high-throughput amplicon sequencing. For each marker, the ordination of Bray-Curtis Index calculated from the total Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) present in each stream showed the Unimpaired and Recovered streams clustered, while Moderately Impaired streams were more distant. Focusing on the algal ASVs, the Shannon index for the rbcL, and UPA markers showed significantly lower alpha diversity in Moderately Impaired streams compared to Unimpaired streams, but the Recovered streams were not significantly different from the other two stream categories. The two universal markers together captured all algal phyla providing an outline of the diversity, but the two algal specific markers produced a greater number of ASVs and taxonomic depth for algal taxa. Further examination of the UPA marker revealed a drastic decrease in relative abundance of diatoms in Moderately Impaired streams compared to Recovered and Unimpaired streams.

Additionally, biofilm formation of S. gordonii with C. albicans knock-out mutants of 45 transcription factors that affect cell wall integrity, filamentous growth and biofilm formation was determined. Furthermore, these mutants were also screened for antibiotic tolerance in mixed biofilms with S. gordonii.

Here, we report exploitation of the probiotic properties of two novel, food-derived yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain KTP) and Issatchenkia occidentalis (strain ApC), as an alternative approach to combat widespread opportunistic fungal infections. Both yeasts inhibit virulence traits such as adhesion, filamentation, and biofilm formation of several non-albicans Candida species, including Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis as well as the recently identified multidrug-resistant species Candida auris They inhibit adhesion to abiotic surfaces as well as cultured colon epithelial cells. Furthermore, probiotic treatment blocks the formation of biofilms of individual non-albicans Candida strains as well as mixed-culture biofilms of each non-albicans Candida strain in combination with Candida albicans The probiotic yeasts attenuated non-albicans Candida infections in a live animal. In vivo studies using Caenorhabditis elegans suggest that exposure to probiotic yeasts protects nematodes from infection with non-albicans Candida strains compared to worms that were not exposed to the probiotic yeasts. Furthermore, application of probiotic yeasts postinfection with non-albicans Candida alleviated pathogenic colonization of the nematode gut. The probiotic properties of these novel yeasts are better than or comparable to those of the commercially available probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, which was used as a reference strain throughout this study. These results indicate that yeasts derived from food sources could serve as an effective alternative to antifungal therapy against emerging pathogenic Candida species.","authors":[{"name":"Lohith Kunyeit"},{"name":"Nawneet K Kurrey"},{"name":"K A Anu-Appaiah"},{"name":"Reeta P Rao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Caco-2 cell monolayer"},{"word":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Candida auris"},{"word":"Candida glabrata"},{"word":"Candida krusei"},{"word":"Candida parapsilosis"},{"word":"Candida tropicalis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"mixed-species Candida biofilm"},{"word":"plastic adhesion assay"},{"word":"probiotic yeasts"}]},"article139":{"pmid":"31615958","title":"Bacterial Longevity Requires Protein Synthesis and a Stringent Response.","date":"2020-02-05","abs":"Gram-negative bacteria in infections, biofilms, and industrial settings often stop growing due to nutrient depletion, immune responses, or environmental stresses.

Here, we show that protein synthesis, specific proteins involved in translation, and a stringent response are required for this remarkable longevity. Because it can generate ATP from light during growth arrest, R. palustris is an extreme example of a bacterial species that will stay alive for long periods of time as a relatively homogeneous population of cells and it is thus an excellent model organism for studies of bacterial longevity. There is evidence that other Gram-negative species also continue to synthesize proteins during growth arrest and that a stringent response is required for their longevity as well. Our observations challenge the notion that growth-arrested cells are necessarily dormant and metabolically inactive and suggest that such bacteria may have a level of metabolic activity that is higher than many would have assumed.

Since microbes are difficult to observe directly, sociality in natural populations can instead be investigated using evolutionary genetic signatures, as social loci can be evolutionary hotspots. The budding yeast has been studied for over a century, yet little is known about its social behaviour in nature. Flo11 is a highly regulated cell adhesin required for most laboratory social phenotypes; studies suggest it may function in cell recognition and its heterogeneous expression may be adaptive for collectives such as biofilms. We investigated this locus and found positive selection in the areas implicated in cell-cell interaction, suggesting selection for kin discrimination. We also found balancing selection at an upstream activation site, suggesting selection on the level of variegated gene expression.

The cellular pool of DolP is derived from de novo synthesis in the dolichol branch of the mevalonate pathway and from recycling of DolPP after each cycle of N-glycosylation, when the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid carrier to the protein and DolPP is released and then dephosphorylated. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the dephosphorylation of DolPP is known to be catalyzed by the Cwh8p protein. To establish the role of the Cwh8p orthologue in another distantly related yeast species, Candida albicans, we studied its mutant devoid of the CaCWH8 gene. A double Cacwh8∆/Cacwh8∆ strain was constructed by the URA-blaster method. As in S. cerevisiae, the mutant was impaired in DolPP recycling. This defect, however, was accompanied by an elevation of cis-prenyltransferase activity and higher de novo production of dolichols. Despite these compensatory changes, protein glycosylation, cell wall integrity, filamentous growth, and biofilm formation were impaired in the mutant. These results suggest that the defects are not due to the lack of DolP for the protein N-glycosylation but rather that the activity of oligosacharyltransferase could be inhibited by the excess DolPP accumulating in the mutant.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Janik"},{"name":"Monika Niewiadomska"},{"name":"Urszula Perlińska-Lenart"},{"name":"Jacek Lenart"},{"name":"Damian Kołakowski"},{"name":"Karolina Skorupińska-Tudek"},{"name":"Ewa Swiezewska"},{"name":"Joanna S Kruszewska"},{"name":"Grażyna Palamarczyk"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. albicans"},{"word":"Cwh8p"},{"word":"Rer2p"},{"word":"cell wall integrity"},{"word":"dolichol"},{"word":"morphogenesis"}]},"article143":{"pmid":"31614693","title":"A Diverse Repertoire of Exopolysaccharide Biosynthesis Gene Clusters in Lactobacillus Revealed by Comparative Analysis in 106 Sequenced Genomes.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) is one of the unique features of Lactobacillus genus.

The objective of this study was to see if we could find B. burgdorferi in a Lyme disease patient after a long clinical course and after long-term antibiotic treatment. Therefore, we investigated the potential presence of B. burgdorferi antigens and DNA in human autopsy tissues from a well-documented serum-, PCR-, and culture-positive Lyme disease patient, a 53-year-old female from northern Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley Region of New York State, who had received extensive antibiotic treatments during extensive antibiotic treatments over the course of her 16-year-long illness. We also asked what form the organism might take, with special interest in the recently found antibiotic-resistant aggregate form, biofilm. We also examined the host tissues for the presence of inflammatory markers such as CD3+ T lymphocytes. Autopsy tissue sections of the brain, heart, kidney, and liver were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical methods (IHC), confocal microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/metagenomics. We found significant pathological changes, including borrelial spirochetal clusters, in all of the organs using IHC combined with confocal microscopy. The aggregates contained a well-established biofilm marker, alginate, on their surfaces, suggesting they are true biofilm. We found B. burgdorferi DNA by FISH, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an independent verification by WGS/metagenomics, which resulted in the detection of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto specific DNA sequences. IHC analyses showed significant numbers of infiltrating CD3+ T lymphocytes present next to B. burgdorferi biofilms. In summary, we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that B. burgdorferi can persist in the human body, not only in the spirochetal but also in the antibiotic-resistant biofilm form, even after long-term antibiotic treatment. The presence of infiltrating lymphocytes in the vicinity of B. burgdorferi biofilms suggests that the organism in biofilm form might trigger chronic inflammation.","authors":[{"name":"Eva Sapi"},{"name":"Rumanah S Kasliwala"},{"name":"Hebo Ismail"},{"name":"Jason P Torres"},{"name":"Michael Oldakowski"},{"name":"Sarah Markland"},{"name":"Gauri Gaur"},{"name":"Anthony Melillo"},{"name":"Klaus Eisendle"},{"name":"Kenneth B Liegner"},{"name":"Jenny Libien"},{"name":"James E Goldman"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Borrelia burgdorferi"},{"word":"Lyme disease"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"persisters"},{"word":"spirochete"}]},"article145":{"pmid":"31614449","title":"Phage-Antibiotic Combination Treatments: Antagonistic Impacts of Antibiotics on the Pharmacodynamics of Phage Therapy?","date":"2020-01-28","abs":"Bacteria can evolve resistance to antibiotics.

Antibiotics nevertheless remain the standard of care for bacterial infections, and rightly so given their long track records of both antibacterial efficacy and infrequency of severe side effects.

Ideally phages could be used in combination with standard antibiotics while retaining their anti-bacterial pharmacodynamic activity, this despite antibiotics interfering with aspects of bacterial metabolism that are also required for full phage infection activity.

AIPs are also produced by coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) commonly found as commensals in both humans and animals, and interestingly, some of these inhibit S. aureus agr activity.

The exposure to bacterial biofilm triggers host inflammatory response whose dysregulation is ultimately responsible for the destruction of hard and soft periodontal tissues resulting in tooth loss. To date, significant effort has been invested in the research of the involvement of host cells and inflammatory mediators in regulation of inflammatory response in periodontitis. Syndecans (Sdcs) belong to a four-member family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Sdcs are compound molecules comprised of the core protein to which several heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached. The role of Sdcs in pathogenesis of periodontitis is poorly investigated despite the numerous reports from experimental studies about the critical involvement of these factors in modulation of various aspects of inflammatory response, such as the formation of inflammatory mediators gradients, leukocyte recruitment and extracellular matrix remodeling in resolution of inflammation. Most of these functions of Sdcs are HS-related and, thus, dependent upon the structure of HS. This, in turn, is determined by the combinatorial action of enzymes for biosynthesis and modification of HS such as exostosis (EXTs), sulfotransferases (NDSTs), and heparanase 1 (HPSE1). The data presented in this study clearly indicate that some Sdcs display different expression profiles in healthy and diseased periodontal tissue. Additionally, the differences in expression profiles of HS GAG biosynthesis and modification enzymes (EXTs, NDSTs, and HPSE1) in healthy and diseased periodontal tissue imply that changes in HS GAG content and structure might also take place during periodontitis.

Variants in A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin (ltx) were created, labeled, inoculated, and compared with their progenitor strain for in vivo colonization. Samples of tooth-related plaque were assessed for colonization at baseline and after debridement and inoculation of labeled strains. Null, minimal, and hyper-Ltx-producing strains were created and assessed for hydroxyapatite binding and biofilm formation in vitro. Ltx-hyperproducing strains colonized with greater prevalence and at higher levels than wild type or ltx mutants (P = 0.05). Indigenous and inoculated A. actinomycetemcomitans strains that attached were associated with lactate-producing species (i.e., Leptotrichia, Abiotrophia, and Streptoccocci). A. actinomycetemcomitans was found at 0.13% of the total flora at baseline and at 0.05% 4 wk after inoculation. In vivo data were supported by in vitro results.

Increased attachment can be linked to ltx gene expression and up-regulation of adherence-associated genes.

Five unique C. difficile strains embedded in three different biofilm types grown for 72 or 120 h were exposed to seven different hospital disinfectants. C. difficile abundance [as log(number of CFU/milliliter)] was calculated after manufacturer-determined contact times along with biofilm biomass and microscopy.

C. difficile vegetative cells and spores were recovered from biofilms regardless of the type of biofilm growth or biofilm growth time. No disinfectant was able to completely eliminate C. difficile from the biofilms. Overall, Clorox, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), and Virex were most effective at killing C. difficile spores regardless of biofilm age, ribotype, or wash conditions (whether biofilms are washed or unwashed) (P = 0.001, each). Clorox and OPA were also effective at killing total vegetative cell growth (P = 0.001, each), but Virex was found to be ineffective against vegetative cell growth in biofilms (P = 0.77).

In this study, we studied the acute effects (3 h of exposure) of polystyrene beads (PS, with diameter range from 100 nm to 9 μm) on five biological endpoints targeting community and ecosystem-level processes in biofilms: chlorophyll a, photosynthetic yield, and three extracellular enzyme activities. The results showed that the large size PS beads (500 nm, 1 μm, and 9 μm) exhibited negligible effects on the determined biological endpoints in biofilms within the range of concentrations (5-100 mg/L) in this study. However, high concentration of PS beads (100 nm, 100 mg/L) significantly decreased the content of chlorophyll a, and the functional enzyme activities of β-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase, suggesting negative effects on the carbon and nitrogen cycling of freshwater biofilms. Moreover, the influences of PS NPs (100 nm) on biofilms strongly depended on the surface modification of PS particles, with the positively charged PS NPs (amide-modified) exhibiting the highest toxicity to biofilms. The excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this study indicated oxidative stress induced by PS NPs, which might lead to the observed nano-toxic effects on biofilms.

In order to sense these changes in population density, bacteria produce, secrete and detect small molecules called autoinducers.

This resilience is partially due to a subpopulation of cells that can survive such stresses and regenerate the community. Microfluidic approaches now provide a means to study microbial physiology and bacterial heterogeneity at the single cell level, improving our ability to isolate and examine these subpopulations. Drop-based microfluidics provides a high-throughput approach to study individual cell physiology within bacterial populations. Using this approach, single cells are isolated from the population and encapsulated in growth medium dispersed in oil using a 15 μm diameter drop making microfluidic device. The drops are arranged as a packed monolayer inside a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device. Growth of thousands of individual cells in identical microenvironments can then be imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). A challenge for this approach has been the maintenance of drop stability during extended time-lapse imaging. In particular, the drops do not maintain their volume over time during incubation in PDMS devices, due to fluid transport into the porous PDMS surroundings. Here, we present a strategy for PDMS device preparation that stabilizes drop position and volume within a drop array on a microfluidic chip for over 20 h. The stability of water-in-oil drops is maintained by soaking the device in a reservoir containing both water and oil in thermodynamic equilibrium. This ensures that phase equilibrium of the drop emulsion fluids within the porous PDMS material is maintained during drop incubation and imaging. We demonstrate the utility of this approach, which we label DropSOAC (Drop Stabilization On A Chip), for time-lapse studies of bacterial growth. We characterize growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its Δhpf mutant derivative during resuscitation and growth following starvation. We demonstrate that growth rate and lag time heterogeneity of hundreds of individual bacterial cells can be determined starting from single isolated cells.

Until recently, electrically conductive pili (e-pili), assembled from the PilA pilin monomer, were the only known Geobacter protein nanowires. However, filaments comprised of the multi-heme c-type cytochrome, OmcS, are present in some preparations of G. sulfurreducens outer-surface proteins. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the available evidence on the in vivo expression of e-pili and OmcS filaments and their biological function. Abundant literature demonstrates that G. sulfurreducens expresses e-pili, which are required for long-range electron transport to Fe (III) oxides and through conductive biofilms. In contrast, there is no definitive evidence yet that wild-type G. sulfurreducens express long filaments of OmcS extending from the cells, and deleting the gene for OmcS actually increases biofilm conductivity. The literature does not support the concern that many previous studies on e-pili were mistakenly studying OmcS filaments. For example, heterologous expression of the aromatic-rich pilin monomer of Geobacter metallireducens in G. sulfurreducens increases the conductivity of individual nanowires more than 5,000-fold, whereas expression of an aromatic-poor pilin reduced conductivity more than 1,000-fold. This more than million-fold range in nanowire conductivity was achieved while maintaining the 3-nm diameter characteristic of e-pili. Purification methods that eliminate all traces of OmcS yield highly conductive e-pili, as does heterologous expression of the e-pilin monomer in microbes that do not produce OmcS or any other outer-surface cytochromes. Future studies of G. sulfurreducens expression of protein nanowires need to be cognizant of the importance of maintaining environmentally relevant growth conditions because artificial laboratory culture conditions can rapidly select against e-pili expression. Principles derived from the study of e-pili have enabled identification of non-cytochrome protein nanowires in diverse bacteria and archaea. A similar search for cytochrome appendages is warranted. Both e-pili and OmcS filaments offer design options for the synthesis of protein-based green electronics, which may be the primary driving force for the study of these structures in the near future.","authors":[{"name":"Derek R Lovley"},{"name":"David J F Walker"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biomaterials"},{"word":"cytochrome"},{"word":"electromicrobiology"},{"word":"electron transfer"},{"word":"pili"}]},"article178":{"pmid":"31608016","title":"Shear Stress as a Major Driver of Marine Biofilm Communities in the NW Mediterranean Sea.","date":"2019-10-23","abs":"While marine biofilms depend on environmental conditions and substrate, little is known about the influence of hydrodynamic forces.

Cell density increased with time, greatly limited by hydrodynamic forces, and supposed to delay biofilm maturation. After 1 year, a significant impact of shear stress on the taxonomic structure of the prokaryotic community developed on each surface type was observed. When surfaces contained no biocides, roughness and wettability shaped prokaryotic community structure, which was not enhanced by shear stress. Conversely, the biocidal effect of SPC surfaces, already major in static immersion mode, was amplified by the 15 knots speed. The biofilm community on SPC was 60% dissimilar to the biofilm on the other surfaces and was distinctly colonized by Sphingomonadaceae ((Alter)Erythrobacter). At Banyuls, prokaryotic community structures were more similar between the four surfaces tested than at Toulon, due possibly to a masking effect of environmental constraints, especially hydrodynamic, which was greater than in Toulon. Finally, predicted functions such as cell adhesion confirmed some of the hypotheses drawn regarding biofilm formation over the artificial surfaces tested here.","authors":[{"name":"Elisa C P Catão"},{"name":"Thomas Pollet"},{"name":"Benjamin Misson"},{"name":"Cédric Garnier"},{"name":"Jean-Francois Ghiglione"},{"name":"Raphaëlle Barry-Martinet"},{"name":"Marine Maintenay"},{"name":"Christine Bressy"},{"name":"Jean-François Briand"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Sphingomonadaceae"},{"word":"artificial surface"},{"word":"hydrodynamic"},{"word":"marine microbiome"},{"word":"multi-species biofilm"}]},"article179":{"pmid":"31607727","title":"Antibacterial activity of Salvadora persica against oral pathogenic bacterial isolates.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"The objective was to determine the antibacterial activity of Salvadora persica extract against bacteria isolated from dental plaque of patients.","authors":[{"name":"M A Khalil"},{"name":"M S El-Sabbagh"},{"name":"E B El Naggar"},{"name":"R H El-Erian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial activity"},{"word":"Salvadora persica"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Streptococcus spp"},{"word":"gas chromatography-mass spectrometry"},{"word":"high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry"},{"word":"plaque-induced gingivitis"}]},"article180":{"pmid":"31607578","title":"Uranium bioremediation by acid phosphatase activity of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms: Can a foe turn a friend?","date":"2020-03-03","abs":"In this study, Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, which are considered a foe for being pathogenic, were tested for their uranium bioremediation capacity to find out if they can turn out to be a friend.

Thus, the prevention and inhibition of Salmonella enteritidis infection are of great concern. Lactic acid bacteria have anti-pathogenic activity; however, their underlying mechanisms and modes of action have not yet been clarified. In this study, the antibacterial mechanism of Lactobacillus reuteri S5 (L. reuteri S5) against Salmonella enteritidis ATCC13076 (S. enteritidis ATCC13076) was studied by different methods. We found that L. reuteri S5 was able to form a stable biofilm formation, colonizing the entire intestinal tract of chickens. In addition, bacterial cultures and the cell-free supernatant (CFS) of L. reuteri S5 inhibited SE ATCC13076 growth, and this growth inhibition was also observed in the co-culture assay. This effect may be predominantly caused by antimicrobial metabolites produced by L. reuteri S5. Furthermore, treatment with the CFS of L. reuteri S5 resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of Salmonella virulence, motility and adhesion genes and a significant reduction in the motility ability and inhibitory effect on biofilm formation. In addition, the damage to the membrane structure and intracellular structure induced by the CFS of L. reuteri S5 could be observed on Transmission electron microscopy images and dodecyl sulfate, sodium salt (SDS)-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the disruptive action of the CFS of L. reuteri S5 on the cytoplasmic membrane. Our findings demonstrate that L. reuteri S5, an intestinal Lactobacillus species associated with chicken health, is able to form biofilm and stably colonize chicken intestines. It also possesses anti-SE activity, preventing SE growth, inhibits the expression of SE genes involved in adhesion and invasion, virulence and cell membrane integrity, inhibits SE biofilm formation and motility, damages or destroys bacterial structures, and inhibits intracellular protein synthesis. L. reuteri S5 therefore has potential applications as a probiotic agent.","authors":[{"name":"Shuiqin Shi"},{"name":"Zhao Qi"},{"name":"Tingting Sheng"},{"name":"Jian Tu"},{"name":"Yin Shao"},{"name":"Kezong Qi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial mechanism"},{"word":"Biofilms formation"},{"word":"Intestinal colonization"},{"word":"Lactobacillus reuteri S5"},{"word":"Salmonella enteritidis ATCC13076"}]},"article195":{"pmid":"31603505","title":"Cationic amphiphiles against Gardnerella vaginalis resistant strains and bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens.","date":"2020-03-22","abs":"Antibiotic resistance and infection recurrence are critical issues in treating bacterial vaginosis, the most common vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age.

While fluconazole alone exhibits a low efficiency against the stationary phase and biofilm cells of C. albicans, complete eradication corresponding to 7-log killing is achieved when the antifungal drug is provided subsequently to the electrochemical treatment. Further mechanistic analyses have revealed that the sequential treatment shows a complex multimodal action, including the disruption of cell wall integrity and permeability, impaired metabolic functions, and enhanced susceptibility to fluconazole, while altering the biofilm structure.

Bacterial twitching is important for initial bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. The existing research about bacteria twitching is largely experimental orientated. There is a lack of models of twitching motility of bacteria in shear flows, which could provide fundamental understanding about how bacterial twitching would be affected by bacteria associated properties such as number of pili and their distribution on the cell body and environmental factors such as flow and surface patterns. In this work, a three-dimensional modelling approach of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) coupled with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) proposed to study bacterial twitching on flat and groove surfaces under shear flow conditions. Rod-shaped bacteria are modelled as groups of spherical particles and Type IV pili attached to bacteria are modelled as dynamic springs which can elongate, retract, attach and detach. The CFD-DEM model of rod-shape bacteria is validated against orbiting of immotile bacteria in shear flows. The effects of fluid flow rate and surface topography on twitching motility are studied. The model can successfully predict upstream twitching motility of rod-shaped bacteria in shear flows. Our model can predict that there would be an optimal range of wall shear stress in which bacterial upstream twitching is most efficient.

Stainless steel and polycarbonate coupons (12 mm in diameter) were used in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention biofilm reactor containing 400 mL of 10% tryptic soy broth (TSB) that had been inoculated with an individual strain of L. monocytogenes or STEC to obtain 6 log CFU/mL populations.

To fill this gap, surface morphometry combined with single-cell force spectroscopy was performed on surfaces with irregular topographies on the nano-scale. As surfaces, hydrophobized silicon wafers were used that were etched to exhibit surface structures in the same size range as the bacterial cell wall molecules. The surface structures were characterized by a detailed morphometric analysis based on Minkowski functionals revealing both qualitatively similar features and quantitatively different extensions. We find that as the size of the nanostructures increases, the adhesion forces decrease in a way that can be quantified by the area of the surface that is available for the tethering of cell wall molecules. In addition, we observe a bactericidal effect, which is more pronounced on substrates with taller structures but does not influence adhesion. Our results can be used for a targeted development of 3D-structured materials for/against bio-adhesion.

Continuous adjustment of metabolic patterns to enhance nucleotide synthesis and energy generation may underlie evolution. Indeed, nucleotide levels were elevated and strengthened ciprofloxacin resistance. Quorum sensing (QS) genes were upregulated in the early growth phase, thus potentially improving survival. Further, a thicker cell wall potentially serves as a stronger barrier and reduces drug permeation. The aforementioned three drug resistance levels displayed continuity and differences; the low-resistant level displayed no prominent mechanism; medium, a more focused change in nucleotide metabolism; and high, a thorough evolution to a complete systematic mechanism with higher adenosine 5'-triphosphate levels, serving as a defense mechanism for reducing drug-induced stress.

The S. mutans Cid/Lrg system likely contributes to tolerating stresses encountered in this environment as cid and/or lrg mutants exhibit altered oxidative stress sensitivity, genetic competence, and biofilm phenotypes. It was recently noted that the cidB mutant had two stable colony morphologies: a rough phenotype (similar to wild type) and a smooth phenotype. In our previously published work, the cidB rough mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, and RNAseq identified widespread transcriptomic changes in central carbon metabolism and oxidative stress response genes. In this current report, we conducted Illumina-based genome resequencing of wild type, cidB rough, and cidB smooth mutants and compared their resistance to oxidative and acid stress, biofilm formation, and competence phenotypes. Both cidB mutants exhibited comparable aerobic growth inhibition on agar plates, during planktonic growth, and in the presence of 1 mM hydrogen peroxide. The cidB smooth mutant displayed a significant competence defect in BHI, which was rescuable by synthetic CSP. Both cidB mutants also displayed reduced XIP-mediated competence, although this reduction was more pronounced in the cidB smooth mutant. Anaerobic biofilms of the cidB smooth mutant displayed increased propidium iodide staining, but corresponding biofilm CFU data suggest this phenotype is due to cell damage and not increased cell death. The cidB rough anaerobic biofilms showed altered structure relative to wild type (reduced biomass and average thickness) which correlated with decreased CFU counts. Sequencing data revealed that the cidB smooth mutant has a unique loss of read coverage of ~78 kb of DNA, corresponding to the genomic island TnSMU2 and genes flanking its 3' end. It is therefore likely that the unique biofilm and competence phenotypes of the cidB smooth mutant are related to its genomic changes in this region.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew E Turner"},{"name":"Khanh Huynh"},{"name":"O'neshia V Carney"},{"name":"Dennis Gross"},{"name":"Ronan K Carroll"},{"name":"Sang-Joon Ahn"},{"name":"Kelly C Rice"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"Cid/Lrg system"},{"word":"TnSMU2"},{"word":"competence"},{"word":"genomic island"},{"word":"oxidative stress"}]},"article214":{"pmid":"31599093","title":"Skeleton bones in museum indoor environments offer niches for fungi and are affected by weathering and deposition of secondary minerals.","date":"2020-01-02","abs":"Large skeleton specimens are often featured as iconic open displays in Natural History Museums, for example, the blue whale 'Hope' at the Natural History Museum, London.

The response regulator ArlR consists of a C-terminal DNA-binding effector domain and an N-terminal receiver domain that is phosphorylated by ArlS, the cognate transmembrane sensor histidine kinase. We demonstrate that the receiver domain of ArlR adopts the canonical α5β5 response regulator assembly, which dimerizes upon activation, using beryllium trifluoride as an aspartate phosphorylation mimic. Activated ArlR recognizes a 20-bp imperfect inverted repeat sequence in the ica operon, which is involved in intercellular adhesion polysaccharide production. Crystal structures of the inactive and activated forms reveal that activation induces a significant conformational change in the β4-α4 and β5-α5-connecting loops, in which the α4 and α5 helices constitute the homodimerization interface. Crystal structures of the DNA-binding ArlR effector domain indicate that it is able to dimerize via a non-canonical β1-β2 hairpin domain swapping, raising the possibility of a new mechanism for signal transduction from the receiver domain to effector domain. Taken together, the current study provides structural insights into the activation of ArlR and its recognition, adding to the diversity of response regulation mechanisms that may inspire novel antimicrobial strategies specifically targeting Staphylococcus.","authors":[{"name":"Zhenlin Ouyang"},{"name":"Fang Zheng"},{"name":"Jared Y Chew"},{"name":"Yingmei Pei"},{"name":"Jinhong Zhou"},{"name":"Keqing Wen"},{"name":"Miao Han"},{"name":"M Joanne Lemieux"},{"name":"Peter M Hwang"},{"name":"Yurong Wen"}],"keywords":[]},"article216":{"pmid":"31598670","title":"Differential regulation of physiological activities by RcsB and OmpR in Yersinia enterocolitica.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of Rcs and EnvZ/OmpR phosphorelay systems that allow Yersinia enterocolitica to thrive in various environments is crucial to prevent and control Y. enterocolitica infections.

The rcsB mutant stimulated flagella biosynthesis and increased motility, biofilm formation and c-di-GMP production by upregulating flhDC, hmsHFRS and hmsT. However, mutation in ompR exhibited a non-motile phenotype due to the lack of flagella.

Furthermore, OmpR was identified to be important for Y. enterocolitica to grow in extreme temperature conditions. Importantly, ompR mutations in Y. enterocolitica were more sensitive to polymyxin B and sodium dodecyl sulfate than rcsB mutations.

In this context, recent theoretical studies suggest that an environment containing both resources and toxic waste can promote the emergence of complex, spatially distributed proto-organisms exhibiting division of labour and higher-scale features beyond the cell-cell pairwise interactions. Some previous non-spatial models suggest that the presence of a growth inhibitor can trigger the coexistence of competitive species in an antibiotic-resistance context. In this paper, we further explore this idea using both mathematical and computational models taking the most fundamental features of the proto-organisms model interactions.

Among those, extracts from five plants (Arctii Fructus, Caryopteris incana, Aralia continentalis, Symplocarpus renifolius, and Lamium amplexicaule) showed a growth inhibition of S. mutans. The five extracts were further individually evaluated for their minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration.

To determine the anti-biofilm activity of plant extracts, S. mutans was treated with increasing concentrations of the extracts in the range from 1250 to 3750 µg/mL. When S. mutans was grown in the defined biofilm medium containing the individual extracts of 47 species, the biofilm amount markedly decreased compared to that of a negative control. Notably, the extract of S. renifolius significantly downregulated the gtf and spaP genes for synthesis of glucan and adhesive proteins in S. mutans, and L. amplexicaule decreased the expression of gtfD gene.

This study aims to clarify the potential electron acceptors that could support the process. Here we operated four membrane biofilm reactors (MBfRs) fed with nitrate, nitrite, oxygen at a relatively low rate, and oxygen at a relatively high rate, respectively, to study if they can support methane bioconversion to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the associated microbiological features.

However, IV catheters are also prone to blood clotting at the point of insertion and infection by formation of robust bacterial biofilms on their surface. Nitric oxide (NO) is ideally suited to counteract both of these problems, due to its antimicrobial properties and its ability to inhibit platelet activation/aggregation. One way to equip catheters with NO releasing properties is by electrocatalytic nitrite reduction to NO by copper complexes in a multi-lumen configuration. In this work, we systematically investigate six closely related Cu(II) BMPA- and BEPA-carboxylate complexes (BMPA = bis-(2-methylpyridyl)amine); BEPA = bis-(2-ethylpyridyl)amine), using carboxylate groups of different chain lengths. The corresponding Cu(II) complexes were characterized using UV-Vis, EPR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. Using detailed cyclic voltammetry (CV) and bulk electrocatalyic studies (with real-time NO quantification), in aqueous buffer, pH 7.4, we are able to derive clear reactivity relations between the ligand structures of the complexes, their Faradaic efficiencies for NO generation, their turnover frequencies (TOFs), and their redox potentials. Our results show that the complex [Cu(BEPA-Bu)](OAc) is the best catalyst with a high Faradaic efficiency over large nitrite concentration ranges and the expected best tolerance to oxygen levels. For this species, the more positive redox potential suppresses NO disproportionation, which is a major Achilles heel of the (faster) catalysts with the more negative reduction potentials.","authors":[{"name":"Andrew P Hunt"},{"name":"Allison E Batka"},{"name":"Marjan Hosseinzadeh"},{"name":"Jordan D Gregory"},{"name":"Halima K Haque"},{"name":"Hang Ren"},{"name":"Mark E Meyerhoff"},{"name":"Nicolai Lehnert"}],"keywords":[{"word":"copper nitrite reductase"},{"word":"electrocatalysis"},{"word":"inhaled NO therapy"},{"word":"intravenous catheters"},{"word":"model complexes"},{"word":"modulated NO-release"},{"word":"nitric oxide"},{"word":"nitrite reduction"}]},"article230":{"pmid":"31592330","title":"Improving Water and Nutrient Use Efficiency in Rice by Changing Crop Establishment Methods, Application of Microbial Inoculations, and Zn Fertilization.","date":"2019-10-23","abs":"A field experiment was conducted during the wet seasons of 2013 and 2014 to evaluate the effect of three rice establishment methods: viz. puddled transplanted rice (PTR), system of rice intensification (SRI) and aerobic rice system (ARS), two cyanobacteria based inoculants, viz.

In this review, we summarize recent work in identifying specific molecular components that mediate cell-cell interactions and describe metabolic interactions, such as cross-feeding and exchange of electron acceptors and small molecules, that modify the growth and virulence of individual species. We argue, however, that although pairwise interaction models have provided useful information, complex community-like systems are needed to study the properties of oral communities. The networks of multiple synergistic and antagonistic interactions within oral biofilms give rise to the emergent properties of persistence, stability, and long-range spatial structure, with these properties mediating the dysbiotic transitions from health to oral diseases.

Currently, AECRS is universally treated with antibiotics following the guidelines for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), as our understanding of its microbiology is insufficient to establish specific treatment recommendations. Unfortunately, antibiotics frequently fail to control the symptoms of AECRS due to biofilm formation, disruption of the natural microbiota, and arising antibiotic resistance. These issues can potentially be addressed by phage therapy. In this study, the endoscopically-guided cultures were postoperatively obtained from 50 patients in order to explore the microbiology of AECRS, evaluate options for antibiotic treatment, and, most importantly, assess a possibility of efficient phage therapy. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae. Alarmingly, mechanisms of antibiotic resistance were detected in the isolates from 46% of the patients. Bacteria not sensitive to amoxicillin were carried by 28% of the patients. The lowest rates of resistance were noted for fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Fortunately, 60% of the patients carried bacterial strains that were sensitive to bacteriophages from the Biophage Pharma collection and 81% of the antibiotic-resistant strains turned out to be sensitive to bacteriophages. The results showed that microbiology of AECRS is distinct from ABRS and amoxicillin should not be the antibiotic of first choice. Currently available bacteriophages could be used instead of antibiotics or as an adjunct to antibiotics in the majority of patients with AECRS.","authors":[{"name":"Joanna Szaleniec"},{"name":"Agnieszka Gibała"},{"name":"Monika Pobiega"},{"name":"Sylwia Parasion"},{"name":"Jacek Składzień"},{"name":"Paweł Stręk"},{"name":"Tomasz Gosiewski"},{"name":"Maciej Szaleniec"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"exacerbations"},{"word":"phage"},{"word":"rhinosinusitis"}]},"article235":{"pmid":"31590240","title":"Methods Used for the Eradication of Staphylococcal Biofilms.","date":"2020-01-28","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is considered one of the leading pathogens responsible for community and healthcare-associated infections.

Increased proportions of bacteria with an anaerobic metabolism in M. aeruginosa-fed biofilms suggest that this 'priming' could be due to higher productivity and the resulting changes in habitat conditions. We, therefore, investigated GDM systems amended with the biomass of toxic (WT) or non-toxic (MUT) M. aeruginosa strains, of diatoms (DT), or with starch solution (ST). After 25 days, these treatments were changed to receiving toxic cyanobacterial biomass. MC degradation established significantly more rapidly in MUT and ST than in DT. Oxygen measurements suggested that this was due to oxygen-limited conditions in MUT and ST already prevailing before addition of MC-containing biomass. Moreover, the microbial communities in the initial ST biofilms featured high proportions of facultative anaerobic taxa, whereas aerobes dominated in DT biofilms.

Copper exposure seems to induce drastic changes in the lipid composition of the bacterial cell membrane and to modulate the abundance of proteins functionally known to be involved in copper cell homeostasis in both planktonic and biofilm culture modes.

Although removal of the double bond from acyldepsipeptides generally has a significant negative impact on potency, structural studies revealed that the phenyl ureadepsipeptides can retain potency through the formation of a third hydrogen bond between the urea and the key Tyr63 residue in the ClpP activation domain.

Because a neutrophil is too small to engulf the entire aggregate, it must be able to detach and engulf a few bacteria at a time if it is to use phagocytosis to clear the infection. Current research techniques do not provide a method for determining how the success of phagocytosis, here defined as the complete engulfment of a piece of foreign material, depends on the mechanical properties of a larger object from which the piece must be removed before being engulfed. This article presents a step toward such a method. By varying polymer concentration or cross-linking density, the elastic moduli of centimeter-sized gels are varied over the range that was previously measured for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms grown from clinical bacterial isolates. Human neutrophils are isolated from blood freshly drawn from healthy adult volunteers, exposed to gel containing embedded beads for 1 h, and removed from the gel. The percentage of collected neutrophils that contain beads that had previously been within the gels is used to measure successful phagocytic engulfment. Both increased polymer concentration in agarose gels and increased cross-linking density in alginate gels are associated with a decreased success of phagocytic engulfment. Upon plotting the percentage of neutrophils showing successful engulfment as a function of the elastic modulus of the gel to which they were applied, it is found that data from both alginate and agarose gels collapse onto the same curve. This suggests that gel mechanics may be impacting the success of phagocytosis and demonstrates that this experiment is a step toward realizing methods for measuring how the mechanics of a large target, or a large structure in which smaller targets are embedded, impact the success of phagocytic engulfment.","authors":[{"name":"Megan Davis-Fields"},{"name":"Layla A Bakhtiari"},{"name":"Ziyang Lan"},{"name":"Kristin N Kovach"},{"name":"Liyun Wang"},{"name":"Elizabeth M Cosgriff-Hernandez"},{"name":"Vernita D Gordon"}],"keywords":[]},"article251":{"pmid":"31586475","title":"The effect of the sub-minimal inhibitory concentration and the concentrations within resistant mutation window of ciprofloxacin on MIC, swimming motility and biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-03-18","abs":"To explore the effect of sub-minimal inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) and concentrations within resistant mutation window (MSW) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), swimming motility and biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and also to investigate the correlation between swimming motility and genes expression of lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR and pqsR.","authors":[{"name":"Nan Shi"},{"name":"Yating Gao"},{"name":"Donghong Yin"},{"name":"Yan Song"},{"name":"Jianbang Kang"},{"name":"Xiaoxia Li"},{"name":"Zhiqi Zhang"},{"name":"Xinyuan Feng"},{"name":"Jinju Duan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Ciprofloxacin"},{"word":"MSW"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Swimming motility"}]},"article252":{"pmid":"31586133","title":"Automated Platform for Long-Term Culture and High-Content Phenotyping of Single C. elegans Worms.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a suitable model organism in drug screening.

We allocated single embryos to growth chambers, for observing the main embryonic and post-embryonic development stages and phenotypes, while exposing worms to up to 8 different well-controlled chemical conditions. Our approach allowed eliminating bacteria aggregation and biofilm formation-related clogging issues, which enabled us performing up to 80 hours of automated single worm culture studies. Our microfluidic platform is linked with an automated phenotyping code that registers organism-associated phenotypes at high-throughput. We validated our platform with a dose-response study of the anthelmintic drug tetramisole by studying its influence through the life cycle of the nematodes. In parallel, we could observe development effects and variations in single embryo and worm viability due to the bleaching procedure that is standardly used for harvesting the embryos from a worm culture agar plate.","authors":[{"name":"H B Atakan"},{"name":"R Xiang"},{"name":"M Cornaglia"},{"name":"L Mouchiroud"},{"name":"E Katsyuba"},{"name":"J Auwerx"},{"name":"M A M Gijs"}],"keywords":[]},"article253":{"pmid":"31586051","title":"Efficient inter-species conjugative transfer of a CRISPR nuclease for targeted bacterial killing.","date":"2020-02-14","abs":"The selective regulation of bacteria in complex microbial populations is key to controlling pathogenic bacteria.

It was calibrated and validated with data collected from a pilot-scale study used for potable water reuse and a full-scale facility used for potable water treatment.

Using reconstituted assemblages, from pairs to all 6 members, community biofilm formation was observed to be robust to the absence of any single species and only removal of the C. gleum/S. paucimobilis pair, out of all 15 possible 2-species subtractions, led to loss of community biofilm formation. In conjunction with these findings, dual-species biofilm formation assays supported the view that the contribution of C. gleum to community biofilm formation was dependent on synergistic biofilm formation with either R. insidiosa or C. metallidurans. These data support a model of multiple, partially redundant species interactions to generate robustness in biofilm formation. A bacteriophage and multiple predatory bacteria were used to test the resilience of the community to the removal of individual members in situ, but the combination of precise and substantial depletion of a single target species was not achievable.

However, low-dose antibiotic therapy is a complicated challenge for eradicating biofilms as hundreds (even thousands) of times higher concentrations of antibiotics are needed than killing planktonic bacteria. Polymer vesicles may solve these problems via effective antibiotic delivery into biofilms, but traditional single corona vesicles lack the multifunctionalities essential for biofilm eradication. In this paper, we aim to effectively treat biofilm-induced periodontitis using much lower concentrations of antibiotics than traditional antibiotic therapy by designing a multifunctional dual corona vesicle with intrinsic antibacterial and enhanced antibiotic delivery capabilities. This vesicle is co-assembled from two block copolymers, poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(lysine-stat-phenylalanine) [PCL-b-P(Lys-stat-Phe)] and poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) [PEO-b-PCL]. Both PEO and P(Lys-stat-Phe) coronas have their specific functions: PEO endows vesicles with protein repelling ability to penetrate extracellular polymeric substances in biofilms (stealthy coronas), whereas P(Lys-stat-Phe) provides vesicles with positive charges and broad spectrum intrinsic antibacterial activity. As a result, the dosage of antibiotics can be reduced by 50% when encapsulated in the dual corona vesicles to eradicate Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, effective in vivo treatment has been achieved from a rat periodontitis model, as confirmed by significantly reduced dental plaque, and alleviated inflammation. Overall, this stealthy and antibacterial dual corona vesicle demonstrates a fresh insight for improving the antibiofilm efficiency of antibiotics and combating the serious threat of biofilm-associated diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Yuejing Xi"},{"name":"Yue Wang"},{"name":"Jingyi Gao"},{"name":"Yufen Xiao"},{"name":"Jianzhong Du"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"co-assembly"},{"word":"drug delivery"},{"word":"periodontitis"},{"word":"plaque biofilm"},{"word":"polymer vesicles"},{"word":"self-assembly"}]},"article258":{"pmid":"31584891","title":"Effect of 5 Popular Disinfection Methods on Microflora of Laboratory: Customized Implant Abutments.","date":"2019-10-29","abs":"To compare the efficacy of 5 different decontamination methods of titanium abutments and to assess their possible effects on surface roughness of titanium.","authors":[{"name":"Ali Homayouni"},{"name":"Abbas Bahador"},{"name":"Mohammad Moharrami"},{"name":"Maryam Pourhajibagher"},{"name":"Amir Alireza Rasouli-Ghahroudi"},{"name":"Marzieh Alikhasi"}],"keywords":[]},"article259":{"pmid":"31584765","title":"Methicillin resistance and biofilm production in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in México","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"Introduction: Infections associated with health care caused by S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci multi-resistant to antibiotics cause a high epidemiological impact due to their high morbidity and mortality.

Biofilm-dispersed cells, whose growth rate was the same as that of exponential planktonic bacteria but significantly higher than those of sessile and stationary planktonic forms, colonized both abiotic and biotic surfaces more efficiently than their planktonic counterparts regardless of their initial adhesion capabilities.

In addition, dispersed cells have both a higher engulfment rate and better survival/multiplication inside macrophages than planktonic cells and sessile cells. In an in vivo murine pneumonia model, the bacterial load in mice lungs infected with biofilm-dispersed bacteria was similar at 6, 24 and 48 h after infection to that of mice lungs infected with planktonic or sessile bacteria.

A large scale field investigation in Chinese paddy fields reported here shows that soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) contents rather than soil total phosphorus (STP) triggered phosphorus immobilization of paddy biofilms, as they changed algal diversity and EPS production. High C: P and N: P ratios favored phosphorus immobilization in biofilm biomass via increasing the abundance of green algae.

One of the main concerns related to Salmonella and other food-borne pathogens is their capacity to acquire antimicrobial resistance and produce biofilms. Due to the increased resistance to common antimicrobials used to treat livestock animals and human infections, the discovery of new antimicrobial substances is one of the main challenges in microbiological research. An additional challenge is the development of new methods and substances to inhibit and destruct biofilms. We determined the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of apitoxin in 16 Salmonella strains isolated from poultry. In addition, the effect of apitoxin on Salmonella motility and the expression of biofilm- and virulence-related genes was evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of apitoxin ranged from 1,024-256 μg/mL, with 512 μg/mL being the most common. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of apitoxin significantly reduced biofilm formation in 14 of the 16 Salmonella strains tested, with significant increases in motility. MIC concentrations of apitoxin destroyed the pre-formed biofilm by 27.66-68.22% (47.00% ± 10.91). The expression of biofilm- and virulence-related genes and small RNAs was differentially regulated according to the strain and the presence of apitoxin. The transcription of the small RNAs dsrA and csrB, related to antimicrobial resistance, was upregulated in the presence of apitoxin.

A survey of 132 MRSA genomes assembled from long reads enabled detailed characterization of an outbreak lasting several months of a CC5/ST105/USA100 clone among 18 infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Available hospital-wide genome surveillance data traced the origins of the outbreak to three patients admitted to adult wards during a 4-month period preceding the NICU outbreak. The pattern of changes among complete outbreak genomes provided full spatiotemporal resolution of its progression, which was characterized by multiple subtransmissions and likely precipitated by equipment sharing between adults and infants.

In many cases, NO-induced biofilm dispersal is accomplished through signal transduction pathways that ultimately lead to a decrease in intracellular cyclic-di-GMP levels. H-NOX (heme nitric oxide/oxygen binding domain) proteins are the best characterized bacterial NO sensors and have been implicated in NO-mediated cyclic-di-GMP signaling, but we have recently discovered a second family of NO-sensitive proteins in bacteria named NosP (NO sensing protein); to date, a clear link between NosP signaling and cyclic-di-GMP metabolism has not been established.

Previous studies have well documented the patterns of bacterial alpha diversity in stream biofilms in glacier-fed streams, where, however, beta diversity of the microbial communities has received much less attention especially considering both bacterial and fungal communities. A focus on beta diversity can provide insights into the mechanisms driving community changes associated to large environmental fluctuations and disturbances, such as in glacier-fed streams. Moreover, modularity of co-occurrence networks can reveal more ecological and evolutionary properties of microbial communities beyond taxonomic groups. Here, integrating beta diversity and co-occurrence approach, we explored the network topology and modularity of the bacterial and fungal communities with consideration of environmental variation in glacier-fed streams in Central Asia. Combining results from hydrological modeling and normalized difference of vegetation index, this study highlighted that hydrological variables and vegetation status are major variables determining the environmental heterogeneity of glacier-fed streams. Bacterial communities formed a more complex and connected network, while the fungal communities formed a more clustered network. Moreover, the strong interrelations among the taxonomic dissimilarities of bacterial community (BC) and modules suggest they had common processes in driving diversity and taxonomic compositions across the heterogeneous environment. In contrast, fungal community (FC) and modules generally showed distinct driving processes to each other. Moreover, bacterial and fungal communities also had different driving processes. Furthermore, the variation of BC and modules were strongly correlated with hydrological properties and vegetation status but not with nutrients, while FC and modules (except one module) were not associated with environmental variation. Our results suggest that bacterial and fungal communities had distinct mechanisms in structuring microbial networks, and environmental variation had strong influences on bacterial communities but not on fungal communities. The fungal communities have unique assembly mechanisms and physiological properties which might lead to their insensitive responses to environmental variations compared to bacterial communities. Overall, beyond alpha diversity in previous studies, these results add our knowledge that bacterial and fungal communities have contrasting assembly mechanisms and respond differently to environmental variation in glacier-fed streams.","authors":[{"name":"Ze Ren"},{"name":"Hongkai Gao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Co-occurrence"},{"word":"Dissimilarity"},{"word":"Hydrology"},{"word":"Microbial community"},{"word":"Modules"}]},"article296":{"pmid":"31575775","title":"Establishment of Chronic Typhoid Infection in a Mouse Carriage Model Involves a Type 2 Immune Shift and T and B Cell Recruitment to the Gallbladder.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Typhoid fever, caused primarily by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S Typhi), is a life-threatening systemic disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Three to 5% of individuals infected with S Typhi become chronic carriers due to bacterial persistence in the gallbladder. We have demonstrated that Salmonella forms biofilms on gallstones to establish gallbladder carriage. However, an in-depth molecular understanding of chronic carriage in the gallbladder, from the perspective of both the pathogen and host, is poorly defined. To examine the dynamics of the gallbladder in response to Salmonella infection, we performed transcriptional profiling in the mouse gallbladder at early (7 days) and chronic (21 days) time points. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed a shift from a Th1 proinflammatory response at 7 days postinfection (dpi) toward an anti-inflammatory Th2 response by 21 dpi, characterized by increased levels of immunoglobulins and the Th2 master transcriptional regulator, GATA3. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis predicted the upstream regulation of characteristic Th2 markers, including interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Stat6. Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis confirmed a significant increase in lymphocytes, including T and B cells, at 21 dpi in mice with gallstones. Interestingly, the levels of Salmonella-specific CD4 T cells were 10-fold higher in the gallbladder of mice with gallstones at 21 dpi. We speculate that the biofilm state allows Salmonella to resist the initial onslaught of the Th1 inflammatory response, while yet undefined events influence a switch in the host immunity toward a more permissive type 2 response, enabling the establishment of chronic infection.","authors":[{"name":"Juan F González"},{"name":"Jonathan Kurtz"},{"name":"David L Bauer"},{"name":"Regan Hitt"},{"name":"James Fitch"},{"name":"Amy Wetzel"},{"name":"Krista La Perle"},{"name":"Peter White"},{"name":"James McLachlan"},{"name":"John S Gunn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Salmonella"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chronic carriage"}]},"article297":{"pmid":"31575767","title":"Chemoperception of Specific Amino Acids Controls Phytopathogenicity in Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Chemotaxis has been associated with the pathogenicity of bacteria in plants and was found to facilitate bacterial entry through stomata and wounds.

We show that the chemoreceptor P. syringae pv. tomato PscA (PsPto-PscA) recognizes specifically and with high affinity l-Asp, l-Glu, and d-Asp. The mutation of the chemoreceptor gene largely reduced chemotaxis to these ligands but also altered cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) levels, biofilm formation, and motility, pointing to cross talk between different chemosensory pathways. Furthermore, the PsPto-PscA mutant strain showed reduced virulence in tomato. Asp and Glu are the most abundant amino acids in plants and in particular in tomato apoplasts, and we hypothesize that this receptor may have evolved to specifically recognize these compounds to facilitate bacterial entry into the plant.

In the quest for efficient strategies to achieve this objective, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has emerged as an alternative to classical endodontic irrigation solutions and antibiotics. The aim of the present critical review is to summarize the available evidence on photosensitizers (PSs) which has been confirmed in numerous studies from diverse areas combined with several antimicrobial strategies, as well as emerging options in order to optimize their properties and effects that might be translational and useful in the near future in basic endodontic research. Published data notably support the need for continuing the search for an ideal endodontic photosensitizer, that is, one which acts as an excellent antimicrobial agent without causing toxicity to the human host cells or presenting the risk of tooth discoloration. The current literature on experimental studies mainly relies on assessment of mixed disinfection protocols, combining approaches which are already available with aPDT as an adjunct therapy. In this review, several approaches concerning aPDT efficiency are appraised, such as the use of bacteriophages, biopolymers, drug and light delivery systems, efflux pump inhibitors, negative pressure systems, and peptides. The authors also analyzed their combination with other approaches for aPDT improvement, such as sonodynamic therapy. All of the aforementioned techniques have already been tested, and we highlight the biological challenges of each formulation, predicting that the collected information may encourage the development of other effective photoactive materials, in addition to being useful in endodontic basic research. Moreover, special attention is dedicated to studies on detailed conditions, aPDT features with a focus on PS enhancer strategies, and the respective final antimicrobial outcomes. From all the mentioned approaches, the two which are most widely discussed and which show the most promising outcomes for endodontic purposes are drug delivery systems (with strong development in nanoparticles) and PS solubilizers.","authors":[{"name":"Patrícia Diogo"},{"name":"M Amparo F Faustino"},{"name":"M Graça P M S Neves"},{"name":"Paulo J Palma"},{"name":"Isabel P Baptista"},{"name":"Teresa Gonçalves"},{"name":"João Miguel Santos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"endodontic therapy"},{"word":"root canal disinfection"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"31574976","title":"Biomimetic Approaches for the Development of New Antifouling Solutions: Study of Incorporation of Macroalgae and Sponge Extracts for the Development of New Environmentally-Friendly Coatings.","date":"2020-02-10","abs":"Biofouling causes major economic losses in the maritime industry.

It causes life-threatening complications in diseases characterized by the up-regulation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling, such as cancer or viral infections. Since type I IFNs regulate multiple functions of neutrophils, which constitute the first line of anti-bacterial host defense, in this work we aimed to study how interferon-activated neutrophils influence the course of P. aeruginosa infection of the lung. In lungs of infected IFN-sufficient WT mice, significantly elevated bacteria load was observed, accompanied by the prominent lung tissue damage. At the same time IFN-deficient animals seem to be partly resistant to the infection. Lung neutrophils from such IFN-deficient animals release significantly lower amounts of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), as compared to WT neutrophils. Of note, such IFN-deficient neutrophils show significantly decreased capacity to stimulate biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa. Reduced biofilm production impairs in turn the survival of bacteria in a lung tissue. In line with that, treatment of neutrophils with recombinant IFN-β enhances their NETosis and stimulates biofilm formation by Pseudomonas after co-incubation with such neutrophils. Possibly, bacteria utilizes neutrophil-derived NETs as a scaffold for released biofilms. In agreement with this, in vivo treatment with ROS-scavengers, NETs disruption or usage of the bacterial strains unable to bind DNA, suppress neutrophil-mediated biofilm formation in the lungs. Together, our findings indicate that the excessive activation of neutrophils by type I IFNs leads to their boosted NETosis that in turn triggers biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa and supports its persistence in the infected lung. Targeting these mechanisms could offer a new therapeutic approach to prevent persistent bacterial infections in patients with diseases associated with the up-regulation of type I IFNs.","authors":[{"name":"Ekaterina Pylaeva"},{"name":"Sharareh Bordbari"},{"name":"Ilona Spyra"},{"name":"Anna Sophie Decker"},{"name":"Susanne Häussler"},{"name":"Vadim Vybornov"},{"name":"Stephan Lang"},{"name":"Jadwiga Jablonska"}],"keywords":[{"word":"IFN-β"},{"word":"IFNAR"},{"word":"NETs"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacterial infection"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"innate immunity"},{"word":"neutrophils"}]},"article312":{"pmid":"31572366","title":"Quorum Sensing by Monocyte-Derived Populations.","date":"2019-10-23","abs":"Quorum sensing is a type of cellular communication that was first described in bacteria, consisting of gene expression regulation in response to changes in cell-population density. Bacteria synthesize and secrete diffusive molecules called autoinducers, which concentration varies accordingly with cell density and can be detected by the producing cells themselves. Once autoinducer concentration reaches a critical threshold, all bacteria within the autoinducer-rich environment react by modifying their genetic expression and adopt a coordinated behavior (e.g., biofilm formation, virulence factor expression, or swarming motility). Recent advances highlight the possibility that such type of communication is not restricted to bacteria, but can exist among other cell types, including immune cells and more specifically monocyte-derived cells (1). For such cells, quorum sensing mechanisms may not only regulate their population size and synchronize their behavior at homeostasis but also alter their activity and function in unexpected ways during immune reactions. Although the nature of immune autoinducers and cellular mechanisms remains to be fully characterized, quorum sensing mechanisms in the immune system challenge our traditional conception of immune cell interactions and likely represent an important mode of communication at homeostasis or during an immune response. In this mini-review, we briefly present the prototypic features of quorum sensing in bacteria and discuss the existing evidence for quorum sensing within the immune system.

Microbiome profiling of Stelletta normani and BD1268 sponge samples identified several potential QS active genera. Subsequent biosensor-based screening of a library of 650 marine sponge bacterial isolates identified 10 isolates that could activate at least one of three AHL biosensor strains.

Addition of supernatants from QS active strains did however impact significantly on biofilm formation of the marine Bacillus sp.

To further explore this, we tested the effect of phage treatment on K. pneumoniae growing in several different environments. We found that colistin-resistant cells were more susceptible to phage than were the wildtype cells when growing in biofilms or infected moth larvae and when colonizing the mammalian gut.

Our study demonstrates that, in a strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), IsaA and SceD contribute differently to biofilm formation and β-lactam resistance. Deletion of isaA, but not sceD, led to decreased biofilm formation. Additionally, in isaA-deleted strains, β-lactam resistance was significantly decreased compared to that of wild-type strains. Plasmid-based expression of mecA, a major determinant of β-lactam resistance in MRSA, in an isaA-deleted strain did not restore β-lactam resistance, demonstrating that the β-lactam susceptibility phenotype is exhibited by isaA mutant regardless of the production level of PBP2a. Overall, our results suggest that IsaA is a potential therapeutic target for MRSA infections.","authors":[{"name":"Anne-Aurelie Lopes"},{"name":"Yutaka Yoshii"},{"name":"Satomi Yamada"},{"name":"Mari Nagakura"},{"name":"Yuki Kinjo"},{"name":"Yoshimitsu Mizunoe"},{"name":"Ken-Ichi Okuda"}],"keywords":[]},"article319":{"pmid":"31570304","title":"Detection of virulence factors and antifungal susceptibility of human and avian Aspergillusflavus isolates.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"Aspergillusflavus is the second leading cause of invasive and non-invasive aspergillosis.

To ensure the beneficial effects, the probiotic cells must survive processing and storage of food, its passage through the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and subsequent chemical ingestion processes until they reach their target organ. However, there is considerable loss of viability of the probiotic bacteria during the drying process, in the acidic conditions of the stomach, and in the high bile concentration in the small intestine. Bacillus subtilis, a spore-forming probiotic bacterium, can effectively maintain a favorable balance of microflora in the GIT. B. subtilis produces a protective extracellular matrix (ECM), which is shared with other probiotic bacteria; thus, it was suggested that this ECM could potentially protect an entire community of probiotic cells against unfavorable environmental conditions. Consequently, a biofilm-based bio-coating system was developed that would enable a mutual growth of B. subtilis with different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) through increasing the ECM production. Results of the study demonstrate a significant increase in the survivability of the bio-coated LAB cells during the desiccation process and passage through the acidic environment. Thus, it provides evidence about the ability of B. subtilis in rescuing the desiccation-sensitive LAB, for instance, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, from complete eradication. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the antagonistic potential of the mutual probiotic system against pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. The data show that the cells of B. subtilis possess robust anti-biofilm activity against S. aureus through activating the antimicrobial lipopeptide production pathway.","authors":[{"name":"Hadar Kimelman"},{"name":"Moshe Shemesh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"B. subtilis"},{"word":"beneficial biofilm"},{"word":"bio-coating"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"pathogen elimination"},{"word":"probiotics"}]},"article323":{"pmid":"31568874","title":"Rechargeable anti-microbial adhesive formulation containing cetylpyridinium chloride montmorillonite.","date":"2020-03-20","abs":"Long-term anti-bacterial effect is a desired ability of any dental material in combating tooth caries as one of the most common and widespread persistent diseases today.

A novel approach was developed to combat the problem of biofilm antibiotic tolerance by reverting biofilm bacteria back to the planktonic mode of growth. This reversion was achieved through the enzymatic depletion of available pyruvate using pyruvate dehydrogenase, which induced biofilm bacteria to disperse from the surface-associated mode of growth into the surrounding environment. However, direct use of the enzyme in clinical settings is not practical as the enzyme is susceptible to denaturation under various storage conditions. We hypothesize that by encapsulating pyruvate dehydrogenase into degradable, biocompatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles, the activity of the enzyme can be extended to deplete available pyruvate and induce dispersion of mature Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Several particle formulations were attempted in order to permit the use of the smallest dose of nanoparticles while maintaining pyruvate dehydrogenase activity for an extended time length. The nanoparticles synthesized using the optimal formulation showed an average size of 266.7 ± 1.8 nm. The encapsulation efficiency of pyruvate dehydrogenase was measured at 17.9 ± 1.4%.

While many strategies have been proposed to mitigate Bd outbreaks, few have been successful. In recent years, the use of probiotic formulations that protect an amphibian host by killing or inhibiting Bd have shown promise as an effective chytridiomycosis control strategy. The North American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is a common carrier of Bd and harbours a diverse skin microbiota that includes lactic acid bacteria (LAB), a microbial group containing species classified as safe and conferring host benefits. We investigated beneficial/probiotic properties: anti-Bd activity, and adhesion and colonisation characteristics (hydrophobicity, biofilm formation and exopolysaccharide-EPS production) in two confirmed LAB (cLAB-Enterococcus gallinarum CRL 1826, Lactococcus garvieae CRL 1828) and 60 presumptive LAB (pLAB) [together named as LABs] isolated from bullfrog skin.We challenged LABs against eight genetically diverse Bd isolates and found that 32% of the LABs inhibited at least one Bd isolate with varying rates of inhibition. Thus, we established a score of sensitivity from highest (BdGPL AVS7) to lowest (BdGPL C2A) for the studied Bd isolates. We further reveal key factors underlying host adhesion and colonisation of LABs. Specifically, 90.3% of LABs exhibited hydrophilic properties that may promote adhesion to the cutaneous mucus, with the remaining isolates (9.7%) being hydrophobic in nature with a surface polarity compatible with colonisation of acidic, basic or both substrate types. We also found that 59.7% of LABs showed EPS synthesis and 66.1% produced biofilm at different levels: 21% weak, 29% moderate, and 16.1% strong. Together all these properties enhance colonisation of the host surface (mucus or epithelial cells) and may confer protective benefits against Bd through competitive exclusion. Correspondence analysis indicated that biofilm synthesis was LABs specific with high aggregating bacteria correlating with strong biofilm producers, and EPS producers being correlated to negative biofilm producing LABs. We performed Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis and demonstrated a higher degree of genetic diversity among rod-shaped pLAB than cocci. Based on the LAB genetic analysis and specific probiotic selection criteria that involve beneficial properties, we sequenced 16 pLAB which were identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus thailandicus, Lactobacillus pentosus/L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. curvatus. Compatibility assays performed with cLAB and the 16 species described above indicate that all tested LAB can be included in a mixed probiotic formula. Based on our analyses, we suggest that E. gallinarum CRL 1826, L. garvieae CRL 1828, and P. pentosaceus 15 and 18B represent optimal probiotic candidates for Bd control and mitigation.","authors":[{"name":"M V Niederle"},{"name":"J Bosch"},{"name":"C E Ale"},{"name":"M E Nader-Macías"},{"name":"C Aristimuño Ficoseco"},{"name":"L F Toledo"},{"name":"A Valenzuela-Sánchez"},{"name":"C Soto-Azat"},{"name":"S E Pasteris"}],"keywords":[]},"article343":{"pmid":"31559835","title":"Structural and Functional Characterization of the Globin-Coupled Sensors of Azotobacter vinelandii and Bordetella pertussis.","date":"2020-01-17","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Francesca Germani"},{"name":"Marco Nardini"},{"name":"Amy De Schutter"},{"name":"Bert Cuypers"},{"name":"Herald Berghmans"},{"name":"Marie-Louise Van Hauwaert"},{"name":"Stefano Bruno"},{"name":"Andrea Mozzarelli"},{"name":"Luc Moens"},{"name":"Sabine Van Doorslaer"},{"name":"Martino Bolognesi"},{"name":"Alessandra Pesce"},{"name":"Sylvia Dewilde"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"c-di-GMP and enzyme specificity"},{"word":"crystal structure"},{"word":"heme-based sensor"},{"word":"oxygen affinity"}]},"article344":{"pmid":"31559818","title":"Highly Efficient Antimicrobial Ceramics Based on Electrically Charged Interfaces.","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"The increasing threat of multidrug-resistant microorganisms is a cause of worldwide concern.

A combination of Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman microscopy is used to determine the chemical elements and crystallizations at the ceramic surface. Moreover, Kelvin probe force microscopy demonstrates that the presence of glass-free edges in feldspar needle crystals (semiconductor phase) on a glass matrix (insulator phase) promotes the formation of semiconductor-insulator interface barriers. These barriers act as reservoirs of electric charges of ∼1.5 V, producing a discharge exceeding the microorganism membrane breakdown value (up to 0.5 V). Furthermore, the surface crystallizations account for the formation of a microroughness that limits biofilm formation.

The formation of biofilms and the accumulation of trehalose and sporulation are well-known strategies used by bacteria to survive desiccation. Other mechanisms, including intrinsically disordered proteins and the anti-glycation defence, have been mainly studied in eukaryotic cells, and their role in bacteria remains unclear. We have recently shown that the impairment of trehalose synthesis results in higher glucose availability, leading to the accumulation of acetyl phosphate and enhanced protein acetylation, which in turn stimulates protein aggregation. In the absence of trehalose synthesis, excess glucose may stimulate non-enzymatic glycosylation and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) bound to proteins. Therefore, we propose that trehalose may prevent protein damage, not only as a chemical chaperone but also as a metabolite that indirectly counteracts detrimental protein acetylation and glycation.","authors":[{"name":"Ewa Laskowska"},{"name":"Dorota Kuczyńska-Wiśnik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Advanced glycation end products"},{"word":"Desiccation"},{"word":"Protein acetylation"},{"word":"Protein aggregation"}]},"article346":{"pmid":"31559255","title":"Successful Treatment of Dermatophytomas in 19 Patients Using Efinaconazole 10% Solution.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Dermatophytomas represent a historically difficult-to-treat complication of onychomycosis and are characterized by adherent fungal masses encased in biofilm in the subungual space.

Due to their potent antimicrobial functions, low potential to develop resistance, and immunogenicity, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative treatment for multidrug-resistant strains. Here, we examined the activity of a lysine-rich derivative of amphibian temporin-1CEb (DK5) conjugated to peptides that exert pro-proliferative and/or cytoprotective activity. Analysis of a library of synthetic peptides to identify those with antibacterial potential revealed that the most potent agent against multidrug-resistant S. aureus was a conjugate of a temporin analogue with the synthetic Leu-enkephalin analogue dalargin (DAL). DAL-PEG-DK5 exerted direct bactericidal effects via bacterial membrane disruption, leading to eradication of both planktonic and biofilm-associated staphylococci. Finally, we showed that accumulation of the peptide in the cytoplasm of human keratinocytes led to a marked clearance of intracellular MRSA, resulting in cytoprotection against invading bacteria.

The majority of animals studied to date rely on the cellulolytic activity of symbiotic microorganisms in their digestive tract, with some evidence for a complementary action of endogenous cellulases. Terrestrial isopods have evolved a lifestyle including feeding on a lignocellulose diet. Whether isopods utilize both external and internal cellulases for digestion of a diet is still not understood. We experimentally manipulated the content of cellulose (30%, 60%, or 90%) and the amount of biofilm (small or large) in the offered food source and quantified growth and cellulolytic activity in the gut of the isopod Porcellio scaber. The presence of a visible biofilm significantly promoted isopod growth, regardless of the cellulose content in the diet. The activity of gut cellulases was not significantly affected by the amount of biofilm or the cellulose content. Our results do not support a significant contribution of either ingested or host enzymes to cellulose utilization in P. scaber. Cellulose might not represent a key nutrient for isopods and does not seem to affect the nutritional value of the diet-associated biofilm.

In this study, we use deep-sequencing analyses to explore and compare the structure of bacterial communities at inanimate surfaces of the ICU and NICU wards of The Medical School Clinics Hospital (Brazil). The data revealed that NICU presents higher biodiversity than ICU and surfaces closest to the patient showed a peculiar microbiota, distinguishing one unit from the other.

A checkerboard microdilution assay showed that ENOblock has a significant synergistic effect in combination with FLC against FLC-resistant C. albicans. The time-kill curve further confirmed the synergism of this compound with FLC against FLC-resistant C. albicans. Moreover, we demonstrated the significant inhibitory effects of ENOblock alone and in combination with FLC against C. albicans hypha and biofilm formation. Furthermore, the XTT assay showed that ENOblock has relatively low toxicity to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The in vivo antifungal efficacy of ENOblock was further assessed in a murine model of systemic C. albicans infection. Although ENOblock alone was not sufficient to treat C. albicans infection, the combination of FLC and ENOblock showed significant in vivo activity against FLC-resistant C. albicans. Finally, using surface plasmon resonance analysis as well as an inhibition assay, we determined that ENOblock directly interacted with CaEno1 and significantly inhibited the transglutaminase activity of this enzyme, which is involved in the growth and morphogenesis of C. albicans. In summary, these results demonstrate the synergistic effects of FLC and ENOblock against FLC-resistant C. albicans, and indicate that inhibition of the transglutaminase activity of CaEno1 by ENOblock might confer an advantage for the synergism of FLC and ENOblock, suggesting the potential of ENOblock as a new antifungal candidate.","authors":[{"name":"Liping Li"},{"name":"Teng Zhang"},{"name":"Jianrong Xu"},{"name":"Jing Wu"},{"name":"Yida Wang"},{"name":"Xiran Qiu"},{"name":"Yu Zhang"},{"name":"Weitong Hou"},{"name":"Lan Yan"},{"name":"Maomao An"},{"name":"Yuanying Jiang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"ENOblock"},{"word":"enolase1"},{"word":"fluconazole"},{"word":"synergism"},{"word":"transglutaminase activity"}]},"article357":{"pmid":"31555243","title":"Exposure to Bile Leads to the Emergence of Adaptive Signaling Variants in the Opportunistic Pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The chronic colonization of the respiratory tract by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa has been shown to undergo extensive genomic adaptation facilitating its persistence within the CF lung allowing it to evade the host immune response and outcompete co-colonizing residents of the lung microbiota. However, whilst several studies have described the various mutations that frequently arise in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, the environmental factors governing the emergence of these genetic variants is less well characterized. Gastro-oesophageal reflux has recently emerged as a major co-morbidity in CF and is often associated with the presence of bile acids in the lungs most likely by (micro) aspiration. In order to investigate whether bile may select for genetic variants, P. aeruginosa was experimentally evolved in artificial sputum medium, a synthetic media resembling environmental conditions found within the CF lung. Pigmented derivatives of P. aeruginosa emerged exclusively in the presence of bile. Genome sequencing analysis identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in quorum sensing (lasR) and both the pyocyanin (phzS) and pyomelanin (hmgA) biosynthetic pathways. Phenotypic analysis revealed an altered bile response when compared to the ancestral P. aeruginosa progenitor strain. While the recovered pigmented derivatives retained the bile mediated suppression of swarming motility and enhanced antibiotic tolerance, the biofilm, and redox responses to bile were abolished in the adapted mutants. Though loss of pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) production in the pigmented isolates was not linked to the altered biofilm response, the loss of redox repression could be explained by defective alkyl-quinolone (AQ) production in the presence of bile. Collectively, these findings suggest that the adaptive variants of P. aeruginosa that arise following long term bile exposure enables the emergence of ecologically competitive sub-populations. Altered pigmentation and AQ signaling may contribute to an enhancement in fitness facilitating population survival within a bile positive environment.","authors":[{"name":"Stephanie Flynn"},{"name":"F Jerry Reen"},{"name":"Fergal O'Gara"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"adaptation"},{"word":"artificial sputum media"},{"word":"bile"},{"word":"chronic"},{"word":"evolution"},{"word":"pigmented"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article358":{"pmid":"31555231","title":"Oxygen Restriction Generates Difficult-to-Culture P. aeruginosa.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Induction of a non-culturable state has been demonstrated for many bacteria, e.g., Escherichia coli and various Vibrio spp. In a clinical perspective, the lack of growth due to these non-culturable bacteria can have major consequences for the treatment of patients.

In this study, two syntrophic Geobacter populations are investigated using in situ liquid ToF-SIMS to reveal the biofilm surface changes between them due to direct interspecies electron transfer. By comparing spectral principal component analysis (PCA) results of all peaks and selected peaks, the authors find that spectral peak overlay is an effective strategy to reduce the matrix effect in handling complex ToF-SIMS data. Additionally, the spectral PCA results of high intensity and high resolution data obtained from liquid ToF-SIMS are compared. Selected peaks, amino acid peaks, and water cluster peaks spectral PCA produce nice separation among samples in both high intensity and high resolution data sets. However, the high resolution data show better separation between coculture planktonic and coculture aggregates, confirming that the higher mass accuracy is useful in the analysis of microbial samples.

IncI1 plasmids are widely distributed in Salmonella from food animal sources and associated with clinically important strains. These plasmids often encode antimicrobial resistance; however, little is known about their impact on the virulence of Salmonella strains. To assess the potential impact of the plasmids on virulence, 43 IncI1-positive Salmonella isolates from human and animal sources were subjected to whole genome sequence (WGS) analyses and evaluated for their abilities to invade and persist for 48 h in Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells, form biofilms and encode bacteriocins. Draft WGS data were submitted to predict the presence of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, plasmid replicon types present, conduct plasmid multilocus sequence typing (pMLST), and core genome MLST (cgMLST) in the isolates. Caco-2 cells were infected with Salmonella strains and incubated for both one and 48 h for the invasion and persistence assays, respectively. Additionally, Salmonella isolates and IncI1 plasmid carrying transconjugants (n = 12) generated in Escherichia coli were assessed for their ability to produce biofilms and bacteriocin inhibition of growth of other bacteria. All Salmonella isolates infected Caco-2 cells and persisted in the cells at 48 hrs. Persistent cell counts were observed to be significantly higher than invasion assay cell counts in 26% of the isolates. Among the IncI1 plasmids, there were 18 pMLST types. Nearly 35% (n = 15) of Salmonella isolates produced biofilms; however, none of the IncI1-positive transconjugants produced increased biofilms compared to the recipient. Approximately 65% (n = 28) of isolates and 67% (n = 8) of IncI1-positive transconjugants were able to inhibit growth of at least one E. coli strain; however, none inhibited the growth of strains from species other than E. coli. The study characterized IncI1 positive Salmonella isolates and provided evidence about the potential contributions of IncI1 plasmids virulence phenotypes and areas where they do not.

Non-genetic factors such as the composition and function of microbial populations within different enteric compartments have been recognized to influence FCR, although the extent of interplay between hosts and their microbiomes is unclear. To examine host-microbiome interactions we investigated variation in the composition and functions of host intestinal-hepatic transcriptomes and the intestinal microbiota of full-sib broilers with divergent FCR. Progeny from 300 broiler families were assessed for divergent FCR set against shared genetic backgrounds and exposure to the same environmental factors. The seven most divergent full-sib pairs were chosen for analysis, exhibiting marked variation in transcription of genes as well as gut microbial diversity. Examination of enteric microbiota in low FCR sibs revealed variation in microbial community structure and function with no difference in feed intake compared to high FCR sibs. Gene transcription in low and high FCR sibs was significantly associated with the abundance of specific microbial taxa. Highly intertwined interactions between host transcriptomes and enteric microbiota are likely to modulate complex traits like FCR and may be amenable to selective modification with relevance to improving intestinal homeostasis and health.","authors":[{"name":"Tejas M Shah"},{"name":"Jignasha G Patel"},{"name":"Tejas P Gohil"},{"name":"Damer P Blake"},{"name":"Chaitanya G Joshi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Metagenomics"},{"word":"Microbiome"}]},"article378":{"pmid":"31552139","title":"Exploiting biofilm phenotypes for functional characterization of hypothetical genes in Enterococcus faecalis.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal organism as well as an important nosocomial pathogen, and its infections are typically linked to biofilm formation.

In this study, we used a pan-genomic approach to identify factors important for infection and hospital adaptation by exploring the genomic variability of 123 clinical isolates and 46 commensal S. haemolyticus isolates. Phylogenetic reconstruction grouped the 169 isolates into six clades with a distinct distribution of clinical and commensal isolates in the different clades. Phenotypically, multi-drug antibiotic resistance was detected in 108/123 (88%) of the clinical isolates and 5/46 (11%) of the commensal isolates (p < 0.05).

Additionally, three novel capsular polysaccharide operons were detected, with a potential role in S. haemolyticus virulence. Clinical S. haemolyticus isolates showed specific signatures associated with successful hospital adaption. Biofilm forming S. haemolyticus isolates that are resistant to oxacillin (mecA) and aminoglycosides (aacA-aphD) are most likely invasive isolates whereas absence of these traits strongly indicates a commensal isolate. We conclude that our data show a clear segregation of isolates of commensal origin, and specific genetic signatures distinguishing the clinical isolates from the commensal isolates.

Interrogating crustal life is difficult due to habitat inaccessibility, low-biomass and contamination challenges. Subseafloor observatories have facilitated the study of planktonic life in crustal aquifers, however, studies of life in crust-attached biofilms are rare. Here, we investigate biofilms grown on various minerals at different temperatures over 1-6 years at subseafloor observatories in the Eastern Pacific. To mitigate potential sequence contamination, we developed a new bioinformatics tool - TaxonSluice. We explore ecological factors driving community structure and potential function of biofilms by comparing our sequence data to previous amplicon and metagenomic surveys of this habitat. We reveal that biofilm community structure is driven by temperature rather than minerology, and that rare planktonic lineages colonize the crustal biofilms. Based on 16S rRNA gene overlap, we partition metagenome assembled genomes into planktonic and biofilm fractions and suggest that there are functional differences between these community types, emphasizing the need to separately examine each to accurately describe subseafloor microbe-rock-fluid processes. Lastly, we report that some rare lineages present in our warm and anoxic study site are also found in cold and oxic crustal fluids in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, suggesting global crustal biogeography patterns.","authors":[{"name":"Gustavo A Ramírez"},{"name":"Arkadiy I Garber"},{"name":"Aurélien Lecoeuvre"},{"name":"Timothy D'Angelo"},{"name":"C Geoffrey Wheat"},{"name":"Beth N Orcutt"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CORK"},{"word":"FLOCS"},{"word":"Juan de Fuca"},{"word":"deep biosphere"},{"word":"low biomass"},{"word":"oceanic crust"},{"word":"subseafloor"}]},"article386":{"pmid":"31551940","title":"Proteomic Analysis Reveals a Biofilm-Like Behavior of Planktonic Aggregates of Staphylococcus epidermidis Grown Under Environmental Pressure/Stress.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Prosthetic joint replacement failure has a huge impact on quality of life and hospitalization costs. A leading cause of prosthetic joint infection is bacteria-forming biofilm on the surface of orthopedic devices. Staphylococcus epidermidis is an emergent, low-virulence pathogen implicated in chronic infections, barely indistinguishable from aseptic loosening when embedded in a mature matrix. The literature on the behavior of quiescent S. epidermidis in mature biofilms is scarce. To fill this gap, we performed comparative analysis of the whole proteomic profiles of two methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains growing in planktonic and in sessile form to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying biofilm stability. After 72-h culture of biofilm-forming S. epidermidis, overexpression of proteins involved in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphate and polysaccharides was observed, whereas planktonic bacteria expressed proteins linked to stress and anaerobic growth. Cytological analysis was performed to determine why planktonic bacteria unexpectedly expressed proteins typical of sessile culture. Images evidenced that prolonged culture under vigorous agitation can create a stressful growing environment that triggers microorganism aggregation in a biofilm-like matrix as a mechanism to survive harsh conditions. The choice of a unique late time point provided an important clue for future investigations into the biofilm-like behavior of planktonic cells. Our preliminary results may inform comparative proteomic strategies in the study of mature bacterial biofilm. Finally, there is an increasing number of studies on the aggregation of free-floating bacteria embedded in an extracellular matrix, prompting the need to gain further insight into this mode of bacterial growth.","authors":[{"name":"Marta Bottagisio"},{"name":"Alessio Soggiu"},{"name":"Cristian Piras"},{"name":"Alessandro Bidossi"},{"name":"Viviana Greco"},{"name":"Luisa Pieroni"},{"name":"Luigi Bonizzi"},{"name":"Paola Roncada"},{"name":"Arianna B Lovati"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"orthopedics"},{"word":"planktonic"},{"word":"prosthetic joint infections"},{"word":"proteomics"},{"word":"sessile"}]},"article387":{"pmid":"31551455","title":"5-Dodecanolide interferes with biofilm formation and reduces the virulence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) through up regulation of agr system.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a predominant human pathogen with high morbidity that is listed in the WHO high priority pathogen list.

Studying how single bacterial cells in a population move requires sophisticated tracking and imaging techniques. We have established quantitative methodology for label-free imaging and tracking of individual bacterial cells simultaneously within the bulk liquid and at solid-liquid interfaces by utilizing the imaging modes of digital holographic microscopy (DHM) in three dimensions (3D), differential interference contrast (DIC), and total internal reflectance microscopy (TIRM) in two dimensions (2D) combined with analysis protocols employing bespoke software. To exemplify and validate this methodology, we investigated the swimming behavior of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild-type strain and isogenic flagellar stator mutants (motAB and motCD) within the bulk liquid and at the surface at the single-cell and population levels. Multiple motile behaviors were observed that could be differentiated by speed and directionality. Both stator mutants swam slower and were unable to adjust to the near-surface environment as effectively as the wild type, highlighting differential roles for the stators in adapting to near-surface environments. A significant reduction in run speed was observed for the P. aeruginosamot mutants, which decreased further on entering the near-surface environment. These results are consistent with the mot stators playing key roles in responding to the near-surface environment.","authors":[{"name":"Andrew L Hook"},{"name":"James L Flewellen"},{"name":"Jean-Frédéric Dubern"},{"name":"Alessandro M Carabelli"},{"name":"Irwin M Zaid"},{"name":"Richard M Berry"},{"name":"Ricky D Wildman"},{"name":"Noah Russell"},{"name":"Paul Williams"},{"name":"Morgan R Alexander"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3D imaging"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"digitial holographic microscopy"},{"word":"flagellar motility"},{"word":"stators"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"31551334","title":"Porphyromonas gingivalis Tyrosine Phosphatase Php1 Promotes Community Development and Pathogenicity.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in bacteria plays a significant role in multiple cellular functions, including those related to community development and virulence. Metal-dependent protein tyrosine phosphatases that belong to the polymerase and histindinol phosphatase (PHP) family are widespread in Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we show that Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative periodontal pathogen, expresses a PHP protein, Php1, with divalent metal ion-dependent tyrosine phosphatase activity. Php1 tyrosine phosphatase activity was attenuated by mutation of conserved histidine residues that are important for the coordination of metal ions and by mutation of a conserved arginine residue, a key residue for catalysis in other bacterial PHPs. The php1 gene is located immediately downstream of the gene encoding the bacterial tyrosine (BY) kinase Ptk1, which was a substrate for Php1 in vitro Php1 rapidly caused the conversion of Ptk1 to a state of low tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of discernible intermediate phosphoforms. Active Php1 was required for P. gingivalis exopolysaccharide production and for community development with the antecedent oral biofilm constituent Streptococcus gordonii under nutrient-depleted conditions. In contrast, the absence of Php1 had no effect on the ability of P. gingivalis to form monospecies biofilms.

The presence of an endotracheal tube (ETT) is one of the major culprits for VAP development: air flow moves pathogens toward the distal airways, while clearance of the trachea is blunted due to reduced tracheal ciliary movement and impaired cough. Several measures are recognized as being useful to prevent VAP, and these are usually grouped in a VAP bundle (ie, avoiding intubation or re-intubation whenever possible; head of bed elevation; hand hygiene; shortening ventilation through sedation interruptions, spontaneous breathing trials, or thromboembolic prophylaxis). However, other interventions have been proposed to reduce VAP rate; some of these interventions have been reported in large clinical trials to be effective, some have been evaluated in small observational studies, and still others at a pre-clinical stage. Some strategies aim to improve the ETT design via a subglottic drainage system, with treatment of the ETT surface to reduce pathogen activity, or by modification of the cuff shape or cuff material to provide a better seal. Another proposed strategy is improving airway care through control of cuff pressure, cleaning the ETT, or use of closed suction systems. Other interventions target a patient's position in the bed to reduce aspiration of digestive content in the airways, or the use of probiotics to modulate gastric flora. Some of these measures are supported by strong evidence, but the impact on relevant outcomes such as duration of ventilation or mortality, as well as cost-benefit ratio, is still unclear, resulting in lack of widespread use.","authors":[{"name":"Andrea Coppadoro"},{"name":"Giacomo Bellani"},{"name":"Giuseppe Foti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"airway care"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"coating"},{"word":"cuff"},{"word":"endotracheal tube"},{"word":"preventive measure"},{"word":"secretion removal"},{"word":"ventilator-associated pneumonia"}]},"article392":{"pmid":"31551209","title":"Antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of traditional medicinal plant from Sheikh Buddin range.","date":"2020-02-12","abs":"During current project, antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of traditional medicinal plant Ziziphus nummularia leaf extract and various fractions was investigated.

Specifically, we tracked snail movements on experimental landscapes where resource (algal biofilm) distribution varied from 0 to 100% coverage and quantified how that movement changed over a 24 h period. Resource distribution strongly affected snail movement. Trajectories were tortuous (i.e. Brownian-like) within resource patches but straighter (i.e. Lévy) in resource-free (bare) patches. The average snail speed was slower in resource patches, where snails spent most of their time. Different patterns of movement between resource and bare patches explained movement at larger spatial scales; movement was ballistic-like Lévy in resource-free landscapes, Lévy in landscapes with intermediate resource coverage and approximated Brownian in landscapes covered in resources. Our temporal analysis revealed that movement patterns changed predictably for snails that satiated their hunger and then performed other behaviours. These changes in movement patterns through time were similar across all treatments that contained resources. Thus, external and internal factors interacted to shape the inherently flexible movement of these snails.","authors":[{"name":"Carl S Cloyed"},{"name":"Anthony I Dell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Brownian walk"},{"word":"Lévy walk"},{"word":"automated imaged-based tracking"},{"word":"optimal foraging"},{"word":"power-law probability density function"},{"word":"step length"}]},"article395":{"pmid":"31550929","title":"Photodynamic and peptide-based strategy to inhibit Gram-positive bacterial biofilm formation.","date":"2019-12-30","abs":"The self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix of biofilms renders them difficult to eliminate once they are established.
