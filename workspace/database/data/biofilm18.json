The exact pathomechanism is not completely understood; however, microbial colonization of osteosynthesis material is considered a trigger for infection. This study aimed to determine the colonization rate of osteosynthesis implants in patients with no clinical or laboratory signs of infection, using two methods, conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of sonication fluid. Fifty-seven patients aged between 18 and 79 years without signs of infection who underwent routine removal of osteosynthesis devices between March 2015 and May 2017 were included in this study. Osteosynthesis material was investigated by sonication followed by cultivation of the sonication fluid in blood culture bottles and PCR analysis, simultaneously. Additionally, electron scanning microscopy was performed in nine representative implants to evaluate biofilm production. Thirty-two (56.1%) implants showed a positive result either by culture or PCR with coagulase-negative staphylococci being the most commonly identified microorganism (68.1%). Furthermore, the detection rate of the culture (50.9%) was significantly higher compared to PCR (21.1%). The scanning electron microscopy imaging demonstrated biofilm-like structures in four of six culture and/or PCR-positive samples. This study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to demonstrate bacterial colonization of osteosynthesis implants in healthy patients with no clinical or laboratory signs of infection. Colonization rate was unexpectedly high and conventional culture was superior to PCR in microbial detection. The common understanding that colonization is a trigger for infection underlines the need for strategies to prevent colonization of implant material like antibiotic-loaded coating or intraoperative gel application.","authors":[{"name":"Ludwig Knabl"},{"name":"Bettina Kuppelwieser"},{"name":"Astrid Mayr"},{"name":"Wilfried Posch"},{"name":"Michaela Lackner"},{"name":"Débora Coraҫa-Huber"},{"name":"Adrian Danita"},{"name":"Michael Blauth"},{"name":"Cornelia Lass-Flörl"},{"name":"Dorothea Orth-Höller"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bath sonication"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"electron scanning microscopy"},{"word":"osteosynthesis implants"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"30507938","title":"TAMMiCol: Tool for analysis of the morphology of microbial colonies.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Many microbes are studied by examining colony morphology via two-dimensional top-down images. The quantification of such images typically requires each pixel to be labelled as belonging to either the colony or background, producing a binary image. While this may be achieved manually for a single colony, this process is infeasible for large datasets containing thousands of images. The software Tool for Analysis of the Morphology of Microbial Colonies (TAMMiCol) has been developed to efficiently and automatically convert colony images to binary. TAMMiCol exploits the structure of the images to choose a thresholding tolerance and produce a binary image of the colony. The images produced are shown to compare favourably with images processed manually, while TAMMiCol is shown to outperform standard segmentation methods. Multiple images may be imported together for batch processing, while the binary data may be exported as a CSV or MATLAB MAT file for quantification, or analysed using statistics built into the software. Using the in-built statistics, it is found that images produced by TAMMiCol yield values close to those computed from binary images processed manually. Analysis of a new large dataset using TAMMiCol shows that colonies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reach a maximum level of filamentous growth once the concentration of ammonium sulfate is reduced to 200 μM. TAMMiCol is accessed through a graphical user interface, making it easy to use for those without specialist knowledge of image processing, statistical methods or coding.","authors":[{"name":"Hayden Tronnolone"},{"name":"Jennifer M Gardner"},{"name":"Joanna F Sundstrom"},{"name":"Vladimir Jiranek"},{"name":"Stephen G Oliver"},{"name":"Benjamin J Binder"}],"keywords":[]},"article3":{"pmid":"30507674","title":"The biofilm in bacterial vaginosis: implications for epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment: 2018 update.","date":"2020-01-30","abs":"Bacterial vaginosis is conventionally appreciated as a temporary community disturbance of the vaginal microbiota, though really involving self-organization as a resilient biofilm community.

The cycling of elements demands a tight tuning of the various metabolic processes and require cooperation between the different groups of microorganisms.

Here, we report the construction and characterization of kre6Δ/Δ, skn1Δ/Δ and kre6Δ/Δ skn1Δ/Δ mutants in C. albicans. While deleting KRE6 or SKN1 had no obvious phenotypic consequence, deleting both caused slow growth, cell separation failure, cell wall abnormalities, diminished hyphal growth, poor biofilm formation and loss of virulence in mice. Furthermore, the GPI-linked cell surface proteins Hwp1 and the invasin Als3 or Ssa1 were not detected in kre6Δ/Δ skn1Δ/Δ mutant. In GMM medium, RT-qPCR and western blotting revealed a constitutive expression of KRE6 and growth conditions-associated activation of SKN1. Like many hypha-specific genes, SKN1 is repressed by Nrg1, but its activation does not involve the transcription factor Efg1. Dysregulation of SKN1 reduces C. albicans ability to damage epithelial and endothelial cells and attenuates its virulence.

Instead, the mechanistic basis of drought tolerance in Arabidopsisthaliana induced by FZB42 remains unexplored. Here, we constructed an exopolysaccharide-deficient mutant epsC and determined the role of epsC in FZB42-induced drought tolerance in A. thaliana. Results showed that FZB42 significantly enhanced growth and drought tolerance of Arabidopsis by increasing the survival rate, fresh and dry shoot weights, primary root length, root dry weight, lateral root number, and total lateral root length. Coordinated changes were also observed in cellular defense responses, including elevated concentrations of proline and activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase, decreased concentrations of malondialdehyde, and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in plants treated with FZB42. The relative expression levels of drought defense-related marker genes, such as RD29A, RD17, ERD1, and LEA14, were also increased in the leaves of FZB42-treated plants. In addition, FZB42 induced the drought tolerance in Arabidopsis by the action of both ethylene and jasmonate, but not abscisic acid. However, plants inoculated with mutant strain epsC were less able to resist drought stress with respect to each of these parameters, indicating that epsC are required for the full benefit of FZB42 inoculation to be gained. Moreover, the mutant strain was less capable of supporting the formation of a biofilm and of colonizing the A. thaliana root. Therefore, epsC is an important factor that allows FZB42 to colonize the roots and induce systemic drought tolerance in Arabidopsis.","authors":[{"name":"Xiang Lu"},{"name":"Shao-Fang Liu"},{"name":"Liang Yue"},{"name":"Xia Zhao"},{"name":"Yu-Bao Zhang"},{"name":"Zhong-Kui Xie"},{"name":"Ruo-Yu Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"drought stress"},{"word":"epsC"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides"},{"word":"phytohormone"}]},"article27":{"pmid":"30517641","title":"Evaluation of the ability of linezolid and tedizolid to eradicate intraosteoblastic and biofilm-embedded Staphylococcus aureus in the bone and joint infection setting.","date":"2020-02-12","abs":"Prolonged use of linezolid for bone and joint infection (BJI) is limited by its long-term toxicity.

Understanding the effect of critical parameters of feed water such as biodegradable substrate concentration on the developed biofilm characteristics enables development of more effective biofouling control strategies. In this study, the effect of substrate concentration on the biofilm characteristics was examined using membrane fouling simulators (MFSs). A feed channel pressure drop (PD) increase of 200 mbar was used as a benchmark to study the developed biofilm. The amount and characteristics of the formed biofilm were analysed in relation to membrane performance indicators: feed channel pressure drop and permeate flux. The effect of the characteristics of the biofilm developed at three substrate concentrations on the removal efficiency of the different biofilms was evaluated applying acid/base cleaning. Results showed that a higher feed water substrate concentration caused a higher biomass amount, a faster PD increase, but a lower permeate flux decline. The permeate flux decline was affected by the spatial location and the physical characteristics of the biofilm rather than the total amount of biofilm. The slower growing biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration was harder to remove by NaOH/HCl cleanings than the biofilm developed at the higher substrate concentrations. Effective biofilm removal is essential to prevent a fast biofilm regrowth after cleaning. While substrate limitation is a generally accepted biofouling control strategy delaying biofouling, development of advanced cleaning methods to remove biofilms formed under substrate limited conditions is of paramount importance.","authors":[{"name":"N M Farhat"},{"name":"L Javier"},{"name":"M C M Van Loosdrecht"},{"name":"J C Kruithof"},{"name":"J S Vrouwenvelder"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm structure"},{"word":"Chemical cleaning"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)"},{"word":"Reverse osmosis performance"},{"word":"Slowly growing biofilms"}]},"article39":{"pmid":"30513124","title":"The afc antifungal activity cluster, which is under tight regulatory control of ShvR, is essential for transition from intracellular persistence of Burkholderia cenocepacia to acute pro-inflammatory infection.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"The opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia is particularly life-threatening for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Chronic lung infections with these bacteria can rapidly develop into fatal pulmonary necrosis and septicaemia. We have recently shown that macrophages are a critical site for replication of B. cenocepacia K56-2 and the induction of fatal pro-inflammatory responses using a zebrafish infection model. Here, we show that ShvR, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator that is important for biofilm formation, rough colony morphotype and inflammation in a rat lung infection model, is also required for the induction of fatal pro-inflammatory responses in zebrafish larvae. ShvR was not essential, however, for bacterial survival and replication in macrophages. Temporal, rhamnose-induced restoration of shvR expression in the shvR mutant during intramacrophage stages unequivocally demonstrated a key role for ShvR in transition from intracellular persistence to acute fatal pro-inflammatory disease. ShvR has been previously shown to tightly control the expression of the adjacent afc gene cluster, which specifies the synthesis of a lipopeptide with antifungal activity. Mutation of afcE, encoding an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, has been shown to give similar phenotypes as the shvR mutant. We found that, like shvR, afcE is also critical for the switch from intracellular persistence to fatal infection in zebrafish. The closely related B. cenocepacia H111 has been shown to be less virulent than K56-2 in several infection models, including Galleria mellonella and rats. Interestingly, constitutive expression of shvR in H111 increased virulence in zebrafish larvae to almost K56-2 levels in a manner that absolutely required afc. These data confirm a critical role for afc in acute virulence caused by B. cenocepacia that depends on strain-specific regulatory control by ShvR. We propose that ShvR and AFC are important virulence factors of the more virulent Bcc species, either through pro-inflammatory effects of the lipopeptide AFC, or through AFC-dependent membrane properties.","authors":[{"name":"Margarida C Gomes"},{"name":"Yara Tasrini"},{"name":"Sujatha Subramoni"},{"name":"Kirsty Agnoli"},{"name":"Joana R Feliciano"},{"name":"Leo Eberl"},{"name":"Pamela Sokol"},{"name":"David O'Callaghan"},{"name":"Annette C Vergunst"}],"keywords":[]},"article40":{"pmid":"30512214","title":"Cheese yeasts.","date":"2019-04-23","abs":"Numerous traditionally aged cheeses are surface ripened and develop a biofilm, known as the cheese rind, on their surfaces.

Temporally direct and lagged correlations between the markers and bacterial taxa were computed individually for 26 volunteers who provided saliva samples during one month (21.2 ± 2.7 samples/volunteer, 551 samples in total).

Using a model system - a CCA of a genus that has been shown to induce high levels of settlement of Acropora corals (Titanoderma cf. tessellatum) and an abundant coral species (Acropora millepora)- we show that chemical effects of CCA are stronger than those from CCA surface microbial biofilms as drivers of coral settlement.

We propose that optimal coral settlement is caused by complex biochemical communications among CCA, their epiphytic microbial community and coral larvae.","authors":[{"name":"Luis A Gómez-Lemos"},{"name":"Christopher Doropoulos"},{"name":"Elisa Bayraktarov"},{"name":"Guillermo Diaz-Pulido"}],"keywords":[]},"article48":{"pmid":"30510177","title":"Collective motion conceals fitness differences in crowded cellular populations.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Many cellular populations are tightly packed, such as microbial colonies and biofilms, or tissues and tumours in multicellular organisms. The movement of one cell in these crowded assemblages requires motion of others, so that cell displacements are correlated over many cell diameters. Whenever movement is important for survival or growth, these correlated rearrangements could couple the evolutionary fate of different lineages. However, little is known about the interplay between mechanical forces and evolution in dense cellular populations. Here, by tracking slower-growing clones at the expanding edge of yeast colonies, we show that the collective motion of cells prevents costly mutations from being weeded out rapidly. Joint pushing by neighbouring cells generates correlated movements that suppress the differential displacements required for selection to act. This mechanical screening of fitness differences allows slower-growing mutants to leave more descendants than expected under non-mechanical models, thereby increasing their chance for evolutionary rescue. Our work suggests that, in crowded populations, cells cooperate with surrounding neighbours through inevitable mechanical interactions. This effect has to be considered when predicting evolutionary outcomes, such as the emergence of drug resistance or cancer evolution.","authors":[{"name":"Jona Kayser"},{"name":"Carl F Schreck"},{"name":"Matti Gralka"},{"name":"Diana Fusco"},{"name":"Oskar Hallatschek"}],"keywords":[]},"article49":{"pmid":"30509729","title":"Linking microbial respiratory activity with phospholipid fatty acid of biofilm from full-scale bioreactors.","date":"2019-07-29","abs":"Deficiency of researches on biotic community-driven biofilm activity makes biofilm regulation lack of quantitative response for decades.

Electro-dewatering (ED) is an attractive technology for enhancing dewaterability and improving the sustainability of waste activated sludge (WAS) handling. However, electrically assisted mechanical dewatering processes consume more energy and the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) dissolution caused by electrochemical reactions can lead to clogging of the filter cloth. Carbon-based materials (CBMs) such as activated carbon and graphite have electrical conductivity and well-developed pore structures which can adsorb the biopolymers. Therefore, addition of CBMs is expected to improve WAS electro-dewatering performance for fuel treatment by enhancing sludge conductivity and filterability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the three carbon materials (AC-0, AC-5, and graphite) on sludge electro-dewatering behavior and the flammability of sludge cakes. The results showed that CBMs promote the performance of WAS electro-dewatering, and the promoting effect of the carbon materials on the sludge electro-dewatering is proportional to the electrical conductivity of the carbon material, and carbon materials can increase the electrophoretic mobility of sludge flocs and the electro-osmotic effect. Moreover, CBMs can adsorb the dissolved EPS, thus alleviate the plugging and filtration resistance of the filter medium. The addition of CBMs also decreases the energy consumption for water removal during the electro-dewatering process and improves the calorific value and sustainable combustion time of the sludge cake.

Biofilms play crucial roles in biogeochemical cycling and invertebrate recruitment in marine environments. However, relatively little is known about how marine biofilms form on different substrata and about how these biofilms impact invertebrate recruitment. Here, we performed a comparative analysis of a 28-day-old biofilm community on non-coated (a control glass) and coated substrata (polyurethane (PU), epoxy resin (EP) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) and examined the settlement of Mytilus coruscus plantigrades on these biofilms. PU, EP and PDMS deterred the development of marine biofilms by reducing the biofilm biomass including the biofilm dry weight, cell density of the bacteria and diatoms and chlorophyll a concentrations. Further analysis of bacterial community revealed that EP altered the bacterial community composition compared with that on the glass substrata by reducing the relative abundance of Ruegeria (Alphaproteobacteria) and by increasing the relative abundance of Methylotenera (Betaproteobacteria) and Cyanobacteria in the biofilms. However, bacterial communities developed on PU and PDMS, as well as glass and PU, EP and PDMS did not exhibit differences from each other. The M. coruscus settlement rates on biofilms on PU, EP and PDMS were reduced by 20-41% compared with those on the glass after 28 days.

BV is catagorized by greyish white discharge, pH greater than 4.5. It results in the preterm labor, abortion, pelvic inflammatory disorders, post cesarean infections. BV is associated with Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) or immune deficiency disorders like Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Human Papilloma Virus, Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The prevalence rate is about 21.2 million (29.2%) worldwide. BV is more frequent in black females as compared to white females, independent of geographical distribution. Globally, BV is treated with the current recommended antibiotic therapy including Metronidazole and Clindamycin. The recurrence rates are 76% and occur within 06 months of treatment due to antibiotic resistance against pathogenic bacteria and their biofilms. The antibiotic resistance is a global health issue which directs the attentions towards other treatments. One of these is the treatment of sex partners, thus helping to stop the recurrence rates in females. However, this method does not show any positive results. Probiotic therapy is an incorporation of Lactobacilli orally or intravaginally for the recolonization of healthy microbes. This therapy has exhibited promising results but some studies revealed that Probiotic therapy does not control the recurrence rate. The other methods are in trials period and none of them are used clinically or commercially available for the treatment. The thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) intravaginal rings contain lactic acid and metronidazole showed promising results in trials of BV treatment. The vaginal acidifiers are used as an alternative method to maintain the vaginal pH but the process of douching is a major limitation. The activated charcoal is used to treat BV patients in clinical trials showed decrease in the pH with only 3.1% loss of lactobacilli. Phage therapy is a reemerging field to overcome the bacterial resistance. They are host specific and easier to handle. They can be used naturally, synthetically; phage cocktails and phage-antibiotics combination can be used. Phages show auspicious results for the treatment of bacterial infections as compared to antibiotics as they also treat biofilms. This is one of the promising therapy in future to treat infections with no side effects. Phage therapy can be used in pharmaceuticals according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. Taken together, it is suggested that large funding is required by pharmaceutical sector or government for further investigation of bacteriophages to be used against BV pathogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Ayesha Javed"},{"name":"Fahed Parvaiz"},{"name":"Sobia Manzoor"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Epidemiology"},{"word":"Phage therapy"},{"word":"Probiotics"},{"word":"STD's"},{"word":"TPU"}]},"article59":{"pmid":"30500794","title":"Operational modifications for the development of nitrifying bacteria in a large-scale biological aerated filter and its impact on wastewater treatment.","date":"2019-05-09","abs":"To develop a better understanding for fixed biomass processes, the development of a nitrifying bacterial biofilm, as well as the performance of treatment during modifications to operational conditions of a full-scale submerged biological filter were examined.

Difficulties on different species identification as well as the lack of standardized sensitivity tests in vitro, contribute to the limited information available on epidemiology, diagnosis, and therapeutics of Trichosporon infections. There are only sporadic reports of UTI caused by Trichosporon asahii reported from India. We report six cases of UTI caused by T. asahii in severely ill patients in a tertiary care setup. Among six positive T. asahii UTI, four were found in female patients with a mean age of 60 years. We observed that all patients were on indwelling urinary catheter, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and with other comorbid conditions. With regard to the antifungal susceptibility testing, all the isolates were resistant to amphotericin B and sensitive to voriconazole. Majority of them were sensitive to Itraconazole, half of them were sensitive to fluconazole. The ubiquity and biofilm formation poses difficulty in establishing pathogenicity and delineating environmental or nosocomial infections. Risk factors such as use of antibiotics, indwelling catheter, and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, anemia, and chronic kidney disease predispose for the development of UTI by T. asahii. Isolation of the same yeast in three consecutive urine samples with significant counts, along with significant number of pus cells establishes T. asahii as an etiological agent of UTI. Furthermore, the clearance of the fungus from the urinary tract with the recovery of the patient following catheter removal and antifungal therapy further confirms T. asahii as the cause of UTI.","authors":[{"name":"Tejashree Anantharaj Urs"},{"name":"Visakha Kadiyala"},{"name":"Saundarya Deepak"},{"name":"M Krishna Karthik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Nosocomial urinary tract infections"},{"word":"Trichosporon asahii"},{"word":"UTI's"}]},"article74":{"pmid":"30498307","title":"Evaluation of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide method for assessing biofilm formation in vitro by Trichosporon spp.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Invasive infections due to Trichosporon spp. have increased recently and are frequently associated with indwelling medical devices.

Finally, Random Forest model prediction of disease status (carriage vs. infection) identifies pathogenicity elements in 415 S. epidermidis isolates with 80% accuracy, demonstrating the potential for identifying risk genotypes pre-operatively.","authors":[{"name":"Guillaume Méric"},{"name":"Leonardos Mageiros"},{"name":"Johan Pensar"},{"name":"Maisem Laabei"},{"name":"Koji Yahara"},{"name":"Ben Pascoe"},{"name":"Nattinee Kittiwan"},{"name":"Phacharaporn Tadee"},{"name":"Virginia Post"},{"name":"Sarah Lamble"},{"name":"Rory Bowden"},{"name":"James E Bray"},{"name":"Mario Morgenstern"},{"name":"Keith A Jolley"},{"name":"Martin C J Maiden"},{"name":"Edward J Feil"},{"name":"Xavier Didelot"},{"name":"Maria Miragaia"},{"name":"Herminia de Lencastre"},{"name":"T Fintan Moriarty"},{"name":"Holger Rohde"},{"name":"Ruth Massey"},{"name":"Dietrich Mack"},{"name":"Jukka Corander"},{"name":"Samuel K Sheppard"}],"keywords":[]},"article92":{"pmid":"30487154","title":"Tetrasodium EDTA Is Effective at Eradicating Biofilms Formed by Clinically Relevant Microorganisms from Patients' Central Venous Catheters.","date":"2019-02-01","abs":"Central venous access devices (CVADs) are an essential component of modern health care. However, their prolonged use commonly results in microbial colonization, which carries the potential risk of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections. These infections complicate the treatment of already sick individuals and cost the existing health care systems around the world millions of dollars. The microbes that colonize CVADs typically form multicellular biofilms that are difficult to dislodge and are resistant to antimicrobial treatments. Clinicians are searching for better ways to extend the working life span of implanted CVADs, by preventing colonization and reducing the risk of bloodstream infections. In this study, we analyzed 210 bacterial and fungal isolates from colonized CVADs or human bloodstream infections from two hospitals geographically separated in the east and west of Canada and screened the isolates for biofilm formation in vitro Twenty isolates, representing 12 common, biofilm-forming species, were exposed to 4% tetrasodium EDTA, an antimicrobial lock solution that was recently approved in Canada for use as a medical device. The EDTA solution was effective at eradicating surface-attached biofilms from each microbial species, indicating that it could likely be used to prevent biofilm growth within CVADs and to eliminate established biofilms. This new lock solution fits with antibiotic stewardship programs worldwide by sparing the use of important antibiotic agents, targeting prevention rather than the expensive treatment of hospital-acquired infections.","authors":[{"name":"Fangning Liu"},{"name":"Satyender Hansra"},{"name":"Gordon Crockford"},{"name":"Wolfgang Köster"},{"name":"Brenda J Allan"},{"name":"Joseph M Blondeau"},{"name":"Chantal Lainesse"},{"name":"Aaron P White"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EDTA"},{"word":"Gram-negative"},{"word":"Gram-positive"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"catheters"},{"word":"central venous access devices"},{"word":"fungi"},{"word":"minimum inhibitory concentration"}]},"article93":{"pmid":"30486995","title":"Bioinspired Carbon Quantum Dots: An Antibiofilm Agents.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Carbon dots, very tiny carbon material with various surface passivations, have emerged as a new class of nanomaterials for various applications.

For this, the effect of 22 drugs on K. pneumoniae ATCC 13884 growth was determined at sub-plasmatic concentrations; the production of autoinducer lactones was established by HPLC and with a biosensor. The induction of biofilm formation was determined through crystal violet assay at 585 nm in a microplate reader and using urethral catheters. According to the in vitro assays, some drugs were found to induce biofilm formation in K. pneumoniae ATCC 13884. The effect of acetaminophen, hydrochlorothiazide, and progesterone stood out. The first drug caused several changes in the biochemistry of K. pneumoniae ATCC 13884 related to QS: high synthesis of N-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone, increasing bacterial populations by 27% and biofilm formation by 49%, and a more gentamicin resistant biofilm. Furthermore, it increased the colonization area of urethral catheters.

Pairwise comparisons between groups were performed at T₀ and T₄, and a logistic regression identified correlates of gingival bleeding (T₄). Among 100 subjects (2273 interdental sites), the median percentage of bleeding sites per participant at T₀ was 65%.

Vibrio tapetis can develop such biofilms on the inner surface of shells of the Ruditapes philippinarum clam, leading to the formation of a brown conchiolin deposit in the form of a ring, hence the name of the disease: Brown Ring Disease. The virulence of V. tapetis is presumed to be related to its capacity to form biofilms, but the link has never been clearly established at the physiological or genetic level. In the present study, we used RNA-seq analysis to identify biofilm- and virulence-related genes displaying altered expression in biofilms compared to the planktonic condition. A flow cell system was employed to grow biofilms to obtain both structural and transcriptomic views of the biofilms. We found that 3615 genes were differentially expressed, confirming that biofilm and planktonic lifestyles are very different. As expected, the differentially expressed genes included those involved in biofilm formation, such as motility- and polysaccharide synthesis-related genes. The data show that quorum sensing is probably mediated by the AI-2/LuxO system in V. tapetis biofilms. The expression of genes encoding the Type VI Secretion System and associated exported proteins are strongly induced, suggesting that V. tapetis activates this virulence factor when living in biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Sophie Rodrigues"},{"name":"Christine Paillard"},{"name":"Sabine Van Dillen"},{"name":"Ali Tahrioui"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Berjeaud"},{"name":"Alain Dufour"},{"name":"Alexis Bazire"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio tapetis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"brown ring disease"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"transcriptome"},{"word":"type VI secretion system"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article99":{"pmid":"30485830","title":"Electroautotrophy of Thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens.","date":"2019-02-27","abs":"The electrochemical behavior and electro-autotrophy of a halo-alkaliphilic chemo-autotrophic Ectothiorhodospiraceae isolated from a soda lake, Thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens, were investigated using electrochemical methods and confocal fluorescence microscopy.

It is associated with varied outcomes of infection, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastric ulcers, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and is generally considered a risk factor for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Cholesteryl glucosides (CGs) constitute a vital component of the cell wall of H. pylori and contribute to its pathogenicity and virulence. The hp0421 gene, which encodes cholesteryl-α-glucoside transferase (CGT), appears critical for the enzymatic function of integrating unique CGs into the cell wall of H. pylori, and deletion of this gene leads to depletion of CGs and their variants. Herein, we report that the deletion of hp0421 and consequent deficiency of cholesterol alter the morphology, shape, and cell wall composition of H. pylori cells, as demonstrated by high-resolution confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analyses of two different type strains of H. pylori, their isogenic knockouts as well as a reconstituted strain. Moreover, measurement of ethidium bromide (EtBr) influx by flow cytometry showed that lack of CGs increased cell wall permeability. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that the hp0421 isogenic knockout strains (Hp26695Δ421 and Hp76Δ421) were sensitive to antibiotics, such as fosfomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin, in contrast to the wild-type strains that were resistant to the above antibiotics and tended to form denser biofilms. Lipid profile analysis of both Hp76 and Hp76Δ421 strains showed an aberrant profile of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the Hp76Δ421 strain. Taken together, we herein provide a set of mechanistic evidences to demonstrate that CGs play critical roles in the maintenance of the typical spiral morphology of H. pylori and its cell wall integrity, and any alteration in CG content affects the characteristic morphological features and renders the H. pylori susceptible to various antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Majjid A Qaria"},{"name":"Naveen Kumar"},{"name":"Arif Hussain"},{"name":"Shamsul Qumar"},{"name":"Sankara N Doddam"},{"name":"Ludovico P Sepe"},{"name":"Niyaz Ahmed"}],"keywords":[{"word":"H. pylori"},{"word":"Helicobacter pylori"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"antibiotic susceptibility"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"cell wall integrity"},{"word":"cholesteryl glucosides"},{"word":"membrane permeability"},{"word":"morphology"}]},"article111":{"pmid":"30482826","title":"Bacillus subtilis Biofilms: a Matter of Individual Choice.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Bacillus subtilis has the capacity to choose between two mutually exclusive lifestyles: biofilm formation and flagellum-mediated swimming motility.

This review summarizes previous work dedicated in searching for the relationship between bacterial adhesion and surface topography in the last eight years, as well as the proposed mechanisms by which surface topographic features interact with bacterial cells. Next, various natural and artificial surfaces with bactericidal surface topography along with their bactericidal mechanisms and efficiency are introduced.

In this study, exposure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to exogenous NO inhibited the expression of iron acquisition-related genes and the production of the siderophore pyoverdine. Furthermore, supplementation of the culture medium with high levels of iron (100 μM) counteracted NO-induced biofilm dispersal by promoting the rapid attachment of planktonic cells. In the presence of iron, biofilms were found to disperse transiently to NO, while the freshly dispersed cells reattached rapidly within 15 min. This effect was not due to the scavenging of NO by free iron but involved a cellular response induced by iron that led to the elevated production of the exopolysaccharide Psl. Interestingly, most Psl remained on the substratum after treatment with NO, suggesting that dispersal involved changes in the interactions between Psl and P. aeruginosa cells. Taken together, our results suggest that iron and NO regulate biofilm development via different pathways, both of which include the regulation of Psl-mediated attachment. Moreover, the addition of an iron chelator worked synergistically with NO in the dispersal of biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Xinyi Zhu"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"},{"name":"Nicolas Barraud"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilm dispersal"},{"word":"iron"},{"word":"nitric oxide"}]},"article123":{"pmid":"30478163","title":"In Vivo Applicability of Neosartorya fischeri Antifungal Protein 2 (NFAP2) in Treatment of Vulvovaginal Candidiasis.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"As a consequence of emerging numbers of vulvovaginitis cases caused by azole-resistant and biofilm-forming Candida species, fast and efficient treatment of this infection has become challenging. The problem is further exacerbated by the severe side effects of azoles as long-term-use medications in the recurrent form. There is therefore an increasing demand for novel and safely applicable effective antifungal therapeutic strategies. The small, cysteine-rich, and cationic antifungal proteins from filamentous ascomycetes are potential candidates, as they inhibit the growth of several Candida spp. in vitro; however, no information is available about their in vivo antifungal potency against yeasts. In the present study, we investigated the possible therapeutic application of one of their representatives in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis, Neosartorya fischeri antifungal protein 2 (NFAP2). NFAP2 inhibited the growth of a fluconazole (FLC)-resistant Candida albicans strain isolated from a vulvovaginal infection, and it was effective against both planktonic cells and biofilm in vitro We observed that the fungal cell-killing activity of NFAP2 is connected to its pore-forming ability in the cell membrane. NFAP2 did not exert cytotoxic effects on primary human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts at the MIC in vitro. In vivo murine vulvovaginitis model experiments showed that NFAP2 significantly decreases the number of FLC-resistant C. albicans cells, and combined application with FLC enhances the efficacy.

The ALS family in C. tropicalis, implicated in adhesion and BF, is represented in several CTRG genes. In this study, we determined the biofilm-forming ability, the primary adherence, and the CSH of C. tropicalis, including six isolates from blood and seven from urine cultures. We also compared the expression of four CTRG ALS-like genes (CTRG_01028, CTRG_02293, CTRG_03786, and CTRG_03797) in sessile versus planktonic cells, selected for their possible contribution to BF. All the C. tropicalis strains were biofilm producers, related to its filamentation capacity; all the strains displayed a high adherence ability correlated to the CSH, and all the strains expressed the CTRG genes in both types of growth. Urine isolates present, although not significantly, higher CSH, adherence, and biofilm formation than blood isolates. This study reveals that three CTRG ALS-like genes-except CTRG_03797-were more upregulated in biofilm cells, although with a considerable variation in expression across the strains studied and between the CTRG genes.

Results indicate that binding processes of EPS to TCS are exothermic mainly driven by the enthalpy changes. The proteins components in EPS dominate the interactions between EPS and TCS by hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction.

The glyoxalase Glx3 is an abundant proteomic component of the biofilm extracellular matrix. Here, we document phenotypic studies of a glx3Δ null mutant concerning its role in biofilm formation, filamentation, antifungal drug resistance, cell wall integrity and virulence. First, consistent with its function as glyoxalase, the glx3 null mutant showed impaired growth on media containing glycerol as the carbon source and in the presence of low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Importantly, the glx3Δ mutant showed decreased fitness at 37°C and formed less biofilm as compared to wild type and a reintegrant strain. At the permissive temperature of 28°C, the glx3Δ mutant showed impaired filamentation as well as increased sensitivity to Calcofluor white, Congo red, sodium dodecyl sulfate and zymolyase, indicating subtle alterations in wall architecture even though gross quantitative compositional changes were not detected. Interestingly, and consistent with its impaired filamentation, biofilm formation and growth at 37°C, the glx3Δ mutant is avirulent. Our results underline the role of Glx3 in fungal pathogenesis and the involvement of the fungal wall in this process.","authors":[{"name":"Laura Cabello"},{"name":"Estefanía Gómez-Herreros"},{"name":"Jordan Fernández-Pereira"},{"name":"Sergi Maicas"},{"name":"María Concepción Martínez-Esparza"},{"name":"Piet W J de Groot"},{"name":"Eulogio Valentín"}],"keywords":[]},"article137":{"pmid":"30475408","title":"Excisionase in Pf filamentous prophage controls lysis-lysogeny decision-making in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-08-19","abs":"Pf filamentous prophages are prevalent among clinical and environmental Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Pf4 and Pf5 prophages are integrated into the host genomes of PAO1 and PA14, respectively, and play an important role in biofilm development. However, the genetic factors that directly control the lysis-lysogeny switch in Pf prophages remain unclear. Here, we identified and characterized the excisionase genes in Pf4 and Pf5 (named xisF4 and xisF5, respectively). XisF4 and XisF5 represent two major subfamilies of functional excisionases and are commonly found in Pf prophages. While both of them can significantly promote prophage excision, only XisF5 is essential for Pf5 excision. XisF4 activates Pf4 phage replication by upregulating the phage initiator gene (PA0727). In addition, xisF4 and the neighboring phage repressor c gene pf4r are transcribed divergently and their 5'-untranslated regions overlap. XisF4 and Pf4r not only auto-activate their own expression but also repress each other. Furthermore, two H-NS family proteins, MvaT and MvaU, coordinately repress Pf4 production by directly repressing xisF4. Collectively, we reveal that Pf prophage excisionases cooperate in controlling lysogeny and phage production.","authors":[{"name":"Yangmei Li"},{"name":"Xiaoxiao Liu"},{"name":"Kaihao Tang"},{"name":"Pengxia Wang"},{"name":"Zhenshun Zeng"},{"name":"Yunxue Guo"},{"name":"Xiaoxue Wang"}],"keywords":[]},"article138":{"pmid":"30474730","title":"The Oral Bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum Binds Staphylococcus aureus and Alters Expression of the Staphylococcal Accessory Regulator sarA.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic pathogen member of the nasal and skin microbiota, can also be found in human oral samples and has been linked to infectious diseases of the oral cavity.

To start addressing this question, we assessed S. aureus ability to directly bind selected members of the oral microbiota as well as its ability to integrate into a human-derived complex oral microbial community in vitro.

Our findings lend support to the notion that S. aureus can become part of the complex microbiota of the human mouth, which could serve as a reservoir for S. aureus.

Interest has been accompanied by the development of mathematical models. This contribution simultaneously reviews available models in the scientific literature for anaerobic, aerobic and partial nitritation-anammox granular sludge reactors because they comprise common phenomena (e.g. liquid, gas and granule transport) and thus pose similar challenges. Many of the publications were found to have no clearly defined goal. The importance of a goal is stressed because it determines the appropriate model complexity and helps other potential users to find a suitable model in the vast amount of literature. Secondly, a wide variety was found in the model features. This review explains the chosen modelling assumptions based on the different reactor types and goals wherever possible, but some assumptions appeared to be habitual within fields of research, without clear reason. We therefore suggest further research to more clearly define the range of operational conditions and goals for which certain simplifying assumptions can be made, e.g. when intragranule solute transport can be lumped in apparent kinetics and when biofilm models are needed, which explicitly calculate substrate concentration gradients inside granules. Furthermore, research is needed to better mechanistically understand detachment, removal of influent particulate matter and changes in the mixing behaviour inside anaerobic systems, before these phenomena can be adequately incorporated in models. Finally, it is suggested to perform full-scale model validation studies for aerobic and anammox reactors.

Although relic DNA is expected to increase in MFCs, the effect of relic DNA has not been investigated in the soil MFCs system. In this study the effect of the MFCs on the soil microbial community composition within the soil profile and the influence of relic DNA were investigated. Microbial community analysis revealed that the MFCs deployment significantly influenced the community composition within the soil profile. The phylum Proteobacteria (34.4% vs 23.6%) and the class Deltaproteobacteria (16.8% vs 5.9%) significantly increased in the MFCs compared to the control, while the phylum Firmicutes (24.0% vs 28.7%) and the class Sphingobacteria (5.3% vs 7.0%) were more abundant in the control. Furthermore, the archaeal phyla Euryarchaeota (40.7% vs 52.3%) and Bathyarchaeota (10.1% vs 17.3%) were significantly lower in the MFCs, whereas the phylum Woesearchaeota (DHVEG6) (24.4% vs 19.4%) was slightly enhanced. Moreover, the results showed that relic DNA can affect the relative abundance of Geobacter and Candidatus Methanoperedens, however, it has no significant effects on the microbial community structure.

The challenge of catalyst nanoparticle diffusion into the porous substrate was addressed by using iron coordinated ligand complexes and optimizing the loading percentage of metal salts onto beads. The effect of using tethered bottom up surface processed CNFs on the porous beads' morphologies was established using structural characterization. The protruding architecture of CNFs on the porous carbon surface was subjected to bacterial colonisation in order to determine the efficiency of cell conjugation onto hairy structures, particularly at a low concentration. The interfaces of immobilized bacteria on the textured surface were studied by varying the pH and external physical stimuli to check the biofilm formation.

Biofilm is formed as a structural adherent over the surfaces of host, food and equipments etc. and is further functionally coordinated by certain chemicals produced itself. These chemicals are known as quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecules and are involved in the cross talk at interspecies, intraspecies and interkingdom levels thus resulting in the production of virulence factors leading to pathogenesis. Bacteria possess receptors to sense these chemicals, which interact with the incoming QS molecules. It is followed by the secretion of virulence molecules, regulation of bioluminescence, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance development and motility behavioral responses. In the natural environment, different bacterial species (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) produce QS signaling molecules that are structurally and functionally different. Recent and past research shows that various antagonistic molecules (naturally and chemically synthesized) are characterized to inhibit the formation of biofilm and attenuation of bacterial virulence by blocking the QS receptors. This review article describes about the diverse QS receptors at their structural, functional and production levels. Thus, by blocking these receptors with inhibitory molecules can be a potential therapeutic approach to control pathogenesis.

For this purpose, bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were inoculated on the substrates coated with thin thiol layers (i.e., 1-octanethiol, 1-decanethiol, 1-octadecanethiol, 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid, and 2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride) with varying hydrophobicity and surface potential. The time-resolved adhesion data revealed a transformation from an exponential dependence to a square root dependence on time upon changing the substrate from hydrophobic or hydrophilic with a negative zeta potential value to hydrophilic with a negative zeta potential for both pathogens. The dewetting of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by E. coli O157:H7 was more noticeable on hydrophobic substrates, compared to that of S. aureus, which is attributed to the more amphiphilic nature of staphylococcal EPS. The interplay between the timescale of EPS dewetting and the inverse of the adhesion rate constant modulated the distribution of E. coli O157:H7 within microcolonies and the resultant microcolonial morphology on hydrophobic substrates. Observed trends in the formation of bacterial monolayers rather than multilayers and microcolonies rather than isolated and evenly spaced bacterial cells could be explained by a colloidal model considering van der Waals and electrostatic double-layer interactions only after introducing the contribution of elastic energy due to adhesion-induced deformations at intercellular and substrate-cell interfaces.

In-vitro, monolaurin lipid nanocapsules (ML-LNCs) carrying adsorbed antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) displayed synergistic efficacy against planktonic Staphylococcus aureus, but it has not been demonstrated, neither in-vitro nor in-vivo, that such ML-LNCs penetrate into infectious S. aureus biofilms and maintain synergy with AMPs. This study investigates the release mechanism of AMPs from ML-LNCs and possible antimicrobial synergy of ML-LNCs with the AMPs DPK-060 and LL-37 against S. aureus biofilms in-vitro and in a therapeutic, murine, infected wound-healing model. Zeta potentials demonstrated that AMP release from ML-LNCs was controlled by the AMP concentration in suspension. Both AMPs demonstrated no antimicrobial efficacy against four staphylococcal strains in a planktonic mode, while a checkerboard assay showed synergistic antimicrobial efficacy when ML-LNCs and DPK-060 were combined, but not for combinations of ML-LNCs and LL-37. Similar effects were seen for growth reduction of staphylococcal biofilms, with antimicrobial synergy persisting only for ML-LNCs at the highest level of DPK-060 or LL-37 adsorption. Healing of wounds infected with bioluminescent S. aureus Xen36, treated with ML-LNCs alone, was faster when treated with PBS, while AMPs alone did not yield faster wound-healing than PBS.

Summarizing, antimicrobial synergy of ML-LNCs with adsorbed antimicrobial peptides as seen in-vitro, is absent in in-vivo healing of infected wounds, likely because host AMPs adapted the synergistic role of the AMPs added. Thus, conclusions regarding synergistic antimicrobial efficacy, should not be drawn from planktonic data, while even in-vitro biofilm data bear little relevance for the in-vivo situation.","authors":[{"name":"René T Rozenbaum"},{"name":"Linzhu Su"},{"name":"Anita Umerska"},{"name":"Matthieu Eveillard"},{"name":"Joakim Håkansson"},{"name":"Margit Mahlapuu"},{"name":"Fan Huang"},{"name":"Jianfeng Liu"},{"name":"Zhenkun Zhang"},{"name":"Linqi Shi"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"},{"name":"Prashant K Sharma"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Monolaurin"},{"word":"Nanocapsules"},{"word":"Wound-healing"},{"word":"Zeta potentials"}]},"article180":{"pmid":"30465645","title":"The quantity and distribution of biofilm growth of Escherichia coli strain ATCC 9723 depends on the carbon/energy source.","date":"2020-01-07","abs":"Escherichia coli strain 15 (ATCC 9723) formed robust biofilms of two distinct forms on glass tubes.

The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans contains three genes (NDT80, REP1, and RON1) that encode proteins with similarity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ndt80, although the homology is restricted to the DNA binding domain. To better understand their role in virulence functions, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated gene 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) to delete the three NDT80-family genes. An ndt80Δ mutant showed strong defects in forming hyphae in response to serum or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which was linked to the ability of Ndt80 to regulate the expression of RAS1, an upstream regulator of hyphal signaling. Conversely, the ndt80Δ mutant formed hyphal cells on glycerol medium, indicating that Ndt80 is not required for hyphal growth under all conditions. In contrast to our previously published data, a ron1Δ single mutant could grow and form hyphae in response to GlcNAc. However, deleting RON1 partially restored the ability of an ndt80Δ mutant to form hyphae in response to GlcNAc, indicating a link to GlcNAc signaling. REP1 was required for growth on GlcNAc, as expected, but not for GlcNAc or serum to induce hyphae. The ndt80Δ mutant was defective in growing under stressful conditions, such as elevated temperature, but not the ron1Δ mutant or rep1Δ mutant. Quantitative assays did not reveal any significant differences in the fluconazole susceptibility of the NDT80-family mutants.

The ability of these pathogens to persist and produce infection under the appropriate conditions is also associated with their capacity to form biofilms in the respiratory mucous membranes. Adding to the difficulty of treating biofilm-forming bacteria with antibiotics, many of these strains are becoming multidrug resistant, and thus the alternative therapeutics available for combating this kind of infections are rapidly depleting. Given these concerns, it is urgent to consider other unconventional strategies and, in this regard, phage lysins represent an attractive resource to circumvent some of the current issues in infection treatment. When added exogenously, lysins break specific bonds of the peptidoglycan and have potent bactericidal effects against susceptible bacteria. These enzymes possess interesting features, including that they do not trigger an adverse immune response and raise of resistance is very unlikely.

Using a 96-well plate MIC protocol, we experimentally determined the MIC for each of 12 antibiotics for a virulent strain of S. suis strain that consistently formed biofilms using a standard crystal violet assay. Using this static biofilm assay, we demonstrated that sub-MICs of bacitracin, carbadox, chlortetracycline, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, neomycin, sulfadimethoxine, tiamulin, and tylosin did not increase S. suis biofilms.

We report results from a full-scale DWDS facility used to develop biofilms naturally, under one of three chlorine concentrations: Low, Medium, or High. Increasing the chlorine concentration reduced the bacterial concentration within the biofilms but quantities of fungi were unaffected. The chlorine regime was influential in shaping the community structure and composition of both taxa. There were microbial members common to all biofilms but the abundance of these varied such that at the end of the Growth phase the communities from each regime were distinct. Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-proteobacteria were the most abundant bacterial classes; Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Microbotryomycetes were the most abundant classes of fungi. Mechanical cleaning was shown to immediately reduce the bacterial and fungal concentrations, followed by a lag effect on the microbiome with continued decreases in quantity and ecological indices after cleaning. However, an established community remained, which recovered such that the microbial compositions at the end of the Re-growth and initial Growth phases were similar. Interestingly, the High-chlorine biofilms showed a significant elevation in bacterial concentrations at the end of the Re-growth (after cleaning) compared the initial Growth, unlike the other regimes. This suggests adaptation to a form a resilient biofilm with potentially equal or greater risks to water quality as the other regimes.

Life-threatening chronic infections by P. aeruginosa have been shown to involve biofilm formation, proliferation and the release of quorum-sensing signaling molecules.

An extensive repertoire of genetic, molecular biological, and biochemical tools has been developed for this fast-growing, easily cultivated haloarchaeon, including expression vectors and gene-deletion strategies, including CRISPR. Its low mutation rate and ability to grow on defined media allow straightforward application of methods such as metabolic labeling, and the sequenced genome laid the foundation for transcriptomics and proteomics studies. These tools have allowed examination of key pathways such as transcription, noncoding RNAs, protein synthesis and degradation, protein glycosylation, motility, and biofilm formation.

Presented here is a bioinspired strategy for self-cleaning anti-thrombotic surfaces using actuating surface topography. As a first test, wrinkled polydimethylsiloxane planar surfaces are constructed that can repeatedly transition between smooth and wrinkled states. When placed in contact with blood, these surfaces display markedly less platelet deposition than control samples. Second, for the specific application of prosthetic vascular grafts, the potential of using pulse pressure, i.e. the continual variation of blood pressure between systole and diastole, to drive topographic actuation was investigated. Soft cylindrical tubes with a luminal surface that transitioned between smooth and wrinkled states were constructed. Upon exposure to blood under continual pressure pulsation, these cylindrical tubes also showed reduced platelet deposition versus control samples under the same fluctuating pressure conditions. In both planar and cylindrical cases, significant reductions in thrombotic deposition were observed, even when the wrinkles had wavelengths of several tens of μm, far larger than individual platelets. We speculate that the observed thrombo-resistance behavior is attributable to a biofilm delamination process in which the bending energy within the biofilm overcomes interfacial adhesion. This novel strategy to reduce thrombotic deposition may be applicable to several types of medical devices placed into the circulatory system, particularly vascular grafts.","authors":[{"name":"Luka Pocivavsek"},{"name":"Sang-Ho Ye"},{"name":"Joseph Pugar"},{"name":"Edith Tzeng"},{"name":"Enrique Cerda"},{"name":"Sachin Velankar"},{"name":"William R Wagner"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Active surfaces"},{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Dynamic topography"},{"word":"Platelet deposition"},{"word":"Pulsatile flow"},{"word":"Thrombosis"}]},"article206":{"pmid":"30458255","title":"Decrease of growth, biofilm and secreted virulence in opportunistic nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 25619 by glycyrrhetinic acid.","date":"2019-03-04","abs":"The present study elucidates the antibiofilm and antivirulent capability of glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 25619.

Cell surface proteins are, however, challenging to characterize because of their low abundance and poor solubility. Moreover, cell surface protein extracts are usually contaminated with cytoplasmic proteins that constitute the main signal in proteomic analysis. This study aimed to compare the efficiency of three methods to extract and explore surface proteins of L. monocytogenes growing in a biofilm: trypsin shaving, biotinylation, and cell fractionation. Peptide separation and identification were performed by shotgun proteomics using high-performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The biotinylation method was the most effective in extracting surface proteins, with the lowest rate of contamination by cytoplasmic proteins. Although presenting a higher contamination rate in cytoplasmic proteins, the other two techniques allowed the identification of additional surface proteins. Seven proteins were commonly retrieved by the three methods. The extracted proteins belong to several functional classes, involved in virulence, transport, or metabolic pathways. Finally, the three extraction methods seemed complementary and their combined use improved the exploration of the bacterial surface proteome.

Most of what we know about neutrophil responses to bacteria is based on in vitro assays that use planktonic bacteria and isolated/preactivated neutrophils, which makes interpretation of the neutrophil responses to bacteria a challenge. An understanding of how neutrophils differentially interact with and respond to commensal and pathogenic oral bacteria is necessary in order to further understand the neutrophil's role in maintaining oral health and the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. In this study, a flow cytometry-based in vitro assay was developed to characterize neutrophil activation states based on CD marker expressions in response to oral monospecies bacterial biofilms. Using this approach, changes in CD marker expressions in response to specific prominent oral commensal and pathogenic bacteria were assayed. Several functional assays, including assays for phagocytosis, production of reactive oxygen species, activation of the transcription factor Nrf2, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and myeloperoxidase release, were also performed to correlate neutrophil function with CD marker expression.

Because the key metabolic mechanisms in the surfactin synthesis pathway remain unclear, genetic engineering approaches are all ending up with a single or a few gene modifications. The aim of this study is to develop a systematic engineering approach to improve the biosynthesis of surfactin. First, we restored surfactin biosynthetic activity by integrating a complete sfp gene into the nonproducing Bacillus subtilis 168 strain and obtained a surfactin titer of 0.4 g/l. Second, we reduced competition by deleting biofilm formation-related genes and nonribosomal peptide synthetases/polyketide synthase pathways (3.8% of the total genome), which increased the surfactin titer by 3.3-fold. Third, we improved cellular tolerance to surfactin by overexpressing potential self-resistance-associated proteins, which further increased the surfactin titer by 8.5-fold. Fourth, we increased the supply of precursor branched-chain fatty acids by engineering the branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, resulting in an increase of the surfactin titer to 8.5 g/l (a 20.3-fold increase). Finally, due to the preference of the glycolytic pathway for cell growth, we diverted precursor acetyl-CoA away from cell growth to surfactin biosynthesis by enhancing the transcription of srfA. The final surfactin titer increased to 12.8 g/l, with a yield of 65.0 mmol/mol sucrose (42% of the theoretical yield) in the metabolically engineered strain.

Such tandem repeats are conserved for BAPs across different bacterial species, but the function of these domains is not completely understood. In this work, we report the first study of the mechanical stability of the BapA protein. Using magnetic tweezers, we show that the folding of BapA BIg domains requires calcium binding and the folded domains have differential mechanical stabilities. Importantly, we identify that >100 nM concentration of calcium is needed for folding of the BIg domains, and the stability of the folded BIg domains is regulated by calcium over a wide concentration range from sub-micromolar (μM) to millimolar (mM). Only at mM calcium concentrations, as found in the extracellular environment, do the BIg domains have the saturated mechanical stability.

They have long been associated with microbially dominated ecosystems and often occur in close proximity to, or embedded within, stromatolites, yet have historically been thought to form solely through physicochemical processes. Numerous studies have revealed both constructive and destructive roles for microbes colonizing the surfaces of modern calcitic and aragonitic ooids, but there has been little evidence for the operation of these processes during the Archean and Proterozoic, when both ooids and microbially dominated ecosystems were more widespread. Recently described carbonate ooids from the 2.9 Ga Pongola Supergroup, South Africa, include well-preserved examples composed of diagenetic dolomite interpreted to have formed from a high-Mg-calcite precursor. Spatial distributions of organic matter and elements associated with metabolic activity (N, S, and P) were interpreted as evidence for a biologically induced origin. Here, we describe exceptionally well-preserved ooids composed of calcite, collected from Earth's oldest known carbonate lake system, the ~2.72 Ga Meentheena Member (Tumbiana Formation), Fortescue Group, Western Australia. We used optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, SEM-EDS, LA-ICP-MS, EA-IRMS, and a novel micro-XRF instrument to investigate an oolite shoal deposited between stromatolites that preserve abundant evidence for microbial activity. We report an extremely fine, radial-concentric, calcitic microfabric that is similar to the primary and early diagenetic fabrics of calcitic ooids reported from modern temperate lakes. Early diagenetic silica has trapped isotopically light and thermally mature organic matter. The close association of organic matter with mineral phases and microfabrics related to primary and early diagenetic processes suggest incorporation of organic matter occurred during accretion, likely due to the presence of microbial biofilms. We conclude that the oldest known calcitic ooids were likely formed through processes similar to those that mediate the accretion of ooids in similar environments today, including formation within a microbial biosphere.","authors":[{"name":"David T Flannery"},{"name":"Abigail C Allwood"},{"name":"Robert Hodyss"},{"name":"Roger Everett Summons"},{"name":"Michael Tuite"},{"name":"Malcolm R Walter"},{"name":"Kenneth H Williford"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Archean"},{"word":"Tumbiana Formation"},{"word":"biosignature"},{"word":"microbialite"},{"word":"ooid"}]},"article234":{"pmid":"30450086","title":"Causes and Consequences of a Variant Strain of Phaeobacter inhibens With Reduced Competition.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Phaeobacter inhibens 2.10 is an effective biofilm former and colonizer of marine surfaces and has the ability to outcompete other microbiota.

The counter diffusion of oxygen and electron donors in MABRs leads to unique behavior, and we hypothesized it also could impact predation. We used optical coherence tomography (OCT), microsensor analyses, and mathematical modeling to investigate predation in membrane-aerated biofilms (MABs). When protozoa were excluded from the inoculum, the MAB's OCT-observable void fraction was around 5%. When protozoa were included, the void fraction grew to nearly 50%, with large, continuous voids at the base of the biofilm. Real-time OCT imaging showed highly motile protozoa in the voids. MABs with protozoa and a high bulk COD (270 mg/L) only had 4% void fraction. DNA sequencing revealed a high relative abundance of amoeba in both high and low-COD MABs. Flagellates were only abundant in the low-COD MAB. Modeling also suggested a relationship between substrate concentrations, diffusion mode (co- or counter-diffusion), and biofilm void fraction. Results suggest that amoeba proliferate in the biofilm interior, especially in the aerobic zones.

Under favourable conditions, they can colonize the vulvovaginal mucosa, giving rise to symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). The mechanism by which Candida spp. produces inflammation is unknown. Both, the blastoconidia and the pseudohyphae are capable of destroying the vaginal epithelium by direct invasion. Although the symptoms are not always related to the fungal burden, in general, VVC is associated with a greater number of yeasts and pseudohyphae. Some years ago, C. albicans was the species most frequently involved in the different forms of VVC. However, infections by different species have emerged during the last two decades producing an increase in causative species of VVC such as C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei and C. tropicalis. Candida species are pathogenic organisms that have two forms of development: planktonic and biofilm. A biofilm is defined as a community of microorganisms attached to a surface and encompassed by an extracellular matrix. This form of presentation gives microorganisms greater resistance to antifungal agents. This review, about Candia spp. with a special emphasis on Candida albicans discusses specific areas such as biofilm structure and development, cell morphology and biofilm formation, biofilm-associated gene expression, the cell surface and adherence, the extracellular matrix, biofilm metabolism, and biofilm drug resistance in vulvovaginitis biofilms as an important virulence factor in fungi.","authors":[{"name":"Carmen Rodríguez-Cerdeira"},{"name":"Miguel Carnero Gregorio"},{"name":"Alberto Molares-Vila"},{"name":"Adriana López-Barcenas"},{"name":"Gabriella Fabbrocini"},{"name":"Brunilda Bardhi"},{"name":"Ardiana Sinani"},{"name":"Elena Sánchez-Blanco"},{"name":"Roberto Arenas-Guzmán"},{"name":"Rigoberto Hernandez-Castro"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungals"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Candida spp."},{"word":"Probiotics"},{"word":"Vulvovaginal candidiasis"}]},"article245":{"pmid":"30447422","title":"Hydrogen peroxide stimulates uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains to cellulose production.","date":"2019-03-04","abs":"Reactive oxygen intermediates, such as hydrogen peroxide, are toxic molecules produced by immune cells in response to bacterial invasion into the host. Bacteria try to protect themselves against the immune system through specific properties such as biofilm formation. This phenomenon occurs also during urinary tract infections. Cellulose is an important factor of Escherichia coli biofilm and contributes to building a protective shield around bacterial cells upon the host immune response. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the production of this biofilm component. To achieve this goal, 25 clinical E. coli strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections were used. These bacterial strains were characterized based on their growth characteristics, their ability to form biofilm and their capacity to produce cellulose upon exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide growth, and the biofilm formation of these strains was analyzed. Our results revealed that the analyzed uropathogenic E. coli strains slightly, but significantly, reduced growth and biofilm production upon hydrogen peroxide treatment. However, when separating these strains regarding their ability to produce cellulose, we found that general biofilm production was reduced but cellulose expression was induced upon peroxide treatment. This finding contributes to a better understanding of how bacterial biofilm formation is triggered and provides interesting insights into how uropathogenic E. coli protect themselves in an inhospitable environment.","authors":[{"name":"Wioletta Adamus-Białek"},{"name":"Tara L Vollmerhausen"},{"name":"Katrin Janik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"Cellulose"},{"word":"ROIs"},{"word":"UPEC"}]},"article246":{"pmid":"30446551","title":"Iron Homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis Requires Siderophore Production and Biofilm Formation.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Iron (Fe) is the most important metal in biology.

To overcome the challenge of Fe acquisition, many microorganisms produce siderophores to retrieve Fe from natural sources. Another ubiquitous feature of bacteria in natural environments is biofilm formation. Previous studies showed that external Fe strongly influenced biofilm formation in several bacteria, suggesting that this microenvironment plays a mechanistic role in micronutrient acquisition for bacteria. Here, we applied a complementary set of analytical methods and deletion mutants to evaluate the role of biofilm formation, siderophore production, and their interaction in Fe homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis We observed that Fe homeostasis, i.e., active growth at a constant intracellular Fe concentration, requires both siderophore production and biofilm formation. Also, we report that in B. subtilis, both biofilm formation and siderophore production are required to achieve active Fe acquisition from the medium and to sustain normal growth. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the formation of biofilm slightly enhances the kinetics of Fe complexation by catechol siderophores and markedly improves siderophore use efficiency. These results provide new perspectives on the mechanism underlying siderophore-based acquisition of Fe in biofilm-forming bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Adrien Rizzi"},{"name":"Sébastien Roy"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Bellenger"},{"name":"Pascale B Beauregard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"iron homeostasis"}]},"article247":{"pmid":"30446550","title":"GlcNAc De-N-Acetylase from the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Sulfolobus solfataricus is an aerobic crenarchaeal hyperthermophile with optimum growth at temperatures greater than 80°C and pH 2 to 4.

Objective: Populus trichocarpa extract's capability to attenuate quorum sensing-regulated virulence and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus is described. Methods: PT13, an ARP obtained from P. trichocarpa, was tested for its activity against S. aureus using the broth microdilution test; a crystal-violet biofilm assay was performed under a scanning electron microscope. The production of various virulence factors was estimated with PT13 treatment. Microarray gene expression profiling of PT13-treated S. aureus was conducted and compared with an untreated control. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) was estimated to observe the PT13 inhibition activity. Results: PT13 was antimicrobial toward S. aureus at different concentrations and showed a similar growth rate in the presence and absence of PT13 at concentrations ≤8 μg/mL. Biofilm production was interrupted even at low concentrations, and biofilm-related genes were down-regulated when exposed to PT13. The genes encoding cell adhesion and bacterial attachment protein were the major genes suppressed by PT13. In addition, hemolysins, clumping activity, and EPS production of S. aureus decreased after treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Conclusions: A long-chain PT13 with effective actions that, even at low concentration levels, not only regulated the gene expression in the producer organism but also blocked the virulence gene expression in this Gram-positive human pathogen is described. Highlights: We identified a PT13 as a potential antivirulence agent that regulated production of bacterial virulence determinants (e.g., toxins, enzymes and biofilm), downwards and it may be a promising anti-virulence agent to be further developed as an anti-infective agent.","authors":[{"name":"Raid Al Akeel"},{"name":"Ayesha Mateen"},{"name":"Rabbani Syed"}],"keywords":[]},"article250":{"pmid":"30445283","title":"Prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility and characterization of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from dairy industries in north-central and north-eastern Greece.","date":"2019-02-21","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of food intoxication, whereas methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) constitutes a serious public-health concern due to its ability to colonize and infect humans and animals.

The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence and the antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus and MRSA in four Greek dairy industries, to identify virulence factors of MRSA isolates and to describe their genetic diversity, in order to identify possible epidemiological links and evaluate the risk of MRSA dissemination to the community. S. aureus was isolated from 67 out of 305 (22.0%) dairy industry samples (bulk-tank milk, dairy products, employee nasal swabs and equipment/surface swabs). Almost all (99%) of the 227 corresponding S. aureus isolates (approximately 4 isolates per positive sample) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial and 22% were multi-drug resistant (MDR). MRSA were isolated from 11 different samples (3.6%) originating from three of the dairy plants. All MRSA isolates were capable of forming biofilms, while staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes were detected in 91% of the MRSA isolates, with sec being the most frequent. All of the MRSA isolates harbored the mecA gene but the mecC and Pandon-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) genes were not detected. Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed genetic diversity among the MRSA isolates and indicated clonal circulation in one of the dairy plants. Seven spa types were identified among the MRSA isolates with the most prevalent (t065) isolated only in one dairy plant. Certain spa types (t065, t337 and t3536) were isolated for the first time in Greece. The presence of MDR, biofilm-forming and enterotoxigenic MRSA strains in dairy plant facilities may lead to their dissemination to the community, but also to staphylococcal food poisoning, when conditions are favorable.

We report here a simple method to create thin (∼30 μm) conformal lubricating hydrogel coatings on catheters. The key to this method is a three-step process including shape-forming, gradient cross-linking, and swell-peeling (we label this method as SGS). First, we took advantage of the fast gelation of agar to form a hydrogel layer conformal to catheters; then, we performed a surface-bound UV cross-linking of acrylamide mixed in agar in open air, purposely allowing gradual oxygen inhibition of free radicals to generate a gradient of cross-linking density across the hydrogel layer; and finally, we caused the hydrogel to swell to let the non-cross-linked/loosely attached hydrogel fall off, leaving behind a surface-bound, thin, and mostly uniform hydrogel coating. This method also allowed easy incorporation of different polymerizable monomers to obtain multifunctionality. For example, incorporating an antifouling, zwitterionic moiety sulfobetaine in the hydrogel reduced both in vitro protein adsorption and in vivo foreign-body response in mice. The addition of a biocidal N-halamine monomer to the hydrogel coating deactivated both Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus) and Escherichia coli ( E. coli) O157:H7 within 30 min of contact and reduced biofilm formation by 90% compared to those of uncoated commercial catheters when challenged with S. aureus for 3 days. The lubricating, antibiofouling hydrogel coating may bring clinical benefits in the use of urinary and venous catheters as well as other types of medical devices.","authors":[{"name":"You Yong"},{"name":"Mingyu Qiao"},{"name":"Alan Chiu"},{"name":"Stephanie Fuchs"},{"name":"Qingsheng Liu"},{"name":"Yehudah Pardo"},{"name":"Randy Worobo"},{"name":"Zheng Liu"},{"name":"Minglin Ma"}],"keywords":[]},"article266":{"pmid":"30441540","title":"3D Bioprinting of Cyanobacteria for Solar-driven Bioelectricity Generation in Resource-limited Environments.","date":"2019-10-30","abs":"We demonstrate a hybrid biological photovoltaic device by forming a 3D cooperative biofilm of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. 3D bioprinting technique was applied to engineer a cyanobacterial encapsulation in hydrogels over the heterotrophic bacteria.

Oral mycoses, mostly affecting mucosae, are mainly caused by the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. They become relevant in denture-wearers elderly people, in diabetic patients, and in immunocompromised individuals. Differently, bacteria are responsible for other pathologies, such as dental caries, gingivitis and periodontitis, which affect even immune-competent individuals. An appropriate oral hygiene can avoid (or at least ameliorate) such pathologies: the regular and correct use of toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash helps prevent oral infections. Interestingly, little or no information is available on the effects (if any) of mouthwashes on the composition of oral microbiota in healthy individuals. Therefore, by means of in vitro models, we assessed the effects of alcohol-free commercial mouthwashes, with different composition (4 with chlorhexidine digluconate, 1 with fluoride, 1 with essential oils, 1 with cetylpyridinium chloride and 1 with triclosan), on several virulence traits of C. albicans, and a group of viridans streptococci, commonly colonizing the oral cavity. For the study here described, a reference strain of C. albicans and of streptococci isolates from pharyngeal swabs were used. Chlorhexidine digluconate- and cetylpyridinium chloride-containing mouthwashes were the most effective in impairing C. albicans capacity to adhere to both abiotic and biotic surfaces, to elicit proinflammatory cytokine secretion by oral epithelial cells and to escape intracellular killing by phagocytes. In addition, these same mouthwashes were effective in impairing biofilm formation by a group of viridans streptococci that, notoriously, cooperate with the cariogenic S. mutans, facilitating the establishment of biofilm by the latter. Differently, these mouthwashes were ineffective against other viridans streptococci that are natural competitors of S. mutans. Finally, by an in vitro model of mixed biofilm, we showed that mouthwashes-treated S. salivarius overall failed to impair C. albicans capacity to form a biofilm. In conclusion, the results described here suggest that chlorhexidine- and cetylpyridinium-containing mouthwashes may be effective in regulating microbial homeostasis of the oral cavity, by providing a positive balance for oral health. On the other side, chlorhexidine has several side effects that must be considered when prescribing mouthwashes containing this molecule.","authors":[{"name":"Andrea Ardizzoni"},{"name":"Eva Pericolini"},{"name":"Simona Paulone"},{"name":"Carlotta Francesca Orsi"},{"name":"Anna Castagnoli"},{"name":"Ilaria Oliva"},{"name":"Elena Strozzi"},{"name":"Elisabetta Blasi"}],"keywords":[]},"article268":{"pmid":"30439531","title":"Antimicrobial efficacy of methylene blue-mediated photodynamic therapy on titanium alloy surfaces in vitro.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"Bacterial elimination using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been considered an alternative therapeutic modality in peri-implantitis treatment.

The effects of different MB concentrations (50, 100, and 200 μg/mL), the pH of the MB (4, 7, and 10), and irradiation time (0, 30, and 60 s) on the bacterial viability and residual lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels were examined. The variations in the pH of the MB solution after aPDT for 60 s on the uncontaminated and contaminated specimens were also detected. The experimental results indicated that MB-mediated PDT could effectively kill the majority of bacteria on the titanium alloy surfaces of biofilm-contaminated implants compared with the MB alone. Of note, aPDT exhibited better antibacterial efficacy with increase in the MB concentration and irradiation time. While treated in an acidic solution on the biofilm-contaminated specimens, aPDT caused the pH to increase. By contrast, the initially high alkaline pH decreased to a value of about pH 8.5 after aPDT. Intriguingly, the neutral pH had minor changes, independent of the MB concentration and bacterial species. As expected, aPDT with higher MB concentration at higher pH environment significantly lowered the LPS concentration of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis. On the basis of the data, the aPDT with 200 μg/mL MB at pH 10 for 60 s of irradiation time might be an effectively treatment to eliminate bacteria and LPS adherent to titanium surface, however, the use of the multispecies biofilm model and the evaluation of in vitro osteogenesis needed to be further evaluated.","authors":[{"name":"Tsun-Chin Huang"},{"name":"Chun-Ju Chen"},{"name":"Shinn-Jyh Ding"},{"name":"Chun-Cheng Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial activity"},{"word":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"Lipopolysaccharide"},{"word":"Methylene blue"},{"word":"Peri-implantitis"},{"word":"Photodynamic therapy"}]},"article269":{"pmid":"30439530","title":"Manual dexterity and dental biofilm accumulation in independent older adults without hand disabilities: A cross-sectional study.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"This study investigated the relationship between manual dexterity and dental biofilm accumulation in independent older Koreans using Quantitative Light-Induced Fluorescence-Digital (QLF-D).","authors":[{"name":"Na-Ri Shin"},{"name":"Jun-Seon Choi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Manual dexterity"},{"word":"Mature dental biofilm"},{"word":"Quantitative light-induced fluorescence–digital"}]},"article270":{"pmid":"30439400","title":"Antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities of cinnamaldehyde against S. epidermidis.","date":"2019-03-04","abs":"The search for new antimicrobial drugs has been necessary due to the increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics currently in use, and natural products play an important role in this field.

We have focused on the extensive microdiversity of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp., which is a dominant member of the dense phototrophic biofilms in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. From deep amplicon sequencing of many loci and statistical analyses of these data, we showed previously that the population has undergone an unexpectedly high degree of homologous recombination, unlinking synonymous SNP-pair correlations even on intragenic length scales. Here, we analyze the genic amino acid diversity, which provides new evidence of selection and insights into the evolutionary history of the population. Surprisingly, some features of the data, including the spectrum of distances between genic-alleles, appear consistent with primarily asexual neutral drift. Yet the non-synonymous site frequency spectrum has too large an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms to result from negative selection on deleterious mutations given the distribution of coalescent times that we infer. And our previous analyses showed that the population is not asexual. Taken together, these apparently contradictory data suggest that selection, epistasis, and hitchhiking all play essential roles in generating and stabilizing the diversity. We discuss these as well as potential roles of ecological niches at genomic and genic levels. From quantitative properties of the diversity and comparative genomic data, we infer aspects of the history and inter-spring dispersal of the meta-population since it was established in the Yellowstone Caldera.

However, the bacteria must then swim to pores and down into the deeper crypt tissues that they ultimately colonize. A number of positive and negative regulators control syp expression and biofilm formation, but until recently the environmental inputs controlling this clash between opposing regulatory mechanisms have been unclear. Thompson et al. have now shown that Syp-mediated biofilms can be repressed by a well-known host-derived molecule: nitric oxide.

However, many bacterial biofilms efficiently resist wetting by water, oil or even organic solvents. Here, we demonstrate how exposing the surface of mature biofilm colonies to concentrated ethanol, saline or glucose solutions results in topographical changes that enable their wettability. With this approach, even omniphobic biofilm colonies become wettable towards aqueous solutions and oils. As a result of this reduced liquid repellency, the biofilms become susceptible to erosion by water which allows for their removal from the substrate they have been grown on. Moreover, bacteria within pre-treated biofilms can now be inactivated with antibiotic solutions. Thus, the biofilm treatment strategy presented here presents a new stepping stone for fighting biofilms in either industrial or medical settings.","authors":[{"name":"Carolina Falcón García"},{"name":"Felix Stangl"},{"name":"Alexandra Götz"},{"name":"Weining Zhao"},{"name":"Stephan A Sieber"},{"name":"Madeleine Opitz"},{"name":"Oliver Lieleg"}],"keywords":[]},"article289":{"pmid":"30426373","title":"Cyhalothrin biodegradation in Cunninghamella elegans.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The insecticide λ-cyhalothrin was incubated with planktonic and biofilm cultures of the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.

However, due to the slow growth of anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria (AnAOB), drawbacks including long startup time and sensitivity to toxins still hamper the application of anammox-based processes. To cope with the slow growth of AnAOB, various bioreactor configurations have been investigated for the capability of retaining anammox biomass, among which, the expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor is a promising option. In this study, two laboratory-scale EGSB reactors were used to gain insights of microbial population and their response to amending biofilm-carriers, aiming to enhance the biomass retention of AnAOB. The respective ammonium and nitrite removal efficiencies were up to over 90%, and the overall nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) was stable at over 70%, in the EGSB reactor amended with carriers (CEGSB). Compared to the control EGSB, CEGSB's observed performance was more stable during the 236-day operational period. The abundance of AnAOB reached 22% in the EGSB and 49% in the CEGSB.

Some experiments, such as stepwise selection of vancomycin-resistant strains, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), antimicrobial susceptibility test, population analysis profile-area under the curve (PAP-AUC), molecular typing, transmission electron microscopy, δ-hemolysin expression, autolysis assay, biofilm assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for gene expression were carried out to compare the derivated bacteria with their parental strains. Results showed that the observed phenotypes of vancomycin-resistant strains such as hemolysin, autolysis and biofilm significantly reduced, which were associated with vancomycin resistance capability of the selected strain. The changes of phenotype and regulatory genes expression were inversely proportional to the vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MICvan). Most heterogeneous vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) or VISA strains belonged to spa type t570 and agr group II. In summary, the clinical isolated vancomycin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VSSA), hVISA and VISA could be derivated into high vancomycin-resistant VISA in vitro, but it was difficult for them to develop into vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA).

Antibiotics are widely applied in livestock husbandry to maintain animal health and productivity, thus contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant livestock and human pathogens, and pose a significant public health threat. Effect of antibiotic pressure on S. aureus biofilm formation, as well as the mechanism, remains unclear. In this study, the regulatory mechanism of low concentration of ampicillin on S. aureus biofilm formation was elucidated. The viability and biomass of biofilm with and without 1/4 MIC ampicillin treatment for 8 h were determined by XTT and crystal violet straining assays, respectively. Transcriptomics analysis on ampicillin-induced and non-ampicillin-induced biofilms were performed by RNA-sequencing, differentially expressed genes identification and annotation, GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment. The viability and biomass of ampicillin-induced biofilm showed dramatical increase compared to the non-ampicillin-induced biofilm. A total of 530 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with 167 and 363 genes showing up- and down-regulation, respectively, were obtained. Upon GO functional enrichment, 183, 252, and 21 specific GO terms in biological process, molecular function and cellular component were identified, respectively. Eight KEGG pathways including Microbial metabolism in diverse environments, S. aureus infection, and Monobactam biosynthesis were significantly enriched. In addition, beta-lactam resistance pathway was also highly enriched. In ampicillin-induced biofilm, the significant up-regulation of genes encoding multidrug resistance efflux pump AbcA, penicillin binding proteins PBP1, PBP1a/2, and PBP3, and antimicrobial resistance proteins VraF, VraG, Dlt, and Aur indicated the positive response of S. aureus to ampicillin.

Here, we show that another cue, temperature, modulates P. aeruginosa CRISPR-Cas. Increased CRISPR adaptation occurs at environmental (i.e., low) temperatures compared to that at body (i.e., high) temperature. This increase is a consequence of the accumulation of CRISPR-Cas complexes, coupled with reduced P. aeruginosa growth rate at the lower temperature, the latter of which provides additional time prior to cell division for CRISPR-Cas to patrol the cell and successfully eliminate and/or acquire immunity to foreign DNA. Analyses of a QS mutant and synthetic QS compounds show that the QS and temperature cues act synergistically. The diversity and level of phage encountered by P. aeruginosa in the environment exceed that in the human body, presumably warranting increased reliance on CRISPR-Cas at environmental temperatures.","authors":[{"name":"Nina Molin Høyland-Kroghsbo"},{"name":"Katrina Arcelia Muñoz"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CRISPR"},{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"growth rate"},{"word":"phage"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article297":{"pmid":"30424731","title":"Comparative study of virulence factors among methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates.","date":"2019-01-11","abs":"Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is recognized worldwide as a leading cause of hospital and community infections.

DMAHDM was incorporated into a composite at mass% of 0%, 0.75%, 1.5%, 2.25% and 3%. A commercial composite Heliomolar served as a comparative control. A biofilm model consisting of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis) and Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii) was tested by growing biofilms for 48 h and 72 h on composites. Colony-forming units (CFUs), metabolic activity and live/dead staining were evaluated. Lactic acid and polysaccharide productions were measured to assess biofilm cariogenicity. TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the proportion of each species in the biofilm. DMAHDM-containing composite had a strong anti-biofilm function, reducing biofilm CFU by 2-3 orders of magnitude, compared to control composite. Biofilm metabolic activity, lactic acid and polysaccharides were decreased substantially, compared to control (p < 0.05). At 72 h, the cariogenic S. mutans proportion in the biofilm on the composite with 3% DMAHDM was 19.9%. In contrast, an overwhelming S. mutans proportion of 92.2% and 91.2% existed in biofilms on commercial control and 0% DMAHDM, respectively. In conclusion, incorporating DMAHDM into dental composite: (1) yielded potent anti-biofilm properties; (2) modulated the biofilm species composition toward a non-cariogenic tendency.

Therapy of these infections is problematic due to the remarkable intrinsic antimicrobial resistance of the species and to acquired resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. As this organism is a low-grade pathogen, the pathogenesis of S. maltophilia infections involves numerous virulence factors as well as the ability of bacterial cells to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces and host tissues. The present review summarizes the literature data regarding extracellular and cell-associated virulence factors of S. maltophilia (some of which have still not been studied in detail) and considers the basic characteristics of biofilm formation. Many virulence features such as extracellular enzymes, bacterial motility and biofilm formation are finely controlled by quorum sensing (QS) that enable the bacteria to express these virulence factors in a coordinated, cell-density-dependent manner and overwhelm the host defence mechanisms. Manipulating the QS regulatory system is a promising approach for development of new strategies for control of S. maltophilia infections.","authors":[{"name":"Angelina Trifonova"},{"name":"Tanya Strateva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"Virulence factors"}]},"article311":{"pmid":"30422688","title":"Anti-biofilm effects of gold and silver nanoparticles synthesized by the Rhodiola rosea rhizome extracts.","date":"2019-06-17","abs":"Bacterial biofilm represents a major problem in medicine. They colonize and damage medical devices and implants and, in many cases, foster development of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Biofilm development starts by bacterial attachment to the surface and the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The EPS forms a structural scaffold for dividing bacterial cells. The EPS layers also play a protective role, preventing the access of antibiotics to biofilm-associated microorganisms. The aim of this work was to investigate the production nanoparticles that could be used to inhibit biofilm formation. The applied production procedure from rhizome extracts of Rhodiola rosea is simple and environmentally friendly, as it requires no additional reducing, stabilizing and capping agents. The produced nanoparticles were stable and crystalline in nature with an average diameter of 13-17 nm for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and 15-30 nm for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis revealed the concentration of synthesized nanoparticles as 3.3 and 5.3 mg/ml for AuNPs and AgNPs, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy detected the presence of flavonoids, terpenes and phenols on the nanoparticle surface, which could be responsible for reducing the Au and Ag salts to nanoparticles and further stabilizing them. Furthermore, we explored the AgNPs for inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli biofilms. AgNPs exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50 and 100 µg/ml, against P. aeruginosa and E. coli, respectively. The respective minimum bactericidal concentrations were 100 and 200 µg/ml. These results suggest that using the rhizome extracts of the medicinal plant R. rosea represents a viable route for green production of nanoparticles with anti-biofilm effects.","authors":[{"name":"Priyanka Singh"},{"name":"Santosh Pandit"},{"name":"Mariam Beshay"},{"name":"V R S S Mokkapati"},{"name":"Jørgen Garnaes"},{"name":"Mikael Emil Olsson"},{"name":"Abida Sultan"},{"name":"Aiga Mackevica"},{"name":"Ramona Valentina Mateiu"},{"name":"Henrik Lütken"},{"name":"Anders Egede Daugaard"},{"name":"Anders Baun"},{"name":"Ivan Mijakovic"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"gold nanoparticles"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"}]},"article312":{"pmid":"30421690","title":"Transmission of Staphylococcus aureus from dry surface biofilm (DSB) via different types of gloves.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"Pathogens can survive for extended periods when incorporated into biofilm on dry hospital surfaces (ie, dry-surface biofilm, DSB).

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, CA significantly inhibited the formation of biofilm, the ability of swarming, and virulence factors including protease and elastase activities and rhamnolipid and pyocyanin production.

Tobacco smoke has been demonstrated as a contributor to various infection diseases by improving the biofilm formation of multiple bacterial species; however, the association between tobacco smoke and S. epidermidis biofilm is still unclear. In this study, we tested the effect of nicotine, one of the most active components of tobacco, on S. epidermidis biofilm formation, and we studied the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that nicotine promoted the biofilm formation of S. epidermidis 1457 strain (SE1457) and enhanced its initial attachment to a polyethylene surface as well as polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) production. In addition, an increased extracellular DNA release and a higher autolysis rate of SE1457 was detected after nicotine treatment, which was consistent with the increased ratio of dead cells in nicotine-treated SE1457 biofilm observed with confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Furthermore, the effect of nicotine on several autolysis-related and biofilm-related gene knockout mutants of SE1457 was tested. It showed that in ΔsaeRS, ΔlytSR, and ΔsceD, nicotine induced increase in biofilm formation was similar to that in SE1457; but in ΔarlRS, ΔatlE, and ΔicaC, the effect was obviously impaired. Consistently, the increase of the bacterial autolysis rate in ΔarlRS and ΔatlE induced by nicotine was not as significant as that in SE1457. Meanwhile, the growth inhibition of nicotine on SE1457 was observed, and it was much less on ΔarlRS and restored by the arlRS complementation. The arlRS transcription in SE1457 was inhibited by nicotine during cultivation as indicated by a promoter reporter assay using green fluoresent protein.

However, during therapy, bacteria are unavoidably exposed to lower antibiotic concentrations, and sub-MIC exposure can result in a wide variety of other effects, including the induction of virulence, which can complicate therapy, or horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which can accelerate the spread of resistance genes. Bacterial type I signal peptidase (SPase) is an essential protein that acts at the final step of the general secretory pathway. This pathway is required for the secretion of many proteins, including many required for virulence, and the arylomycins are a class of natural product antibiotics that target SPase. Here, we investigated the consequences of exposing Escherichia coli cultures to sub-MIC levels of an arylomycin. Using multidimensional protein identification technology mass spectrometry, we found that arylomycin treatment inhibits the proper extracytoplasmic localization of many proteins, both those that appear to be SPase substrates and several that do not. The identified proteins are involved in a broad range of extracytoplasmic processes and include a number of virulence factors. The effects of arylomycin on several processes required for virulence were then individually examined, and we found that, at even sub-MIC levels, the arylomycins potently inhibit flagellation, motility, biofilm formation, and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance via HGT. Thus, we conclude that the arylomycins represent promising novel therapeutics with the potential to eradicate infections while simultaneously reducing virulence and the dissemination of resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Shawn I Walsh"},{"name":"David S Peters"},{"name":"Peter A Smith"},{"name":"Arryn Craney"},{"name":"Melissa M Dix"},{"name":"Benjamin F Cravatt"},{"name":"Floyd E Romesberg"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"drug design"},{"word":"secretion"},{"word":"signal peptidase"}]},"article319":{"pmid":"30419743","title":"Targeting bacterial biofilms in pulmonary diseases in pediatric population.","date":"2019-11-06","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Kamal Dua"},{"name":"Gaurav Gupta"},{"name":"Dinesh K Chellappan"},{"name":"Shakti Shukla"},{"name":"Philip M Hansbro"}],"keywords":[]},"article320":{"pmid":"30419487","title":"Activity of quercetin and kaemferol against Streptococcus mutans biofilm.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Nidus Vespae (NV) is the honeycomb of Polistes Olivaceous, P.

Hence, reliable, fast, and reproducible methods for assessing biofilm susceptibility to antimicrobials are strongly needed. Isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) is a nondestructive sensitive technique that allows for the real-time monitoring of microbial viability in the presence or absence of antimicrobial compounds. Therefore, the efficacy of specific antimicrobials, alone or in combination, may be promptly validated supporting the development of new drugs and avoiding the administration of ineffective therapies. Furthermore, the susceptibility of both planktonic and biofilm cells to antimicrobials can be conveniently assessed without the need for elaborated staining procedures and under nontoxic working conditions. Quantitative data regarding the antimicrobial effect against different strains might be collected by monitoring the microbial cell replication, and, more importantly, a dose-dependent activity can be efficiently detected by measuring the delay and decrease in the heat flow peak of the treated samples. A limitation of IMC for anti-biofilm susceptibility test is the inability to directly quantify the non-replicating cells in the biofilm or the total biomass. However, as IMC is a nondestructive method, the samples can be also analyzed by using different techniques, acquiring more information complementary to calorimetric data.

The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) values varied from 62.5 to 1,000 μg/mL, and the effect seems to be due to interference with cell wall biosynthesis. The kinetics assay showed that EO at MICx2 (500 μg/mL) induced a significant (p < 0.05) reduction of the fungal growth after exposure for 8 h. At this concentration, the EO was also able to hinder biofilm formation and reduce Candida spp. monospecies and multispecies in mature biofilm at 24 h and 48 h (p < 0.05). A protective effect on human red blood cells was detected with the EO at concentrations up to 750 μg/mL, as well as an absence of a significant reduction (p > 0.05) in the viability of human red blood cells at concentrations up to 1,000 μg/mL.

More recently, the combination of selective ammonia to nitrite oxidation (nitritation) and autotrophic anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), collectively termed deammonification, has also emerged as a possible energy- and cost-effective BNR alternative. Herein, we analyzed microbial diversity and functional potential within 13 BNR processes in the United States, Denmark, and Singapore operated with varying reactor configuration, design, and operational parameters. Using next-generation sequencing and metagenomics, gene-coding regions were aligned against a custom protein database expanded to include all published aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB), anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AMX), and complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria (CMX). Overall contributions of these N-cycle bacteria to the total functional potential of each reactor was determined, as well as that of several organisms associated with denitrification and/or structural integrity of microbial aggregates (biofilm or granules). The potential for these engineered processes to foster a broad spectrum of microbial catabolic, anabolic, and carbon assimilation transformations was elucidated. Seeded sidestream DEMON® deammonification systems and single-stage nitritation-anammox moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) and a mainstream Cleargreen reactor designed to enrich in AOB and AMX showed lower enrichment in AMX functionality than an enriched two-stage nitritation-anammox MBBR system treating mainstream wastewater. Conventional BNR systems in Singapore and the United States had distinct metagenomes, especially relating to AOB. A hydrocyclone process designed to recycle biomass granules for mainstream BNR contained almost identical structural and functional characteristics in the overflow, underflow, and inflow of mixed liquor (ALT) rather than the expected selective enrichment of specific nitrifying or AMX organisms. Inoculum used to seed a sidestream deammonification process unexpectedly contained <10% of total coding regions assigned to AMX. These results suggest the operating conditions of engineered bioprocesses shape the resident microbial structure and function far more than the bioprocess configuration itself. We also highlight the advantage of a systems- and metagenomics-based interrogation of both the microbial structure and potential function therein over targeting of individual populations or specific genes.","authors":[{"name":"Medini K Annavajhala"},{"name":"Vikram Kapoor"},{"name":"Jorge Santo-Domingo"},{"name":"Kartik Chandran"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BNR"},{"word":"anammox"},{"word":"deammonification"},{"word":"global survey"},{"word":"metagenomics"},{"word":"nitritation-anammox"}]},"article335":{"pmid":"30415026","title":"Modelling the effects of multiple stressors on respiration and microbial biomass in the hyporheic zone using decision trees.","date":"2019-09-25","abs":"Integrity of freshwater surface- and groundwater ecosystems and their ecological and qualitative status greatly depends on ecological processes taking place in streambed sediments overgrown by biofilm, in the hyporheic zone (HZ).

The ML technique of decision trees using the J48 algorithm was applied to build models from a data set of 342 samples collected over three seasons at 24 sites within the catchments of five gravel-bed rivers in north-central Slovenia. Catchment-scale land use data and reach-scale environmental features indicating the HZ morphology and physical and chemical characteristics of water were used as predictive variables, while respiration (R) and microbial respiratory electron transport system activity (ETSA) were used as response variables indicating ecological processes and total protein content (TPC) indicating microbial biomass. Separate models were built for two HZ depths: 5-15 cm and 20-40 cm. The models with R as a response variable have the highest predictive performance (67-89%) showing that R is a good indicator of complex environmental gradients. The ETSA and TPC models were less accurate (42-67%) but still provide valuable ecological information. The best model show that temperature when combined with selected water quality elements is an important predictor of R at depth of 5-15 cm. The ETSA and TPC models show the combined effects of temperature, catchment land use and selected water quality elements on both response variables. Overall, this study provides new knowledge on how ecological processes occurring in the HZ respond to catchment and reach-scale variables, and provides evidence-based information about complex interactions between temperature, catchment land use and water quality. These interactions are highly dependent on the selection of the response variable, i.e., each response variable is influenced by a specific combination of predictive environmental variables.","authors":[{"name":"Nataša Mori"},{"name":"Barbara Debeljak"},{"name":"Mateja Škerjanec"},{"name":"Tatjana Simčič"},{"name":"Tjaša Kanduč"},{"name":"Anton Brancelj"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Ecosystem processes"},{"word":"Freshwater biofilm"},{"word":"Hyporheic zone"},{"word":"Machine learning"},{"word":"Stressors"},{"word":"Water quality"}]},"article336":{"pmid":"30414536","title":"Using upstream oxidants to minimize surface biofouling and improve hydraulic performance in GAC biofilters.","date":"2019-09-25","abs":"The combination of biological growth and particle loading can adversely affect hydraulic performance in drinking water biofilters.

The genomes of mycobacteria encode for three β-CAs that have been cloned and characterized from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the crystal structures of two of the enzymes have been determined. Different classes of inhibitor molecules against Mtb β-CAs have subsequently been designed and have been shown to inhibit these mycobacterial enzymes in vitro. The inhibition of these centrally important mycobacterial enzymes leads to reduced growth of mycobacteria, lower virulence, and impaired biofilm formation.

Here, we present a comparative microbiome analysis of endosymbiotic bacteria spanning the entire phylogenetic tree. We show that, across 17 representative sympatric species from eight genera sampled in Panama, abdominal microbiomes are dominated by Mollicutes, α- and γ-Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Bacterial abundances increase from basal to crown branches in the phylogeny reflecting a shift towards putative specialized and abundant abdominal microbiota after the ants domesticated gongylidia-bearing cultivars, but before the origin of industrial-scale farming based on leaf-cutting herbivory. This transition coincided with the ancestral single colonization event of Central/North America ca. 20 MYA, documented in a recent phylogenomic study showing that almost the entire crown group of the higher attine ants, including the leaf-cutting ants, evolved there and not in South America. Several bacterial species are located in gut tissues or abdominal organs of the evolutionarily derived, but not the basal attine ants. The composition of abdominal microbiomes appears to be affected by the presence/absence of defensive antibiotic-producing actinobacterial biofilms on the worker ants' cuticle, but the significance of this association remains unclear.

Adaptive metabolic changes of P. aeruginosa were generally required during both infection processes. Counter-selection against flagella expression was observed during acute lung infections. Obviously, avoidance of flagella-mediated activation of host immunity is advantageous for the wildtype bacteria. For the ΔlasR mutant, loss of flagella did not confer a selective advantage. Apparently, other pathogenesis mechanisms are active in this virulence attenuated strain.

The problem of drug resistance necessitates the need for alternative novel therapeutic strategies to combat this menace. One such approach is targeting the quorum-sensing (QS) controlled virulence and biofilm formation. In this study, we first screened different fractions of Psoralea corylifolia (seed) for their anti-QS property in the Chromobacterium violaceum 12472 strain. The methanol fraction was found to be the most active fraction and was selected for further bioassays. At sub-inhibitory concentrations, the P. corylifolia methanol fraction (PCMF) reduced QS-regulated virulence functions in C. violaceum CVO26 (violacein); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (elastase, protease, pyocyanin, chitinase, exopolysaccharides (EPS), and swarming motility), A. hydrophila (protease, EPS), and Serratia marcescens (prodigiosin). Biofilm formation in all the test pathogens was reduced significantly (p ≤ 0.005) in a concentration-dependent manner. The β-galactosidase assay showed that the PCMF at 1,000 μg/ml downregulated las-controlled transcription in PAO1. In vivo studies with C. elegans demonstrated increased survival of the nematodes after treatment with the PCMF. Bakuchiol, a phytoconstituent of the extract, demonstrated significant inhibition of QS-regulated violacein production in C. violaceum and impaired biofilm formation in the test pathogens. The molecular docking results suggested that bakuchiol efficiently binds to the active pockets of LasR and RhlR, and the complexes were stabilized by several hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, the molecular dynamics simulation of LasR, LasR-bakuchiol, RhlR, and RhlR-bakuchiol complexes for 50 ns revealed that the binding of bakuchiol to LasR and RhlR was fairly stable. The study highlights the anti-infective potential of the PCMF and bakuchiol instead of bactericidal or bacteriostatic action, as the extract targets QS-controlled virulence and the biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Fohad Mabood Husain"},{"name":"Iqbal Ahmad"},{"name":"Faez Iqbal Khan"},{"name":"Nasser A Al-Shabib"},{"name":"Mohammad Hassan Baig"},{"name":"Afzal Hussain"},{"name":"Md Tabish Rehman"},{"name":"Mohamed F Alajmi"},{"name":"Kevin A Lobb"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Psoralea corylifolia"},{"word":"bakuchiol"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"molecular dynamics simulation"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article353":{"pmid":"30410627","title":"Non-native autoinducer analogs capable of modulating the SdiA quorum sensing receptor in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) allows many common bacterial pathogens to coordinate group behaviors such as virulence factor production, host colonization, and biofilm formation at high population densities.

QS Signaling molecules (QSSMs) may be recognized and may function also within the host cells, being potentially involved in the progression of the infectious process. In this study we evaluate the expression of adhesion and inflammatory molecules in endothelial cells treated with P. aeruginosa QSSMs, in order to bring new insights on the mechanisms involved in the interaction of P. aeruginosa with host cells during the infectious process. Endothelial cells were stimulated with 20 µM of main P. aeruginosa QSSMs (OdDHL = N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, C4HSL = N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone, PQS = 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone and HHQ = 2-heptyl-4-quinolone). Adherence to endothelial cells, inert substratum and biofilm formation was evaluated. The expression of adhesion molecules (VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, ICAM-1, and P-selectin) and inflammatory response molecules (IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, TGFβ, and eNOS) was assessed by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Our results showed that bacterial adherence to inert substratum and biofilm were decreased in the presence of all tested QSSMs. The adherence index of PAO1 laboratory strain to host cells was decreased between 10-40% in the presence of QSSMs, as compared to untreated control. Expression of eukaryotic cells adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and P-selectin was stimulated by QSSMs, whereas VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 levels were increased only by C4HSL. The inflammatory response of endothelial cells was also modulated, as observed by the modified expression of IL-1β (for C4HSL, PQS and HHQ), IL-6 (for C4HSL and HHQ), TNFα (for C4HSL and HHQ), TGFβ, and eNOS factors. Our results demonstrate that the main pseudomonadal QSSMs differentially modulate endothelial cells adhesion and proinflammatory cytokine expression. These observations provide new insights in the mechanisms by which different QSSMs activate endothelial cells and modulate the infectious process, and support the importance of recent studies aiming to develop anti-QS therapeutic strategies to fight against P. aeruginosa infections.","authors":[{"name":"Carmen Curutiu"},{"name":"Florin Iordache"},{"name":"Veronica Lazar"},{"name":"Aurelia Magdalena Pisoschi"},{"name":"Aneta Pop"},{"name":"Mariana Carmen Chifiriuc"},{"name":"Alina Maria Hoban"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"host–pathogen interaction"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article355":{"pmid":"30410476","title":"Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Activity of Synergistic Combinations of a Commercially Available Small Compound Library With Colistin Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilm-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections remain a significant clinical challenge since the conventional antibiotic treatment or combination therapies are largely ineffective; and new approaches are needed.

A preliminary screen of the Prestwick Chemical Library alone did not yield any repositionable candidates, but in a screen of combinations with a fixed sub-inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic colistin we observed 10 drugs whose bacterial inhibiting activity was reproducibly enhanced, seven of which were enhanced by more than 50%.

Within a microcolony, bacteria forgo a single cell lifestyle for a communal lifestyle hallmarked by high cell density and physical interactions between cells potentially altering their behaviour. It is thus crucial to understand how initially identical single cells start to behave differently while assembling in these tight communities. Here we show that cells in the microcolonies formed by the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) present differential motility behaviors within an hour upon colony formation. Observation of merging microcolonies and tracking of single cells within microcolonies reveal a heterogeneous motility behavior: cells close to the surface of the microcolony exhibit a much higher motility compared to cells towards the center. Numerical simulations of a biophysical model for the microcolonies at the single cell level suggest that the emergence of differential behavior within a multicellular microcolony of otherwise identical cells is of mechanical origin.

GC-MS-based chemometric methods for oil fingerprinting were used to identify characteristic signatures for dissolution, biodegradation and photooxidation. In sub-zero temperature seawater, fast degradation of n-alkanes was observed with estimated half-life times of ∼7 days. PCR amplicon sequencing and qPCR quantification of bacterial genes showed that a biofilm with a diverse microbial community colonised the oil films, yet a population related to the psychrophilic hydrocarbonoclastic gammaproteobacterium Oleispira antarctica seemed to play a key role in n-alkane degradation. Although Oleispira populations were also present in sea ice, we found that biofilms in sea ice had 25 to 100 times lower bacterial densities than in seawater, which explained the non-detectable n-alkane degradation in sea ice. Fingerprinting revealed that photooxidation, but not biodegradation, transformed polycyclic aromatic compounds through 50 cm-thick sea ice and in the upper water column with removal rates up to ∼1% per day.

This study evaluated the influence of photopolymerized glaze application on the roughness of ARs and adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis on ocular AR surfaces submitted to accelerated ageing. Two hundred and eighty-eight samples of white colour (N1) and colourless ARs were distributed in eight groups (n = 9), based on surface treatments (glaze or ARs submitted to only a final polishing), accelerated ageing (before and after) and periods of microbial growth (24- and 48-h). The roughness average (Ra) and total height of roughness profile (Rt) values were greater for the groups with glaze and increased for all groups after ageing. The microbial adhesion among the groups with and without glaze did not present a statistically significant difference. The ageing did not statistically affect the adhesion of Staph. epidermidis, but affected the adhesion of Staph. aureus, which presented an increase after 24 h of growth on only N1 AR with glaze. These results demonstrate that the glaze did not contribute to adhesion of Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis, which are responsible for most ocular prosthetic infections. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Some recent evidence suggested that the surface finish of ocular prostheses influences the accumulation of deposits that can affect the interaction with pathogenic bacteria, increasing the probability of infections. In addition, surface deterioration over time can increase the roughness and, consequently, biofilm formation. Thus, a better understanding of the influence of surface finish on bacterial adhesion becomes extremely important. In this study, we tested a glaze for surface polishing compared to mechanical polishing, before and after ageing. The results suggest that the glaze did not contribute to microbial adhesion and might be useful in preventing possible prosthetic infections.","authors":[{"name":"B E Nagay"},{"name":"M C Goiato"},{"name":"E V F da Silva"},{"name":"A M Andreotti"},{"name":"S B Bitencourt"},{"name":"C Duque"},{"name":"P H Dos Santos"},{"name":"D M Dos Santos"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"acrylic resins"},{"word":"ocular prosthesis"},{"word":"surface properties"}]},"article368":{"pmid":"30408016","title":"Bacteriocin Isolated from Lactobacillus Rhamnosus L34 Has Antibacterial Effects in a Rabbit Model of Infection After Mandible Fracture Fixation.","date":"2019-01-22","abs":"BACKGROUND Rigid internal fixation (RIF) technology is a recently developed fracture fixation technique in which use of specific antibiotics before and after the operation and timely treatment of local infections is necessary.

Of the 579 human immunology genes, a substantial signal of the epithelial cells was observed to 181 genes.

Catheters are one of the most commonly used medical devices in the world and can be characterised as either indwelling (ID) or intermittent catheters (IC). The primary challenges in the use of IDs are biofilm formation and encrustation. ICs are increasingly seen as a solution to the complications caused by IDs as ICs pose no risk of biofilm formation due to their short time in the body and a lower risk of bladder stone formation. Research on IDs has focused on the use of antimicrobial and antibiofilm compounds, while research on ICs has focused on preventing bacteria entering the urinary tract or coming into contact with the catheter.

However, delivering water with no or reduced chlorine residual could potentially decrease the selection for antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, favor bacterial regrowth and result in changes in bacterial populations. To evaluate the feasibility of water reduction in local DWDS while ensuring water safety, water quality was measured over 2 months in two different networks, each of them harboring sub-areas with normal and reduced chlorine. Water quality remained good in chlorine reduced samples, with limited development of total flora and absence of coliforms. Furthermore, 16S rRNA amplicon-based metagenomics was used to investigate the diversity and the composition of microbial communities in the sub-networks. Taxonomic classification of sequence reads showed a reduced bacterial diversity in sampling points with higher chlorine residuals. Chlorine disinfection created more homogeneous bacterial population, dominated by Pseudomonas, a genus that contains some major opportunistic pathogens such as P. aeruginosa. In the absence of chlorine, a larger and unknown biodiversity was unveiled, also highlighted by a decreased rate of taxonomic classification to the genus and species level.

The ability of this fungus in switching from commensalism to active infection is attributed to its many virulence traits. Biofilm formation is a key process, which allows the fungus to adhere to and proliferate on medically implanted devices as well as host tissue and cause serious life-threatening infections. Biofilms are complex communities of filamentous and yeast cells surrounded by an extracellular matrix that confers an enhanced degree of resistance to antifungal drugs. Moreover, the extensive plasticity of the C. albicans genome has given this versatile fungus the added advantage of microevolution and adaptation to thrive within the unique environmental niches within the host. To combat these challenges in dealing with C. albicans infections, it is imperative that we target specifically the molecular pathways involved in biofilm formation as well as drug resistance. With the advent of the -omics era and whole genome sequencing platforms, novel pathways and genes involved in the pathogenesis of the fungus have been unraveled. Researchers have used a myriad of strategies including transcriptome analysis for C. albicans cells grown in different environments, whole genome sequencing of different strains, functional genomics approaches to identify critical regulatory genes, as well as comparative genomics analysis between C. albicans and its closely related, much less virulent relative, C. dubliniensis, in the quest to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the success of C. albicans as a major fungal pathogen.

Theory predicts that consumers should increase their feeding selectivity for more energetically valuable resources in warmer environments to offset the disproportionate increase in metabolic demand relative to ingestion rate. This may also result in a change in feeding strategy or a shift towards a more specialist diet. This study used a natural warming experiment to investigate temperature effects on the feeding selectivity of three freshwater invertebrate grazers: the snail Radix balthica, the blackfly larva Simulium aureum, and the midgefly larva Eukiefferiella minor. Chesson's Selectivity Index was used to compare the proportional abundance of diatom species in the guts of each invertebrate species with corresponding rock biofilms sampled from streams of different temperature. The snails became more selective in warmer streams, choosing high profile epilithic diatoms over other guilds and feeding on a lower diversity of diatom species. The blackfly larvae appeared to switch from active collector gathering of sessile high profile diatoms to more passive filter feeding of motile diatoms in warmer streams. No changes in selectivity were observed for the midgefly larvae, whose diet was representative of resource availability in the environment. These results suggest that key primary consumers in freshwater streams, which constitute a major portion of invertebrate biomass, can change their feeding behavior in warmer waters in a range of different ways. These patterns could potentially lead to fundamental changes in the flow of energy through freshwater food webs.","authors":[{"name":"Timothy A C Gordon"},{"name":"Joana Neto-Cerejeira"},{"name":"Paula C Furey"},{"name":"Eoin J O'Gorman"},{"name":" "}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chironomidae"},{"word":"Lymnaea peregra"},{"word":"Simuliidae"},{"word":"climate change"},{"word":"diet"},{"word":"global warming"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"30401769","title":"Matrix Polysaccharides and SiaD Diguanylate Cyclase Alter Community Structure and Competitiveness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during Dual-Species Biofilm Development with Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Mixed-species biofilms display a number of emergent properties, including enhanced antimicrobial tolerance and communal metabolism. These properties may depend on interspecies relationships and the structure of the biofilm. However, the contribution of specific matrix components to emergent properties of mixed-species biofilms remains poorly understood. Using a dual-species biofilm community formed by the opportunistic pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, we found that whilst neither Pel nor Psl polysaccharides, produced by P. aeruginosa, affect relative species abundance in mature P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilms, Psl production is associated with increased P. aeruginosa abundance and reduced S. aureus aggregation in the early stages of biofilm formation. Our data suggest that the competitive effect of Psl is not associated with its structural role in cross-linking the matrix and adhering to P. aeruginosa cells but is instead mediated through the activation of the diguanylate cyclase SiaD. This regulatory control was also found to be independent of the siderophore pyoverdine and Pseudomonas quinolone signal, which have previously been proposed to reduce S. aureus viability by inducing lactic acid fermentation-based growth. In contrast to the effect mediated by Psl, Pel reduced the effective crosslinking of the biofilm matrix and facilitated superdiffusivity in microcolony regions. These changes in matrix cross-linking enhance biofilm surface spreading and expansion of microcolonies in the later stages of biofilm development, improving overall dual-species biofilm growth and increasing biovolume severalfold. Thus, the biofilm matrix and regulators associated with matrix production play essential roles in mixed-species biofilm interactions.","authors":[{"name":"Su Chuen Chew"},{"name":"Joey Kuok Hoong Yam"},{"name":"Artur Matysik"},{"name":"Zi Jing Seng"},{"name":"Janosch Klebensberger"},{"name":"Michael Givskov"},{"name":"Patrick Doyle"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"},{"name":"Liang Yang"},{"name":"Staffan Kjelleberg"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"SiaD"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cyclic di-GMP"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"microrheology"}]},"article394":{"pmid":"30401768","title":"A Genome-Wide Screen Identifies Genes in Rhizosphere-Associated Pseudomonas Required to Evade Plant Defenses.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Pseudomonas fluorescens and related plant root (rhizosphere)-associated species contribute to plant health by modulating defenses and facilitating nutrient uptake.

These complex biofilm dynamics influence oral health and disease. In the latest years there has been an increased recognition of the important role that interkingdom interactions, in particular those between fungi and bacteria, play within the oral cavity. Candida spp., and in particular C. albicans, are among the most important fungi colonizing the oral cavity of humans and have been found to participate in these complex microbial oral biofilms.

In this review we describe some of the better characterized interactions between Candida spp. and oral bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Montelongo-Jauregui"},{"name":"Jose L Lopez-Ribot"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"interkingdom interactions"},{"word":"oral microbiota"}]},"article397":{"pmid":"30400188","title":"Human In Situ Study of the effect of Bis(2-Methacryloyloxyethyl) Dimethylammonium Bromide Immobilized in Dental Composite on Controlling Mature Cariogenic Biofilm.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"Cariogenic oral biofilms cause recurrent dental caries around composite restorations, resulting in unprosperous oral health and expensive restorative treatment. Quaternary ammonium monomers that can be copolymerized with dental resin systems have been explored for the modulation of dental plaque biofilm growth over dental composite surfaces. Here, for the first time, we investigated the effect of bis(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) dimethylammonium bromide (QADM) on human overlying mature oral biofilms grown intra-orally in human participants for 7⁻14 days. Seventeen volunteers wore palatal devices containing composite specimens containing 10% by mass of QADM or a control composite without QADM. After 7 and 14 days, the adherent biofilms were collected to determine bacterial counts via colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. Biofilm viability, chronological changes, and percentage coverage were also determined through live/dead staining. QADM composites caused a significant inhibition of Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation for up to seven days. No difference in the CFU values were found for the 14-day period. Our findings suggest that: (1) QADM composites were successful in inhibiting 1⁻3-day biofilms in the oral environment in vivo; (2) QADM significantly reduced the portion of the S. mutans group; and (3) stronger antibiofilm activity is required for the control of mature long-term cariogenic biofilms. Contact-killing strategies using dental materials aimed at preventing or at least reducing high numbers of cariogenic bacteria seem to be a promising approach in patients at high risk of the recurrence of dental caries around composites.","authors":[{"name":"Mary Anne S Melo"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Vanara F Passos"},{"name":"Juliana P M Rolim"},{"name":"Christopher D Lynch"},{"name":"Lidiany K A Rodrigues"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"dental composite"},{"word":"human in situ study"},{"word":"quaternary ammonium monomers"}]},"article398":{"pmid":"30400165","title":"Pentafluorosulfanyl-containing Triclocarban Analogs with Potent Antimicrobial Activity.","date":"2019-01-14","abs":"Concerns have been raised about the long-term accumulating effects of triclocarban, a polychlorinated diarylurea widely used as an antibacterial soap additive, in the environment and in human beings.

Herein, we report the synthesis, antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of novel N,N'-diarylureas as triclocarban analogs, designed by reducing one or more chlorine atoms of the former and/or replacing them by the novel pentafluorosulfanyl group, a new bioisostere of the trifluoromethyl group, with growing importance in drug discovery. Interestingly, some of these pentafluorosulfanyl-bearing ureas exhibited high potency, broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, and high selectivity index, while displaying a lower spontaneous mutation frequency than triclocarban. Some lines of evidence suggest a bactericidal mode of action for this family of compounds.","authors":[{"name":"Eugènia Pujol"},{"name":"Núria Blanco-Cabra"},{"name":"Esther Julián"},{"name":"Rosana Leiva"},{"name":"Eduard Torrents"},{"name":"Santiago Vázquez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Gram-positive"},{"word":"N,N′-diarylureas"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"antibacterial"},{"word":"pentafluorosulfanyl"},{"word":"triclocarban"}]},"article399":{"pmid":"30399554","title":"Response of chloramphenicol-reducing biocathode resistome to continuous electrical stimulation.","date":"2019-09-25","abs":"Understanding the fate of overall antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during the biological treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater is a central issue for the water ecological safety assessment. Although the microbial electrode-respiration based biotransformation process could significantly detoxify some antibiotic contaminants, e.g. chloramphenicol (CAP), the response of CAP-reducing biocathode microbiome and resistome to continuous electrical stimulation, especially ARGs network interactions, are poorly understood. Here, using highthroughput functional gene array (GeoChip v4.6) and Illumina 16S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing, the structure, composition, diversity and network interactions of CAP-reducing biocathode microbiome and resistome in response to continuous electrical stimulation were investigated. Our results indicate that the CAP bioelectroreduction process could significantly accelerate the elimination of antibacterial activity of CAP during CAP-containing wastewater treatment compared to the pure bioreduction process. Continuous electrical stimulation could obviously alter both the microbiome and resistome structures and consistently decrease the phylogenetic, functional and overall ARGs diversity and network complexity within the CAP-reducing biofilms. The relative abundances of overall ARGs and specific CAP resistance related major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter genes were significantly negatively correlated with the reduction efficiency of CAP to inactive antibacterial product AMCl (partially dechlorinated aromatic amine), which may reduce the ecological risk associated with the evolution of multidrug-resistant bacteria and ARGs during antibiotic-containing wastewater treatment process. This study offers new insights into the response of an antibiotic reducing biocathode resistome to continuous electrical stimulation and provides useful information on the assessment of overall ARGs risk for the bioelectrochemical treatment of antibiotic contaminants.","authors":[{"name":"Bin Liang"},{"name":"Jincai Ma"},{"name":"Weiwei Cai"},{"name":"Zhiling Li"},{"name":"Wenzong Liu"},{"name":"Mengyuan Qi"},{"name":"Youkang Zhao"},{"name":"Xiaodan Ma"},{"name":"Ye Deng"},{"name":"Aijie Wang"},{"name":"Jizhong Zhou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)"},{"word":"Biocathode resistome"},{"word":"Chloramphenicol (CAP) reduction"},{"word":"Continuous electrical stimulation"},{"word":"Network complexity"}]}}
