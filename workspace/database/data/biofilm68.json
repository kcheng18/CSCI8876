In this study, we investigate the diversity and activity of SRB within the developing and established biofilm of two moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) systems treating municipal wastewater in New Zealand. The larger of the two WWTPs (Moa Point) generates high levels of sulphide relative to the smaller Karori plant. Clone libraries of the dissimilatory (bi)sulphite reductase (dsrAB) genes and quantitative real-time PCR targeting dsrA transcripts were used to compare SRB communities between the two WWTPs. Desulfobulbus (35-53 % of total SRB sequences) and genera belonging to the family Desulfobacteraceae (27-41 %) dominated the SRB fraction of the developing biofilm on deployed plastic carriers at both sites, whereas Desulfovibrio and Desulfomicrobium were exclusively found at Moa Point. In contrast, the established biofilms from resident MBBR carriers were largely dominated by Desulfomonile tiedjei-like organisms (58-100 % of SRB sequences). The relative transcript abundance of dsrA genes (signifying active SRBs) increased with biofilm weight yet remained low overall, even in the mature biofilm stage. Our results indicate that although SRB are both present and active in the microbial community at both MBBR study sites, differences in the availability of sulphate may be contributing to the observed differences in sulphide production at these two plants.

The elastin-binding protein of Staphylococcus aureus (EbpS) is an adhesin that is responsible for attachment to host cells via its binding to elastin. Despite its relatively weak contribution to adhesion, the ebpS gene is highly conserved among S. aureus isolates, suggesting that EbpS may have other crucial functions. Here, we found that EbpS binds Zn(2+) with its N-terminal region, which leads to local conformational changes that result in the assembly of the EbpS protein. The growth rate of the EbpS-deficient strain was considerably decreased. Zn(2+) chelation decreased the growth rate of the wild-type strain but did not alter that of the EbpS-deficient strain. Furthermore, biofilm formation by the EbpS-deficient strain was abnormally enhanced in the Zn(2+) concentration-dependent manner. All the results suggest that ebpS deficiency led to a zinc concentration-dependent inability to modulate the growth/biofilm maturation phase appropriately. Given the high conservation of ebpS and that appropriate regulation of biofilm formation is thought to be essential for effective staphylococcal infection, inhibition of EbpS binding to Zn(2+) could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for controlling S. aureus infections.

Besides suppression of plant immunity, Xcc has to adapt its metabolism to exploit plant-derived nutrients present in XS. To study Xcc behaviour in the early infection steps, we used cabbage XS to analyse bacterial growth. Mineral and organic composition of XS were determined. Significant growth of Xcc in XS was allowed by the rapid catabolism of amino acids, sugars and organic acids, and it was accompanied by the formation of biofilm-like structures. Transcriptome analysis of Xcc cultivated in XS using cDNA microarrays revealed a XS-specific transcriptional reprogramming compared to minimal or rich media. More specifically, up-regulation of genes encoding transporters such as TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs), that could be associated with nutrient acquisition and detoxification, was observed. In agreement with the aggregation phenotype, expression of genes important for twitching motility and adhesion was up-regulated in XS. Taken together, our data show specific responses of Xcc to colonization of cabbage XS that could be important for the pathogenesis process and establish XS as a model medium to study mechanisms important for the early infection events.

Five out of the seven tested parameters had a significant impact on the startup duration. The conditions identified to allow a rapid startup of AGS-SBRs with good nutrient removal performances were (i) alternation of high and low dissolved oxygen phases during aeration, (ii) a settling strategy avoiding too high biomass washout during the first weeks of reactor operation, (iii) adaptation of the contaminant load in the early stage of the startup in order to ensure that all soluble COD was consumed before the beginning of the aeration phase, (iv) a temperature of 20 °C, and (v) a neutral pH. Under such conditions, it took less than 30 days to produce granular sludge with high removal performances for COD, N, and P.

In this work, experimental pipe loops were set up to investigate the effect of sulfate on the dynamical transformation characteristics of iron corrosion products and bacterial community in old cast iron distribution pipes. All the test pipes were excavated from existing DWDS with different source water supply histories, and the test water sulfate concentration was in the range of 50-350 mg/L. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA was used for bacterial community analysis. The results showed that iron release increased markedly and even red water occurred for pipes with groundwater supply history when feed water sulfate elevated abruptly. However, the iron release of pipes with only surface water supply history changed slightly without noticeable color even the feed water sulfate increased multiply. The thick-layered corrosion scales (or densely distributed tubercles) on pipes with surface water supply history possessed much higher stability due to the larger proportion of stable constituents (mainly Fe3O4) in their top shell layer; instead, the rather thin and uniform non-layered corrosion scales on pipes with groundwater supply history contained relatively higher proportion of less stable iron oxides (e.g. β-FeOOH, FeCO3 and green rust). The less stable corrosion scales tended to be more stable with sulfate increase, which was evidenced by the gradually decreased iron release and the increased stable iron oxides. Bacterial community analysis indicated that when switching to high sulfate water, iron reducing bacteria (IRB) maintained dominant for pipes with stable corrosion scales, while significant increase of sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB), sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and iron oxidizing bacteria (IOB) was observed for pipes with less stable corrosion scales.

Decades later, it is not uncommon for gram-negative organisms to be multidrug-resistant and even pan-resistant to available antibiotic regimens, leaving clinicians with few therapeutic alternatives. Because fosfomycin has been shown to retain activity against these virulent pathogens, there is renewed interest in its use as a therapeutic agent. Fosfomycin formulations including fosfomycin disodium and the newer tromethamine salt are less toxic than other alternatives and are attractive options for resistant gram-negative and gram-positive infections. Oral fosfomycin tromethamine is approved for urinary tract infections in the United States, and an intravenous formulation is also available outside of the United States for systemic disease. The bactericidal action of fosfomycin occurs at an earlier step in cell wall synthesis than that of β-lactam antibiotics. From an in vitro standpoint, fosfomycin generally has high activity against ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae; multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility appears to be more dependent on the local antibiogram. Fosfomycin formulations have a large volume of distribution, penetrate biofilms, and concentrate in the urine. Both oral and intravenous fosfomycin formulations are effective for a wide range of gram-negative infections and disease severities; however, clinical studies are limited. Fosfomycin formulations are well-tolerated, and mild gastrointestinal distress is the most common adverse effect. The primary limitations of fosfomycin are the lack of established regimens for complicated infections and the lack of availability of the intravenous formulation in the United States. Further study of this promising agent seems warranted in the current climate of antibiotic resistance.

We describe a 64-year-old woman who was receiving hemodialysis 3 times/week and was hospitalized with persistent fungemia. Despite receiving intravenous micafungin, she had multiple positive blood cultures for Candida albicans, which finally cleared after 7 days. Her double-lumen catheter was considered the most likely nidus of infection.

Here we show that the cystic fibrosis isolate CHA exhibits a unique virulence phenotype featuring a mucoid morphology, an active Type III Secretion System (T3SS, hallmark of acute infections), and no Type VI Secretion System (H1-T6SS). This virulence profile is due to a 426 bp deletion in the 3' end of the gacS gene encoding an essential regulatory protein. The absence of GacS disturbs the Gac/Rsm pathway leading to depletion of the small regulatory RNAs RsmY/RsmZ and, in consequence, to expression of T3SS, while switching off the expression of H1-T6SS and Pel polysaccharides. The CHA isolate also exhibits full ability to swim and twitch, due to active flagellum and Type IVa pili. Thus, unlike the classical scheme of balance between virulence factors, clinical strains may adapt to a local niche by expressing both alginate exopolysaccharide, a hallmark of membrane stress that protects from antibiotic action, host defences and phagocytosis, and efficient T3S machinery that is considered as an aggressive virulence factor.

Strains naturally present in soils, sea water, sediments and waste waters have inherent abilities to degrade hydrocarbons such as alkanes (short and medium chain) and aromatic compounds (biphenyl and dibenzofuran). With the application of slow release fertilizers, design of immobilization techniques and development of microbial consortia, scale-up studies and in situ applications have been possible. In general, hydrocarbon uptake in this yeast is mediated by attachment to large droplets (via hydrophobic cell surfaces) or is aided by surfactants and emulsifiers. Subsequently, the internalized hydrocarbons are degraded by relevant enzymes innately present in the yeast. Some wild-type or recombinant strains also detoxify nitroaromatic (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), halogenated (chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons) and organophosphate (methyl parathion) compounds. The yeast can tolerate some metals and detoxify them via different biomolecules. The biomass (unmodified, in combination with sludge, magnetically-modified and in the biofilm form) has been employed in the biosorption of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solutions. Yeast cells have also been applied in protocols related to nanoparticle synthesis. The treatment of oily and solid wastes with this yeast reduces chemical oxygen demand or value-added products (single cell oil, single cell protein, surfactants, organic acids and polyalcohols) are obtained.

These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.","authors":[{"name":"Małgorzata Dawgul"},{"name":"Magdalena Maciejewska"},{"name":"Maciej Jaskiewicz"},{"name":"Anna Karafova"},{"name":"Wojciech Kamysz"}],"keywords":[]},"article27":{"pmid":"24778902","title":"A periodontitis-associated multispecies model of an oral biofilm.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"While single-species biofilms have been studied extensively, we know notably little regarding multispecies biofilms and their interactions.

The study of assembling phototrophic biofilm communities provides a robust means to identify such interactions and evaluate their contributions to the recruitment and maintenance of phylogenetic and functional diversity over time. To examine primary succession in phototrophic communities, we isolated two unicyanobacterial consortia from the microbial mat in Hot Lake, Washington, characterizing the membership and metabolic function of each consortium. We then analyzed the spatial structures and quantified the community compositions of their assembling biofilms. The consortia retained the same suite of heterotrophic species, identified as abundant members of the mat and assigned to Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Autotroph growth rates dominated early in assembly, yielding to increasing heterotroph growth rates late in succession. The two consortia exhibited similar assembly patterns, with increasing relative abundances of members from Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria concurrent with decreasing relative abundances of those from Gammaproteobacteria. Despite these similarities at higher taxonomic levels, the relative abundances of individual heterotrophic species were substantially different in the developing consortial biofilms. This suggests that, although similar niches are created by the cyanobacterial metabolisms, the resulting webs of autotroph-heterotroph and heterotroph-heterotroph interactions are specific to each primary producer. The relative simplicity and tractability of the Hot Lake unicyanobacterial consortia make them useful model systems for deciphering interspecies interactions and assembly principles relevant to natural microbial communities.

Among 122 isolated and tested strains of CoNS the most frequent were: S. epidermidis-32 strains, S. haemolyticus-31 strains, S. capitis subsp. capitis- 21 strains, S. hominis-11 strains, S. cohnii subsp. cohnii-nine strains. In case of CoNS, the main molecule responsible for intercellular adhesion is a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), encoded on the ica gene operon. The analysis revealed the presence of the icaADBC operon genes in 46.88% of S. epidermidis isolates. IcaA and icaD were present in 34.38% and 28.13% of strains respectively while IcaC gene was present in 37.50% of strains. IcaB gene was found in 21.88% of S. epidermidis strains.

The assessment of antibacterial drugs susceptibility demonstrated that analyzed CoNS strains were highly resistant to macrolides and lincosamides and more sensitive to rifampicin and linezolid.

The nitrite can cause inhibition to the bacteria that catalyze the anammox reaction. The literature shows a great divergence on the levels of NO2 (-) causing inhibition. Moreover, the conditions influencing the resistance of anammox bacteria to NO2 (-) inhibitory effect are not well understood. This work investigated the effect of the pH and the concentration of nitrite on the activity and metabolism of anammox granular sludge under different physiological conditions. Batch activity tests in a range of pH values were carried out in which either actively metabolizing cells or resting cells were exposed to nitrite in the presence or absence of the electron donating substrate ammonium, respectively. The response of the bacteria was evaluated by analyzing the specific anammox activity, the accumulation of nitric oxide, and the evolution of the ATP content in the biomass. Additionally, the effect of the pH on the tolerance of the biomass to single substrate feeding interruptions was evaluated in continuous anammox bioreactors. The results show that the influence of the pH on the NO2 (-) inhibition of anammox bacteria is greater under non-metabolizing conditions than during active metabolism. The exposure of resting cells to NO2 (-) (100 mg N L(-1) ) at pH values below 7.2 caused complete inhibition of the anammox activity. The inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of the intermediate, nitric oxide, in the gas phase. In contrast, just mild inhibition was observed for resting cells exposed to the same NO2 (-) concentration at pH values higher than 7.5 or any of the pH values tested in assays with actively metabolizing cells. ATP initially increased and subsequently decreased in time after resting cells were exposed to NO2 (-) suggesting an active response of the cells to nitrite stress. Furthermore, bioreactors operated at pH lower than 6.8 had greater sensitivity to NO2 (-) during an ammonium feed interruption than a bioreactor operated at pH 7.1. The results suggest that the ability of resting cells to tolerate NO2 (-) inhibition is seriously impeded at mildly acidic pH values; whereas actively metabolizing biomass is resistant to NO2 (-) toxicity over a wide range of pH values.","authors":[{"name":"José M Carvajal-Arroyo"},{"name":"Daniel Puyol"},{"name":"Guangbin Li"},{"name":"Reyes Sierra-Álvarez"},{"name":"Jim A Field"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anaerobic"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"mechanism"},{"word":"nitric oxide"},{"word":"nitrogen removal"},{"word":"nitrous acid"},{"word":"toxicity"}]},"article43":{"pmid":"24771104","title":"Exoelectrogenic biofilm as a template for sustainable formation of a catalytic mesoporous structure.","date":"2014-09-25","abs":"Mesoporous structures can increase catalytic activity by maximizing the ratio of surface area to volume, but current synthesis techniques utilize expensive polymers and toxic chemicals.

The most prevalent bacterium was V. parvula (∼50% of the total biomass), followed by S. gordonii (∼30%), F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum (∼10%) and A. naeslundii (<5%). Total bacterial biomass was significantly higher in both grade-4-titanium surfaces (p < 0.05). The results demonstrated that not only implant surface treatment, but also titanium purity, influence early bacterial colonization.

However, the molecular mechanisms that link the mechanical properties of a biofilm with the ability of bacteria to survive in different chemical environments remain enigmatic. Here, we study the erosion stability of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) biofilms in the presence of different chemical environments. We find that these biofilms can utilize the absorption of certain metal ions such as Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Fe(2+), Fe(3+) and Al(3+) into the biofilm matrix to avoid erosion by shear forces. Interestingly, many of these metal ions are toxic for planktonic B. subtilis bacteria. However, their toxic activity is suppressed when the ions are absorbed into the biofilm matrix. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that the biofilm matrix has to fulfill a dual function, i.e. regulating both the mechanical properties of the biofilm and providing a selective barrier towards toxic chemicals.

Production and detection of DSF are governed by the rpf cluster, which encodes the synthase RpfF and the sensor RpfC, among other components. Despite a well-studied system, little is known about its implication in virulence regulation in S. maltophilia. Here, we have analyzed the rpfF gene from 82 S. maltophilia clinical isolates. Although rpfF was found to be present in all of the strains, it showed substantial variation, with two populations (rpfF-1 and rpfF-2) clearly distinguishable by the N-terminal region of the protein. Analysis of rpfC in seven complete genome sequences revealed a corresponding variability in the N-terminal transmembrane domain of its product, suggesting that each RpfF variant has an associated RpfC variant. We show that only RpfC-RpfF-1 variant strains display detectable DSF production. Heterologous rpfF complementation of ΔrpfF mutants of a representative strain of each variant suggests that RpfF-2 is, however, functional and that the observed DSF-deficient phenotype of RpfC-RpfF-2 variant strains is due to permanent repression of RpfF-2 by RpfC-2. This is corroborated by the ΔrpfC mutant of the RpfC-RpfF-2 representative strain. In line with this observations, deletion of rpfF from the RpfC-RpfF-1 strain leads to an increase in biofilm formation, a decrease in swarming motility, and relative attenuation in the Caenorhabditis elegans and zebrafish infection models, whereas deletion of the same gene from the representative RpfC-RpfF-2 strain has no significant effect on these virulence-related phenotypes.

Many PTS components are repressed at the transcriptional level when the substrates they transport are not available. In Escherichia coli, the transcription factor Mlc (for makes large colonies) represses transcription of the genes encoding enzyme I (EI), histidine protein (HPr), and the glucose-specific enzyme IIBC (EIIBC(Glc)) in defined media that lack PTS substrates. When glucose is present, the unphosphorylated form of EIIBC(Glc) sequesters Mlc to the cell membrane, preventing its interaction with DNA. Very little is known about Vibrio cholerae Mlc. We found that V. cholerae Mlc activates biofilm formation in LB broth but not in defined medium supplemented with either pyruvate or glucose. Therefore, we questioned whether V. cholerae Mlc functions differently than E. coli Mlc. Here we have shown that, like E. coli Mlc, V. cholerae Mlc represses transcription of PTS components in both defined medium and LB broth and that E. coli Mlc is able to rescue the biofilm defect of a V. cholerae Δmlc mutant. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Mlc indirectly activates transcription of the vps genes by repressing expression of EI. Because activation of the vps genes by Mlc occurs under only a subset of the conditions in which repression of PTS components is observed, we conclude that additional inputs present in LB broth are required for activation of vps gene transcription by Mlc.

We also examined the effect of FT on the transport behavior of B. subtilis at two solution ionic strengths (IS: 10 and 100 mM) in quartz sand packed columns.

Although FT exposure had no significant effect on the bacterial growth rate, it substantially decreased B. subtilis biofilm formation and correspondingly decreased the transcription of matrix production genes in higher IS solution.

The aim of this multicentre study was to perform a phenotypic and genotypic characterisation of clinical S. aureus isolates recovered from musculoskeletal infections and to investigate differences between isolates cultured from Orthopaedic Implant Related Infections (OIRI) and those from Non-Implant Related Infections (NIRI). OIRI were further differentiated in two groups: Fracture Fixation-Device Infections (FFI) and Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI). Three-hundred and five S. aureus strains were collected from 4 different Swiss and 2 French hospitals (FFI, n=112; PJI, n=105; NIRI, n=88). NIRI cases were composed of 27 Osteomyelitis (OM), 23 Diabetic Foot Infections (DFI), 27 Soft Tissue Infections (STI) and 11 postoperative Spinal Infections (SI). All isolates were tested for their ability to form biofilm, to produce staphyloxanthin and their haemolytic activity. They were typed by agr (accessory gene regulator) group, spa type and screened by PCR for the presence of genes of the most relevant virulence factors such as MSCRAMMs, Panton Valentine Leukotoxin (PVL), enterotoxins, exotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin. Overall, methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was more prevalent than methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in this collection. The OIRI group trended towards a higher incidence of MRSA, gentamicin resistance and haemolysis activity than the NIRI group. Within the OIRI group, PJI isolates were more frequently strong biofilm formers than isolates from the FFI group. A statistically significant difference was observed between OIRI and NIRI isolates for the sdrE gene, the cna gene, the clfA gene and the bbp gene. Certain spa types (t230 and t041) with a specific genetic virulence pattern were only found in isolates cultured from OIRI. In conclusion, our study highlights significant trends regarding the virulence requirements displayed by S. aureus isolates associated with implant related infections in comparison to non-implant related infections.

The lack of correlation between conventional susceptibility test results and therapeutic success in chronic infections is probably a consequence of the use of planktonically growing instead of biofilm-growing bacteria. Therefore, several in vitro models to evaluate antimicrobial activity on biofilms have been implemented over the last decade. Microtitre plate-based assays, the Calgary device, substratum suspending reactors and the flow cell system are some of the most used in vitro biofilm models for susceptibility studies. Likewise, new pharmacodynamic parameters, including minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration, minimal biofilm-eradication concentration, biofilm bactericidal concentration, and biofilm-prevention concentration, have been defined in recent years to quantify antibiotic activity in biofilms. Using these parameters, several studies have shown very significant quantitative and qualitative differences for the effects of most antibiotics when acting on planktonic or biofilm bacteria. Nevertheless, standardization of the procedures, parameters and breakpoints, by official agencies, is needed before they are implemented in clinical microbiology laboratories for routine susceptibility testing.

In the present study, the bacteria from four critical phases of an unchlorinated DWDS, including bulk water, pipe wall biofilm, suspended solids, and loose deposits, were quantified and identified by adenosine triphosphate analysis and pyrosequencing, respectively. The results showed that the bulk water bacteria (including the contribution of suspended solids) contributed less than 2% of the total bacteria. The bacteria associated with loose deposits and pipe wall biofilm that accumulated in the DWDS accounted for over 98% of the total bacteria, and the contributions of bacteria in loose deposits and pipe wall biofilm were comparable. Depending on the amount of loose deposits, its contribution can be 7-fold higher than the pipe wall biofilm. Pyrosequencing revealed relatively stable bacterial communities in bulk water, pipe wall biofilm, and suspended solids throughout the distribution system; however, the communities present in loose deposits were dependent on the amount of loose deposits locally. Bacteria within the phases of suspended solids, loose deposits, and pipe wall biofilm were similar in phylogenetic composition. The bulk water bacteria (dominated by Polaromonas spp.) were clearly different from the bacteria from the other three phases (dominated by Sphingomonas spp.).

The accumulation of loose deposits and the aging process create variable microenvironments inside loose deposits structures for bacteria to grow.

A review of the scientific literature indicates that mechanical nonsurgical periodontal treatment predictably reduces the levels of inflammation and probing pocket depths, increases the clinical attachment level and results in an apical shift of the gingival margin. Another parameter to be considered, in spite of the lack of scientific evidence, is the reduction in the degree of tooth mobility, as clinically experienced. It is important to point out that nonsurgical periodontal treatment presents limitations such as the long-term maintainability of deep periodontal pockets, the risk of disease recurrence, and the skill of the operator. A high number of posttreatment residual pockets exhibiting bleeding on probing and > 5 mm deep are related to lower clinical stability. The successful treatment of plaque-induced periodontitis will restore periodontal health, but with reduced periodontium. In such cases, anatomical damage from previous periodontal disease will persist and inverse architecture of soft tissue may impair home plaque removal. The clinician can select one of the following therapeutic options according to the individual patient's needs: - Quadrant/sextant wise instrumentation (conventional staged debridement, CSD). - Instrumentation of all pockets within a 24-hour period with (full mouth disinfection [FMD]) or without (full mouth scaling and root planing [FMSRP]) local antiseptics. Both procedures can be associated with systemic antimicrobials. -CSD or FMD in combination with laser or photodynamic therapy. Patients with aggressive periodontitis constitute a challenge to the clinician. To date there are no established protocols for controlling the disease. However, data from the literature on the application of the FMD protocol combined with amoxicillin-metronidazole systemic administration are promising. A new classification in supra- and subcrestal nonsurgical periodontal therapy will be proposed. The supracrestal therapy includes the treatment of gingivitis, nonsurgical coverage of recession-type defects, treatment of suprabony defects and papilla reconstruction techniques.

Elevated c-di-GMP levels or increased GGDEF protein expression is frequently associated with the onset of sessility and biofilm formation in numerous bacterial species. Conversely, phosphodiesterase-dependent diminution of c-di-GMP levels by EAL- and HD-GYP-domain proteins is often accompanied by increased motility and virulence. In this study, we individually overexpressed 23 predicted GGDEF, EAL or HD-GYP-domain proteins encoded by the phytopathogen Pectobacterium atrosepticum strain SCRI1043. MS-based detection of c-di-GMP and 5'-phosphoguanylyl-(3'-5')-guanosine in these strains revealed that overexpression of most genes promoted modest 1-10-fold changes in cellular levels of c-di-GMP, with the exception of the GGDEF-domain proteins ECA0659 and ECA3374, which induced 1290- and 7660-fold increases, respectively. Overexpression of most EAL domain proteins increased motility, while overexpression of most GGDEF domain proteins reduced motility and increased poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-glucosamine-dependent flocculation. In contrast to domain-based predictions, overexpression of the EAL protein ECA3549 or the HD-GYP protein ECA3548 increased c-di-GMP concentrations and reduced motility. Most overexpression constructs altered the levels of secreted cellulases, pectinases and proteases, confirming c-di-GMP regulation of virulence in Pe. atrosepticum. However, there was no apparent correlation between virulence-factor induction and the domain class expressed or cellular c-di-GMP levels, suggesting that regulation was in response to specific effectors within the network, rather than total c-di-GMP concentration. Finally, we demonstrated that the cellular localization patterns vary considerably for GGDEF/EAL/HD-GYP proteins, indicating it is a likely factor restricting specific interactions within the c-di-GMP network.

Target concentrations of COD and TN were based on high-stringency water reuse scenarios. Results showed reductions in power requirements as high as 86%. The decrease mainly resulted from the dramatically lower air flows for the MBfR, resulting from its higher oxygen-transfer efficiencies. When the MBfR was used for COD and TN removal, savings up to US$200/1,000 m(3) of treated water were predicted. Cost savings were highly sensitive to the costs of the membrane modules and electrical power. The costs were also very sensitive to membrane oxidation flux for ammonia, and the membrane life. These results suggest the hybrid MBfR may provide significant savings in energy and costs.

It is initiated by complex subgingival biofilms, triggering an inflammatory response by the juxtaposed gingival tissue. The range of transcriptional events initiated in the gingiva following biofilm challenge is not fully elucidated. By employing gene microarray technology, this study aimed to characterize the overall transcriptional changes (more than two-fold regulation) of cultured human gingival fibroblasts in response to a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model (BF), over a challenge period of 6 h. The relative involvement of the three 'red complex' species in these transcriptional events was evaluated by omitting these species from the biofilm composition (BF-RC). When compared with the unchallenged control, challenge with BF and BF-RC differentially regulated 386 and 428 genes, respectively, with an overlap of 52-75%. Interestingly, the expression of only three genes was significantly different between the BF and BF-RC challenged groups. There was also a strong overlap of the affected signalling pathways and gene ontology processes. These signalling pathways involved primarily the immune response, and included toll-like receptors, interleukin-1, interleukin-17 and heat-shock proteins 60 and 70. In conclusion, subgingival biofilms elicited a large number of transcriptional changes in gingival fibroblasts, while the presence of the 'red complex' in the biofilm did not yield any substantial differences.

The first part of this review is devoted to an overview of the regulatory mechanisms that are directly or indirectly involved in the formation of biofilm. The most effective approaches to suppressing the formation of biofilm that do not cause the development of resistance are based on the application of substances that interfere with the regulatory molecules or block the appropriate regulatory mechanisms involved in biofilm development by the cells.

Markov state models (MSMs) built from the trajectory data reveal how subtle chemical modifications can have a significant effect on conformational populations, leading to the overall stabilization of the target structure. In particular, we identify a key steric interaction between a methyl substituent and a valine side chain that acts to allosterically shift population between native and near-native states, which could be exploited in future designs. Visualization of this mechanism is aided considerably by the tICA method, which identifies degrees of freedom most important in slow conformational transitions.

How bacteria self-organize to form these structured communities is an area of active research.

This network acts as a means for self-organization of collective behavior during biofilm expansion as the cells following these vanguard aggregates were preferentially confined within the furrow network resulting in the formation of an intricate network of trails of cells.

Here, we investigated and defined the role of this so-called triple glycine (TG) motif in determining sortase specificity during the pilus assembly and anchoring. Mutagenesis of the TG motif resulted in a lack or an alteration of the L. rhamnosus GG pilus structures, indicating that the TG motif is critical in pilus assembly and that they govern the pilin-specific and housekeeping sortase specificity. This allowed us to propose a regulatory model of the L. rhamnosus GG pilus biogenesis. Remarkably, the TG motif was identified in multiple pilus gene clusters of other Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting that similar signaling mechanisms occur in other, mainly pathogenic, species.

Intriguingly, despite the absence of chitin in human and mammalian hosts, both of the chitinases have been deemed important for infection, through a mechanism that, at least in the case of ChiA, involves modulation of host immune responses. In this study, we show that the expression of the two chitinases is subject to regulation by the listerial agr system, a homologue of the agr quorum-sensing system of Staphylococcus aureus, that has so far been implicated in virulence and biofilm formation. We demonstrate that in addition to these roles, the listerial agr system is required for efficient chitin hydrolysis, as deletion of agrD, encoding the putative precursor of the agr autoinducer, dramatically decreased chitinolytic activity on agar plates. Agr was specifically induced in response to chitin addition in stationary phase and agrD was found to regulate the amount of chiA, but not chiB, transcripts. Although the transcript levels of chiB did not depend on agrD, the extracellular protein levels of both chitinases were reduced in the ΔagrD mutant. The regulatory effect of agr on chiA is potentially mediated through the small RNA LhrA, which we show here to be negatively regulated by agr. LhrA is in turn known to repress chiA translation by binding to the chiA transcript and interfering with ribosome recruitment. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized role of the agr system and suggest that autoinducer-based regulation of chitinolytic systems may be more commonplace than previously thought.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the secreted nuclease (Nuc) enzyme is a virulence factor in multiple models of infection, and in vivo expression of nuc has facilitated the development of an infection imaging approach based on Nuc-activatable probes. Interestingly, S. aureus strains encode a second nuclease (Nuc2) that has received limited attention. With the growing interest in bacterial nucleases, we sought to characterize Nuc2 in more detail through localization, expression, and biochemical studies. Fluorescence microscopy and alkaline phosphatase localization approaches using Nuc2-GFP and Nuc2-PhoA fusions, respectively, demonstrated that Nuc2 is membrane bound with the C-terminus facing the extracellular environment, indicating it is a signal-anchored Type II membrane protein. Nuc2 enzyme activity was detectable on the S. aureus cell surface using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, and in time courses, both nuc2 transcription and enzyme activity peaked in early logarithmic growth and declined in stationary phase. Using a mouse model of S. aureus pyomyositis, Nuc2 activity was detected with activatable probes in vivo in nuc mutant strains, demonstrating that Nuc2 is produced during infections. To assess Nuc2 biochemical properties, the protein was purified and found to cleave both single- and double-stranded DNA, and it exhibited thermostability and calcium dependence, paralleling the properties of Nuc. Purified Nuc2 prevented biofilm formation in vitro and modestly decreased biomass in dispersal experiments. Altogether, our findings confirm that S. aureus encodes a second, surface-attached and functional DNase that is expressed during infections and displays similar biochemical properties to the secreted Nuc enzyme.

In high-altitude lakes, exposed bedrock, boulders, gravel, and sand in contact with highly oxygenated water and where a very thin epilithic biofilm develops usually dominate the littoral zone. Traditionally, these surfaces have been considered unsuitable for denitrification, but recent investigations have shown higher biological diversity than expected, including diverse anaerobic microorganisms. In this study, we explored the presence of microbial N-cycling nirS and nirK (denitrification through the conversion of NO2(-) to NO), nifH (N2 fixation), anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation), and amoA (aerobic ammonia oxidation, both bacterial and archaeal) genes in epilithic biofilms of a set of high-altitude oligotrophic lakes in the Pyrenees. The concentrations of denitrifying genes determined by quantitative PCR were two orders of magnitude higher than those of ammonia-oxidizing genes. Both types of genes were significantly correlated, suggesting a potential tight coupling nitrification-denitrification in these biofilms that deserves further confirmation. The nifH gene was detected after nested PCR, and no signal was detected for the anammox-specific genes used. The taxonomic composition of denitrifying and nitrogen-fixing genes was further explored by cloning and sequencing. Interestingly, both microbial functional groups were richer and more genetically diverse than expected. The nirK gene, mostly related to Alphaproteobacteria (Bradyrhizobiaceae), dominated the denitrifying gene pool as expected for oxygen-exposed habitats, whereas Deltaproteobacteria (Geobacter like) and Cyanobacteria were the most abundant among nitrogen fixers. Overall, these results suggest an epilithic community more metabolically diverse than previously thought and with the potential to carry out an active role in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycling of high-altitude ecosystems. Measurements of activity rates should be however carried out to substantiate and further explore these findings.","authors":[{"name":"Maria Vila-Costa"},{"name":"Mireia Bartrons"},{"name":"Jordi Catalan"},{"name":"Emilio O Casamayor"}],"keywords":[]},"article118":{"pmid":"24743836","title":"Kind discrimination and competitive exclusion mediated by contact-dependent growth inhibition systems shape biofilm community structure.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Contact-Dependent Growth Inhibition (CDI) is a phenomenon in which bacteria use the toxic C-terminus of a large exoprotein (called BcpA in Burkholderia species) to inhibit the growth of neighboring bacteria upon cell-cell contact. CDI systems are present in a wide range of Gram-negative proteobacteria and a hallmark feature is polymorphism amongst the exoprotein C-termini (BcpA-CT in Burkholderia) and amongst the small immunity proteins (BcpI) that protect against CDI in an allele-specific manner. In addition to CDI, the BcpAIOB proteins of Burkholderia thailandensis mediate biofilm formation, and they do so independent of BcpA-mediated interbacterial competition, suggesting a cooperative role for CDI system proteins in this process. CDI has previously only been demonstrated between CDI+ and CDI- bacteria, leaving the roles of CDI system-mediated interbacterial competition and of CDI system diversity in nature unknown. We constructed B. thailandensis strains that differed only in the BcpA-CT and BcpI proteins they produced. When co-cultured on agar, these strains each participated in CDI and the outcome of the competition depended on both CDI system efficiency and relative bacterial numbers initially. Strains also participated in CDI during biofilm development, resulting in pillar structures that were composed of only a single BcpA-CT/BcpI type. Moreover, a strain producing BcpA-CT/BcpI proteins of one type was prevented from joining a pre-established biofilm community composed of bacteria producing BcpA-CT/BcpI proteins of a different type, unless it also produced the BcpI protein of the established strain. Bacteria can therefore use CDI systems for kind recognition and competitive exclusion of 'non-self' bacteria from a pre-established biofilm. Our data indicate that CDI systems function in both cooperative and competitive behaviors to build microbial communities that are composed of only bacteria that are related via their CDI system alleles.

Unfortunately, there is limited information on the role of other physiological factors influencing aromatic utilization. In this report, we demonstrate that P. putida KT2440 increases its siderophore secretion in response to the availability of benzyl alcohol, a model aromatic substrate. It is argued that accelerated siderophore secretion in response to aromatic substrates provides an iron 'boost' which is required for the effective functioning of the iron-dependent oxygenases responsible for ring opening. Direct evidence for the cardinal role of siderophores in aromatic utilization is provided by evaluation of per capita siderophore secretion and comparative growth assessments of wild-type and siderophore-negative mutant strains grown on an alternative carbon source. Accelerated siderophore secretion can be viewed as a compensatory mechanism in P. putida in the context of its inability to secrete more than one type of siderophore (pyoverdine) or to utilize heterologous siderophores. Stimulated siderophore secretion might be a key factor in successful integration and proliferation of this organism as a bio-augmentation agent for aromatic degradation. It not only facilitates efficient aromatic utilization, but also provides better opportunities for iron assimilation amongst diverse microbial communities, thereby ensuring better survival and proliferation.

The investigation of microbe-microbe interactions is essential for understanding the in vivo activities of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. Candida albicans, a polymorphic fungus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, are two opportunistic pathogens that interact in various polymicrobial infections in humans. To determine how P. aeruginosa affects the physiology of C. albicans and vice versa, we compared the proteomes of each species in mixed biofilms versus single-species biofilms. In addition, extracellular proteins were analyzed. We observed that, in mixed biofilms, both species showed differential expression of virulence proteins, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, proteases and cell defense, stress and iron-regulated proteins. Furthermore, in mixed biofilms, both species displayed an increase in mutability compared with monospecific biofilms. This characteristic was correlated with the downregulation of enzymes conferring protection against DNA oxidation. In mixed biofilms, P. aeruginosa regulates its production of various molecules involved in quorum sensing and induces the production of virulence factors (pyoverdine, rhamnolipids and pyocyanin), which are major contributors to the ability of this bacterium to cause disease. Overall, our results indicate that interspecies competition between these opportunistic pathogens enhances the production of virulence factors and increases mutability and thus can alter the course of host-pathogen interactions in polymicrobial infections.

A periodontal abscess is clinically important because it is a relatively frequent dental emergency, it can compromise the periodontal prognosis of the affected tooth and bacteria within the abscess can spread and cause infections in other body sites. Different types of abscesses have been identified, mainly classified by their etiology, and there are clear differences between those affecting a pre-existing periodontal pocket and those affecting healthy sites. Therapy for this acute condition consists of drainage and tissue debridement, while an evaluation of the need for systemic antimicrobial therapy will be made for each case, based on local and systemic factors. The definitive treatment of the pre-existing condition should be accomplished after the acute phase is controlled. Necrotizing periodontal diseases present three typical clinical features: papilla necrosis, gingival bleeding and pain. Although the prevalence of these diseases is not high, their importance is clear because they represent the most severe conditions associated with the dental biofilm, with very rapid tissue destruction. In addition to bacteria, the etiology of necrotizing periodontal disease includes numerous factors that alter the host response and predispose to these diseases, namely HIV infection, malnutrition, stress or tobacco smoking. The treatment consists of superficial debridement, careful mechanical oral hygiene, rinsing with chlorhexidine and daily re-evaluation. Systemic antimicrobials may be used adjunctively in severe cases or in nonresponding conditions, being the first option metronidazole. Once the acute disease is under control, definitive treatment should be provided, including appropriate therapy for the pre-existing gingivitis or periodontitis. Among other acute conditions affecting the periodontal tissues, but not caused by the microorganisms present in oral biofilms, infectious diseases, mucocutaneous diseases and traumatic or allergic lesions can be listed. In most cases, the gingival involvement is not severe; however, these conditions are common and may prompt an emergency dental visit. These conditions may have the appearance of an erythematous lesion, which is sometimes erosive. Erosive lesions may be the direct result of trauma or a consequence of the breaking of vesicles and bullae. A proper differential diagnosis is important for adequate management of the case.

Currently, A. actinomycetemcomitans is regarded as a minor component of the resident oral microbiota and as an opportunistic pathogen in some individuals.

Previous work has examined how chemical gradients develop in large biofilms containing >10(8) cells. However, many bacterial communities in nature are composed of small, densely packed aggregates of cells (≤ 10(5) bacteria). Using a gelatin-based three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy, we confined the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa within picoliter-sized 3D microtraps that are permeable to nutrients, waste products, and other bioactive small molecules. We show that as a single bacterium grows into a maximally dense (10(12) cells ml(-1)) clonal population, a localized depletion of oxygen develops when it reaches a critical aggregate size of ~55 pl. Collectively, these data demonstrate that chemical and phenotypic heterogeneity exists on the micrometer scale within small aggregate populations. IMPORTANCE Before developing into large, complex communities, microbes initially cluster into aggregates, and it is unclear if chemical heterogeneity exists in these ubiquitous micrometer-scale aggregates. We chose to examine oxygen availability within an aggregate since oxygen concentration impacts a number of important bacterial processes, including metabolism, social behaviors, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. By determining that oxygen availability can vary within aggregates containing ≤ 10(5) bacteria, we establish that physiological heterogeneity exists within P. aeruginosa aggregates, suggesting that such heterogeneity frequently exists in many naturally occurring small populations.","authors":[{"name":"Aimee K Wessel"},{"name":"Talha A Arshad"},{"name":"Mignon Fitzpatrick"},{"name":"Jodi L Connell"},{"name":"Roger T Bonnecaze"},{"name":"Jason B Shear"},{"name":"Marvin Whiteley"}],"keywords":[]},"article144":{"pmid":"24736223","title":"O-mannosylation in Candida albicans enables development of interkingdom biofilm communities.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Candida albicans is a fungus that colonizes oral cavity surfaces, the gut, and the genital tract. Streptococcus gordonii is a ubiquitous oral bacterium that has been shown to form biofilm communities with C. albicans. Formation of dual-species S. gordonii-C. albicans biofilm communities involves interaction of the S. gordonii SspB protein with the Als3 protein on the hyphal filament surface of C. albicans. Mannoproteins comprise a major component of the C. albicans cell wall, and in this study we sought to determine if mannosylation in cell wall biogenesis of C. albicans was necessary for hyphal adhesin functions associated with interkingdom biofilm development. A C. albicans mnt1Δ mnt2Δ mutant, with deleted α-1,2-mannosyltransferase genes and thus defective in O-mannosylation, was abrogated in biofilm formation under various growth conditions and produced hyphal filaments that were not recognized by S. gordonii. Cell wall proteomes of hypha-forming mnt1Δ mnt2Δ mutant cells showed growth medium-dependent alterations, compared to findings for the wild type, in a range of protein components, including Als1, Als3, Rbt1, Scw1, and Sap9. Hyphal filaments formed by mnt1Δ mnt2Δ mutant cells, unlike wild-type hyphae, did not interact with C. albicans Als3 or Hwp1 partner cell wall proteins or with S. gordonii SspB partner adhesin, suggesting defective functionality of adhesins on the mnt1Δ mnt2Δ mutant. These observations imply that early stage O-mannosylation is critical for activation of hyphal adhesin functions required for biofilm formation, recognition by bacteria such as S. gordonii, and microbial community development. IMPORTANCE In the human mouth, microorganisms form communities known as biofilms that adhere to the surfaces present. Candida albicans is a fungus that is often found within these biofilms. We have focused on the mechanisms by which C. albicans becomes incorporated into communities containing bacteria, such as Streptococcus. We find that impairment of early stage addition of mannose sugars to C. albicans hyphal filament proteins deleteriously affects their subsequent performance in mediating formation of polymicrobial biofilms.

Bacterial bis-(3'-5') cyclic GMP (cyclic di-GMP [c-di-GMP]) serves as a second messenger and is involved in modulating virulence factors in numerous bacteria. However, the role of this second messenger has not been investigated in P. gingivalis, mainly due to a lack of an annotation regarding diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) in this bacterium. Using bioinformatics tools, we found a protein, PGN_1932, containing a GGDEF domain. A deletion mutation in the pgn_1932 gene had a significant effect on the intracellular c-di-GMP level in P. gingivalis. Genetic analysis showed that expression of the fimA and rgpA genes, encoding the major protein subunit of fimbriae and an arginine-specific proteinase, respectively, was downregulated in the pgn_1932 mutant. Correspondingly, FimA protein production and the fimbrial display on the mutant were significantly reduced. Mutations in the pgn_1932 gene also had a significant impact on the adhesive and invasive capabilities of P. gingivalis, which are required for its pathogenicity.

In this work, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of different molecular weights (Mw = 350, 550) was coupled to a saturated difunctional alkyl alcohol to generate amphiphilic surfactants (PEG-hydrocarbon-OH). The resulting macromolecules were then used as side chains to covalently modify a pre-synthesized PS8 K-b-P(E/B)25 K-b-PI10 K (SEBI or K3) triblock copolymer, and the final polymers were applied to glass substrata through an established multilayer surface coating technique to prepare fouling resistant coatings. The coated surfaces were characterized with AFM, XPS and NEXAFS, and evaluated in laboratory assays with two important fouling algae, Ulva linza (a green macroalga) and Navicula incerta, a biofilm-forming diatom. The results suggest that these polymer-coated surfaces undergo surface reconstruction upon changing the contact medium (polymer/air vs polymer/water), due to the preferential interfacial aggregation of the PEG segment on the surface in water. The amphiphilic polymer-coated surfaces showed promising results as both AF and FR coatings. The sample with longer PEG chain lengths (Mw = 550 g mol(-1)) exhibited excellent properties against both algae, highlighting the importance of the chemical structures on ultimate biological performance. Besides reporting synthesis and characterization of this new type of amphiphilic surface material, this work also provides insight into the nature of PEG/hydrocarbon amphiphilic coatings, and this understanding may help in the design of future generations of fluorine-free, environmentally friendly AF/FR polymeric coatings.","authors":[{"name":"Zhaoli Zhou"},{"name":"David R Calabrese"},{"name":"Warren Taylor"},{"name":"John A Finlay"},{"name":"Maureen E Callow"},{"name":"James A Callow"},{"name":"Daniel Fischer"},{"name":"Edward J Kramer"},{"name":"Christopher K Ober"}],"keywords":[{"word":"alga"},{"word":"amphiphilic polymer"},{"word":"hydrocarbon/PEG surfactants"},{"word":"marine antifouling/fouling release coatings"},{"word":"surface structure"}]},"article158":{"pmid":"24730462","title":"A three-species biofilm model for the evaluation of enamel and dentin demineralization.","date":"2014-04-25","abs":"Although Streptococcus mutans biofilms have been useful for evaluating the cariogenic potential of dietary carbohydrates and the effects of fluoride on dental demineralization, a more appropriate biofilm should be developed to demonstrate the influence of other oral bacteria on cariogenic biofilms.

Fluidic conditions play a key role for biofilm structural development and subsequently for overall reactor performance. Continuous interfacial forces generated by aqueous-air segmented flow are controlling biofilm structure and diminish mass transfer limitations in biofilm microreactors. A simple three step method allows the formation of robust biofilms under aqueous-air segmented flow conditions: a first-generation biofilm is developing during single phase flow, followed by the introduction of air segments discarding most of the established biofilm. Finally, a second-generation, mature biofilm is formed in the presence of aqueous-air segments. Confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments revealed that the segmented flow supports the development of a robust biofilm. This mature biofilm is characterized by a three to fourfold increase in growth rate, calculated from an increase in thickness, a faster spatial distribution (95% surface coverage in 24 h), and a significantly more compact structure (roughness coefficient <1), as compared to biofilms grown under single phase flow conditions. The applicability of the concept in a segmented flow biofilm microreactor was demonstrated using the epoxidation of styrene to (S)-styrene oxide (ee > 99.8%) catalyzed by Pseudomonas sp. strain VLB120ΔC cells in the mono-species biofilm. The limiting factor affecting reactor performance was oxygen transfer as the volumetric productivity rose from 11 to 46 g L tube (-1) day(-1) after increasing the air flow rate. In summary, different interfacial forces can be applied for separating cell attachment and adaptation resulting in the development of a robust catalytic biofilm in continuous microreactors.","authors":[{"name":"Rohan Karande"},{"name":"Babu Halan"},{"name":"Andreas Schmid"},{"name":"Katja Buehler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"catalytic biofilms"},{"word":"continuous bioprocess"},{"word":"microreactors"},{"word":"multiphasic biocatalysis"},{"word":"segmented flow"}]},"article164":{"pmid":"24729040","title":"Reference and counter electrode positions affect electrochemical characterization of bioanodes in different bioelectrochemical systems.","date":"2014-08-26","abs":"The placement of the reference electrode (RE) in various bioelectrochemical systems is often varied to accommodate different reactor configurations. While the effect of the RE placement is well understood from a strictly electrochemistry perspective, there are impacts on exoelectrogenic biofilms in engineered systems that have not been adequately addressed. Varying distances between the working electrode (WE) and the RE, or the RE and the counter electrode (CE) in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can alter bioanode characteristics. With well-spaced anode and cathode distances in an MFC, increasing the distance between the RE and anode (WE) altered bioanode cyclic voltammograms (CVs) due to the uncompensated ohmic drop. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) also changed with RE distances, resulting in a calculated increase in anode resistance that varied between 17 and 31 Ω (-0.2 V). While WE potentials could be corrected with ohmic drop compensation during the CV tests, they could not be automatically corrected by the potentiostat in the EIS tests. The electrochemical characteristics of bioanodes were altered by their acclimation to different anode potentials that resulted from varying the distance between the RE and the CE (cathode). These differences were true changes in biofilm characteristics because the CVs were electrochemically independent of conditions resulting from changing CE to RE distances. Placing the RE outside of the current path enabled accurate bioanode characterization using CVs and EIS due to negligible ohmic resistances (0.4 Ω). It is therefore concluded for bioelectrochemical systems that when possible, the RE should be placed outside the current path and near the WE, as this will result in more accurate representation of bioanode characteristics.","authors":[{"name":"Fang Zhang"},{"name":"Jia Liu"},{"name":"Ivan Ivanov"},{"name":"Marta C Hatzell"},{"name":"Wulin Yang"},{"name":"Yongtae Ahn"},{"name":"Bruce E Logan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioanode"},{"word":"bioelectrochemical systems"},{"word":"cyclic voltammetry"},{"word":"electrochemical impedance spectroscopy"},{"word":"reference electrode placement"},{"word":"uncompensated ohmic drop"}]},"article165":{"pmid":"24729038","title":"Biofilms of Candida albicans serotypes A and B differ in their sensitivity to photodynamic therapy.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Candida albicans is classified into different serotypes according to cell wall mannan composition and cell surface hydrophobicity.

Crucial to their complex lifestyle is the ability to sense and respond to diverse environmental stimuli, requiring elaborate signaling pathways. In the majority of bacteria, the nucleotide-based second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is involved in signal transduction. Surprisingly, little is known about the importance of c-di-GMP signaling in rhizobia. We have analyzed the genome sequences of six well-studied type species (Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Mesorhizobium loti, Rhizobium etli, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Sinorhizobium fredii, and Sinorhizobium meliloti) for proteins possibly involved in c-di-GMP signaling based on the presence of four domains: GGDEF (diguanylate cyclase), EAL and HD-GYP (phosphodiesterase), and PilZ (c-di-GMP sensor). We find that rhizobia possess a high number of these proteins. Conservation analysis suggests that c-di-GMP signaling proteins modulate species-specific pathways rather than ancient rhizobia-specific processes. Two hybrid GGDEF-EAL proteins were selected for functional analysis, R. etli RHE_PD00105 (CdgA) and RHE_PD00137 (CdgB). Expression of cdgA and cdgB is repressed by the alarmone (p)ppGpp. cdgB is significantly expressed on plant roots and free living. Mutation of cdgA, cdgB, or both does not affect plant root colonization, nitrogen fixation capacity, biofilm formation, motility, and exopolysaccharide production. However, heterologous expression of the individual GGDEF and EAL domains of each protein in Escherichia coli strongly suggests that CdgA and CdgB are bifunctional proteins, possessing both diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities. Taken together, our results provide a platform for future studies of c-di-GMP signaling in rhizobia.","authors":[{"name":"Shanjun Gao"},{"name":"Samir Ben Romdhane"},{"name":"Serge Beullens"},{"name":"Volkhard Kaever"},{"name":"Ivo Lambrichts"},{"name":"Maarten Fauvart"},{"name":"Jan Michiels"}],"keywords":[]},"article167":{"pmid":"24728529","title":"Orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances and biofilm formation--a potential public health threat?","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Orthodontic treatment is highly popular for restoring functional and facial esthetics in juveniles and adults.

While methods for screening biofilm formation in the laboratory are well established, studies in marine environments have so far been based upon destructive analysis of individual samples and provide only discontinuous snapshots of biofilm establishment.

Using this technique in combination with microscope-assisted imaging, we investigated biofilm formation from its beginning to mature multispecies biofilms. In contrast to laboratory studies on biofilm formation, a smooth transition from initial attachment to colony formation and exponential growth could not be observed in the marine environment. Instead, initial attachment was followed by an adaptation phase of low growth and homogeneously distributed solitary bacterial cells. Moreover, we observed a diurnal variation of biofilm signal intensity, suggesting a transient state of biofilm formation of bacteria. Overall, the biofilm formation dynamics could be modeled by three consecutive development stages attributed to initial bacterial attachment, bacterial growth, and attachment and growth of unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms. Additional experiments showed that the presence of seaweed considerably shortened the adaptation phase in comparison with that on control surfaces but yielded similar growth rates. The outlined examples highlight the advantages of a quasicontinuous in situ detection that enabled, for the first time, the exploration of the initial attachment phase and the diurnal variation during biofilm formation in natural ecosystems.","authors":[{"name":"M Fischer"},{"name":"G Friedrichs"},{"name":"T Lachnit"}],"keywords":[]},"article171":{"pmid":"24727224","title":"Arginine deiminase in Staphylococcus epidermidis functions to augment biofilm maturation through pH homeostasis.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Allelic replacement mutants were constructed within arginine deiminase (arcA1 and arcA2) to assess the function of the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway in organic acid resistance and biofilm formation of Staphylococcus epidermidis 1457.

However, no difference in viability was noted for individual 1457 ΔarcA1 (native) or ΔarcA2 (arginine catabolic mobile element [ACME]-derived) mutants, suggesting that the native and ACME-derived ADIs are compensatory in S. epidermidis. Furthermore, flow cytometry and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy results suggested that organic acid stress resulted in oxidative stress that could be partially rescued by the iron chelator dipyridyl.

Finally, static biofilm assays determined that viability, ammonia synthesis, and pH were reduced in strain 1457 ΔADI following 120 h of growth in comparison to strain 1457 and the arcA1 and arcA2 single mutants.

Ibuprofen and naproxen were largely removed through biological transformation; whereas gemfibrozil and diclofenac showed more variable removal, likely due to both biological transformation and sorption processes.

Furthermore, the proliferation of those bacteria that do adhere is inhibited by the lateral confinement imposed by the non-adhesive boundaries surrounding each patch.

This review summarizes recent studies that have revealed clear spatial physiological differentiation, complex supracellular architecture and striking morphology in macrocolony biofilms. By responding to gradients of nutrients, oxygen, waste products and signalling compounds that build up in growing biofilms, various stress responses determine whether bacteria grow and proliferate or whether they enter into stationary phase and use their remaining resources for maintenance and survival. As a consequence, biofilms differentiate into at least two distinct layers of vegetatively growing and stationary phase cells that exhibit very different cellular physiology. This includes a stratification of matrix production with a major impact on microscopic architecture, biophysical properties and directly visible morphology of macrocolony biofilms. Using Escherichia coli as a model system, this review also describes our detailed current knowledge about the underlying molecular control networks - prominently featuring sigma factors, transcriptional cascades and second messengers - that drive this spatial differentiation and points out directions for future research.

The development of biofilm involves the initial attachment of planktonic bacteria to a surface, followed by replication, cell-to-cell adhesion to form microcolonies, maturation, and detachment. Mature biofilms are embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix composed primarily of bacterial-derived exopolysaccharides, specialized proteins, adhesins, and occasionally DNA. Because the synthesis and assembly of biofilm matrix components is an exceptionally complex process, the transition between its different phases requires the coordinate expression and simultaneous regulation of many genes by complex genetic networks involving all levels of gene regulation. The finely controlled intracellular level of the chemical second messenger molecule, cyclic-di-GMP is central to the post-transcriptional mechanisms governing the switch between the motile planktonic lifestyle and the sessile biofilm forming state in many bacteria. Several other post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are known to dictate biofilm development and assembly and these include RNA-binding proteins, small non-coding RNAs, toxin-antitoxin systems, riboswitches, and RNases. Post-transcriptional regulation is therefore a powerful molecular mechanism employed by bacteria to rapidly adjust to the changing environment and to fine tune gene expression to the developmental needs of the cell. In this review, we discuss post-transcriptional mechanisms that influence the biofilm developmental cycle in a variety of pathogenic bacteria.

In this review, we focus on the biosynthesis and physiological roles of membrane lipids in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The major components of A. tumefaciens membranes are the phospholipids (PLs), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cardiolipin, and ornithine lipids (OLs). Under phosphate-limited conditions, the membrane composition shifts to phosphate-free lipids like glycolipids, OLs and a betaine lipid. Remarkably, PC and OLs have opposing effects on virulence of A. tumefaciens. OL-lacking A. tumefaciens mutants form tumors on the host plant earlier than the wild type suggesting a reduced host defense response in the absence of OLs. In contrast, A. tumefaciens is compromised in tumor formation in the absence of PC. In general, PC is a rare component of bacterial membranes but amount to ~22% of all PLs in A. tumefaciens. PC biosynthesis occurs via two pathways. The phospholipid N-methyltransferase PmtA methylates PE via the intermediates monomethyl-PE and dimethyl-PE to PC. In the second pathway, the membrane-integral enzyme PC synthase (Pcs) condenses choline with CDP-diacylglycerol to PC. Apart from the virulence defect, PC-deficient A. tumefaciens pmtA and pcs double mutants show reduced motility, enhanced biofilm formation and increased sensitivity towards detergent and thermal stress. In summary, there is cumulative evidence that the membrane lipid composition of A. tumefaciens is critical for agrobacterial physiology and tumor formation.

To understand modulation of A. pleuropneumoniae gene expression in response to the stress caused by anaerobic conditions, gene expression profiles under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were compared in this study. The microarray results showed that 631 genes (27.7% of the total ORFs) were differentially expressed in anaerobic conditions. Many genes encoding proteins involved in glycolysis, carbon source uptake systems, pyruvate metabolism, fermentation and the electron respiration transport chain were up-regulated. These changes led to an increased amount of pyruvate, lactate, ethanol and acetate in the bacterial cells as confirmed by metabolite detection. Genes encoding proteins involved in cell surface structures, especially biofilm formation, peptidoglycan biosynthesis and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis were up-regulated as well. Biofilm formation was significantly enhanced under anaerobic conditions. These results indicate that induction of central metabolism is important for basic survival of A. pleuropneumoniae after a shift to an anaerobic environment. Enhanced biofilm formation may contribute to the persistence of this pathogen in the damaged anaerobic host tissue and also in the early colonization stage.

Some isolates show beneficial potential for biocontrol, bioremediation and plant growth promotion. On the contrary, other strains are pathogens for plants and immunocompromised individuals, like cystic fibrosis patients. In these subjects, they can cause respiratory tract infections sometimes characterised by fatal outcome. Most of the Burkholderia cepacia Complex species are mucoid when grown on a mannitol rich medium and they also form biofilms, two related characteristics, since polysaccharides are important component of biofilm matrices. Moreover, polysaccharides contribute to bacterial survival in a hostile environment by inhibiting both neutrophils chemotaxis and antimicrobial peptides activity, and by scavenging reactive oxygen species. The ability of these microorganisms to produce exopolysaccharides with different structures is testified by numerous articles in the literature. However, little is known about the type of polysaccharides produced in biofilms and their relationship with those obtained in non-biofilm conditions. The aim of this study was to define the type of exopolysaccharides produced by nine species of the Burkholderia cepacia Complex. Two isolates were then selected to compare the polysaccharides produced on agar plates with those formed in biofilms developed on cellulose membranes. The investigation was conducted using NMR spectroscopy, high performance size exclusion chromatography, and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The results showed that the Complex is capable of producing a variety of exopolysaccharides, most often in mixture, and that the most common exopolysaccharide is always cepacian. In addition, two novel polysaccharide structures were determined: one composed of mannose and rhamnose and another containing galactose and glucuronic acid. Comparison of exopolysaccharides obtained from cultures on agar plates with those extracted from biofilms on cellulose membranes showed important differences, thus suggesting that extrapolating data from non-biofilm conditions might not always be applicable.

Streptococcus mutans bacteria were cultured on resin to form biofilms. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to measure biofilm thickness, live/dead volumes and live-bacteria percentage vs. distance from resin surface. Biofilm thickness was the greatest for Scotchbond control; it decreased with increasing chain length, reaching a minimum at chain length 16. Live-biofilm volume had a similar trend. Dead-biofilm volume increased with increasing chain length. The adhesive with chain length 9 had 37% live bacteria near resin surface, but close to 100% live bacteria in the biofilm top section. For chain length 16, there were nearly 0% live bacteria throughout the three-dimensional biofilm. In conclusion, strong antibacterial activity was achieved by adding quaternary ammonium into adhesive, with biofilm thickness and live-biofilm volume decreasing as chain length was increased from 3 to 16.

The EPS in the strongest biofilms had a higher content of proteins and a lower level of carbohydrates. Staining analyses revealed that the outermost EPS in the stronger biofilm regions was of hydrophilic nature and distributed around dense microbial aggregates, whereas it was homogeneously distributed in the weaker strata.

Sixteen pairs of genes were identified based on their apparent similarity to TA modules. Overexpression of the putative toxins had various effects on growth, persistence, and biofilm formation. Toxins, whose overexpression resulted in growth inhibition, often increased the number of surviving persisters; in contrast, overexpression of putative toxins showing no effects on growth had no positive influence on the number of surviving persisters. Furthermore, the expression of the TA modules was compared between treated and untreated sessile and planktonic wild-type cultures. For 10 toxin-encoding genes, the expression was higher in untreated sessile cells than in untreated planktonic cells. Nine toxin-encoding genes were upregulated after treatment with tobramycin, but none after treatment with ciprofloxacin.

The 3D model showed conformational stability over time, confirming the quality of the starting 3D model. Large scale 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations show the intramolecular changes occurring in SrtA, and multiple conformations of structure based screening elucidate potential leads against this pathogen. Experimental results showed that the screened compounds are active showing anti-microbial and anti-biofilm activity, as SrtA is known to play an important role in E. faecalis biofilm formation. Experimental results also suggest that SrtA specific screened compounds have better anti-biofilm activity than the available inhibitors.

Within biomedical applications, nanocellulose has been proposed as a suitable nano-material for wound dressings. This is based on the capability of the material to self-assemble into 3D micro-porous structures, which among others have an excellent capacity of maintaining a moist environment. In addition, the surface chemistry of nanocellulose is suitable for various applications. First, OH-groups are abundant in nanocellulose materials, making the material strongly hydrophilic. Second, the surface chemistry can be modified, introducing aldehyde and carboxyl groups, which have major potential for surface functionalization. In this study, we demonstrate the production of nanocellulose with tailor-made surface chemistry, by pre-treating the raw cellulose fibres with carboxymethylation and periodate oxidation. The pre-treatments yielded a highly nanofibrillated material, with significant amounts of aldehyde and carboxyl groups. Importantly, the poly-anionic surface of the oxidized nanocellulose opens up for novel applications, i.e. micro-porous materials with pH-responsive characteristics. This is due to the swelling capacity of the 3D micro-porous structures, which have ionisable functional groups. In this study, we demonstrated that nanocellulose gels have a significantly higher swelling degree in neutral and alkaline conditions, compared to an acid environment (pH 3). Such a capability can potentially be applied in chronic wounds for controlled and intelligent release of antibacterial components into biofilms.

Silicone rubber (SR) surfaces were endowed with selective loading and fungi-triggered release of polyene antifungal agents by means of a two-step functionalization that involved the grafting of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) via a γ-ray preirradiation method (9-21.3% wt grafting) and the subsequent immobilization of ergosterol (3.9-116.8 mg/g) to the epoxy groups of polyGMA. The functionalized materials were characterized using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) image analyses. Specific interactions between natamycin or nystatin and ergosterol endowed SR with ability to take up these polyene drugs, while immobilization of ergosterol did not modify the loading of antifungal drugs that did not interact in vivo with ergosterol (e.g., miconazole). In a buffer medium, polyene-loaded ergosterol-immobilized slabs efficiently retained the drug (<10% released at day 14), while in the presence of ergosterol-containing liposomes that mimic fungi membranes the release rate was 10-to-15-fold enhanced due to a competitive displacement of the drug from the ergosterol-immobilized slab to the ergosterol-containing liposomes. Release in the presence of cholesterol liposomes was slower due to a weaker interaction with polyene agents. The fungi-responsive release was demonstrated for both polyene drugs tested and for slabs prepared with a wide range of amounts of immobilized GMA and ergosterol, demonstrating the robustness of the approach. Nystatin-loaded functionalized slabs were challenged with Candida albicans and showed improved capability to inhibit biofilm formation compared to nystatin-soaked pristine SR, confirming the performance of the bioinspired materials.

The plant-protective activity of these bacteria has been correlated with the potential to secrete a wide array of antibiotic compounds upon growth as planktonic cells in isolated cultures under laboratory conditions. However, in situ expression of these antibiotics in the rhizosphere where bacterial cells naturally colonize root tissues is still poorly understood. In this work, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) to examine spatiotemporal changes in the secreted antibiome of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens developing as biofilms on roots. Nonribosomal lipopeptides such as the plant immunity elicitor surfactin or the highly fungitoxic iturins and fengycins were readily produced albeit in different time frames and quantities in the surrounding medium. Interestingly, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments performed directly from the gelified culture medium also allowed us to identify a new variant of surfactins released at later time points. However, no other bioactive compounds such as polyketides were detected at any time, strongly suggesting that the antibiome expressed in planta by B. amyloliquefaciens does not reflect the vast genetic arsenal devoted to the formation of such compounds. This first dynamic study reveals the power of MALDI MSI as tool to identify and map antibiotics synthesized by root-associated bacteria and, more generally, to investigate plant-microbe interactions at the molecular level.

Their management is difficult and costly, and the development of antibiotic resistance by both planktonic and biofilm-associated bacteria necessitates the use of alternative wound treatments. Honey is now being revisited as an alternative treatment due to its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and the inability of bacteria to develop resistance to it. Many previous antibacterial studies have used honeys that are not well characterized, even in terms of quantifying the levels of the major antibacterial components present, making it difficult to build an evidence base for the efficacy of honey as an antibiofilm agent in chronic wound treatment. Here we show that a range of well-characterized New Zealand manuka-type honeys, in which two principle antibacterial components, methylglyoxal and hydrogen peroxide, were quantified, can eradicate biofilms of a range of Staphylococcus aureus strains that differ widely in their biofilm-forming abilities. Using crystal violet and viability assays, along with confocal laser scanning imaging, we demonstrate that in all S. aureus strains, including methicillin-resistant strains, the manuka-type honeys showed significantly higher anti-biofilm activity than clover honey and an isotonic sugar solution. We observed higher anti-biofilm activity as the proportion of manuka-derived honey, and thus methylglyoxal, in a honey blend increased. However, methylglyoxal on its own, or with sugar, was not able to effectively eradicate S. aureus biofilms. We also demonstrate that honey was able to penetrate through the biofilm matrix and kill the embedded cells in some cases. As has been reported for antibiotics, sub-inhibitory concentrations of honey improved biofilm formation by some S. aureus strains, however, biofilm cell suspensions recovered after honey treatment did not develop resistance towards manuka-type honeys. New Zealand manuka-type honeys, at the concentrations they can be applied in wound dressings are highly active in both preventing S. aureus biofilm formation and in their eradication, and do not result in bacteria becoming resistant. Methylglyoxal requires other components in manuka-type honeys for this anti-biofilm activity. Our findings support the use of well-defined manuka-type honeys as a topical anti-biofilm treatment for the effective management of wound healing.

To fight off pathogenic microorganisms, the epidermis and its secretion, the mucus acts as a barrier between the fish and the environment. Fish are surrounded by a continuous layer of mucus which is the first physical, chemical and biological barrier from infection and the first site of interaction between fish's skin cells and pathogens. The mucus composition is very complex and includes numerous antibacterial factors secreted by fish's skin cells, such as immunoglobulins, agglutinins, lectins, lysins and lysozymes. These factors have a very important role to discriminate between pathogenic and commensal microorganisms and to protect fish from invading pathogens. Furthermore, the skin mucus represents an important portal of entry of pathogens since it induces the development of biofilms, and represents a favorable microenvironment for bacteria, the main disease agents for fish. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of the interaction between bacteria and fish skin mucus, the adhesion mechanisms of pathogens and the major factors influencing pathogen adhesion to mucus. The better knowledge of the interaction between fish and their environment could inspire other new perspectives to study as well as to exploit the mucus properties for different purposes.

APT displayed altered cell morphology compared with COL and increased aggregation in biofilm assays. Increased resistance to β-lactam antibiotics was observed, but adaptation to oxacillin did not confer multidrug resistance. Analysis of the S. aureus COL and APT surfaceomes identified 150 proteins at a threshold determined by the scoring algorithm. Proteins unique to APT included the LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) domain-containing MsrR and SACOL2302. Quantitative RT-PCR showed increased expression of sacol2302 in APT grown with oxacillin (>6-fold compared with COL).

Proteomics using iTRAQ and LC-MS/MS identified 1323 proteins (∼50% of the theoretical S. aureus proteome), and cluster analysis demonstrated elevated APT abundances of LCP proteins, capsule and peptidoglycan biosynthesis proteins, and proteins involved in wall remodelling. Adaptation to oxacillin also induced urease proteins, which maintained culture pH compared to COL.

However, little is known of microbial interactions with metallic lead. The objective of this research was to investigate fungal roles in transformations of lead in a surface biofilm community growing on lead sheeting. The lead surface was found to support a diverse fungal community with several members, such as Aureobasidum pullulans, Phoma macrostoma, Penicillium sp. and Botryotinia fuckeliana, probably originating from adjacent phylloplane communities. Many fungal isolates showed tolerance to lead compounds in growth inhibition assays and were able to mediate production of lead-containing secondary minerals in the presence of metallic lead. These exhibited widely differing morphologies to the lead-containing secondary minerals produced under abiotic conditions. The presence of pyromorphite (Pb5 (PO4 )3 Cl) (approximately 50 wt%) was detected in the lead sheet biofilm, and we speculate that animal (bird) faeces could be a significant source of phosphorus in this location. Pyromorphite formation represents biomineralization of mobile lead species into a very stable form, and this research provides the first demonstration of its occurrence in the natural environment.

Short-term diversification and selection within populations is, however, largely uncharacterised, as existing studies typically focus on fixed substitutions. Here, we use whole-genome deep-sequencing to capture the spectrum of mutations arising during biofilm development for two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. This approach identified single nucleotide variants with frequencies from 0.5% to 98.0% and showed that the clinical strain 18A exhibits greater genetic diversification than the type strain PA01, despite its lower per base mutation rate. Mutations were found to be strain specific: the mucoid strain 18A experienced mutations in alginate production genes and a c-di-GMP regulator gene; while PA01 acquired mutations in PilT and PilY1, possibly in response to a rapid expansion of a lytic Pf4 bacteriophage, which may use type IV pili for infection. The Pf4 population diversified with an evolutionary rate of 2.43 × 10(-3) substitutions per site per day, which is comparable to single-stranded RNA viruses. Extensive within-strain parallel evolution, often involving identical nucleotides, was also observed indicating that mutation supply is not limiting, which was contrasted by an almost complete lack of noncoding and synonymous mutations. Taken together, these results suggest that the majority of the P. aeruginosa genome is constrained by negative selection, with strong positive selection acting on an accessory subset of genes that facilitate adaptation to the biofilm lifecycle. Long-term bacterial evolution is known to proceed via few, nonsynonymous, positively selected mutations, and here we show that similar dynamics govern short-term, within-population bacterial diversification.

These differences are mediated primarily by differential colonization of and dispersal among particles. Whereas one population is specialized to colonize particles by attaching and growing biofilms, the other is specialized to disperse among particles by rapidly detecting and swimming toward new particles, implying that it can better exploit short-lived patches. Because the two populations are very similar in their genomic composition, metabolic abilities, chemotactic sensitivity, and swimming speed, this fine-scale behavioral adaptation may have been responsible for the onset of the ecological differentiation between them. These results demonstrate that the principles of spatial ecology, traditionally applied at macroscales, can be extended to the ocean's microscale to understand how the rich spatiotemporal structure of the resource landscape contributes to the fine-scale ecological differentiation and species coexistence among marine bacteria.

The aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of the human lactoferrin-derived peptide hLf1-11 anchored to titanium surfaces. To this end, titanium samples were functionalized with the hLf1-11 peptide either by silanization methods or physical adsorption. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the successful covalent attachment of the hLf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces. Lactate dehydrogenase assay determined that hLf1-11 peptide did not affect fibroblast viability. An outstanding reduction in the adhesion and early stages of biofilm formation of Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus salivarius was observed on the biofunctionalized surfaces compared to control non-treated samples. Furthermore, samples coated with the hLf1-11 peptide inhibited the early stages of bacterial growth.

Lactobacillales were the major biofilm inhabitants (62-82% of rRNA reads), followed by Clostridiales (8-31% of rRNA reads). To identify mRNA transcripts specific for the forestomach, we compared forestomach and hindgut metatranscriptomes. Gene expression of the biofilm microbiota was characterized by high abundance of transcripts related to glucose and maltose utilization, peptide degradation, and amino acid transport, indicating their major catabolic and anabolic pathways. The microbiota transcribed genes encoding pathways enhancing oxidative stress (glutathione synthesis) and acid tolerance. Various pathways, including metabolite formation (urea degradation, arginine pathway, γ-aminobutyrate) and cell wall modification (DltA, cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase), contributed to acid tolerance, as judged from the transcript profile. In addition, the biofilm microbiota expressed numerous genes encoding extracellular proteins involved in adhesion and/or biofilm formation (e.g. MucBP, glycosyl hydrolase families 68 and 70). This study shed light on the lifestyle and specific adaptations of lactobacilli in the murine forestomach that might also be relevant for lactobacilli biofilms in other vertebrates, including humans.

The operation of SBR under higher dissolved oxygen in combination with slow feeding resulted in significant reduced HRT without nitrate accumulation. Partially nitrified centrate was further treated in Anammox reactors, where the mixture of ammonium and nitrite was converted mainly to nitrogen gas. Anammox treatment was carried out in two different types of Anammox reactors: a moving bed hybrid reactor and an up-flow fixed-bed biofilm reactor. The hybrid Anammox reactor removed an average of 55.8% of NH4-N, versus the 48.3% NH4-N removed in the up-flow fixed-bed reactor. Nitrite removal in the hybrid and up-flow fixed-bed Anammox reactors averaged 80.8% and 62.5%, respectively.

Current evidence suggests that these reversible phenotypic traits result from their intercalation into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. We have endeavoured to potentiate the capacity of ECg to modify the MRSA phenotype by stepwise removal of hydroxyl groups from the B-ring pharmacophore and the A:C fused ring system of the naturally occurring molecule. ECg binds rapidly to the membrane, inducing up-regulation of genes responsible for protection against cell wall stress and maintenance of membrane integrity and function. Studies with artificial membranes modelled on the lipid composition of the staphylococcal bilayer indicated that ECg adopts a position deep within the lipid palisade, eliciting major alterations in the thermotropic behaviour of the bilayer. The non-galloylated homolog (-)-epicatechin enhanced ECg-mediated effects by facilitating entry of ECg molecules into the membrane. ECg analogs with unnatural B-ring hydroxylation patterns induced higher levels of gene expression and more profound changes to MRSA membrane fluidity than ECg but adopted a more superficial location within the bilayer. ECg possessed a high affinity for the positively charged staphylococcal membrane and induced changes to the biophysical properties of the bilayer that are likely to account for its capacity to disperse the cell wall biosynthetic machinery responsible for β-lactam resistance. The ability to enhance these properties by chemical modification of ECg raises the possibility that more potent analogs could be developed for clinical evaluation.

In conclusion, hyaluronic acid is characterized by notable antiadhesive properties, while it shows a moderate activity against bacterial biofilm. As bacterial adhesion to oral cells is the first step for colonization, these results further sustain the role of hyaluronic acid in prevention of respiratory infections.

Detailed investigation of the effects of the FL-fraction on QS-regulated violacein production in C. violaceum ATCC12472 and pyocyanin production, proteolytic, elastolytic activities, swarming motility and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was performed using standard methods. Possible mechanisms of QS-inhibition were studied by assessing violacein production in response to N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) synthesis in the presence of the FL-fraction in C. violaceum ATCC31532 and by evaluating the induction of violacein in the mutant C. violaceum CV026 by AHL extracted from the culture supernatants of C. violaceum 31532. Active compounds in the FL-fraction were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Inhibition of violacein production by the FL-fraction in a C. violaceum CV026 biosensor bioassay indicated possible anti-QS activity. The FL-fraction showed concentration-dependent decreases in violacein production in C. violaceum 12472 and inhibited pyocyanin production, proteolytic and elastolytic activities, swarming motility and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Interestingly, the FL-fraction did not inhibit AHL synthesis; AHL extracted from cultures of C. violaceum 31532 grown in the presence of the FL-fraction induced violacein in the mutant C. violaceum CV026. LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of quercetin and quercetin-3-O-arabinoside in the FL-fraction. Both quercetin and quercetin-3-O-arabinoside inhibited violacein production in C. violaceum 12472, at 50 and 100 μg/mL, respectively.

Microbial biofilms are likely responsible for a large proportion of clinically significant infections and the multicellular nature of biofilm existence has been repeatedly associated with antibiotic resistance. Classical in vitro antibiotic-susceptibility testing utilizes artificial growth media and planktonic microbes, but this method may not account for the variability inherent in environments subject to biofilm growth in vivo. Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that nutrient concentration can modulate the antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Developing S. aureus biofilms initiated on surgical sutures, and in selected experiments planktonic cultures, were incubated for 16 h in 66 % tryptic soy broth, 0.2 % glucose (1× TSBg), supplemented with bactericidal concentrations of gentamicin, streptomycin, ampicillin or vancomycin. In parallel experiments, antibiotics were added to growth medium diluted one-third (1/3× TSBg) or concentrated threefold (3× TSBg). Following incubation, viable bacteria were enumerated from planktonic cultures or suture sonicates, and biofilm biomass was assayed using spectrophotometry. Interestingly, bactericidal concentrations of gentamicin (5 µg gentamicin ml(-1)) and streptomycin (32 µg streptomycin ml(-1)) inhibited biofilm formation in samples incubated in 1/3× or 1× TSBg, but not in samples incubated in 3× TSBg. The nutrient dependence of aminoglycoside susceptibility is not only associated with biofilm formation, as planktonic cultures incubated in 3× TSBg in the presence of gentamicin also showed antibiotic resistance. These findings appeared specific for aminoglycosides because biofilm formation was inhibited in all three growth media supplemented with bactericidal concentrations of the cell wall-active antibiotics, ampicillin and vancomycin. Additional experiments showed that the ability of 3× TSBg to overcome the antibacterial effects of gentamicin was associated with decreased uptake of gentamicin by S. aureus. Uptake is known to be decreased at low pH, and the kinetic change in pH of growth medium from biofilms incubated in 5 µg gentamicin ml(-1) in the presence of 3× TSBg was decreased when compared with pH determinations from biofilms formed in 1/3× or 1× TSBg.

Changes are induced by indole concentrations of 0.5-1.0 mM, similar to those found in the supernatant of Escherichia coli stationary phase culture. Here we describe an alternative mode of indole signalling that promotes the survival of E. coli cells during long-term stationary phase. A mutant that has lost the ability to produce indole demonstrates reduced survival under these conditions. Significantly, the addition of 1 mM indole to the culture supernatant is insufficient to restore long-term survival to the mutant. We provide evidence that the pertinent signal in this case is not 1 mM indole in the culture supernatant but a transient pulse of intra-cellular indole at the transition from exponential growth to stationary phase. During this pulse the cell-associated indole reaches a maximum of approximately 60 mM. We argue that this is sufficient to inhibit growth and division by an ionophore-based mechanism and causes the cells to enter stationary phase before resources are exhausted. The unused resources are used to repair and maintain cells during the extended period of starvation.

Biofilms are often studied with respect to bacterial interactions. Many cells inhabiting biofilms are assumed to express 'cooperative traits', like the secretion of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). These traits can enhance biofilm-related properties, such as stress resilience or colony expansion, while being costly to the cells that express them. In well-mixed populations cooperation is difficult to achieve, because non-cooperative individuals can reap the benefits of cooperation without having to pay the costs. The physical process of biofilm growth can, however, result in the spatial segregation of cooperative from non-cooperative individuals. This segregation can prevent non-cooperative cells from exploiting cooperative neighbors. Here we examine the interaction between spatial pattern formation and cooperation in Bacillus subtilis biofilms. We show, experimentally and by mathematical modeling, that the density of cells at the onset of biofilm growth affects pattern formation during biofilm growth. At low initial cell densities, co-cultured strains strongly segregate in space, whereas spatial segregation does not occur at high initial cell densities. As a consequence, EPS-producing cells have a competitive advantage over non-cooperative mutants when biofilms are initiated at a low density of founder cells, whereas EPS-deficient cells have an advantage at high cell densities. These results underline the importance of spatial pattern formation for competition among bacterial strains and the evolution of microbial cooperation.

This review aims to compile what is known presently about the diverse roles of sRNA transcripts in the regulation of metabolic processes, in different growth conditions, in adaptation to stress and in microbial pathogenesis. Several recent studies revealed that sRNA molecules are implicated in carbon metabolism and transport, amino acid metabolism or metal sensing. Moreover, regulatory RNAs participate in cellular adaptation to environmental changes, e.g. through quorum sensing systems or development of biofilms, and analyses of several sRNAs under various physiological stresses and culture conditions have already been performed. In addition, recent experiments performed with Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens showed that regulatory RNAs play important roles in microbial virulence and during infection. The combined results show the diversity of regulation mechanisms and physiological processes in which sRNA molecules are key actors.

This calcium effect has not been reported on calcareous materials. The importance of the effect of calcium on EPS production and biofilm formation is discussed in relation to other applications of CaCO3 precipitation by bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Angélica López-Moreno"},{"name":"José David Sepúlveda-Sánchez"},{"name":"Elia Mercedes Mercedes Alonso Guzmán"},{"name":"Sylvie Le Borgne"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BG-11, Blue Green mineral medium"},{"word":"BLAST, basic local alignment search tool"},{"word":"CPS, capsular polysaccharides"},{"word":"CR, Congo Red"},{"word":"CaCO3 precipitation"},{"word":"EPS production"},{"word":"EPS, extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"MEGA, molecular evolutionary genetics analysis"},{"word":"NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information"},{"word":"OD, optical density"},{"word":"PBS, phosphate buffered saline"},{"word":"PGY-BG11, BG-11 medium supplemented with peptone, glucose and yeast extract"},{"word":"SEM, scanning electron microscopy"},{"word":"XRD, X-ray diffraction"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"calcium effect"},{"word":"heterotrophic bacteria"},{"word":"ignimbrite stones"},{"word":"rRNA, ribosomal ribonucleic acid"}]},"article290":{"pmid":"24689056","title":"Clinical outcomes after treatment of periodontal intrabony defects with nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (Ostim) or enamel matrix derivatives (Emdogain): a randomized controlled clinical trial.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Periodontitis is an inflammatory process in response to dental biofilm and leads to periodontal tissue destruction.

The ability to form biofilms is now considered an attribute of many microorganisms. Diseases associated with biofilms require novel methods for their prevention, diagnosis and treatment; this is largely due to the properties of biofilms. Furthermore, the presence of biofilms on surfaces found at farms, slaughterhouses or food processing plants will have an impact on the efficacy of disinfection protocols.

Our previous study showed that a submicron textured polyurethane surface can inhibit staphylococcal bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. To further understand the effect of the geometry of textures on bacterial adhesion as well as the underlying mechanism, in this study, submicron and micron textured polyurethane surfaces featuring ordered arrays of pillars were fabricated and modified to have different wettabilities. All the textured surfaces were originally hydrophobic and showed significant reductions in Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A adhesion in phosphate buffered saline or 25% platelet poor plasma solutions under shear, as compared to smooth surfaces. After being subjected to an air glow discharge plasma treatment, all polyurethane surfaces were modified to hydrophilic, and reductions in bacterial adhesion on surfaces were subsequently found to be dependent on the size of the patterns. The submicron patterned surfaces reduced bacterial adhesion, while the micron patterned surfaces led to increased bacterial adhesion. The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from the S. epidermidis cell surfaces were extracted and purified, and were coated on a glass colloidal surface so that the adhesion force and separation energy in interactions of the EPS and the surface could be measured by colloidal probe atomic force microscopy. These results were consistent with the bacterial adhesion observations. Overall, the data suggest that the increased surface hydrophobicity and the decreased availability of the contact area contributes to a reduction in bacterial adhesion to the hydrophobic textured surfaces, while the availability of the contact area is the primary determinant factor for bacterial adhesion on hydrophilic textured surfaces.

First, the biofilms and cavity were studied in terms of their algal growth-influencing factors to understand the dynamics of colonization in these very harsh environments. Next, colorimetric measurements were used both to diagnose the initial colonization state and monitor the UV-C-treated biofilms for several months after irradiation. The results indicated that passive dispersal vectors of the viable spores and cells were the primary factors involved in the cave's algae repartition. The illumination time during visits appeared to be responsible for greater colonization in some parts of the cave. We also showed that colorimetric measurements could be used for the detection of both thin and thick biofilms, regardless of the type of colonized surface. Finally, our results showed that UV-C treatment led to bleaching of the treated biofilm due to chlorophyll degradation even one year after UV-C treatment.

However, we discovered that biofilm formed by a panel of S. lugdunensis isolates growing in iron-restricted medium was susceptible to degradation by proteases and not by metaperiodate, suggesting that the biofilm matrix comprised proteins and not PNAG. When the iron concentration was raised to 1 mM biofilm formation by all strains tested was greatly reduced. A mutant of strain N920143 lacking the entire locus that encodes iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins was defective in biofilm formation under iron-limited conditions. An IsdC-null mutant was defective, whereas IsdK, IsdJ, and IsdB mutants formed biofilm to the same level as the parental strain. Expression of IsdC was required both for the primary attachment to unconditioned polystyrene and for the accumulation phase of biofilm involving cell-cell interactions. Purified recombinant IsdC protein formed dimers in solution and Lactococcus lactis cells expressing only IsdC adhered to immobilized recombinant IsdC but not to IsdJ, IsdK, or IsdB. This is consistent with a specific homophilic interaction between IsdC molecules on neighboring cells contributing to accumulation of S. lugdunensis biofilm in vivo.

Herbaspirillum seropedicae Z67 (ATCC 35892) genome encodes GDH apoprotein but lacks genes for the biosynthesis of its cofactor PQQ. In this study, pqqE of Erwinia herbicola (in plasmid pJNK1) and pqq gene clusters of Pseudomonas fluorescens B16 (pOK53) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (pSS2) were over-expressed in H. seropedicae Z67. Transformants Hs (pSS2) and Hs (pOK53) secreted micromolar levels of PQQ and attained high GDH activity leading to secretion of 33.46 mM gluconic acid when grown on 50 mM glucose while Hs (pJNK1) was ineffective. Hs (pJNK1) failed to solubilize rock phosphate, while Hs (pSS2) and Hs (pOK53) liberated 125.47 μM and 168.07 μM P, respectively, in minimal medium containing 50 mM glucose under aerobic conditions. Moreover, under N-free minimal medium, Hs (pSS2) and Hs (pOK53) not only released significant P but also showed enhanced growth, biofilm formation, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) secretion. However, indole acetic acid (IAA) production was suppressed. Thus, the addition of the pqq gene cluster, but not pqqE alone, is sufficient for engineering phosphate solubilization in H. seropedicae Z67 without compromising growth under nitrogen-fixing conditions.

Thioflavin T fluorescence showed that the laminar flow also induced adhesin aggregation into surface amyloid nanodomains in Als5p-expressing cells. Inhibitory concentrations of the amyloid dyes thioflavin S and Congo red or a sequence-specific anti-amyloid peptide decreased binding and biofilm formation under flow. Shear-induced binding also led to formation of robust biofilms. There was less shear-activated increase in adhesion, thioflavin fluorescence, and biofilm formation in cells expressing the amyloid-impaired V326N-substituted Als5p. Similarly, S. cerevisiae cells expressing Flo1p or Flo11p flocculins also showed shear-dependent binding, amyloid formation, biofilm formation, and inhibition by anti-amyloid compounds.

Electrostatic repulsion between the film and electrode surface is believed to drive biofilm detachment under these conditions. However, when the biofilm-coated substrates were treated at potentials negative of -1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, complete removal of a biofilm was achieved within seconds. Under these conditions, vigorous evolution of hydrogen gas is believed to be responsible for the film removal, mechanically detaching the bacteria and extracellular polymeric matrix from the substrate.

Attachment loss of periodontal tissue is primarily caused by host cell-derived immune responses against subgingival biofilm. The aim of the present study was to determine the cytokine profile in serum, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) patients with periodontitis and healthy controls. We show that periodontitis patients exhibit higher numbers of periodontal pathogens and their immune responses are significantly altered. The levels of IL-6 in saliva and GCF were significantly suppressed, and while CXCL8 was not altered in serum, its expression levels were significantly suppressed in saliva and elevated in GCF. The T-cell-derived cytokine IL-2 did not differ between patients and controls in serum and saliva, but there was a significant suppression in GCF of patients. Interestingly, TGF-β1 levels were significantly elevated in serum, saliva and GCF in patients compared to controls. Furthermore, by using cultured gingival fibroblasts stimulated with wild type and proteinase mutant strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, we show that the suppression of CXCL8 and IL-6, and the induction of TGF-β1 is primarily mediated by the proteolytic activity of lysine-specific proteinases. These results indicate that P. gingivalis is a major contributor to the altered immune responses and the pathology of periodontitis. Furthermore, the ease of sampling and analyzing cytokine expression profiles, including TGF-β1, in saliva and GCF may serve to predict the progression of periodontitis and associated systemic inflammatory diseases.

Based on Plackett-Burman design (PBD), glucose, yeast extract, and KH2PO4 were selected as significant variables, which were further optimized by a central composite design (CCD). According to response surface and canonical analysis, the optimal medium was composed of 16.94 g/L glucose, 2.33 g/L yeast extract, and 5.32 g/L KH2PO4. Under this condition, the maximum yield of B4-EPS reached about 8.54 g/L after 72 hr of batch fermentation, which was pretty close to the predicted value (8.52 g/L). Furthermore, B4-EPS was refined by column chromatography. The main homogeneous fraction (B4-EPS1) was collected and applied to assay of antibiofilm activity. B4-EPS1 exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 without antibacterial activity. About 86.1% of biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was inhibited in the presence of 50 µg/mL B4-EPS1, which was more effective than the peer published data. Moreover, B4-EPS1 could prevent biofilm formation of other strains. These data suggest B4-EPS may represent a promising strategy to combat bacterial biofilms in the future.

However, the taxonomic composition and functions of microbial communities that generate distinctive clotted microbialites (thrombolites) are less well understood. Here, microscopy and deep shotgun sequencing were used to characterize the microbiome (microbial taxa and their genomes) associated with a single cyanobacterial host linked by 16S sequences to Nostoc commune Vaucher ex Bornet & Flahault, which dominates abundant littoral clotted microbialites in shallow, subpolar, freshwater Laguna Larga in southern Chile.

A surface biofilm included >50 nonoxygenic bacterial genera (taxa other than Nostoc) that indicate diverse ecological functions. The Laguna Larga Nostoc microbiome included the sulfate reducers Desulfomicrobium and Sulfospirillum and genes encoding all known proteins specific to sulfate reduction, a process known to facilitate carbonate deposition by increasing pH.

We investigated the role of the QseC in the formation of biofilms on the surface of medical-grade polyvinyl chloride using the E. coli K-12 MC1000 strain as well as a corresponding qseC mutant. Addition of EPI/NE increased biofilm formation by wild-type K-12 MC1000 but not by the isogenic qseC mutant. Scanning confocal laser microscopy corroborated these results by showing that EPI/NE addition significantly increased biofilm's thickness. As expected, the addition of EPI/NE to the qseC mutant, which lacks the ability to sense the hormones, failed to stimulate biofilm formation. Since EPI/NE addition increased bacterial motility, we proposed that their stimulatory effects on biofilm formation occur by enhancing bacterial motility and altering biofilm architecture. We also found that EPI/NE regulate motility and the biofilm phenotype via QseC, as motility was diminished and biofilm formation was significantly decreased in a qseC deletion mutant. These results indicate that EPI/NE induce E. coli biofilm formation on the surface of polyvinyl chloride through QseC.

PS pegs were uncoated (bare PS) or individually coated with whey proteins isolate (WPI), β-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, or tryptic soy broth (TSB) and were incubated in bacterial suspensions in modified Welshimer's broth. After 4 h, the number of adherent cells was dependent on the coating, as follows: TSB (10(7) CFU/ml) > bare PS > β-lactoglobulin > bovine serum albumin ∼ WPI (10(4) CFU/ml). The sessile cell counts increased up to 24 h, reaching > 10(7) CFU per peg for all surfaces (P > 0.1), except for WPI-coated PS; this indicates that the inhibitory effects of milk protein conditioning films are transient, slowing down the adhesion process.

The CLPs of CMR12a were studied by chemical structure analysis and in silico analysis of the gene clusters encoding the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases responsible for CLP biosynthesis. CMR12a produces two different classes of CLPs: orfamides B, D and E, whereby the latter two represent new derivatives of the orfamide family, and sessilins A-C. The orfamides are made up of a 10 amino acid peptide coupled to a β-hydroxydodecanoyl or β-hydroxytetradecanoyl fatty acid moiety, and are related to orfamides produced by biocontrol strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5. The sessilins consist of an 18-amino acid peptide linked to a β-hydroxyoctanoyl fatty acid and differ in one amino acid from tolaasins, toxins produced by the mushroom pathogen Pseudomonas tolaasii. CLP biosynthesis mutants were constructed and tested for biofilm formation and swarming motility. Orfamides appeared indispensable for swarming while sessilin mutants showed reduced biofilm formation, but enhanced swarming motility. The interplay between the two classes of CLPs fine tunes these processes. The presence of sessilins in wild type CMR12a interferes with swarming by hampering the release of orfamides and by co-precipitating orfamides to form a white line in agar.","authors":[{"name":"Jolien D'aes"},{"name":"Nam Phuong Kieu"},{"name":"Valérie Léclère"},{"name":"Caroline Tokarski"},{"name":"Feyisara Eyiwumi Olorunleke"},{"name":"Katrien De Maeyer"},{"name":"Philippe Jacques"},{"name":"Monica Höfte"},{"name":"Marc Ongena"}],"keywords":[]},"article336":{"pmid":"24673176","title":"Characterization of exopolymeric substances (EPS) produced by Aeromonas hydrophila under reducing conditions.","date":"2014-04-11","abs":"The aim of this work was to investigate the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by Aeromonas hydrophila grown under anaerobic conditions.

However, current results are ambiguous and the simultaneous impact of multiple ubiquitous enemies, protists and phages on virulence evolution has not been investigated previously. Here we tested experimentally how Tetrahymena thermophila protist predation and PNM phage parasitism (bacteria-specific virus) alone and together affect the evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 virulence, measured in wax moth larvae. Protist predation selected for small colony types, both in the absence and presence of phage, which showed decreased edibility to protists, reduced growth in the absence of enemies and attenuated virulence. Although phage selection alone did not affect the bacterial phenotype, it weakened protist-driven antipredatory defence (biofilm formation), its associated pleiotropic growth cost and the correlated reduction in virulence. These results suggest that protist selection can be a strong coincidental driver of attenuated bacterial virulence, and that phages can constrain this effect owing to effects on population dynamics and conflicting selection pressures. Attempting to define causal links such as these might help us to predict the cold and hot spots of coincidental virulence evolution on the basis of microbial community composition of environmental reservoirs.

Nitric oxide (NO) homeostasis is crucial to mammalian physiology. The recently described entero-salivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway has been shown to provide bioactive NO from dietary nitrate sources. Interestingly, this pathway is dependent upon oral nitrate-reducing bacteria, since humans lack this enzyme activity. This pathway appears to represent a newly recognized symbiosis between oral nitrate-reducing bacteria and their human hosts in which the bacteria provide nitrite and nitric oxide from nitrate reduction. Here we measure the nitrate-reducing capacity of tongue-scraping samples from six healthy human volunteers, and analyze metagenomes of the bacterial communities to identify bacteria contributing to nitrate reduction. We identified 14 candidate species, seven of which were not previously believed to contribute to nitrate reduction. We cultivated isolates of four candidate species in single- and mixed-species biofilms, revealing that they have substantial nitrate- and nitrite-reduction capabilities. Colonization by specific oral bacteria may thus contribute to host NO homeostasis by providing nitrite and nitric oxide. Conversely, the lack of specific nitrate-reducing communities may disrupt the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway and lead to a state of NO insufficiency. These findings may also provide mechanistic evidence for the oral systemic link. Our results provide a possible new therapeutic target and paradigm for NO restoration in humans by specific oral bacteria.

Mature Proteus mirabilis crystalline biofilms detach from silicone elastomer substrates upon application of strain to the substrate, and increasing the strain rate increases biofilm detachment. The study presents a quantitative relationship between applied strain rate and biofilm debonding through an analysis of biofilm segment length and the driving force for debonding. Based on this mechanism, hydraulic and pneumatic elastomer actuation is used to achieve surface strain selectively within the lumen of prototypes of sections of a fouling-release urinary catheter. Proof-of-concept prototypes of sections of active, fouling-release catheters are constructed using techniques typical to soft robotics including 3D printing and replica molding, and those prototypes demonstrate release of mature P. mirabilis crystalline biofilms (e.g., ≈90%) from strained surfaces.

All strains were evaluated for the presence of the biofilm-associated icaAD genes by PCR, their capability to produce extracellular polysaccharide (slime) on Congo red agar plates and their ability to form surface-attached aggregates (biofilms) in glucose-supplemented trypticase soy broth (TSBg) using a crystal violet staining assay. A subset of four strains (two slow growers and two fast growers) was further examined for the ability for biofilm formation in PCs. Two of these strains carried the icAD genes, formed slime and produced biofilms in TSBg and PCs, while the other two strains, which did not carry icaAD, did not produce slime or form biofilms in TSBg. Although the two ica-negative slime-negative strains did not form biofilms in media, they displayed a biofilm-positive phenotype in PCs. Although all four strains formed biofilms in PCs, the two slow growers formed significantly more biofilms than the fast growers. Furthermore, growth experiments of the two ica-positive strains in plasma-conditioned platelet bags containing TSBg revealed that a slow grower isolate was more likely to escape culture-based screening than a fast grower strain.

The plethora of biofilm characteristics that could give rise to persisters, including slower growth, quorum signaling, oxidative stress, and nutrient heterogeneity, have complicated efforts to delineate formation pathways that generate persisters during biofilm development. Here we sought to specifically determine whether nutrient transitions, which are a common metabolic stress encountered within surface-attached communities, stimulate persister formation in biofilms and if so, to then identify the pathway. To accomplish this, we established an experimental methodology where nutrient availability to biofilm cells could be controlled exogenously, and then used that method to discover that diauxic carbon source transitions stimulated persister formation in Escherichia coli biofilms. Previously, we found that carbon source transitions stimulate persister formation in planktonic E. coli cultures, through a pathway that involved ppGpp and nucleoid-associated proteins, and therefore, tested the functionality of that pathway in biofilms. Biofilm persister formation was also found to be dependent on ppGpp and nucleoid-associated proteins, but the importance of specific proteins and enzymes between biofilm and planktonic lifestyles was significantly different. Data presented here support the increasingly appreciated role of ppGpp as a central mediator of bacterial persistence and demonstrate that nutrient transitions can be a source of persisters in biofilms.

The objective of this chapter is to describe the steps involved in the taxonomic and functional analysis of metagenome datasets from biofilm involved in microbial-induced concrete corrosion (MICC).","authors":[{"name":"Vicente Gomez-Alvarez"}],"keywords":[]},"article360":{"pmid":"24664843","title":"Capturing air-water interface biofilms for microscopy and molecular analysis.","date":"2014-03-25","abs":"Described here is a simple and versatile technique for capturing small samples of the thin biofilm that is located at the meniscus of almost every air-water interface (AWI), an electrostatically distinct aquatic domain/habitat.

Most cases of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) involve colonization of microorganisms on catheter surfaces where they form a biofilm.

Fungal biofilm formation is studied using a number of techniques, involving the use of a wide variety of substrates and growth conditions. In vitro techniques involving the use of confocal scanning laser/scanning electron microscopy, metabolic activity assay, dry weight measurements, and antifungal susceptibility assays are increasingly used by investigators to quantify and evaluate biofilm morphology.

In many cases the only solution is revision surgery in which the hardware is removed. This process is extremely long and painful for patients and is a considerable financial burden for the health-care system. A significant proportion of the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of PJI are associated with biofilm formation where bacteria attach to the surface of the prosthesis and periprosthetic tissue and build a 3-D biofilm community encased in an extracellular polymeric slime (EPS) matrix. Bacteria in biofilms have a low metabolic rate which is thought to be a major contributor to their recalcitrance to antibiotic treatment.

Chitinases of F. tularensis ssp. novicida (Fn) have been suggested to regulate biofilm formation on chitin surfaces. However, the underlying mechanisms of how chitinases may regulate biofilm formation are not fully determined. We hypothesized that Fn chitinase modulates bacterial surface properties resulting in the alteration of biofilm formation. We analyzed biofilm formation under diverse conditions using chitinase mutants and their counterpart parental strain. Substratum surface charges affected biofilm formation and initial attachments. Biophysical analysis of bacterial surfaces confirmed that the chi mutants had a net negative-charge. Lectin binding assays suggest that chitinase cleavage of its substrates could have exposed the concanavalin A-binding epitope. Fn biofilm was sensitive to chitinase, proteinase and DNase, suggesting that Fn biofilm contains exopolysaccharides, proteins and extracellular DNA. Exogenous chitinase increased the drug susceptibility of Fn biofilms to gentamicin while decreasing the amount of biofilm. In addition, chitinase modulated bacterial adhesion and invasion of A549 and J774A.1 cells as well as intracellular bacterial replication. Our results support a key role of the chitinase(s) in biofilm formation through modulation of the bacterial surface properties.

KatA is the major catalase of PA that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive oxygen intermediate generated during aerobic respiration. Paradoxically, PA displays elevated KatA activity under anaerobic growth conditions where the substrate of KatA, H2O2, is not produced. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon and define the role of KatA in PA during anaerobiosis using genetic, biochemical and biophysical approaches. We demonstrated that anaerobic wild-type PAO1 cells yielded higher levels of katA transcription and expression than aerobic cells, whereas a nitrite reductase mutant ΔnirS produced ∼50% the KatA activity of PAO1, suggesting that a basal NO level was required for the increased KatA activity. We also found that transcription of the katA gene was controlled, in part, by the master anaerobic regulator, ANR. A ΔkatA mutant and a mucoid mucA22 ΔkatA bacteria demonstrated increased sensitivity to acidified nitrite (an NO generator) in anaerobic planktonic and biofilm cultures. EPR spectra of anaerobic bacteria showed that levels of dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNIC), indicators of NO stress, were increased significantly in the ΔkatA mutant, and dramatically in a ΔnorCB mutant compared to basal levels of DNIC in PAO1 and ΔnirS mutant. Expression of KatA dramatically reduced the DNIC levels in ΔnorCB mutant. We further revealed direct NO-KatA interactions in vitro using EPR, optical spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. KatA has a 5-coordinate high spin ferric heme that binds NO without prior reduction of the heme iron (Kd ∼6 μM). Collectively, we conclude that KatA is expressed to protect PA against NO generated during anaerobic respiration. We proposed that such protective effects of KatA may involve buffering of free NO when potentially toxic concentrations of NO are approached.

The majority of H. pylori cells demonstrate rod-shape morphology occurring in two subtypes: spiral and S-shaped. Both are isolated from mucus layer biopsy specimens of the stomach or from short-term cultures. However, results obtained from electron microscopy revealed that H. pylori long-term cultures not only consist of classic, spiral shaped bacteria, but also contain alternative forms of coccoid cells. Further investigations showed that coccoid forms of H. pylori may be divided into two types: viable but non-culturable coccus (VBnC) and a degenerative form, coccoid stage which is probably the effect of bacterial cell death. Transformation from spiral to coccoid form is induced under stress conditions, such as the presence of antibiotics. But still there is no evidence for reversion from the coccoid state to the viable and infectious spiral form. Besides the planktonic form, H. pylori also forms homo-, and heterogenic biofilms, which may constitute a potential environmental reservoir of this bacterium.

The variation in those properties suggests that morphological forms of H. pylori are potentially involved in the transmission of the infection.

The dose-response effects of the eight β-lactam antibiotics on LAC biofilm varied from biphasic and bimodal to near-linear. We also found that sub-MIC methicillin induced biofilm in 33 out of 39 additional MRSA clinical isolates, which also exhibited biphasic, bimodal and linear dose-response curves. The amount of biofilm formation induced by sub-MIC methicillin was inversely proportional to the susceptibility of each strain to methicillin. Our results demonstrate that induction of biofilm by sub-MIC antibiotics is a common phenotype among MRSA clinical strains and is specific for β-lactam antibiotics. These findings may have relevance to the use of β-lactam antibiotics in clinical and agricultural settings.

Moreover, these proteins are multifunctional virulence factors involved in several other biological traits, including invasion into host cells and evasion of the host immune system. In cystic fibrosis epidemic Burkholderia cenocepacia strain J2315, we identified a unique TAA (BCAM0224)-encoding gene, previously described as being implicated in virulence. Here, we characterized this multifunctional protein, trying to establish its role in B. cenocepacia pathogenicity. We show that BCAM0224 occurs on the bacterial surface and adopts a trimeric conformation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BCAM0224 is needed for earlier stages of biofilm formation and is required for swarming motility. In addition, BCAM0224 plays an important role in evasion of the human innate immune system, providing resistance against the bactericidal activity of serum via the complement classical pathway. Finally, BCAM0224 mediates bacterial adhesion to and invasion of cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. Together, these data reveal the high versatility of the BCAM0224 protein as a virulence factor in the pathogenic bacterium B. cenocepacia.

Therefore, it would be important to research the ability of Anammox biomass to form biofilms under different conditions. The effects of shear stress and salinity (NaCl and CaCl2) on Anammox biofilm formation were studied. Anammox bacteria showed good attachment capacity, with an initial adhesion phase lasting for 5-7 days at the different flow rates tested (Reynolds numbers 54, 63, 188 and 400). A four-parameter model was developed and the experimental data fitted well into the model. The presence of 5 g/L of each of the two salts favoured the formation of Anammox biofilm. The effects of CaCl2 were stronger than those caused by NaCl. 15 g/L of NaCl was detrimental for the biofilm, probably due to an inhibitory effect.

We present evidence that, in addition to bapA, BapR influences the expression of extracellular proteases, swimming motility and has a profound impact in the incidence of persister cells, making this regulator an interesting target for persister cells and biofilm eradication.

This study investigated the microbial community at a food production facility, examining interactions between Listeria and the associated microbiome. Listeria species can be transferred between zones in the production environment by individuals or equipment, and drains may act as a reservoir for the organism, reflecting the microbial flora potentially in the production environment. Drains that were colonized by Listeria species and those determined to be free of Listeria were examined. In each case, 16S rRNA gene analysis was performed using the PhyloChip platform. Some general similarities in bacterial population structure were observed when Listeria-negative and -positive drain communities were compared, with some distinct differences also noted. These included increased populations of the genera Prevotella and Janthinobacterium associated with the absence of Listeria species, whereas Enterococcus and Rhodococcus were in higher abundance in drains colonized by Listeria species. Based on these results, a selection of bacterial species were grown in coculture biofilm with a Listeria monocytogenes strain identified as having colonized a drain at the facility. Mixed-species biofilm experiments showed that Janthinobacterium inhibited attachment and subsequent biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes; however, Enterococcus gallinarum significantly increased it. The results of this study suggest the microbial community in food processing facilities can impact the colonization of Listeria species and that influencing the microbiome in favor of antilisterial species may reduce the colonization of Listeria species and limit the likelihood of product/process contamination.

This study was conducted to examine the effect of patterned topographies on bacterial fouling using Enterobacter cloacae as the test model. E. cloacae is an opportunistic pathogen involved frequently in nosocomial infections. It is an important model organism to be studied in the context of healthcare associated infections (HAI) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based urinary catheter fouling. Patterned surfaces, such as Sharklet™, have shown the promise of being a benign surface treatment for prevention of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). To the best of our knowledge, inhibition of fouling by E. cloacae has not been demonstrated on microscale patterned PDMS surfaces. In this study, the Sharklet™ and smooth PDMS surfaces were used as controls. All pattern surfaces had statistically significantly lower percentage area coverage compared to the smooth PDMS control. A cross type feature (C-1-PDMS), demonstrated the most significant reduction in percent area coverage, 89% (p<0.01, α=0.05), compared to the smooth PDMS control and all other patterned test surfaces. Additionally, theoretical calculations show that C-1-PDMS is the only surface predicted to hold the thermodynamically stable Cassie state, which occurs due to trapping air pockets at the liquid-solid interface. Combined the results provide new insights for designing environmentally benign, novel, microscale patterned surfaces for restricting bacterial fouling.
