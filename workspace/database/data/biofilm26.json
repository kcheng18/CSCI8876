Candida albicans interact with Streptococcus mutans in dental biofilms associated with severe childhood tooth-decay, a prevalent pediatric oral disease. Current modalities are ineffective and primarily based on antimicrobial monotherapies despite the polymicrobial nature of the infection. Here, we show that the combination of clinically used topical antifungal fluconazole with povidone iodine (PI) can completely suppress C. albicans carriage and mixed-biofilm formation without increasing bacterial killing activity in vivo. We unexpectedly found that the inclusion of PI enhanced fluconazole efficacy by potently disrupting the assembly of a protective bacterial exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix through inhibition of α-glucan synthesis by S. mutans exoenzyme (GtfB) bound on the fungal surface. Further analyses revealed that the EPS produced in situ directly bind and sequester fluconazole, reducing uptake and intracellular transportation of the drug. Conversely, inhibition of GtfB activity by PI, enzymatic degradation of the α-glucan matrix or co-culturing with gtfB-defective S. mutans re-established antifungal susceptibility. Hence, topical antifungal has limitations in mixed oral biofilms due to enhanced C. albicans tolerance to fluconazole afforded by the shielding effect of bacterial-derived EPS. The data provide new insights for treatment of C. albicans in cross-kingdom biofilms, indicating that EPS inhibitors may be required for enhanced killing efficacy and optimal anti-biofilm activity.","authors":[{"name":"Dongyeop Kim"},{"name":"Yuan Liu"},{"name":"Raphael I Benhamou"},{"name":"Hiram Sanchez"},{"name":"Áurea Simón-Soro"},{"name":"Yong Li"},{"name":"Geelsu Hwang"},{"name":"Micha Fridman"},{"name":"David R Andes"},{"name":"Hyun Koo"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"29670216","title":"Micro-scale intermixing: a requisite for stable and synergistic co-establishment in a four-species biofilm.","date":"2019-08-02","abs":"Microorganisms frequently coexist in complex multispecies communities, where they distribute non-randomly, reflective of the social interactions that occur. It is therefore important to understand how social interactions and local spatial organization influences multispecies biofilm succession. Here the localization of species pairs was analyzed in three dimensions in a reproducible four-species biofilm model, to study the impact of spatial positioning of individual species on the temporal development of the community. We found, that as the biofilms developed, species pairs exhibited distinct intermixing patterns unique to the four-member biofilms. Higher biomass and more intermixing were found in four-species biofilms compared to biofilms with fewer species. Intriguingly, in local regions within the four member biofilms where Microbacterium oxydans was scant, both biomass and intermixing of all species were lowered, compared to regions where M. oxydans was present at typical densities. Our data suggest that Xanthomonas retroflexus and M. oxydans, both low abundant biofilm-members, intermixed continuously during the development of the four-species biofilm, hereby facilitating their own establishment. In turn, this seems to have promoted distinct spatial organization of Stenotrophomonas rhizophila and Paenibacillus amylolyticus enabling enhanced growth of all four species.

However, the prevailing use of swabs to extract the microorganisms has meant that only population 'snapshots' are obtained, and all spatially resolved information of bacterial growth is lost. Here we report on the temporospatial growth of Staphylococcus aureus on the surface of the human stratum corneum (SC); the outermost layer of skin. This bacterial species dominates bacterial populations on skin with atopic dermatitis (AD). We first establish that the distribution of ceramides naturally present in the SC is heterogeneous, and correlates with the tissue's structural topography. This distribution subsequently impacts the growth of bacterial biofilms. In the SC retaining healthy ceramide concentrations, biofilms exhibit no spatial preference for growth. By contrast, a depletion of ceramides consistent with reductions known to occur with AD enables S. aureus to use the patterned network of topographical canyons as a conduit for growth. The ability of ceramides to govern bacterial growth is confirmed using a topographical skin canyon analogue coated with the ceramide subcomponent d-sphingosine. Our work appears to explain the causal link between ceramide depletion and increased S. aureus populations that is observed in AD. It may also provide insight into disease transmission as well as improving pre-operative skin cleansing techniques.","authors":[{"name":"Joseph M Cleary"},{"name":"Zachary W Lipsky"},{"name":"Minyoung Kim"},{"name":"Cláudia N H Marques"},{"name":"Guy K German"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"ceramide"},{"word":"sphingosine"},{"word":"stratum corneum"},{"word":"topography"}]},"article3":{"pmid":"29669887","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa gshA Mutant Is Defective in Biofilm Formation, Swarming, and Pyocyanin Production.","date":"2019-03-12","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous Gram-negative bacterium that can cause severe opportunistic infections.

However, structures of chemical mediators required by the pathogen for host colonization and infection remain elusive in most cases. Here, we report two types of threonine-tagged lipopeptides conserved among mushroom and rice pathogenic Burkholderia species that facilitate bacterial infection of hosts. Genome mining, metabolic profiling of infected mushrooms, and heterologous expression of orphan gene clusters allowed the discovery of these unprecedented metabolites in the mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli (haereogladin, burriogladin) and the plant pathogen Burkholderia glumae (haereoglumin and burrioglumin). Through targeted gene deletions, the molecular basis of lipopeptide biosynthesis by nonribosomal peptide synthetases was revealed. Surprisingly, both types of lipopeptides feature unusual threonine tags, which yield longer peptide backbones than one would expect based on the canonical colinearity of the NRPS assembly lines. Both peptides play an indirect role in host infection as biosurfactants that enable host colonization by mediating swarming and biofilm formation abilities. Moreover, MALDI imaging mass spectrometry was applied to investigate the biological role of the lipopeptides.

The success of this pathogen in the host colonization and infection results from the presence of several virulence factors, including extracellular peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD), an enzyme that converts protein arginine residues to citrullines. A common opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans, is also frequently identified among microorganisms that reside at subgingival sites. The aim of the current work was to verify if protein citrullination can influence the formation of mixed biofilms by both microorganisms under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Quantitative estimations of the bacterial adhesion to fungal cells demonstrated the importance of PPAD activity in this process, since the level of binding of P. gingivalis mutant strain deprived of PPAD was significantly lower than that observed for the wild-type strain. These results were consistent with mass spectrometric detection of the citrullination of selected surface-exposed C. albicans proteins. Furthermore, a viability of P. gingivalis cells under normoxia increased in the presence of fungal biofilm compared with the bacteria that formed single-species biofilm. These findings suggest a possible protection of these strict anaerobes under unfavorable aerobic conditions by C. albicans during mixed biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Justyna Karkowska-Kuleta"},{"name":"Dominika Bartnicka"},{"name":"Marcin Zawrotniak"},{"name":"Gabriela Zielinska"},{"name":"Anna Kieronska"},{"name":"Oliwia Bochenska"},{"name":"Izabela Ciaston"},{"name":"Joanna Koziel"},{"name":"Jan Potempa"},{"name":"Zbigniew Baster"},{"name":"Zenon Rajfur"},{"name":"Maria Rapala-Kozik"}],"keywords":[]},"article6":{"pmid":"29668457","title":"Probiotics: Evidence of Oral Health Implications.","date":"2020-01-03","abs":"The prevalence of common oral diseases, such as dental caries, periodontal diseases and oral candidiasis remains high in the general population.

Food manufactures face an ongoing challenge in preventing the entry of L. monocytogenes into food production environments (FPEs) due to its ubiquitous nature. In addition to this, the capacity of L. monocytogenes strains to colonize FPEs can lead to repeated identification of L. monocytogenes in FPE surveillance. The contamination of food products requiring product recall presents large economic burden to industry and is further exacerbated by damage to the brand. Poor equipment design, facility layout, and worn or damaged equipment can result in Listeria hotspots and biofilms where traditional cleaning and disinfecting procedures may be inadequate. Novel biocontrol methods may offer FPEs effective means to help improve control of L. monocytogenes and decrease cross contamination of food. Bacteriophages have been used as a medical treatment for many years for their ability to infect and lyse specific bacteria. Endolysins, the hydrolytic enzymes of bacteriophages responsible for breaking the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, are being explored as a biocontrol method for food preservation and in nanotechnology and medical applications. Antibacterial proteins known as bacteriocins have been used as alternatives to antibiotics for biopreservation and food product shelf life extension. Essential oils are natural antimicrobials formed by plants and have been used as food additives and preservatives for many years and more recently as a method to prevent food spoilage by microorganisms. Competitive exclusion occurs naturally among bacteria in the environment. However, intentionally selecting and applying bacteria to effect competitive exclusion of food borne pathogens has potential as a biocontrol application.

S. baltica are incapable of producing acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing signals, but can respond to environmental AHLs. In this paper, Acinetobacter was found to produce three AHLs, i.e. N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (O-C6-HSL) and N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (O-C8-HSL), according to thin-layer chromatography using the bioreporter Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136. The agar diffusion and β-galactosidase assays revealed that S. baltica could eavesdrop on these three AHLs from Acinetobacter. Eavesdropping on Acinetobacter AHLs especially C4-HSL was found to boost the growth of S. baltica particularly under nutrient limiting conditions (up to 40-fold increase) in the co-culture experiments. The azocasein assay revealed that S. baltica produced fourfold more extracellular proteases in response to Acinetobacter AHLs. As demonstrated by the biofilm crystal violet staining assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy, eavesdropping also decreased the biofilm-forming capacity of Acinetobacter. By inoculation of S. baltica and Acinetobacter onto surface-sterilized shrimp, eavesdropping was found to endow a growth advantage to S. baltica in vivo, resulting in a 0.5 day shortened shelf life of shrimp according to total volatile basic nitrogen levels and sensory analysis. Overall, the AHL-dependent eavesdropping increased the spoilage potential of S. baltica, providing a fresh perspective on the spoilage process of refrigerated L. vannamei, and this may inspire the development of novel preservation techniques in the future to further reduce post-harvest loss of shrimp.","authors":[{"name":"Suqin Zhu"},{"name":"Haohao Wu"},{"name":"Caili Zhang"},{"name":"Jinxin Jie"},{"name":"Zunying Liu"},{"name":"Mingyong Zeng"},{"name":"Changyun Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Eavesdropping"},{"word":"Extracellular proteases"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"Shrimp"},{"word":"Spoilage"}]},"article15":{"pmid":"29666284","title":"Biofilms Comprise a Component of the Annual Cycle of Vibrio cholerae in the Bay of Bengal Estuary.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Vibrio cholerae, an estuarine bacterium, is the causative agent of cholera, a severe diarrheal disease that demonstrates seasonal incidence in Bangladesh.

Interestingly, a different compound was identified with an increased ability to potentiate a subset of β-lactam antibiotics. These compounds indicate that biofilm dispersion and potentiation capabilities may not be associated.","authors":[{"name":"Sara E Martin"},{"name":"Catherine M Nguyen"},{"name":"Randall J Basaraba"},{"name":"Christian Melander"}],"keywords":[{"word":"chemical biology"},{"word":"drug design"},{"word":"drug discovery"}]},"article23":{"pmid":"29663554","title":"Periprosthetic bacterial biofilm and quorum sensing.","date":"2019-05-28","abs":"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a common complication after total joint arthroplasty leading to severe morbidity and mortality. With an aging population and increasing prevalence of total joint replacement procedures, the burden of PJI will be felt not only by individual patients, but in increased healthcare costs. Current treatment of PJI is inadequate resulting in incredibly high failure rates. This is believed to be largely mediated by the presence of bacterial biofilms. These polymicrobial bacterial colonies form within secreted extracellular matrices, adhering to the implant surface and local tissue. The biofilm architecture is believed to play a complex and critical role in a variety of bacterial processes including nutrient supplementation, metabolism, waste management, and antibiotic and immune resistance. The establishment of these biofilms relies heavily on the quorum sensing communication systems utilized by bacteria. Early stage research into disrupting bacterial communication by targeting quorum sensing show promise for future clinical applications. However, prevention of the biofilm formation via early forced induction of the biofilm forming process remains yet unexplored. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

A total of 273 draft genomes including ST121 and ST14 newly sequenced and publicly available draft genomes were analyzed. Whole-genome Single Nucleotide Polymorfism (wgSNP) analysis was performed separately on the assemblies of ST121 and ST14 draft genomes. SNPs alignments were used to infer phylogeny. A dataset of L. monocytogenes ecophysiology genes was built based on a comprehensive literature review. The 94 selected genes were screened on the assemblies of all ST121 and ST14 draft genomes. Significant gene enrichments were evaluated by statistical analyses. A persistent ST14 clone, including 23 out of 27 newly sequenced genomes, was circulating in the rabbit-meat plant along with two not persistent clones. A significant enrichment was observed in ST121 genomes concerning stress survival islet 2 (SSI-2) (alkaline and oxidative stress), qacH gene (resistance to benzalkonium chloride), cadA1C gene cassette (resistance to 70 mg/l of cadmium chloride) and a truncated version of actA gene (biofilm formation). Conversely, ST14 draft genomes were enriched with a full-length version of actA gene along with the Listeria Genomic Island 2 (LGI 2) including the ars operon (arsenic resistance) and the cadA4C gene cassette (resistance to 35 mg/l of cadmium chloride). Phenotypic tests confirmed ST121 as a weak biofilm producer in comparison to ST14. In conclusion, ST121 carried the qacH gene and was phenotypically resistant to quaternary ammonium compounds. This property might contribute to the high prevalence of ST121 in food processing plants. ST14 showed greater ability to form biofilms, which might contribute to the occasional colonization and persistence on harborage sites where sanitizing procedures are difficult to display.","authors":[{"name":"Frédérique Pasquali"},{"name":"Federica Palma"},{"name":"Laurent Guillier"},{"name":"Alex Lucchi"},{"name":"Alessandra De Cesare"},{"name":"Gerardo Manfreda"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"adaptation"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"stress"},{"word":"the food processing environment"}]},"article27":{"pmid":"29662232","title":"Characterization of AiiK, an AHL lactonase, from Kurthia huakui LAM0618","date":"2019-10-07","abs":"N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) act as the key quorum sensing (QS) signal molecules in gram-negative bacteria, which coordinates gene expression and then activates various processes, including biofilm formation and production of virulence factors in some pathogens.

A combination of pull-downs and proteomics analyses led to the discovery of a mycobacterial protein, HadD, displaying highly specific interactions with the dehydratase HadAB of FAS-II. In vitro activity assays and homology modeling showed that HadD is, like HadAB, a hot dog folded (R)-specific hydratase/dehydratase. A hadD knockout mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis produced only the medium-size alpha'-MAs. Data strongly suggest that HadD is involved in building the third meromycolic segment during the late FAS-II elongation cycles, leading to the synthesis of the full-size alpha- and epoxy-MAs. The change in the envelope composition induced by hadD inactivation strongly altered the bacterial fitness and capacities to aggregate, assemble into colonies or biofilms and spread by sliding motility, and conferred a hypersensitivity to the firstline antimycobacterial drug rifampicin.

Our understanding of mechanotransduction, and its contribution to vital cellular responses, is a rapidly expanding field of research involving complex processes that are still not clearly understood. The use of mechanical vibration as a stimulus of mechanotransduction, including variation of frequency and amplitude, allows an alternative method to control specific cell behaviour without chemical stimulation (e.g. growth factors). Chemical-independent control of cell behaviour could be highly advantageous for fields including drug discovery and clinical tissue engineering. In this review, a novel technique is described based on nanoscale sinusoidal vibration. Using finite-element analysis in conjunction with laser interferometry, techniques that are used within the field of gravitational wave detection, optimization of apparatus design and calibration of vibration application have been performed. We further discuss the application of nanovibrational stimulation, or 'nanokicking', to eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells including the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells towards an osteoblast cell lineage. Mechanotransductive mechanisms are discussed including mediation through the Rho-A kinase signalling pathway. Optimization of this technique was first performed in two-dimensional culture using a simple vibration platform with an optimal frequency and amplitude of 1 kHz and 22 nm. A novel bioreactor was developed to scale up cell production, with recent research demonstrating that mesenchymal stem cell differentiation can be efficiently triggered in soft gel constructs. This important step provides first evidence that clinically relevant (three-dimensional) volumes of osteoblasts can be produced for the purpose of bone grafting, without complex scaffolds and/or chemical induction. Initial findings have shown that nanovibrational stimulation can also reduce biofilm formation in a number of clinically relevant bacteria. This demonstrates additional utility of the bioreactor to investigate mechanotransduction in other fields of research.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The promises of gravitational-wave astronomy'.","authors":[{"name":"Shaun N Robertson"},{"name":"Paul Campsie"},{"name":"Peter G Childs"},{"name":"Fiona Madsen"},{"name":"Hannah Donnelly"},{"name":"Fiona L Henriquez"},{"name":"William G Mackay"},{"name":"Manuel Salmerón-Sánchez"},{"name":"Monica P Tsimbouri"},{"name":"Craig Williams"},{"name":"Matthew J Dalby"},{"name":"Stuart Reid"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"gravitational waves"},{"word":"mechanotransduction"},{"word":"mesenchymal stem cells"},{"word":"nanokicking"},{"word":"nanovibrational stimulation"}]},"article30":{"pmid":"29661929","title":"Arginase-1 Expression in Myeloid Cells Regulates Staphylococcus aureus Planktonic but Not Biofilm Infection.","date":"2019-03-19","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of device-associated biofilm infections, which represent a serious health care concern based on their chronicity and antibiotic resistance.

Further, triclosan and tobramycin killed persister cells, causing a 100-fold reduction by 8 h and complete eradication by 24 h. Triclosan also enhances tobramycin killing of multiple Burkholderia cenocepacia and Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates grown as biofilms.

An alternative approach based on DNA barcoding and high throughput sequencing (HTS), metabarcoding, has been developed in recent years to identify species at the community level by using a DNA reference library. The suitabilities of morphological and molecular approaches were compared. Diatom assemblages were sampled from seven juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Mayotte Island, France. The structures of the epibiotic diatom assemblages differed between both approaches. This resulted in different clustering of the turtles based on their diatom communities. Metabarcoding allowed better discrimination between turtles based on their epibiotic diatom assemblages and put into evidence the presence of a cryptic diatom diversity.

But, its growth and production are significantly hampered by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) which causes leaf blight disease. Earlier studies have reported the antibacterial ability of FDA-approved niclosamide drug against Xoo. However, the underlying mechanism by which niclosamide blocks the growth of Xoo remained elusive. In the present study, by employing the microbiological, microscopical, molecular, bioinformatics and analytical tools we found that niclosamide can directly inhibit the growth of the Xoo by hampering the biofilm formation and the production of xanthomonadin and exopolysaccharide substances (EPS) required for relentless growth and virulence of Xoo. Interestingly, niclosamide was found to specifically suppress the growth of Xoo without affecting other bacteria like Escherichia coli. Our electron microscopic observations disclosed that niclosamide disrupts the membrane permeability of Xoo and causes the release of intracellular components. Similarly, the molecular docking analysis disclosed the molecular interaction of niclosamide with the biofilm, virulence and quorum sensing related proteins, which was further substantiated by relative gene expression analysis where niclosamide was found to significantly downregulate the expression of these key regulatory genes.

This work is aimed at optimizing a surface biofunctionalization strategy to inhibit the adhesion of S. aureus on solid substrates. The first part of the work deals with the albumin adsorption-desorption process, studied by a factorial design of experiments to explore a wide range of experimental factors (protein concentration, pH, flow rate and adsorption time) and responses (initial adsorption rate, adsorbed amount, desorbed extent) for hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates, with a reduced number of experiments. This approach allows the simultaneous evaluation of the factors affecting the albumin adsorption-desorption process to find a qualitative correlation with the amount of alive S. aureus adhered on albumin biofunctionalized substrates. The results of this work point to a relationship between bacterial adhesion and the degree of albumin relaxation on the solid substrate. In fact, the inhibition of bacterial adhesion on albumin biofunctionalized substrates is due to the surface perturbation on the native structure of the protein. On this base, a biofunctionalization strategy was designed using a solution of thermally treated albumin molecules (higher β-sheet or unordered secondary structure elements) to biofunctionalize solid substrates by dipping. With these albumin biofunctionalized substrates S. aureus adhesion was minimized.","authors":[{"name":"María Laura Martín"},{"name":"Valeria Pfaffen"},{"name":"Laura E Valenti"},{"name":"Carla E Giacomelli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Adsorption-desorption process"},{"word":"Bacterial adhesion"},{"word":"Factorial design of experiments"},{"word":"Partially denatured albumin"},{"word":"Protein coated substrate"},{"word":"Surface protein relaxation"}]},"article74":{"pmid":"29649702","title":"Quantitative characterization and analysis of granule transformations: Role of intermittent gas sparging in a super high-rate anaerobic system.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Knowledge of leveraging biomass characteristics is essential for achieving a microbial community with a desired structure to optimize anaerobic bioreactor performance.

S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are the most frequent pathogens isolated from chronic wounds and increasing resistance to topical antibiotics has become a major issue. Therefore, new treatment options are urgently needed. In recent years, research focused on the development of synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with lower toxicity and improved activity compared to their endogenous counterparts. AMPs appear to be promising therapeutic options for the treatment of SSTIs and wounds as they show a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, low resistance rates and display pivotal immunomodulatory as well as wound healing promoting activities such as induction of cell migration and proliferation and angiogenesis. In this review, we evaluate the potential of AMPs for the treatment of bacterial SSTIs and wounds and provide an overview of the mechanisms of actions of AMPs that contribute to combat skin infections and to improve wound healing. Bacteria growing in biofilms are more resistant to conventional antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts due to limited biofilm penetration and distinct metabolic and physiological functions, and often result in chronification of infections and wounds.

Here we describe the preparation of a novel zwitterionic block copolymer with the potential to prevent or delay the formation of microbial biofilms. The block copolymer comprised a zwitterionic (hydrophilic) section of alternating glutamic acid (negatively charged) and lysine (positively charged) units and a hydrophobic polystyrene section. Cryo-TEM and dynamic-light-scattering (DLS) results showed that, on average, the block copolymer self-assembled into 7-nm-diameter micelles in aqueous solutions (0 to 100 mM NaCl, pH 6). Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and contact angle measurements demonstrated that the block copolymer self-assembled into a brush-like monolayer on polystyrene surfaces. The brush-like monolayer produced from a 100 mg/L block copolymer solution exhibited an average distance, d, of approximately 4-8 nm between each block copolymer molecule (center to center). Once the brush-like monolayer self-assembled, it reduced EPS adsorption onto the polystyrene surface by ∼70% (mass), reduced the rate of bacterial attachment by >80%, and inhibited the development of thick biofilms. QCM-D results revealed that the EPS molecules penetrate between the chains of the brush and adsorb onto the polystyrene surface. Additionally, AFM analyses showed that the brush-like monolayer prevents the adhesion of large (> d) hydrophilic colloids onto the surface via hydration repulsion; however, molecules or colloids small enough to fit between the brush polymers (< d) were able to be adsorbed onto the surface via van der Waals interactions. Overall, we found that the penetration of extracellular organelles, as well as biopolymers through the brush, is critical for the failure of the antifouling coating, and likely could be prevented through tuning of the brush density. Stability and biofilm development testing on multiple surfaces (polypropylene, glass, and stainless steel) support practical applications of this novel block copolymer.","authors":[{"name":"Christopher Ziemba"},{"name":"Maria Khavkin"},{"name":"Dimitris Priftis"},{"name":"Handan Acar"},{"name":"Jun Mao"},{"name":"Maya Benami"},{"name":"Moshe Gottlieb"},{"name":"Matthew Tirrell"},{"name":"Yair Kaufman"},{"name":"Moshe Herzberg"}],"keywords":[]},"article90":{"pmid":"29638210","title":"Stenotrophomonas lactitubi sp. nov. and Stenotrophomonas indicatrix sp. nov., isolated from surfaces with food contact.","date":"2019-12-11","abs":"Five Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, none-spore-forming isolates were obtained from biofilms on different sites of a milking machine in Germany.

Micro-/nanoscale substratum surface features have been shown to disrupt firm adhesion of planktonic microbes to surfaces, thereby interfering with the earliest stage of biofilm formation. However, the role of geometry and size of surface features in microbial retention is not completely understood. In this study, we developed a biophysical model that describes the changes in the total free energy (adhesion energy and stretching energy) of an adherent Candida albicans cell on nanofiber-coated surfaces as a function of the geometry (i.e., diameter) and configuration (i.e., interfiber spacing) of the surface features (i.e., nanofibers). We then introduced a new nondimensional parameter, Π, to represent the ratio of cell rigidity to cell-substratum interfacial energy. We show that the total free energy is a strong function of topographical feature size at higher Π and lower spacing values. To confirm our biophysical model predictions, we performed 24 h dynamic retention assays and quantified cell attachment number density on surfaces coated with highly ordered polystyrene nanofibers. We show that the total free energy of a single adherent cell on a patterned surface is a key determinant of microbial retention on that surface. The cell attachment density trend closely correlates with the predictions based on the adherent single-cell total energy. The nanofiber coating design (1.2 μm diameter, 2 μm spacing) that maximized the total energy of the adherent cell resulted in the lowest microbial retention. We further demonstrate the utility of our biophysical model by showing close correlation between the computed single-cell total free energy and biofilm nucleation on fiber-coated urinary and central venous catheters of different materials. This biophysical model could offer a powerful new paradigm in ab initio design of patterned surfaces for controlled biofilm growth for medical applications and beyond.","authors":[{"name":"Zhou Ye"},{"name":"AhRam Kim"},{"name":"Carolyn Y Mottley"},{"name":"Michael W Ellis"},{"name":"Candace Wall"},{"name":"Alan R Esker"},{"name":"Amrinder S Nain"},{"name":"Bahareh Behkam"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adhesion model"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"microbial adhesion"},{"word":"microbial retention"},{"word":"patterned surfaces"},{"word":"stretching energy"},{"word":"surface topography"}]},"article96":{"pmid":"29637309","title":"Advances in Ureteral Stent Design and Materials.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"There are three technological parameters that play a key role on the performance of an ideal stent.

Despite its economic importance, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity and virulence of A. citrulli. Like other plant-pathogenic bacteria, A. citrulli relies on a type III secretion system (T3SS) for pathogenicity. On the basis of sequence and operon arrangement analyses, A. citrulli was found to have a class II hrp gene cluster similar to those of Xanthomonas and Ralstonia spp. In the class II hrp cluster, hrpG and hrpX play key roles in the regulation of T3SS effectors. However, little is known about the regulation of the T3SS in A. citrulli. This study aimed to investigate the roles of hrpG and hrpX in A. citrulli pathogenicity. We found that hrpG or hrpX deletion mutants of the A. citrulli group II strain Aac5 had reduced pathogenicity on watermelon seedlings, failed to induce a hypersensitive response in tobacco, and elicited higher levels of reactive oxygen species in Nicotiana benthamiana than the wild-type strain. Additionally, we demonstrated that HrpG activates HrpX in A. citrulli. Moreover, transcription and translation of the type 3-secreted effector (T3E) gene Aac5_2166 were suppressed in hrpG and hrpX mutants. Notably, hrpG and hrpX appeared to modulate biofilm formation.

Here we identify proteins enriched in the matrix of P. aeruginosa biofilms. We then focused on a candidate matrix protein, the serine protease inhibitor ecotin (PA2755). This protein is able to inhibit neutrophil elastase, a bactericidal enzyme produced by the host immune system during P. aeruginosa biofilm infections. We show that ecotin binds to the key biofilm matrix exopolysaccharide Psl and that it can inhibit neutrophil elastase when associated with Psl. Finally, we show that ecotin protects both planktonic and biofilm P. aeruginosa cells from neutrophil elastase-mediated killing.

Antimicrobial and antibiofilm capacity seems to be strictly linked to the organic cap surrounding biogenic nanoparticles, although the actual role played by this coating layer in the biocidal action remains still undefined. Nevertheless, evidence has been gained that the progressive loss in protein and carbohydrate content of the organic cap determines a decrease in nanoparticle stability. This leads to an alteration of size and electrical properties of SeNPs along with a gradual attenuation of their antibacterial efficacy. Denaturation of the coating layer was proved even to have a negative effect on the antibiofilm activity of these nanoparticles. The pronounced antimicrobial efficacy of biogenic SeNPs compared to the denatured ones can - in first instance - be associated with their smaller dimensions.

However, it is unclear whether staging and thus the long-term exposure to varying organic carbon type and loading influences the microbial community structure and diversity. In this study, we investigated biofilm structure and diversity in the three-stage MBBR system (S) compared to a single-stage configuration (U) and their relationship with microbial functions. Results from 16S rRNA amplicon libraries revealed a significantly higher microbial richness in the staged MBBR (at 99% sequence similarity) compared to single-stage MBBR. A more even and diverse microbial community was selected in the last stage of S (S3), likely due to exposure to carbon limitation during continuous-flow operation. A core of OTUs was shared in both systems, consisting of Burkholderiales, Xanthomonadales, Flavobacteriales and Sphingobacteriales, while MBBR staging selected for specific taxa (i.e., Candidate division WS6 and Deinococcales). Results from quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that S3 exhibited the lowest abundance of 16S rRNA but the highest abundance of atypical nosZ, suggesting a selection of microbes with more diverse N-metabolism (i.e., incomplete denitrifiers) in the stage exposed to the lowest carbon availability. A positive correlation (p < 0.05) was observed between removal rate constants of several pharmaceuticals with abundance of relevant denitrifying genes, but not with biodiversity.

However, recent microbiome studies indicate that LAB can be endogenous members of other human body sites such as the upper respiratory tract (URT). Interestingly, DNA-based microbiome research suggests an inverse correlation between the presence of LAB and the occurrence of potential pathogens, such as Moraxella catarrhalis, an important URT pathogen linked to otitis media, sinusitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, a direct interaction between these microbes has not been explored in detail. This study investigated the direct antipathogenic effects of Lactobacillus species, including several well-documented probiotic strains, on M. catarrhalis using agar-based assays, time course analysis, biofilm assays and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing. These assays were performed using spent culture supernatans (SCS) at two pHs (4.3 and 7) and D- and/or L-lactic acid at three pHs (2, 4 and 7). In addition, cell line assays for adhesion competition and immunomodulation were used to substantiate the inhibitory effect of lactobacilli against M. catarrhalis. A proportion of Lactobacillus strains, including the model probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, showed a strong and direct activity against M. catarrhalis. Screening of the activity of the SCS after different treatments demonstrated that lactic acid has an important antimicrobial activity against this pathogen - at least in vitro - with mean MIC values for D- and L-lactic acid varying between 0.5 and 27 g/l depending on the pH. Furthermore, L. rhamnosus GG also decreased the adhesion of M. catarrhalis to human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells with more than 50%, and the expression of mucin MUC5AC, pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α at least 1.2 fold.

Interestingly, the TreR transcriptional regulator appeared to be critical for responding to oxidative stress and for mounting a protective stress tolerance response following growth at moderately acidic pH. mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of a treR deletion mutant suggested that in S. mutans, TreR acts as a trehalose-sensing activator of transcription of the tre operon, rather than as a repressor, as described in other species. In addition, deletion of treR caused the downregulation of a number of genes involved in genetic competence and bacteriocin production, supporting the results of a recent study linking trehalose and the S. mutans competence pathways. Finally, deletion of treR compromised the ability of S. mutans to inhibit the growth of the competing species Streptococcus gordonii and Lactococcus lactis Taking the results together, this study solidifies the role of the S. mutans tre operon in trehalose utilization and suggests novel functions for the TreR regulator, including roles in the stress response and competitive fitness.","authors":[{"name":"J L Baker"},{"name":"E L Lindsay"},{"name":"R C Faustoferri"},{"name":"T T To"},{"name":"E L Hendrickson"},{"name":"X He"},{"name":"W Shi"},{"name":"J S McLean"},{"name":"R G Quivey"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"gene regulation"},{"word":"mutacin"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"trehalose"}]},"article123":{"pmid":"29631628","title":"Characterizing oral microbial communities across dentition states and colonization niches.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The present study aimed to identify patterns and processes in acquisition of oral bacteria and to characterize the microbiota of different dentition states and habitats.

In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that nutrient-limited growth is the mechanism by which these floral patterns form. To do this, we use a combination of experiments and mathematical analysis. In mat formation experiments of the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we observe that mats expand radially at a roughly constant speed, and eventually undergo a transition from circular to floral morphology. To determine the extent to which nutrient-limited growth can explain these features, we adopt a previously proposed mathematical model for yeast growth. The model consists of a coupled system of reaction-diffusion equations for the yeast cell density and nutrient concentration, with a non-linear, degenerate diffusion term for cell spread. Using geometric singular perturbation theory and numerics, we show that the model admits travelling wave solutions in one dimension, which enables us to infer the diffusion ratio from experimental data. We then use a linear stability analysis to show that two-dimensional planar travelling wave solutions for feasible experimental parameters are linearly unstable to non-planar perturbations. This provides a potential mechanism by which petals can form, and allows us to predict the characteristic petal width. There is good agreement between these predictions, numerical solutions to the model, and experimental data. We therefore conclude that the non-linear cell diffusion mechanism provides a possible explanation for pattern formation in yeast mat biofilms, without the need to invoke other mechanisms such as flow of extracellular fluid, cell adhesion, or changes to cellular shape or behaviour.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander Tam"},{"name":"J Edward F Green"},{"name":"Sanjeeva Balasuriya"},{"name":"Ee Lin Tek"},{"name":"Jennifer M Gardner"},{"name":"Joanna F Sundstrom"},{"name":"Vladimir Jiranek"},{"name":"Benjamin J Binder"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Angular pair-correlation function"},{"word":"Geometric singular perturbation theory"},{"word":"Linear stability analysis"},{"word":"Mat formation experiment"},{"word":"Reaction–diffusion"},{"word":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae"},{"word":"Travelling wave solution"}]},"article127":{"pmid":"29630806","title":"Penetration and bactericidal efficacy of two oral care products in an oral biofilm model.","date":"2019-04-22","abs":"To investigate the immediate penetration and bactericidal effect of two oral care products marketed in China on an intact natural plaque biofilm model at different time points.","authors":[{"name":"Junbo Xiang"},{"name":"Hongmei Li"},{"name":"Boqun Pan"},{"name":"Jinlan Chang"},{"name":"Yanyan He"},{"name":"Tao He"},{"name":"Ross Strand"},{"name":"Yunming Shi"},{"name":"Weili Dong"}],"keywords":[]},"article128":{"pmid":"29630805","title":"Effect of surface characteristics of soft liners and tissue conditioners and saliva on the adhesion and biofilm formation.","date":"2019-04-22","abs":"To investigate the influence of surface characteristics and saliva on the adhesion and biofilm formation of Candida glabrata and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to soft liners and tissue conditioners.","authors":[{"name":"Camila Cristina De Foggi"},{"name":"Marina Siqueira Bambini Ayres"},{"name":"Guilherme Paladini Feltrin"},{"name":"Janaina Habib Jorge"},{"name":"Ana Lucia Machado"}],"keywords":[]},"article129":{"pmid":"29630788","title":"Effect of pulsed ultrasound toothbrush on Streptococcus mutans biofilm removal.","date":"2019-04-08","abs":"To evaluate the effect of pulsed ultrasound toothbrush on the removal of biofilm formed by Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans).","authors":[{"name":"Shinya Horiuchi"},{"name":"Hiromichi Yumoto"},{"name":"Tomoko Kimura"},{"name":"Minami Sato"},{"name":"Silvia Naomi Mitsui"},{"name":"Masahiro Hiasa"},{"name":"Eiji Nishikawa"},{"name":"Tarek El-Bialy"},{"name":"Eiji Tanaka"}],"keywords":[]},"article130":{"pmid":"29630066","title":"The Microbe Directory: An annotated, searchable inventory of microbes' characteristics.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The Microbe Directory is a collective research effort to profile and annotate more than 7,500 unique microbial species from the MetaPhlAn2 database that includes bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and protozoa.

In this study, we showed that in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the ΔclpYQ deletion mutant formed early and robust biofilms, while swarming motility was severely impaired. Colonies of the ΔclpYQ mutant were also much less mucoid on agar plates, indicating the loss of the production of secreted γ-poly-dl-glutamic acid (γ-PGA). Global proteomic analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) confirmed that a number of proteins involved in motility, chemotaxis and the production of γ-PGA were less abundant in the ΔclpYQ mutant. The results from both iTRAQ and Western immunoblotting showed that levels of the biofilm master repressor SinR were modestly reduced in the ΔclpYQ mutant, but probably significantly enough to alter biofilm regulation due to the ultrasensitivity of the expression of biofilm genes to SinR protein levels. Western immunoblotting also showed that the abundance of CodY, whose gene is clustered with clpYQ in the same operon, was not impacted on by ΔclpYQ. Lastly, our results suggested that, unlike in Escherichia coli, ClpYQ does not play an essential role in heat-shock response in both B. subtilis and Bacillus cereus. In conclusion, we propose that the ClpYQ protease is primarily involved in multicellular development in B. subtilis.","authors":[{"name":"Yiyang Yu"},{"name":"Fang Yan"},{"name":"Yinghao He"},{"name":"Yuxuan Qin"},{"name":"Yun Chen"},{"name":"Yunrong Chai"},{"name":"Jian-Hua Guo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"ClpYQ"},{"word":"HslVU"},{"word":"ITRAQ"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"motility"}]},"article133":{"pmid":"29629858","title":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa PumA acts on an endogenous phenazine to promote self-resistance.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The activities of critical metabolic and regulatory proteins can be altered by exposure to natural or synthetic redox-cycling compounds. Many bacteria, therefore, possess mechanisms to transport or transform these small molecules. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 synthesizes phenazines, redox-active antibiotics that are toxic to other organisms but have beneficial effects for their producer. Phenazines activate the redox-sensing transcription factor SoxR and thereby induce the transcription of a small regulon, including the operon mexGHI-opmD, which encodes an efflux pump that transports phenazines, and PA14_35160 (pumA), which encodes a putative monooxygenase. Here, we provide evidence that PumA contributes to phenazine resistance and normal biofilm development, particularly during exposure to or production of strongly oxidizing N-methylated phenazines. We show that phenazine resistance depends on the presence of residues that are conserved in the active sites of other putative and characterized monooxygenases found in the antibiotic producer Streptomyces coelicolor. We also show that during biofilm growth, PumA is required for the conversion of phenazine methosulfate to unique phenazine metabolites. Finally, we compare ∆mexGHI-opmD and ∆pumA strains in assays for colony biofilm morphogenesis and SoxR activation, and find that these deletions have opposing phenotypic effects. Our results suggest that, while MexGHI-OpmD-mediated efflux has the effect of making the cellular phenazine pool more reducing, PumA acts on cellular phenazines to make the pool more oxidizing. We present a model in which these two SoxR targets function simultaneously to control the biological activity of the P. aeruginosa phenazine pool.","authors":[{"name":"Abigail J Sporer"},{"name":"Christopher Beierschmitt"},{"name":"Anastasia Bendebury"},{"name":"Katherine E Zink"},{"name":"Alexa Price-Whelan"},{"name":"Marisa C Buzzeo"},{"name":"Laura M Sanchez"},{"name":"Lars E P Dietrich"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm physiology"},{"word":"monooxygenase"},{"word":"phenazines"},{"word":"self-resistance"}]},"article134":{"pmid":"29628998","title":"Role of Streptococcus mutans surface proteins for biofilm formation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Streptococcus mutans has been implicated as a primary causative agent of dental caries in humans.

Bacteria utilize quorum-sensing systems to modulate environmental stress responses. A major mechanism of response to signals is represented by the so called two-component signal transduction system, which enables bacteria to regulate their gene expression and coordinate activities in response to environmental stress. As for S. mutans, a signal peptide-mediated quorum-sensing system encoded by comCDE has been found to be a regulatory system that responds to cell density and certain environmental stresses by excreting a peptide signal molecule termed CSP (competence-stimulating peptide). One of its principal virulence factors is production of bacteriocins (peptide antibiotics) referred to as mutacins.

We studied bacterial antibiotic resistance transition and the role of biofilms in a drinking water distribution system (DWDS). We tracked several different antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) with resistance to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and norfloxacin for one year in a DWDS. The results indicated that the amount of ARB increased in tap water, presumably due to biofilm detachment. The effect of biofilm detachment on the transmission of antibiotic resistance from biofilms to tap water was explored by using a bacterial annular reactor. The percentage of ARB of inlet water, outlet water, and biofilms ranged from 0.26% to 9.85%, 1.08%-16.29%, and 0.52%-29.97%, respectively in a chlorinated system, and from 0.23% to 9.89%, 0.84%-16.84%, and 0.35%-17.77%, respectively, in a chloraminated system. The relative abundances of antibiotic resistance Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas, and Bradyrhizobium were higher in outlet water than in inlet water, as determined by high throughout sequencing. The amount of ARB percentage varied with the concentration of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells (r = 0.21, n = 160, P < 0.05) in biofilm, suggesting a higher antibiotic resistance mutation rate in VBNC cells.

However, the dairy cow has changed significantly over the past decades, as have the types of diets fed and the production systems used. The plethora of literature published in recent years provides new insights on eating and ruminating activity of dairy cows. Lactating dairy cows spend about 4.5 h/d eating (range: 2.4-8.5 h/d) and 7 h/d ruminating (range: 2.5-10.5 h/d), with a maximum total chewing time of 16 h/d. Chewing time is affected by many factors, most importantly whether access to feed is restricted, intake of neutral detergent fiber from forages, and mean particle size of the diet. Feed restriction and long particles (≥19 mm) have a greater effect on eating time, whereas intake of forage neutral detergent fiber and medium particles (4-19 mm) affects rumination time. It is well entrenched in the literature that promoting chewing increases salivary secretion of dairy cows, which helps reduce the risk of acidosis. However, the net effect of a change in chewing time on rumen buffing is likely rather small; therefore, acidosis prevention strategies need to be broad. Damage to plant tissues during mastication creates sites that provide access to fungi, adhesion of bacteria, and formation of biofilms that progressively degrade carbohydrates. Rumination and eating are the main ways in which feed is reduced in particle size. Contractions of the rumen increase during eating and ruminating activity and help move small particles to the escapable pool and into the omasum. Use of recently developed low-cost sensors that monitor chewing activity of dairy cows in commercial facilities can provide information that is helpful in management decisions, especially when combined with other criteria. Although accuracy and precision can be somewhat variable depending on sensor and conditions of use, relative changes in cow behavior, such as a marked decrease in rumination time of a cow or sustained low rumination time compared with a contemporary group of cows, can be used to help detect estrus, parturition, and some illnesses.

In vibrios, LuxR and AphA are two master QS regulators (MQSRs) controlling gene expression in response to high or low cell density. Other regulators involved in the regulation of these two MQSRs and QS pathways remain to be determined. Here, we performed bacterial one-hybrid (B1H)-assay-based screens of transcriptional factors (TFs) to identify TFs that can directly regulate the expression of luxR and aphA from a library of 285 TFs encoded by the fish pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus A total of 7 TFs were identified to bind to the promoters of both luxR and aphA Among these TFs, the novel LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) VqsA could activate LuxR and repress AphA transcription. Meanwhile, LuxR and AphA exerted feedback inhibition and activation of vqsA expression, respectively, indicating that VqsA coordinates QS and is also regulated by QS. In addition, VqsA inhibited its own expression by directly binding to its own promoter region. The VqsA-binding sites in the promoter regions of luxR and aphA as well as the binding sites of LuxR, AphA, and VqsA in the vqsA gene were uncovered by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and DNase I footprinting analysis.

This cell density-dependent signaling mechanism enables single cells to behave as multicellular organisms and regulates different microbial behaviors like morphogenesis, pathogenesis, competence, biofilm formation, bioluminescence, etc guided by environmental cues.

Anaerobic digestion is a well-established technology for the conversion of wastewater and solid feedstocks to energy with the additional potential for production of process intermediates of high market values (e.g., carboxylates). In recent years, first-generation biofuels typically derived from food crops have been widely utilized as a renewable source of energy. The environmental and socioeconomic limitations of such strategy, however, have led to the development of second-generation biofuels utilizing, amongst other feedstocks, lignocellulosic biomass. In this context, the anaerobic digestion of perennial grass holds great promise for the conversion of sustainable renewable feedstock to energy and other process intermediates. The advancement of this technology however, and its implementation for industrial applications, relies on a greater understanding of the microbiome underpinning the process. To this end, microbial communities recovered from replicated anaerobic bioreactors digesting grass were analyzed. The bioreactors leachates were not buffered and acidic pH (between 5.5 and 6.3) prevailed at the time of sampling as a result of microbial activities. Community composition and transcriptionally active taxa were examined using 16S rRNA sequencing and microbial functions were investigated using metaproteomics. Bioreactor fraction, i.e., grass or leachate, was found to be the main discriminator of community analysis across the three molecular level of investigation (DNA, RNA, and proteins). Six taxa, namely Bacteroidia, Betaproteobacteria, Clostridia, Gammaproteobacteria, Methanomicrobia, and Negativicutes accounted for the large majority of the three datasets. The initial stages of grass hydrolysis were carried out by Bacteroidia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Negativicutes in the grass biofilms, in addition to Clostridia in the bioreactor leachates. Numerous glycolytic enzymes and carbohydrate transporters were detected throughout the bioreactors in addition to proteins involved in butanol and lactate production. Finally, evidence of the prevalence of stressful conditions within the bioreactors and particularly impacting Clostridia was observed in the metaproteomes. Taken together, this study highlights the functional importance of Clostridia during the anaerobic digestion of grass and thus research avenues allowing members of this taxon to thrive should be explored.","authors":[{"name":"Aoife Joyce"},{"name":"Umer Z Ijaz"},{"name":"Corine Nzeteu"},{"name":"Aoife Vaughan"},{"name":"Sally L Shirran"},{"name":"Catherine H Botting"},{"name":"Christopher Quince"},{"name":"Vincent O'Flaherty"},{"name":"Florence Abram"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA profiling"},{"word":"anaerobic digestion"},{"word":"biomolecule co-extraction"},{"word":"cellulosic substrate"},{"word":"metaproteomics"}]},"article174":{"pmid":"29619021","title":"Validation of a Hypothesis: Colonization of Black Smokers by Hyperthermophilic Microorganisms.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Newly erupted black smokers (hydrothermal vent chimneys) are sterile during their formation, but house hyperthermophilic microorganisms in substantial amounts in later stages.

While switching life-styles, bacteria must coordinate the progression of their cell cycle with their physiological status. Our current understanding of the regulatory pathways controlling the decision-making processes and triggering developmental switches highlights a key role of protein phosphorylation. The regulatory mechanisms that integrate the bacterial chromosome replication status with sporulation involve checkpoint proteins that target the replication initiator DnaA or the kinase phosphorelay controlling the master regulator Spo0A. B. subtilis YabA is known to interact with DnaA to prevent over-initiation of replication during vegetative growth. Here, we report that YabA is phosphorylated by YabT, a Ser/Thr kinase expressed during sporulation and biofilm formation. The phosphorylation of YabA has no effect on replication initiation control but hyper-phosphorylation of YabA leads to an increase in sporulation efficiency and a strong inhibition of biofilm formation. We also provide evidence that YabA phosphorylation affects the level of Spo0A-P in cells. These results indicate that YabA is a multifunctional protein with a dual role in regulating replication initiation and life-style switching, thereby providing a potential mechanism for cross-talk and coordination of cellular processes during adaptation to environmental change.","authors":[{"name":"Tránsito García García"},{"name":"Magali Ventroux"},{"name":"Abderahmane Derouiche"},{"name":"Vladimir Bidnenko"},{"name":"Sara Correia Santos"},{"name":"Céline Henry"},{"name":"Ivan Mijakovic"},{"name":"Marie-Françoise Noirot-Gros"},{"name":"Sandrine Poncet"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"Ser/Thr kinase"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"replication initiation control"},{"word":"sporulation"}]},"article176":{"pmid":"29618576","title":"Options and Limitations in Clinical Investigation of Bacterial Biofilms.","date":"2019-04-04","abs":"Bacteria can form single- and multispecies biofilms exhibiting diverse features based upon the microbial composition of their community and microenvironment.

Bacterial adaptation to the host is often evident phenotypically, with increased extracellular polysaccharide production characteristic of some biofilm-associated organisms.

However, a shortcut nitrification&ndash;denitrification process presents distinctive advantages, as it saves oxygen, requires less organic matter, and requires less time for denitrification compared to conventional nitrogen removal methods. Thus, if the shortcut nitrification&ndash;denitrification process could be applied to the CRI system properly, a simpler, more economic, and efficient nitrogen removal method will be obtained. However, as its reaction process shows that the first and the most important step of achieving shortcut nitrification&ndash;denitrification is to achieve shortcut nitrification, in this study we explored the feasibility to achieve shortcut nitrification, which produces nitrite as the dominant nitrogen species in effluent, by the addition of potassium chlorate (KClO₃) to the influent. In an experimental CRI test system, the effects on nitrogen removal, nitrate inhibition, and nitrite accumulation were studied, and the advantages of achieving a shortcut nitrification&ndash;denitrification process were also analysed. The results showed that shortcut nitrification was successfully achieved and maintained in a CRI system by adding 5 mM KClO₃ to the influent at a constant pH of 8.4. Under these conditions, the nitrite accumulation percentage was increased, while a lower concentration of 3 mM KClO₃ had no obvious effect. The addition of 5mM KClO₃ in influent presumably inhibited the activity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), but inhibition of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) was so strong that it resulted in a maximum nitrite accumulation percentage of up to over 80%. As a result, nitrite became the dominant nitrogen product in the effluent.

First, biofilms may exhibit properties of immunological silence, preventing immune activation. Second, biofilms may produce immune-deviating factors, converting effective immunity into ineffective immunity. Third, biofilms may resist host immunity, which would otherwise be effective. Using a murine subcutaneous biofilm model, we found that mice infected with biofilms developed sterilizing immunity effective when challenged with yeast form Candida.

Anti-Bd bacteria from amphibian skin have been cultured, and skin bacterial communities have been described through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Here, we present a shotgun metagenomic analysis of skin bacterial communities from a Neotropical frog, Craugastor fitzingeri. We sequenced the metagenome of six frogs from two different sites in Panamá: three frogs from Soberanía (Sob), a Bd-endemic site, and three frogs from Serranía del Sapo (Sapo), a Bd-naïve site. We described the taxonomic composition of skin microbiomes and found that Pseudomonas was a major component of these communities. We also identified that Sob communities were enriched in Actinobacteria while Sapo communities were enriched in Gammaproteobacteria. We described gene abundances within the main functional classes and found genes enriched either in Sapo or Sob. We then focused our study on five functional classes of genes: biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, membrane transport, cellular communication and antimicrobial drug resistance. These gene classes are potentially involved in bacterial communication, bacterial-host and bacterial-pathogen interactions among other functions. We found that C. fitzingeri metagenomes have a wide array of genes that code for secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and bacterial toxins, which may be involved in bacterial communication, but could also have a defensive role against pathogens. Several genes involved in bacterial communication and bacterial-host interactions, such as biofilm formation and bacterial secretion systems were found. We identified specific genes and pathways enriched at the different sites and determined that gene co-occurrence networks differed between sites. Our results suggest that skin microbiomes are composed of distinct bacterial taxa with a wide range of metabolic capabilities involved in bacterial defense and communication. Differences in taxonomic composition and pathway enrichments suggest that skin microbiomes from different sites have unique functional properties. This study strongly supports the need for shotgun metagenomic analyses to describe the functional capacities of skin microbiomes and to tease apart their role in host defense against pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Eria A Rebollar"},{"name":"Ana Gutiérrez-Preciado"},{"name":"Cecilia Noecker"},{"name":"Alexander Eng"},{"name":"Myra C Hughey"},{"name":"Daniel Medina"},{"name":"Jenifer B Walke"},{"name":"Elhanan Borenstein"},{"name":"Roderick V Jensen"},{"name":"Lisa K Belden"},{"name":"Reid N Harris"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis"},{"word":"amphibians"},{"word":"host-bacteria interactions"},{"word":"shotgun metagenomics"},{"word":"skin microbiome"}]},"article191":{"pmid":"29615732","title":"Drug resistance of oral bacteria to new antibacterial dental monomer dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate.","date":"2019-10-07","abs":"Only two reports exist on drug-resistance of quaternary ammonium monomers against oral bacteria; both studies tested planktonic bacteria for 10 passages, and neither study tested biofilms or resins.

Prior studies with Candida albicans biofilms show that an extracellular matrix mannan-glucan complex (MGCx) contributes to antifungal sequestration, leading to drug resistance. Here we implement biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic approaches to explore a similar mechanism of resistance for the three most common clinically encountered non-albicansCandida species (NAC). Our findings reveal that each Candida species biofilm synthesizes a mannan-glucan complex and that the antifungal-protective function of this complex is conserved. Structural similarities extended primarily to the polysaccharide backbone (α-1,6-mannan and β-1,6-glucan). Surprisingly, biochemical analysis uncovered stark differences in the branching side chains of the MGCx among the species. Consistent with the structural analysis, similarities in the genetic control of MGCx production for each Candida species also appeared limited to the synthesis of the polysaccharide backbone. Each species appears to employ a unique subset of modification enzymes for MGCx synthesis, likely accounting for the observed side chain diversity. Our results argue for the conservation of matrix function among Candida spp. While biogenesis is preserved at the level of the mannan-glucan complex backbone, divergence emerges for construction of branching side chains.

Its resistance to numerous antibiotics and threat to immunocompromised patients necessitate finding new therapies to combat these infections. Previous successes in the laboratory, as well as the conservation of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) among the members of the ST258 clone, suggest that monoclonal antibody (MAb) therapy targeting the outer polysaccharide capsule of K. pneumoniae could serve as a valuable treatment alternative for afflicted patients. Here, we isolated several IgG antibodies from mice inoculated with a mixture of CR K. pneumoniae CPS conjugated to anthrax protective antigen. Two of these MAbs, 17H12 and 8F12, bind whole and oligosaccharide epitopes of the CPS of clade 2 ST258 CR K. pneumoniae, which is responsible for the most virulent CR K. pneumoniae infections in the United States. These antibodies were shown to agglutinate all clade 2 strains and were also shown to promote extracellular processes killing these bacteria, including biofilm inhibition, complement deposition, and deployment of neutrophil extracellular traps. Additionally, they promoted opsonophagocytosis and intracellular killing of CR K. pneumoniae by human-derived neutrophils and cultured murine macrophages. Finally, when mice were intratracheally infected with preopsonized clade 2 CR K. pneumoniae, these MAbs reduced bacterial dissemination to organs. Our data suggest that broadly reactive anticapsular antibodies and vaccines against clade 2 ST258 CR K. pneumoniae are possible. Such MAbs and vaccines would benefit those susceptible populations at risk of infection with this group of multidrug-resistant bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth Diago-Navarro"},{"name":"Michael P Motley"},{"name":"Gonzalo Ruiz-Peréz"},{"name":"Winnie Yu"},{"name":"Julianne Austin"},{"name":"Bruna M S Seco"},{"name":"Guozhi Xiao"},{"name":"Aniska Chikhalya"},{"name":"Peter H Seeberger"},{"name":"Bettina C Fries"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"adjuvant therapy"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"carbapenem resistance"},{"word":"infection protection"},{"word":"monoclonal antibodies"}]},"article194":{"pmid":"29615244","title":"From the [Pasteurella] pneumotropica complex to Rodentibacter spp.: an update on [Pasteurella] pneumotropica.","date":"2018-11-20","abs":"The species [Pasteurella] pneumotropica has been reclassified into the new genus Rodentibacter, within the family Pasteurellaceae.

The organisms are obligate commensals of the mucous membranes and members of Rodentibacter are not able to persist for long in the environment. Members of Rodentibacter spp. are responsible for the most prevalent bacterial infections in laboratory mice and rats, but are also common in rodents outside laboratory settings. Some Rodentibacter spp. produce mainly localised disease in connection with favouring factors and seldomly act as primary pathogens in healthy immunocompetent animals. The subclinical infection with Rodentibacter spp. can affect the results of certain types of research using contaminated animals thus placing them on a list of microbes which are often not tolerated in experimental rodent facilities. The presences of RTX toxins, YadA-like proteins and a capsule with possible role in the pathogenesis have been described.

However, because ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and AMP by metabolic processes, by heat treatment, or under acidic or alkaline conditions, total adenylate (ATP+ADP+AMP [A3]) could be a more reliable sanitation indicator of food residues that may cause biofilm formation and allergen contamination. Therefore, a novel hygiene monitoring system to measure A3 was developed based on the luciferin-luciferase assay with the combination of two enzymes, pyruvate kinase and pyruvate phosphate dikinase, that can convert ADP into ATP and recycle AMP into ATP, respectively. The newly developed A3 assay system afforded stable bioluminescence signals and equivalent linear calibration curves between relative light units (RLU) and the amounts of ATP, ADP, and AMP, respectively. To verify the significance of the A3 method, the ratios of ATP, ADP, and AMP in various food samples were determined; large amounts of ADP and AMP were found in a variety of foods, such as meat, seafood, dairy, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and fermented foods. Sanitation monitoring of stainless steel exposed to raw meat was also examined, and the A3 method achieved a 200-RLU level, the typical benchmark value, after complete washing with detergent and rinsing. In contrast, a conventional ATP method showed less than 200 RLU after only a light cold and hot water rinse. In conclusion, the A3 assay appeared to be suitable for detection of adenylates from food residues that are not detected by the conventional ATP assay.","authors":[{"name":"Mikio Bakke"},{"name":"Shigeya Suzuki"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ATP+ADP+AMP"},{"word":"Food residue detection"},{"word":"Hygiene monitoring"},{"word":"Rapid detection"}]},"article202":{"pmid":"29611650","title":"Comparison of biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains isolated from sheep milk using three diagnostic methods.","date":"2019-08-02","abs":"In this study we investigated 24 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 33 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from milk of sheep with clinical mastitis, for their ability to form biofilms.

One of the drawbacks of MBRs, however, is the formation of biofilm on the surface of membrane modules. The occurrence of biofilms leads to biofouling, which eventually compromises water quality and damages the membranes. To prevent this, it is vital to understand the mechanism of biofilm formation on membrane surfaces. In this pilot-scale study, a novel reciprocation membrane bioreactor was operated for a period of 8 months and fed with domestic wastewater from an aerobic tank of a local WWTP. Water quality parameters were monitored and the microbial composition of the attached biofilm and suspended aggregates was evaluated in this reciprocating MBR configuration. The abundance of nitrifiers and composition of microbial communities from biofilm and suspended solids samples were investigated using qPCR and high throughput 16S amplicon sequencing. Removal efficiencies of 29%, 16%, and 15% of chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus and total nitrogen from the influent were observed after the MBR process with average effluent concentrations of 16 mg/L, 4.6 mg/L, and 5.8 mg/L respectively.

These bacteria frequently grow within a biofilm matrix, rendering therapy with conventional antibiotics inefficient; a fact that emphasizes the need for new treatment strategies. Antimicrobial peptidomimetics constitute potential alternatives to traditional antimicrobial agents. However, their application remains limited due to the lack of efficient delivery to their target site in vivo and the risk of high systemic toxicity. Nanogels composed of cross-linked networks of amphiphilic polymers with a therapeutic drug molecule embedded constitute attractive drug delivery systems, as they have been shown to display unique properties such as biocompatibility and biodegrability, as well as confer improved drug stability and reduced drug-mediated cytotoxicity. Here, we report on the first formulation of biopolymer nanogels incorporating a potent antibacterial peptidomimetic. A lysine-based α-peptide/β-peptoid hybrid with potent activity against P. aeruginosa was designed and formulated into a nanogel together with octenyl succinic anhydride-modified hyaluronic acid in order to improve its cell selectivity. Twelve nanogel formulations were prepared by using a design of experiments setup in order to identify the parameters yielding the highest drug loading and the smallest particle size. Encapsulation of the peptidomimetic into nanogels significantly decreased the cytotoxicity of the peptidomimetic to eukaryotes.

In this way, bacteria secrete and sense small mediating molecules, called autoinducers (AI), which concentration increases in the environment proportionally to bacterial cell number. QS induces major physiological and phenotypic changes such as virulence induction and biofilm formation. Biofilm represents a physical barrier which shelters bacteria poorly sensitive to antimicrobial treatments and favors the apparition of resistance mechanisms. Disturbing QS is referred to as quorum quenching (QQ). This strategy is used by microorganisms themselves to prevent the development of specific group behaviors. Two strategies are mainly employed: the use of quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) and of quorum quenching enzymes (QQE) that degrades AI. Many studies have been dedicated to identifying QSI (natural or synthetic) as well as QQE and demonstrating their anti-virulence and anti-biofilm effects on numerous bacterial species. Synergistic effects between QQ and traditional treatments such as antibiotherapy or with reemerging phage therapy have been put forward. The efficiency of numerous QSI and QQE was thereby demonstrated either with in vitro or in vivo animal models leading to the development of medical devices containing QSI and QQE to improve already existing treatments.","authors":[{"name":"S Mion"},{"name":"B Rémy"},{"name":"L Plener"},{"name":"E Chabrière"},{"name":"D Daudé"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotics"},{"word":"Antibiotiques"},{"word":"Bacterial virulence"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Phagotherapy"},{"word":"Phagothérapie"},{"word":"Quorum Quenching"},{"word":"Quorum Sensing"},{"word":"Quorum quenching"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"Virulence bactérienne"}]},"article240":{"pmid":"31829990","title":"Comparison of biofilm formation and efflux pumps in ESBL and carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a range of diseases.

Acute infections, such as skin infections, are often self-limiting. However, chronic infections, such as implant infections, can be difficult to clear and may require surgical intervention. The host immune response may contribute to the different outcomes often associated with these two disease types. We used proteomic arrays and two murine models for an initial, descriptive characterization of the contribution of the host immune response to outcomes of acute versus chronic S. aureus disease. We compared the immune responses between a model of self-limiting skin and soft tissue infection caused by the planktonic form of S. aureus versus a model of surgical mesh implant infection, which we show to be caused by a bacterial biofilm. The significantly altered host cytokines and chemokines were largely different in the two models, with responses diminished by 21 days post-implantation in surgical mesh infection. Because bacterial levels remained constant during the 21 days that the surgical mesh infection was followed, those cytokines that are significantly increased during chronic infection are not likely effective in eradicating biofilm. Comparison of the levels of cytokines and chemokines in acute versus chronic S. aureus infection can provide a starting point for evaluation of the role of specific immune factors that are present in one disease manifestation but not the other.","authors":[{"name":"Rebecca A Brady"},{"name":"Christopher P Mocca"},{"name":"Roger D Plaut"},{"name":"Kazuyo Takeda"},{"name":"Drusilla L Burns"}],"keywords":[]},"article244":{"pmid":"29595151","title":"Nitrogen removal via a single-stage PN-Anammox process in a novel combined biofilm reactor.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This study developed a partial nitrification (PN) and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (Anammox) process for treating high-ammonia wastewater using an innovative biofilm system in which ammonia oxidizing bacteria grew on fluidized Kaldnes (K1) carriers and Anammox bacteria grew on fixed acryl resin carriers.

GBS is an opportunistic commensal constituting a part of the intestinal and vaginal physiologic flora and maternal colonization is the principal route of GBS transmission. GBS is a pathobiont that converts from the asymptomatic mucosal carriage state to a major bacterial pathogen causing severe invasive infections. At present, as many as 10 serotypes (Ia, Ib, and II-IX) are recognized. The aim of the current review is to shed new light on the latest epidemiological data and clonal distribution of GBS in addition to discussing the most important colonization determinants at a molecular level. The distribution and predominance of certain serotypes is susceptible to variations and can change over time. With the availability of multilocus sequence typing scheme (MLST) data, it became clear that GBS strains of certain clonal complexes possess a higher potential to cause invasive disease, while other harbor mainly colonizing strains. Colonization and persistence in different host niches is dependent on the adherence capacity of GBS to host cells and tissues. Bacterial biofilms represent well-known virulence factors with a vital role in persistence and chronic infections. In addition, GBS colonization, persistence, translocation, and invasion of host barriers are largely dependent on their adherence abilities to host cells and extracellular matrix proteins (ECM). Major adhesins mediating GBS interaction with host cells include the fibrinogen-binding proteins (Fbs), the laminin-binding protein (Lmb), the group B streptococcal C5a peptidase (ScpB), the streptococcal fibronectin binding protein A (SfbA), the GBS immunogenic bacterial adhesin (BibA), and the hypervirulent adhesin (HvgA). These adhesins facilitate persistent and intimate contacts between the bacterial cell and the host, while global virulence regulators play a major role in the transition to invasive infections. This review combines for first time epidemiological data with data on adherence and colonization for GBS. Investigating the epidemiology along with understanding the determinants of mucosal colonization and the development of invasive disease at a molecular level is therefore important for the development of strategies to prevent invasive GBS disease worldwide.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah Shabayek"},{"name":"Barbara Spellerberg"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus agalactiae"},{"word":"colonization"},{"word":"epidemiology"},{"word":"molecular characteristics"},{"word":"serotype"}]},"article254":{"pmid":"29593666","title":"Factors Involved in the Persistence of a Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 Strain in Bovine Feces and Gastro-Intestinal Content.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Healthy cattle are the primary reservoir for O157:H7 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli responsible for human food-borne infections. Because farm environment acts as a source of cattle contamination, it is important to better understand the factors controlling the persistence of E. coli O157:H7 outside the bovine gut. The E. coli O157:H7 strain MC2, identified as a persistent strain in French farms, possessed the characteristics required to cause human infections and genetic markers associated with clinical O157:H7 isolates. Therefore, the capacity of E. coli MC2 to survive during its transit through the bovine gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) and to respond to stresses potentially encountered in extra-intestinal environments was analyzed. E. coli MC2 survived in rumen fluids, grew in the content of posterior digestive compartments and survived in bovine feces at 15°C predicting a successful transit of the bacteria along the bovine GIT and its persistence outside the bovine intestine. E. coli MC2 possessed the genetic information encoding 14 adherence systems including adhesins with properties related to colonization of the bovine intestine (F9 fimbriae, EhaA and EspP autotransporters, HCP pilus, FdeC adhesin) reflecting the capacity of the bacteria to colonize different segments of the bovine GIT. E. coli MC2 was also a strong biofilm producer when incubated in fecal samples at low temperature and had a greater ability to form biofilms than the bovine commensal E. coli strain BG1. Furthermore, in contrast to BG1, E. coli MC2 responded to temperature stresses by inducing the genes cspA and htrA during its survival in bovine feces at 15°C. E. coli MC2 also activated genes that are part of the GhoT/GhoS, HicA/HicB and EcnB/EcnA toxin/antitoxin systems involved in the response of E. coli to nutrient starvation and chemical stresses. In summary, the large number of colonization factors known to bind to intestinal epithelium and to biotic or abiotic surfaces, the capacity to produce biofilms and to activate stress fitness genes in bovine feces could explain the persistence of E. coli MC2 in the farm environment.","authors":[{"name":"Audrey Segura"},{"name":"Pauline Auffret"},{"name":"Delphine Bibbal"},{"name":"Marine Bertoni"},{"name":"Alexandra Durand"},{"name":"Grégory Jubelin"},{"name":"Monique Kérourédan"},{"name":"Hubert Brugère"},{"name":"Yolande Bertin"},{"name":"Evelyne Forano"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EHEC"},{"word":"Escherichia coli"},{"word":"O157:H7"},{"word":"STEC"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"stress response"}]},"article255":{"pmid":"29593662","title":"Petrophilic, Fe(III) Reducing Exoelectrogen Citrobacter sp.

Three samples of C. albicans were used in this study: a clinical sample from a patient with HIV (39S), a clinical sample from a patient with denture stomatitis lesion (Ca30), and a standard strain ATCC 18804. The quantification of gene expression was related to the production of those genes in the samples referred above using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay in real time. The photosensitizer methylene blue at 300 uM and erythrosine at 400 uM, sensitized with low-power laser (visible red, 660 nm) and green LED (532 nm), respectively, were used for PDI. Four groups of each sample and PDI protocol were evaluated: (a) P+L+: sensitization with the photosensitizer and irradiation with light, (b) P+L-: only treatment with the photosensitizer, (c) P-L+: only irradiation with light, and (d) P-L-: without sensitization with the dye and absence of light. The results were analyzed by t test, with a significance level of 5%. The photodynamic inactivation was able to reduce the expression of all genes for both treatments, laser and LED. The fold-decrease for the genes ALS3, HWP1, BCR1, TEC1, CPH1, and EFG1 were 0.73, 0.39, 0.77, 0.71, 0.67, and 0.60 for laser, respectively, and 0.66, 0.61, .050, 0.43, 0.54, and 0.66 for LED, respectively.

Bacterial adhesion was assessed in the presence of saliva under static and dynamic conditions to approximate both sub- and supragingival conditions in the oral cavity as the gingival seal will be affected by implantation. The ultimate goal was to develop a surface that will reduce biofilm formation but still support osseointegration in vivo. To this end nanotubular or nanopitted surfaces were created on electropolished titanium via electrochemical anodization procedures. Sandblasted/acid etched surfaces (SBAE) were used as a microrough reference. Bacterial adhesion was studied using saliva-precoated samples with S. sanguinis as a typical early colonizer of the oral cavity; osteogenic differentiation was assessed with human bone marrow stromal cells. While bacterial adhesion was reduced on all microsmooth surfaces to an average of 17% surface coverage compared to 61% on SBAE under static conditions, under dynamic conditions the nanopitted surface had a significant impact on bacterial adhesion. Here fluid flow removed all bacteria. By comparison, the reduction on the nanotubular surface was only similar to that of the SBAE reference. We hypothesise the underlying cause to be an effect of the surface morphology on the structure and composition of the saliva precoating that reduces its stability, giving rise to a self-cleaning effect. In addition, no negative influence on the osteogenic potential of the nanopitted surface could be determined by alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization behaviour or gene expression; it remained on a par with the tissue culture plastic control. Thus, nanopitting seems to be a promising surface treatment candidate for dental implants to reduce infection related complications without compromising the implant integration.","authors":[{"name":"Susanne Bierbaum"},{"name":"Susan Mulansky"},{"name":"Eszter Bognár"},{"name":"Imre Kientzl"},{"name":"Péter Nagy"},{"name":"Nihal Engin Vrana"},{"name":"Miklós Weszl"},{"name":"Elke Boschke"},{"name":"Dieter Scharnweber"},{"name":"Cornelia Wolf-Brandstetter"}],"keywords":[]},"article268":{"pmid":"29588855","title":"Phage treatment of an aortic graft infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Management of prosthetic vascular graft infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be a significant challenge to clinicians.

Most of our understanding of community-level stress responses comes from the study of stationary biofilm communities. Although several community behaviors and production of specific biomolecules affecting biofilm development and associated behavior have been described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria, we have little appreciation for the production and dispersal of secreted metabolites within the 2D and 3D spaces they occupy as they colonize, spread, and grow on surfaces. Here we specifically studied the phenotypic responses and spatial variability of alkyl quinolones, including the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) and members of the alkyl hydroxyquinoline (AQNO) subclass, in P. aeruginosa plate-assay swarming communities. We found that PQS production was not a universal signaling response to antibiotics, as tobramycin elicited an alkyl quinolone response, whereas carbenicillin did not. We also found that PQS and AQNO profiles in response to tobramycin were markedly distinct and influenced these swarms on different spatial scales. At some tobramycin exposures, P. aeruginosa swarms produced alkyl quinolones in the range of 150 μm PQS and 400 μm AQNO that accumulated as aggregates. Our collective findings show that the distribution of alkyl quinolones can vary by several orders of magnitude within the same swarming community. More notably, our results suggest that multiple intercellular signals acting on different spatial scales can be triggered by one common cue.","authors":[{"name":"Nydia Morales-Soto"},{"name":"Sage J B Dunham"},{"name":"Nameera F Baig"},{"name":"Joseph F Ellis"},{"name":"Chinedu S Madukoma"},{"name":"Paul W Bohn"},{"name":"Jonathan V Sweedler"},{"name":"Joshua D Shrout"}],"keywords":[{"word":"N-oxide"},{"word":"PQS"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)"},{"word":"Raman spectroscopy"},{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"mass spectrometry (MS)"},{"word":"quinolone"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"secondary ion mass spectrometry"},{"word":"swarming"}]},"article271":{"pmid":"29588182","title":"Continuous citric acid production in repeated-fed batch fermentation by Aspergillus niger immobilized on a new porous foam.","date":"2018-09-27","abs":"The efficiency of current methods for industrial production of citric acid is limited.

The severe growth defect of the ΔbpsR strain in Stainer-Scholte medium was restored by supplementation with NA, which also functioned as an inducer of nic genes at low micromolar concentrations that are usually present in animals and humans.

Reporter assays with the isogenic mutant derivative of the wild-type (WT) strain harboring deletion in nicA, which encodes a putative nicotinic acid hydroxylase responsible for conversion of NA to 6-HNA, showed that 6-HNA is the actual inducer of the nic genes in the bacterial cell.

Based on the hypothesis that gliptins, commonly used as anti-human-DPP IV drugs, may affect bacterial growth upon inhibition of Sm-XPDAP, we have determined their ex vivo antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity towards S. mutans. All three DPP IV drugs tested reduced biofilm formation as determined by crystal violet staining. To link the observed biofilm inhibition to the human-DPP IV analogue present in S. mutans UA159, a pepX isogenic mutant was generated. In addition to reduced biofilm formation, CLSM studies of the biofilm formed by the pepX isogenic mutant showed these were comparable to those formed in the presence of saxagliptin, suggesting a probable role of this enzyme in biofilm formation by S. mutans UA159. The effects of both pepX deletion and DPP IV drugs on the proteome were studied using LC-MS/MS. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Sm-XPDAP as a novel anti-biofilm target and suggests a template molecule to synthesize lead compounds effective against this enzyme.","authors":[{"name":"Arpan De"},{"name":"Arianna Pompilio"},{"name":"Jenifer Francis"},{"name":"Iain C Sutcliffe"},{"name":"Gary W Black"},{"name":"Giulio Lupidi"},{"name":"Dezemona Petrelli"},{"name":"Luca A Vitali"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Saxagliptin"},{"word":"Shot-gun proteomics"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase"}]},"article286":{"pmid":"29580512","title":"Synergistic effect of X-ray irradiation and sodium hypochlorite against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium biofilms on quail eggshells.","date":"2019-10-07","abs":"The present study investigated the synergistic bactericidal effects of combined X-ray irradiation (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 kGy) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 ppm) treatment on the reduction of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 biofilms on quail eggshells.

Also, antimicrobial resistance, hydrophobicity and autoinducer-2 (AI-2) activity of both the wild-type (WT) and the mutant strain were investigated. Our results revealed that glucose was not essential for S. Dublin biofilm formation but had an inhibitory effect on biofilm formation when the concentration was over 0.1%. NaCl was found to be indispensable in forming biofilm, and it also exerted an inhibitory effect at high concentrations (>1.0%). Both the WT and the mutant strains displayed significant MIC growth after biofilm formation. An increase of up to 32,768 times in the resistance of S. Dublin in biofilm phonotype against antibiotic (ampicillin) compared to its planktonic phonotype was observed. However, S. Dublin luxS knockout mutant only showed slight differences compared to the WT strain in the antimicrobial tests although it displayed better biofilm-forming capacity than the WT strain. The mutant strain also exhibited higher hydrophobicity than the WT strain, which was a feature related to biofilm formation. The production of the quorum sensing autoinducer-2 (AI-2) was significantly lower in the mutant strain than in the WT strain since the LuxS enzyme, encoded by the luxS gene, plays an essential role in AI-2 synthesis. However, the limited biofilm-forming ability in the WT strain indicated AI-2 was not directly related to S. Dublin biofilm formation. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of the WT and mutant strains revealed upregulation of genes related to biofilm stress response and enhanced resistance in the luxS mutant strain, which may provide evidence for the regulatory role of the luxS gene in biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Ju"},{"name":"Junjie Li"},{"name":"Mengjiao Zhu"},{"name":"Zhaoxin Lu"},{"name":"Fengxia Lv"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Zhu"},{"name":"Xiaomei Bie"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"Salmonella Dublin"},{"word":"Xylene (PubChem CID: 6850715)"},{"word":"luxS gene"}]},"article288":{"pmid":"29580466","title":"Integrated combined effects of temperature, pH and sodium chloride concentration on biofilm formation by Salmonella enterica ser.

Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of B. pseudomallei were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by B. pseudomallei. Moreover, no comparative study to investigate the biofilm architectures of B. pseudomallei and the related B. thailandensis under different nutrient concentrations has been reported. Therefore, this study aims to provide new information on the effects of four antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment, viz. ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMI), meropenem (MEM) and doxycycline (DOX) on biofilm architecture of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis with different nutrient concentrations under static and flow conditions using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Impact of nutritional stress on drug susceptibility of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis grown planktonically or as biofilm was also evaluated. The findings of this study indicate that nutrient-limited environment enhanced survival of B. pseudomallei in biofilm after exposure to the tested antibiotics. The shedding planktonic B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis were also found to have increased CAZ tolerance in nutrient-limited environment. However, killing activities of MEM and IMI were stronger than CAZ and DOX on B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis both in planktonic cells and in 2-day old biofilm. In addition, MEM and IMI were able to inhibit B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis biofilm formation to a larger extend compared to CAZ and DOX. Differences in biofilm architecture were observed for biofilms grown under static and flow conditions. Under static conditions, biofilms grown in full strength modified Vogel and Bonner's medium (MVBM) showed honeycomb-like architecture while a knitted-like structure was observed under limited nutrient condition (0.1×MVBM). Under flow conditions, biofilms grown in MVBM showed a multilayer structure while merely dispersed bacteria were found when grown in 0.1×MVBM. Altogether, this study provides more insight on the effect of four antibiotics against B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis in biofilm under different nutrient and flow conditions.

The genome of EAEC strain 042, a diarrheal pathogen validated in a human challenge study, encodes multiple colonization factors.

Deletion of aap is known to increase adherence, autoaggregation, and biofilm formation, so it was proposed that Aap counteracts AAF/II-mediated interactions. We hypothesized that Aap sterically masks heat-resistant agglutinin 1 (Hra1), an integral outer membrane protein recently identified as an accessory colonization factor. We propose that this masking accounts for reduced in vivo colonization upon hra1 deletion and yet no colonization-associated phenotypes when hra1 is deleted in vitro. Using single and double mutants of hra1, aap, and the AAF/II structural protein gene aafA, we demonstrated that increased adherence in aap mutants occurs even when AAF/II proteins are genetically or chemically removed. Deletion of hra1 together with aap abolishes the hyperadherence phenotype, demonstrating that Aap indeed masks Hra1. The presence of all three colonization factors, however, is necessary for optimal colonization and for rapidly building stacked-brick patterns on slides and cultured monolayers, the signature EAEC phenotype. Altogether, our data demonstrate that Aap serves to mask nonstructural adhesins such as Hra1 and that optimal colonization by EAEC is mediated through interactions among multiple surface factors.

Part II - Pathogenesis.","date":"2018-04-27","abs":"<i>Streptococcus suis</i> is a re-emerging zoonotic pathogen that may cause severe disease, mostly meningitis, in pigs and in humans having occupational contact with pigs and pork, such as farmers, slaughterhose workers and butchers. The first stage of the pathogenic process, similar in pigs and humans, is adherence to and colonisation of mucosal and/or epithelial surface(s) of the host. The second stage is invasion into deeper tissue and extracellular translocation of bacterium in the bloodstream, either free in circulation or attached to the surface of monocytes. If <i>S. suis</i> present in blood fails to cause fatal septicaemia, it is able to progress into the third stage comprising penetration into host's organs, mostly by crossing the blood-brain barrier and/or blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier to gain access to the central nervous system (CNS) and cause meningitis. The fourth stage is inflammation that plays a key role in the pathogen esis of both systemic and CNS infections caused by <i>S. suis</i>. The pathogen may induce the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause septic shock and/or the recruitment and activation of different leukocyte populations, causing acute inflammation of the CNS. <i>Streptococcus suis</i> can also evoke - through activation of microglial cells, astrocytes and possibly other cell types - a fulminant inflammatory reaction of the brain which leads to intracranial complications, including brain oedema, increased intracranial pressure, cerebrovascular insults, and deafness, as a result of cochlear sepsis. In all stages of the pathogenic process, <i>S. suis</i> interacts with many types of immunocompetent host's cells, such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mononuclear macrophages, lymphocytes, dendritic cells and microglia, using a range of versatile virulence factors for evasion of the innate and adaptive immune defence of the host, and for overcoming environmental stress. It is estimated that <i>S. suis</i> produces more than 100 different virulence factors that could be classified into 4 groups: surface components or secreted elements, enzymes, transcription factors or regulatory systems and transporter factors or secretion systems. A major virulence factor is capsular polysaccharide (CPS) that protects bacteria from phagocytosis. However, it hampers adhesion to and invasion of host's cells, release of inflammatory cytokines and formation of the resistant biofilm which, in many cases, is vital for the persistence of bacteria. It has been demonstrated that the arising by mutation unencapsulated <i>S. suis</i> clones, which are more successful in penetration to and propagation within the host's cells, may coexist in the organism of a single host together with those that are encapsulated. Both 'complementary' clones assist each other in the successful colonization of host's tissues and persistence therein. <i>S. suis</i> has an open pan-genome characterized by a frequent gene transfer and a large diversity. Of the genetic determinants of <i>S. suis</i> pathogenicity, the most important are pathogenicity islands (PAI), in particular, a novel DNA segment of 89 kb length with evident pathogenic traits that has been designated as 89K PAI.

Those bacteria that are released from biofilm in the distribution system are especially considered as the major potential risk for drinking water bio-safety. For the first time, this full-scale study has captured and identified the proportional contribution of the source water, treated water, and distribution system in shaping the tap water bacterial community based on their microbial community fingerprints using the Bayesian SourceTracker method. The bacterial community profiles and diversity analyses illustrated that the water purification process shaped the community of planktonic and suspended particle-associated bacteria in treated water. The bacterial communities associated with suspended particles, loose deposits, and biofilm were similar to each other, while the community of tap water planktonic bacteria varied across different locations in distribution system. The microbial source tracking results showed that there was not a detectable contribution of source water to bacterial community in the tap water and distribution system. The planktonic bacteria in the treated water was the major contributor to planktonic bacteria in the tap water (17.7-54.1%). The particle-associated bacterial community in the treated water seeded the bacterial community associated with loose deposits (24.9-32.7%) and biofilm (37.8-43.8%) in the distribution system. In return, the loose deposits and biofilm showed a significant influence on tap water planktonic and particle-associated bacteria, which were location dependent and influenced by hydraulic changes. This was revealed by the increased contribution of loose deposits to tap water planktonic bacteria (from 2.5% to 38.0%) and an increased contribution of biofilm to tap water particle-associated bacteria (from 5.9% to 19.7%) caused by possible hydraulic disturbance from proximal to distal regions.

The results showed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) for all complex's atoms were relaxed after 4ns (RMSD for the all-atoms was 26.81±0.1 (Å); RMSF 1.13±0.02Å). For each section, the estimation of RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, inter-H bond and other analysis confirmed that, during the first interval;10ns, there was a stable binding between the two sections. Although all bindings disappeared from 10 to 20ns, the curcumin was trapped inside the chitosan nanoparticles, and no release took place until 20ns, after which the curcumin began to release. This trend suggests that chitosan nanoparticle has ability to carry the curcumin.","authors":[{"name":"Azam Khezri"},{"name":"Arsalan Karimi"},{"name":"Fatemeh Yazdian"},{"name":"Mahmoud Jokar"},{"name":"Soheil Rezazadeh Mofradnia"},{"name":"Hamid Rashedi"},{"name":"Zahra Tavakoli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chitosan"},{"word":"Curcumin"},{"word":"Molecular dynamics"},{"word":"NAMD"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"}]},"article326":{"pmid":"29572043","title":"Bioluminescence imaging increases in vivo screening efficiency for antifungal activity against device-associated Candida albicans biofilms.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Fungal infections are a major problem for a growing number of mostly immunocompromised patients. Candida albicans is an important human fungal pathogen causing mucosal and deep tissue infections, of which the majority are associated with biofilm formation on medical implants. Animal models that are currently in use to test antifungal drugs are limited to ex vivo analyses, requiring host sacrifice that excludes longitudinal monitoring of dynamic processes during biofilm formation in the live host. As a solution, we introduce non-invasive, dynamic imaging and quantification of C. albicans biofilm formation in vivo and subsequent evaluation of treatment efficacy against these biofilms using bioluminescent C. albicans in a catheter-associated mouse model. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) allowed us to evaluate baseline biofilm load before the start of therapy, which is necessary for correct evaluation and interpretation of antibiofilm efficacy in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that this BLI approach monitors the antibiofilm activity of different antifungal agents efficiently in vitro and in vivo. In this study, BLI revealed superior antibiofilm activity for echinocandins compared with amphotericin B and fluconazole. In vitro, anidulafungin showed the highest antibiofilm activity, followed by micafungin and caspofungin. In vivo, caspofungin significantly decreased the biofilm fungal load, as documented by the lower BLI signal and confirmed by CFU counts. In conclusion, this BLI approach increases the power and efficiency of screening and validation of antimycotics both under in vitro and in vivo conditions, thereby refining pre-clinical therapy studies.","authors":[{"name":"Greetje Vande Velde"},{"name":"Soňa Kucharíková"},{"name":"Patrick Van Dijck"},{"name":"Uwe Himmelreich"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungal therapy"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Bioluminescence imaging"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"In vivo"},{"word":"Subcutaneous model"}]},"article327":{"pmid":"29571979","title":"Effects of patchouli and cinnamon essential oils on biofilm and hyphae formation by Candida species.","date":"2019-04-15","abs":"The prevalence and fatality rates with biofilm-associated candidal infections have remained a challenge to the medical fraternity despite major advances in the field of antifungal therapy.

Of these three EOs, CT EO showed enhanced biofilm inhibition than others and hence it was further selected to study its biomass inhibition potential and exopolysaccharide layer disruption ability. The CT EO reduced the biomass of the preformed biofilms of all three Candida strains, which was supported by confocal microscopy. It also disrupted the exopolysaccharide layer of the Candida strains as shown by scanning electron microscopy. The present findings validate the effectiveness of EOs against the virulence of Candida spp. and emphasize the pharmaceutical potential of several native but yet unexplored wild aromatic plants in the prospect of therapeutic application.","authors":[{"name":"S Farisa Banu"},{"name":"D Rubini"},{"name":"P Shanmugavelan"},{"name":"R Murugan"},{"name":"S Gowrishankar"},{"name":"S Karutha Pandian"},{"name":"P Nithyanand"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cinnamomum"},{"word":"Essential oil"},{"word":"Patchouli"},{"word":"Virulent dimorphism"}]},"article328":{"pmid":"29571725","title":"Attenuation of quorum sensing regulated virulence and biofilm development in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 by Diaporthe phaseolorum SSP12.","date":"2018-10-22","abs":"In recent years, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 emerged as the significant pathogenic microorganism in majority of the hospital-acquired infections due to its resistance to the conventional antibiotics by virtue of its highly organized quorum sensing and associated biofilm formation.

To assess if FCM can monitor biofilm function, SSFs differing in age and sand composition were compared. FCM profiles from two established filters were indistinguishable. To examine biofilm in the deep sand bed, SSFs were monitored during a scraping event, when the top layer of sand and the schmutzdecke are removed to restore flow through the filter. The performance of an established SSF was stable: total organic carbon (TOC), pH, numbers of heterotrophs, coliforms, E. coli, and FCM bacterial profile were unaffected by scraping. However, the performance of two newly-built SSFs containing new and mixed sand was compromised: breakthrough of both microbial indicators and TOC occurred following scraping. The compromised performance of the new SSFs was reflected in distinct effluent bacterial communities; and, the presence of microbial indicators correlated to influent bacterial communities. This demonstrated that FCM can monitor SSF performance. Removal of the top layer of sand did not alter the effluent water from the established SSF, but did affect that of the SSFs containing new sand.

Patients with E. coli isolated by intra-operative puncture biopsy were included in the study. Genetic analysis of E. coli isolates, including phylogenetic grouping and virulence factor characteristics, were done by multiplex PCR. We identified 26 patients with chronic sinusitis, in which 26 E. coli isolates were cultured. The E. coli isolates belonged mainly to pathogenic phylogenetic group B2, and carried multiple virulence genes. Three genes in particular were present in all (100%) of examined isolates, they were (1) marker agn43 gene for forming biofilm, (2) type 1 fimbriae (fimG/H gene) and (3) yersiniabactin receptor (fyuA). Furthermore, a pseudo-phylogenetic tree of virulence genes distribution revealed possible cooperation between agn43, fimG/H, and fyuA in the coding of biofilm formation. Intra-operative-biopsy and culture-based therapy, targeting the isolated E. coli, coincided with long-term resolution of symptoms. This is the first report demonstrating an association between a highly pathogenic E. coli, chronic sinus infection, and resolution of symptoms upon E. coli targeted therapy, a significant finding due to the fact that E. coli has not been considered to be a commensal organism of the oropharynx or sinuses.

This work examines the hypothesis that the material properties of a biofilm both power and control wrinkle formation within biofilms in response to localized cell death. Using an agent-based model and a high-performance platform (Biocellion), we built a model that qualitatively reproduced wrinkle formation in biofilms due to cell death. Through the use of computational simulations, we determined important relationships between cellular level mechanical interactions and changes in colony morphology. These simulations were also used to identify significant cellular interactions that are required for wrinkle formation. These results are a first step towards more comprehensive models that, in combination with experimental observations, will improve our understanding of the morphological development of bacterial biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Boris Aguilar"},{"name":"Ahmadreza Ghaffarizadeh"},{"name":"Christopher D Johnson"},{"name":"Gregory J Podgorski"},{"name":"Ilya Shmulevich"},{"name":"Nicholas S Flann"}],"keywords":[]},"article351":{"pmid":"29565266","title":"Effect of Violet-Blue Light on Streptococcus mutans-Induced Enamel Demineralization.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"This in vitro study determined the effectiveness of violet-blue light (405 nm) on inhibiting Streptococcus mutans-induced enamel demineralization.","authors":[{"name":"Grace Gomez Felix Gomez"},{"name":"Frank Lippert"},{"name":"Masatoshi Ando"},{"name":"Andrea Ferreira Zandona"},{"name":"George J Eckert"},{"name":"Richard L Gregory"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"phototherapy"},{"word":"violet-blue light"}]},"article352":{"pmid":"29565118","title":"Bacterial Model Membranes Reshape Fibrillation of a Functional Amyloid Protein.","date":"2019-07-05","abs":"Biofilms are aggregates of cells that form surface-associated communities. The cells in biofilms are interconnected with an extracellular matrix, a network that is made mostly of polysaccharides, proteins, and sometimes nucleic acids. Some extracellular matrix proteins form fibers, termed functional amyloid or amyloid-like, to differentiate their constructive function from disease-related amyloid fibers. Recent functional amyloid assembly studies have neglected their interaction with membranes, despite their native formation in a cellular environment. Here, we use TasA, a major matrix protein in biofilms of the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, as a model functional amyloid protein and ask whether the bacterial functional amyloid interacts with membranes. Using biochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic tools, we show that TasA interacts distinctively with bacterial model membranes and that this interaction mutually influences the morphology and structure of the protein and the membranes. At the protein level, fibers of similar structure and morphology are formed in the absence of membranes and in the presence of eukaryotic model membranes. However, in the presence of bacterial model membranes, TasA forms disordered aggregates with a different β sheet signature. At the membrane level, fluorescence microscopy and anisotropy measurements indicate that bacterial membranes deform more considerably than eukaryotic membranes upon interaction with TasA. Our findings suggest that TasA penetrates bacterial more than eukaryotic model membranes and that this leads to membrane disruption and to reshaping the TasA fiber formation pathway. Considering the important role of TasA in providing integrity to biofilms, our study may direct the design of antibiofilm drugs to the protein-membrane interface.","authors":[{"name":"Ravit Malishev"},{"name":"Razan Abbasi"},{"name":"Raz Jelinek"},{"name":"Liraz Chai"}],"keywords":[]},"article353":{"pmid":"29564238","title":"Antimicrobial activity of four essential oils against pigmenting Pseudomonas fluorescens and biofilmproducing Staphylococcus aureus of dairy origin.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Essential oils (EOs) are mixtures of secondary metabolites of plant origin with many useful properties, among which the antimicrobial activity is also of interest for the food industry.

Staphylococcus aureus has 16 TCSs to adapt to the diverse microenvironments encountered during its life cycle, including host tissues and implanted medical devices. S. aureus is particularly prone to cause infections associated to medical devices, whose surfaces coated by serum proteins constitute a particular environment. Identification of the TCSs involved in the adaptation of S. aureus to colonize and survive on the surface of implanted devices remains largely unexplored. Here, using an in vivo catheter infection model and a collection of mutants in each non-essential TCS of S. aureus, we investigated the requirement of each TCS for colonizing the implanted catheter. Among the 15 mutants in non-essential TCSs, the arl mutant exhibited the strongest deficiency in the capacity to colonize implanted catheters. Moreover, the arl mutant was the only one presenting a major deficit in PNAG production, the main exopolysaccharide of the S. aureus biofilm matrix whose synthesis is mediated by the icaADBC locus. Regulation of PNAG synthesis by ArlRS occurred through repression of IcaR, a transcriptional repressor of icaADBC operon expression. Deficiency in catheter colonization was restored when the arl mutant was complemented with the icaADBC operon. MgrA, a global transcriptional regulator downstream ArlRS that accounts for a large part of the arlRS regulon, was unable to restore PNAG expression and catheter colonization deficiency of the arlRS mutant. These findings indicate that ArlRS is the key TCS to biofilm formation on the surface of implanted catheters and that activation of PNAG exopolysaccharide production is, among the many traits controlled by the ArlRS system, a major contributor to catheter colonization.","authors":[{"name":"Saioa Burgui"},{"name":"Carmen Gil"},{"name":"Cristina Solano"},{"name":"Iñigo Lasa"},{"name":"Jaione Valle"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PNAG"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"arlRS"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"implants"},{"word":"two-component systems"}]},"article356":{"pmid":"29563876","title":"Interference in Bacterial Quorum Sensing: A Biopharmaceutical Perspective.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Numerous bacteria utilize molecular communication systems referred to as quorum sensing (QS) to synchronize the expression of certain genes regulating, among other aspects, the expression of virulence factors and the synthesis of biofilm.

Biofilm formation is a result of dynamic intra- or inter-species interactions. However, the nature of molecular interactions between bacteria in multi-species biofilms are not well understood compared to those in single-species biofilms. This study investigated the ability of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to outcompete the biofilm formation of pathogens including enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis. When dual-species biofilms were formed, EcN inhibited the EHEC biofilm population by 14-fold compared to EHEC single-species biofilms. This figure was 1,100-fold for S. aureus and 8,300-fold for S. epidermidis; however, EcN did not inhibit P. aeruginosa biofilms. In contrast, commensal E. coli did not exhibit any inhibitory effect toward other bacterial biofilms. We identified that EcN secretes DegP, a bifunctional (protease and chaperone) periplasmic protein, outside the cells and controls other biofilms. Although three E. coli strains tested in this study expressed degP, only the EcN strain secreted DegP outside the cells. The deletion of degP disabled the activity of EcN in inhibiting EHEC biofilms, and purified DegP directly repressed EHEC biofilm formation. Hence, probiotic E. coli outcompetes pathogenic biofilms via extracellular DegP activity during dual-species biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Kuili Fang"},{"name":"Xing Jin"},{"name":"Seok Hoon Hong"}],"keywords":[]},"article359":{"pmid":"29563427","title":"Dental Biofilm and Laboratory Microbial Culture Models for Cariology Research.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Dental caries form through a complex interaction over time among dental plaque, fermentable carbohydrate, and host factors (including teeth and saliva).

A replication cohort of 31,571 adults with similar information on diet intake, other lifestyle markers and caries was also studied. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) modelling separated adolescents with low milk intake (lowest tertile with <0.4 servings/day) apart from those with high intake of milk (≥3.7 servings/day) based on saliva and tooth biofilm, respectively. Taxa in several genera contributed to this separation, and milk intake was inversely associated with the caries causing Streptococcus mutans in saliva and tooth biofilm samples by sequencing, PCR and cultivation. Despite the difference in S. mutans colonization, caries prevalence did not differ between milk consumption groups in the adolescents or the adults in the replication cohort, which may reflect that a significant positive association between intake of milk and sweet products was present in both the study and replication group. It was concluded that high milk intake correlates with different oral microbiota and it is hypothesized that milk may confer similar effects in the gut.

Since the surfaces of all urological implants are more or less ideal substrates for microorganisms, the formation of bacterial biofilms is a regularly observed and often serious complication, which in many cases forces early implant replacement. The burden on the patient and the health system are enormous. This article provides an overview of the numerous strategies developed or under development to protect against bacterial adhesion. Observations in use show sometimes good, sometimes bad results for all strategies, which may be due to the fact that the treated patients have different biological and clinical conditions. The implants are each equipped with defense mechanisms designed for certain scenarios; if they are used inadequately in this respect, they cannot optimally fulfill their task. Systematic observations of the outcomes and evaluation of the obtained data would be necessary in order to be able to assign an optimal effect spectrum to each defense strategy, thus, ultimately prospectively giving patients the most suitable product in advance. Systematic use of the existing implant concepts can avoid a large number of implant-related complications ad hoc; further development steps with regard to improved surface modifications can be made more specifically. However, the hope of a super strategy is likely to remain unfulfilled because bacteria as opponents have already proved billions of years of survival.","authors":[{"name":"N Laube"},{"name":"F Bernsmann"},{"name":"C Fisang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm protection"},{"word":"Intolerances"},{"word":"Urinary catheter"},{"word":"Urinary stent"},{"word":"Variety of products"}]},"article372":{"pmid":"29560472","title":"Combination antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, representing common and rare cystic fibrosis strains from different Irish clinics.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"To evaluate the effect of antibiotic combination therapy versus single therapy against cystic fibrosis strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified as common and rare among patient groups in different Irish hospitals.","authors":[{"name":"Priya Kapoor"},{"name":"Philip Murphy"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Infectious disease"},{"word":"Microbiology"}]},"article373":{"pmid":"29560270","title":"How do environment-dependent switching rates between susceptible and persister cells affect the dynamics of biofilms faced with antibiotics?","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Persisters form sub-populations of stress-tolerant cells that play a major role in the capacity of biofilms to survive and recover from disturbances such as antibiotic treatments. The mechanisms of persistence are diverse and influenced by environmental conditions, and persister populations are more heterogeneous than formerly suspected. We used computational modeling to assess the impact of three switching strategies between susceptible and persister cells on the capacity of bacterial biofilms to grow, survive and recover from antibiotic treatments. The strategies tested were: (1) constant switches, (2) substrate-dependent switches and (3) antibiotic-dependent switches. We implemented these strategies in an individual-based biofilm model and simulated antibiotic shocks on virtual biofilms. Because of limited available data on switching rates in the literature, nine parameter sets were assessed for each strategy. Substrate and antibiotic-dependent switches allowed high switching rates without affecting the growth of the biofilms. Compared to substrate-dependent switches, constant and antibiotic-dependent switches were associated with higher proportions of persisters in the top of the biofilms, close to the substrate source, which probably confers a competitive advantage within multi-species biofilms. The constant and substrate-dependent strategies need a compromise between limiting the wake-up and death of persisters during treatments and leaving the persister state fast enough to recover quickly after antibiotic-removal. Overall, the simulations gave new insights into the relationships between the dynamics of persister populations in biofilms and their dynamics of growth, survival and recovery when faced with disturbances.","authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Carvalho"},{"name":"Damien Balestrino"},{"name":"Christiane Forestier"},{"name":"Jean-Denis Mathias"}],"keywords":[]},"article374":{"pmid":"29559963","title":"The Impact of Maltitol-Sweetened Chewing Gum on the Dental Plaque Biofilm Microbiota Composition.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Bart J F Keijser"},{"name":"Tim J van den Broek"},{"name":"Dagmar E Slot"},{"name":"Lodewic van Twillert"},{"name":"Jolanda Kool"},{"name":"Clémentine Thabuis"},{"name":"Michel Ossendrijver"},{"name":"Fridus A van der Weijden"},{"name":"Roy C Montijn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Actinomyces"},{"word":"maltitol"},{"word":"microbiota"},{"word":"oral biofilm"},{"word":"oral health"},{"word":"polyol"},{"word":"supragingival plaque"}]},"article375":{"pmid":"29559526","title":"Multigenerational memory and adaptive adhesion in early bacterial biofilm communities.","date":"2019-12-18","abs":"Using multigenerational, single-cell tracking we explore the earliest events of biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa During initial stages of surface engagement (≤20 h), the surface cell population of this microbe comprises overwhelmingly cells that attach poorly (∼95% stay <30 s, well below the ∼1-h division time) with little increase in surface population. If we harvest cells previously exposed to a surface and direct them to a virgin surface, we find that these surface-exposed cells and their descendants attach strongly and then rapidly increase the surface cell population. This adaptive, time-delayed adhesion requires determinants we showed previously are critical for surface sensing: type IV pili (TFP) and cAMP signaling via the Pil-Chp-TFP system. We show that these surface-adapted cells exhibit damped, coupled out-of-phase oscillations of intracellular cAMP levels and associated TFP activity that persist for multiple generations, whereas surface-naïve cells show uncorrelated cAMP and TFP activity. These correlated cAMP-TFP oscillations, which effectively impart intergenerational memory to cells in a lineage, can be understood in terms of a Turing stochastic model based on the Pil-Chp-TFP framework. Importantly, these cAMP-TFP oscillations create a state characterized by a suppression of TFP motility coordinated across entire lineages and lead to a drastic increase in the number of surface-associated cells with near-zero translational motion. The appearance of this surface-adapted state, which can serve to define the historical classification of irreversibly attached cells, correlates with family tree architectures that facilitate exponential increases in surface cell populations necessary for biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Calvin K Lee"},{"name":"Jaime de Anda"},{"name":"Amy E Baker"},{"name":"Rachel R Bennett"},{"name":"Yun Luo"},{"name":"Ernest Y Lee"},{"name":"Joshua A Keefe"},{"name":"Joshua S Helali"},{"name":"Jie Ma"},{"name":"Kun Zhao"},{"name":"Ramin Golestanian"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"},{"name":"Gerard C L Wong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacteria biofilms"},{"word":"cyclic AMP"},{"word":"surface sensing"},{"word":"type IV pili"}]},"article376":{"pmid":"29558795","title":"Colonization of Electrospun Polycaprolactone Fibers by Relevant Pathogenic Bacterial Strains.","date":"2019-01-28","abs":"Electrospun biodegradable polymers have emerged as promising materials for their applications in several fields, including biomedicine and food industry.

In this work, the ability of three pathogenic bacterial species ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Listeria monocytogenes) to adhere and form biofilm in electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) microfibrous meshes was investigated. Bacterial attachment was analyzed in meshes with different microstructure, and comparisons with other materials (borosilicate glass and electrospun polylactic acid (PLA)) fibers were assessed.

To address geochemical influences, the planktonic phase was assayed periodically for protein, organic acids, physico-/geochemical measurements and bacterial community (via 16S rRNA gene sequencing), while biofilms (i.e. microbial growth on sediment coupons) were targeted for bacterial community composition at the completion of the experiment (23 d).

At day 23, biofilm communities were more taxonomically and phylogenetically diverse and substantially different from planktonic bacterial communities; however, the biofilm bacterial communities were similar regardless of filtration. These results suggest that although planktonic communities were sensitive to groundwater filtration, bacterial biofilm communities were stable and resistant to filtration.

These results suggest that StcA promotes phenotypes by way of ionic interactions with the GAS cell wall, most likely with negatively charged cell wall-associated polysaccharides.","authors":[{"name":"Artemis Gogos"},{"name":"Juan Cristobal Jimenez"},{"name":"Jennifer C Chang"},{"name":"Reid V Wilkening"},{"name":"Michael J Federle"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CHAP domain"},{"word":"S-layers"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cationic peptides"},{"word":"murein hydrolases"},{"word":"pheromone"},{"word":"surface protein"},{"word":"wall polysaccharides"}]},"article392":{"pmid":"29555626","title":"Design of a Broad-Range Bacteriophage Cocktail That Reduces Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms and Treats Acute Infections in Two Animal Models.","date":"2019-08-19","abs":"The alarming diffusion of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial strains requires investigations on nonantibiotic therapies. Among such therapies, the use of bacteriophages (phages) as antimicrobial agents, namely, phage therapy, is a promising treatment strategy supported by the findings of recent successful compassionate treatments in Europe and the United States. In this work, we combined host range and genomic information to design a 6-phage cocktail killing several clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including those collected from Italian cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and analyzed the cocktail performance. We demonstrated that the cocktail composed of four novel phages (PYO2, DEV, E215 and E217) and two previously characterized phages (PAK_P1 and PAK_P4) was able to lyse P. aeruginosa both in planktonic liquid cultures and in biofilms. In addition, we showed that the phage cocktail could cure acute respiratory infection in mice and treat bacteremia in wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larvae. Furthermore, administration of the cocktail to larvae prior to bacterial infection provided prophylaxis. In this regard, the efficiency of the phage cocktail was found to be unaffected by the MDR or mucoid phenotype of the pseudomonal strain. The cocktail was found to be superior to the individual phages in destroying biofilms and providing a faster treatment in mice. We also found the Galleria larva model to be cost-effective for testing the susceptibility of clinical strains to phages, suggesting that it could be implemented in the frame of developing personalized phage therapies.","authors":[{"name":"Francesca Forti"},{"name":"Dwayne R Roach"},{"name":"Marco Cafora"},{"name":"Maria E Pasini"},{"name":"David S Horner"},{"name":"Ersilia V Fiscarelli"},{"name":"Martina Rossitto"},{"name":"Lisa Cariani"},{"name":"Federica Briani"},{"name":"Laurent Debarbieux"},{"name":"Daniela Ghisotti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Galleria mellonella"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacteriophages"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"phage therapy"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"29555180","title":"Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria multispecies biofilms in cystic fibrosis: development of an in vitro Mycobacterium abscessus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa dual species biofilm model.","date":"2018-11-21","abs":"Lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by the progressive colonization of the respiratory tract by different bacteria, which develop polymicrobial biofilms. In the past decades, there has been an increase in the number of CF patients infected with Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM). Although Mycobacterium abscessus is the main NTM isolated globally, little is known about M. abscessus multispecies biofilm formation. In the present study we developed an in vitro model to study the phenotypic characteristics of biofilms formed by M. abscessus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major pathogen in CF. For that purpose, dual species biofilms were grown on polycarbonate membranes with a fixed concentration of P. aeruginosa and different inoculums of M. abscessus. The biofilms were sampled at 24, 48, and 72 h and bacteria were quantified in specific media. The results revealed that the increasing initial concentration of M. abscessus in dual species biofilms had an effect on its population only at 24 and 48 h, whereas P. aeruginosa was not affected by the different concentrations used of M. abscessus. Time elapsed increased biofilm formation of both species, specially between 24 and 48 h. According to the results, the conditions to produce a mature dual species biofilm in which the relative species distribution remained stable were 72 h growth of the mixed microbial culture at a 1:1 ratio. A significant decrease in mycobacterial population in dual compared to single species biofilms was found, suggesting that P. aeruginosa has a negative influence on M. abscessus. Finally, in a proof of concept experiment, young and mature dual species biofilms were exposed to clarithromycin.","authors":[{"name":"Graciela Rodríguez-Sevilla"},{"name":"Marta García-Coca"},{"name":"David Romera-García"},{"name":"John Jairo Aguilera-Correa"},{"name":"Ignacio Mahíllo-Fernández"},{"name":"Jaime Esteban"},{"name":"Concepción Pérez-Jorge"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"Multispecies biofilms"},{"word":"Mycobacterium abscessus"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Sociomicrobiology"}]},"article394":{"pmid":"29554553","title":"A novel model for predicting bioelectrochemical performance of microsized-MFCs by incorporating bacterial chemotaxis parameters and simulation of biofilm formation.","date":"2018-07-17","abs":"Bacterial transport parameters play a fundamental role in microbial population dynamics, biofilm formation and bacteria dispersion.

To address these two emerging issues, this study demonstrated the feasibility to integrate mainstream anammox into an A-2B process for municipal wastewater treatment towards energy-efficient operation with reduced sludge production. In the proposed A-2B process, an anaerobic fixed bed reactor (AFBR) served as A-stage for COD capture, an anammox moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) was employed as B2-stage, which received effluent containing nitrite from a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) at B1-stage. The results showed that under the operation conditions studied, 58% of influent COD was converted methane gas at A-stage, and 87% total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal was achieved with the effluent TIN concentration of 6.5 mg/L. Moreover, it was shown that at least 75% of sludge reduction was obtained due to the COD capture at A-stage. The high-throughput sequencing analysis further revealed that Candidatus Kuenenia was the dominant genus responsible for the observed anammox at B2-stage MBBR. This study clearly demonstrated a novel process configuration for sustaining mainstream anammox for municipal wastewater reclamation towards energy-efficient operation with minimized sludge production.","authors":[{"name":"Jun Gu"},{"name":"Qin Yang"},{"name":"Yu Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"A-2B process"},{"word":"Energy-efficient"},{"word":"Mainstream anammox"},{"word":"Moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR)"},{"word":"Nitritation-denitritation"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"29554502","title":"Effects of surface charge, hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on functional biocathode catalytic efficiency and community structure.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The bioelectrotransformation efficiency of various organic matters and corresponding electrode biofilm community formation as well as electron transfer efficiency in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) with different modified electrodes has been extensively studied on the anode side.

Once the infection is established, however, only a limited number of options are available that provides an efficient and successful treatment outcome. Over the past few years, there has been a tremendous amount of research dedicated to the functionalization of prosthetic meshes with antimicrobial properties, with some receiving regulatory approval and are currently available for clinical use. In this context, it is important to review the clinical importance of mesh infection, its risk factors, prophylaxis and pathogenicity.

Tonsillectomy has been shown to provide considerable relief to 75% of patients with plaque psoriasis. Even with the substantial evidence supporting group A Streptococcus as a causative pathogen in psoriasis, it is an elusive pathogen because it is not culturable, nor does it exhibit any positive serologic evidence of its presence. One possible reason for the negative cultures and negative serology findings with group A Streptococcus is the development of biofilms. We conducted a pathologic study to determine whether biofilms were present in the tonsillar tissues of 10 patients with psoriasis-6 men and 4 women, aged 25 to 64 years (mean: 48)-and in 10 age- and sex-matched controls with chronic tonsillitis who did not have psoriasis. We found that biofilms were present in every tonsillectomy specimen we examined, including those of the controls. Whereas psoriasis has been considered a double hit phenomenon, we believe that the development of skin lesions is likely attributable to the presence of the gene PSORS together with the biofilm in psoriasis patients rather than to the biofilm itself. Biofilms have been identified in both extra- and intracellular locations. We believe our findings add further evidence supporting a microbial pathogenesis of this disease.","authors":[{"name":"Herbert B Allen"},{"name":"Saagar Jadeja"},{"name":"Rina M Allawh"},{"name":"Kavita Goyal"}],"keywords":[]},"article399":{"pmid":"29554250","title":"Unexpected synergistic and antagonistic antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus biofilms.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"To evaluate putative anti-staphylococcal biofilm antibiotic combinations used in the management of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs).","authors":[{"name":"G F Dall"},{"name":"S-T J Tsang"},{"name":"P J Gwynne"},{"name":"S P MacKenzie"},{"name":"A H R W Simpson"},{"name":"S J Breusch"},{"name":"M P Gallagher"}],"keywords":[]}}
