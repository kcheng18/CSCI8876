We investigated the role of the micronutrient zinc in the pathogenesis of an E. coli strain associated with human disease. A variety of bacterial characteristics-growth in vitro, biofilm formation, adherence to IEC-6 epithelial cells, gene expression of putative EAEC virulence factors as well as EAEC-induced cytokine expression by HCT-8 cells-were quantified. At concentrations (≤ 0.05 mM) that did not alter EAEC growth (strain 042) but that are physiologic in serum, zinc markedly decreased the organism's ability to form biofilm (P<0.001), adhere to IEC-6 epithelial cells (P<0.01), and express putative EAEC virulence factors (aggR, aap, aatA, virK) (P<0.03). After exposure of the organism to zinc, the effect on virulence factor generation was prolonged (> 3 h). Further, EAEC-induced IL-8 mRNA and protein secretion by HCT-8 epithelial cells were significantly reduced by 0.05 mM zinc (P<0.03). Using an in vivo murine model of diet-induced zinc-deficiency, oral zinc supplementation (0.4 µg/mouse daily) administered after EAEC challenge (10 (10) CFU/mouse) significantly abrogated growth shortfalls (by>90%; P<0.01); furthermore, stool shedding was reduced (days 9-11) but tissue burden of organisms in the intestine was unchanged. These findings suggest several potential mechanisms whereby physiological levels of zinc alter pathogenetic events in the bacterium (reducing biofilm formation, adherence to epithelium, virulence factor expression) as well as the bacterium's effect on the epithelium (cytokine response to exposure to EAEC) to alter EAEC pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo. These effects may help explain and extend the benefits of zinc in childhood diarrhea and malnutrition.

QAMs were synthesized with CL of 3 to 18 and incorporated into Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (SBMP) bonding agent. The cured resins were inoculated with Streptococcus mutans. Bacterial early attachment was investigated at 4 hrs. Biofilm colony-forming units (CFU) were measured after 2 days. With CL increasing from 3 to 16, the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were decreased by 5 orders of magnitude. Incorporating QAMs into SBMP reduced bacterial early attachment, with the least colonization at CL = 16. Biofilm CFU for CL = 16 was 4 log lower than SBMP control (p < .05). All groups had similar dentin bond strengths (p > .1). The new antibacterial materials had fibroblast/odontoblast viability similar to that of commercial controls. In conclusion, increasing the chain length of new QAMs in bonding agents greatly increased the antibacterial efficacy. A reduction in Streptococcus mutans biofilm CFU by 4 log could be achieved, without compromising bond strength and cytotoxicity. New QAM-containing bonding agents are promising for a wide range of restorations to inhibit biofilms.

Several virulence factors are important for disease manifestation in APEC of which, role of quorum sensing has not been investigated. Quorum sensing is a population dependent cell-cell signaling system which modulates numerous physiological processes such as biofilm formation and virulence in multiple species. LuxS, a well-known controller in the QS, plays a role in regulating virulence in various bacterial species. Here we investigated the role of LuxS in regulating virulence in APEC O78:K80:H9. Mutation of luxS resulted in a significant reduction of virulence in APEC O78:K80:H9, evidenced by both in vivo and in vitro assays such as decreased invasion of internal organs in chicken embryo, reduced lethality in chicken embryo lethality assay, and altered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profile. In addition, the abilities of the knockout strain to survive in chicken macrophage cell lines and to invade in chicken embryo fibroblast cells were significantly diminished. Further, structure and expression level of the LPS profile was significantly altered in the knockout strain, which may be one of the contributing factors for the persistence and virulence of APEC. Complementation of luxS gene in trans restored the virulence of the knockout strain to the level of wild-type bacteria. Taken together, these results show that LuxS contributes to the virulence in APEC O78:K80:H9 strain and partly explain the role played by LuxS in the pathogenesis of APEC strains.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing the C. albicans adhesion protein Als5p were attached on atomic force microscopy tipless cantilevers using a bioinspired polydopamine wet polymer, and force-distance curves were recorded between the obtained cell probes and various solid surfaces. Force signatures obtained on hydrophobic substrates exhibited large adhesion forces (1.25 ± 0.2 nN) with extended rupture lengths (up to 400 nm), attributed to the binding and stretching of the hydrophobic tandem repeats of Als5p. Data collected on fibronectin (Fn) -coated substrates featured strong adhesion forces (2.8 ± 0.6 nN), reflecting specific binding between Fn and the N-terminal immunoglobulin-like regions of Als5p, followed by weakly adhesive macromolecular bonds. Both hydrophobic and Fn adhesion forces increased with contact time, emphasizing the important role that time plays in strengthening adhesion.

Here we studied the prevalence, expression, and function of the A. baumannii biofilm-associated protein (Bap) in 24 carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii ST92 strains isolated from a single institution over a 10-year period. The bap gene was highly prevalent, with 22/24 strains being positive for bap by PCR. Partial sequencing of bap was performed on the index case strain MS1968 and revealed it to be a large and highly repetitive gene approximately 16 kb in size. Phylogenetic analysis employing a 1,948-amino-acid region corresponding to the C terminus of Bap showed that BapMS1968 clusters with Bap sequences from clonal complex 2 (CC2) strains ACICU, TCDC-AB0715, and 1656-2 and is distinct from Bap in CC1 strains. By using overlapping PCR, the bapMS1968 gene was cloned, and its expression in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain resulted in increased biofilm formation. A Bap-specific antibody was generated, and Western blot analysis showed that the majority of A. baumannii strains expressed an ∼200-kDa Bap protein. Further analysis of three Bap-positive A. baumannii strains demonstrated that Bap is expressed at the cell surface and is associated with biofilm formation. Finally, biofilm formation by these Bap-positive strains could be inhibited by affinity-purified Bap antibodies, demonstrating the direct contribution of Bap to biofilm growth by A. baumannii clinical isolates.

Investigating auxiliary drugs for periodontitis during conventional treatments is, thus, quite important. Capsaicin, an agonist for the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1), due to its bacteriostatic activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anti-inflammatory effects, appears to be a promising drug. In this work, the antimicrobial activity of capsaicin against P. gingivalis and biofilm formation, inflammatory cytokine levels in experimental periodontitis, osteoclast precursor proliferation, and osteoclastogenesis in vitro were fully investigated. The results showed that capsaicin inhibited P. gingivalis growth with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 16 and 64 mg/l, respectively. Capsaicin also inhibited P. gingivalis biofilm formation, with minimum biofilm inhibition concentrations MBIC50 and MBIC90 of 16 and 32 mg/l, respectively, and reduced pre-formed biofilms' viability with a minimum biofilm reduction concentration MBRC50 of 64 mg/l, as demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy.

However, as the number of studies of gene regulation, architecture, and pathogenic traits of C. albicans biofilms has increased, so have differences in results. This suggests that depending upon the conditions employed, biofilms may vary widely, thus hampering attempts at a uniform description. Gene expression studies suggest that this may be the case. To explore this hypothesis further, we compared the architectures and traits of biofilms formed in RPMI 1640 and Spider media at 37°C in air. Biofilms formed by a/α cells in the two media differed to various degrees in cellular architecture, matrix deposition, penetrability by leukocytes, fluconazole susceptibility, and the facilitation of mating. Similar comparisons of a/a cells in the two media, however, were made difficult given that in air, although a/a cells form traditional biofilms in RPMI medium, they form polylayers composed primarily of yeast cells in Spider medium. These polylayers lack an upper hyphal/matrix region, are readily penetrated by leukocytes, are highly fluconazole susceptible, and do not facilitate mating. If, however, air is replaced with 20% CO2, a/a cells make a biofilm in Spider medium similar architecturally to that of a/α cells, which facilitates mating. A second, more cursory comparison is made between the disparate cellular architectures of a/a biofilms formed in air in RPMI and Lee's media. The results demonstrate that C. albicans forms very different types of biofilms depending upon the composition of the medium, level of CO2 in the atmosphere, and configuration of the MTL locus.

In all independently evolved hyperswarmers, the reproducible hyperswarming phenotype is caused by parallel point mutations in a flagellar synthesis regulator, FleN, which locks the naturally monoflagellated bacteria in a multiflagellated state and confers a growth rate-independent advantage in swarming. Although hyperswarmers outcompete the ancestral strain in swarming competitions, they are strongly outcompeted in biofilm formation, which is an essential trait for P. aeruginosa in environmental and clinical settings.

Overall, there is a wealth of technical solutions to contrast the establishment of an implant infection. Many of them exhibit a great potential in preclinical models. The lack of well-structured prospective multicenter clinical trials hinders the achievement of conclusive data on the efficacy and comparative performance of anti-infective biomaterials.

Batch experiments showed that CO was inhibitory to methanogens, but not to bacteria, at CO partial pressure between 0.25 and 1 atm under thermophilic conditions. During anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge supplemented with CO added through a hollow fiber membrane (HFM) module in continuous thermophilic reactors, CO did not inhibit the process even at a pressure as high as 1.58 atm inside the HFM, due to the low dissolved CO concentration in the liquid. Complete consumption of CO was achieved with CO gas retention time of 0.2 d. Results from high-throughput sequencing analysis showed clear differences of the microbial community structures between the samples from liquid and biofilm on the HFM in the reactor with CO addition. Species close to Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus were the two main archaeal species involved in CO biomethanation. However, the two species were distributed differently in the liquid phase and in the biofilm. Although the carboxidotrophic activities test showed that CO was converted by both archaea and bacteria, the bacterial species responsible for CO conversion are unknown.

Lagrangian sampling, which follows a parcel of water as it moves downstream, was used to link hydrological and chemical transformation processes. Wastewater loading of neuro-active compounds varied considerably over a span of several hours, and thus a sampling regime was used to verify that the Lagrangian parcel was being sampled and a mechanism was developed to correct measured concentrations if it was not. In-stream attenuation over the 5.4-km evaluated reach could be modeled as pseudo-first-order decay for 11 of the 14 evaluated neuro-active pharmaceutical compounds, illustrating the capacity of streams to reduce conveyance of neuro-active compounds downstream. Fluoxetine and N-desmethyl citalopram were the most rapidly attenuated compounds (t1/2 = 3.6 ± 0.3 h, 4.0 ± 0.2 h, respectively). Lamotrigine, 10,11,-dihydro-10,11,-dihydroxy-carbamazepine, and carbamazepine were the most persistent (t1/2 = 12 ± 2.0 h, 12 ± 2.6 h, 21 ± 4.5 h, respectively). Parent compounds (e.g., buproprion, carbamazepine, lamotrigine) generally were more persistent relative to their metabolites.

Mechanisms contributing to the persistent carriage and high prevalence rates of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) strains in swine herds and production facilities have not been investigated. One explanation for the high prevalence of MRSA in swine herds is the ability of these organisms to exist as biofilms. In this report, the ability of swine LA-MRSA strains, including ST398, ST9, and ST5, to form biofilms was quantified and compared to several swine and human isolates. The contribution of known biofilm matrix components, polysaccharides, proteins and extracellular DNA (eDNA), was tested in all strains as well. All MRSA swine isolates formed robust biofilms similar to human clinical isolates. The addition of Dispersin B had no inhibitory effect on swine MRSA isolates when added at the initiation of biofilm growth or after pre-established mature biofilms formed. In contrast, the addition of proteinase K inhibited biofilm formation in all strains when added at the initiation of biofilm growth and was able to disperse pre-established mature biofilms. Of the LA-MRSA strains tested, we found ST398 strains to be the most sensitive to both inhibition of biofilm formation and dispersal of pre-formed biofilms by DNaseI. Collectively, these findings provide a critical first step in designing strategies to control or eliminate MRSA in swine herds.

The disease is initiated by pathogenic bacteria in the dental biofilm, and the severity of inflammation and attachment loss varies with the host response. Recently, there has been an increased interest in determining the role of lipid mediators in inflammatory events and the concept of pro-inflammatory and pro-resolution lipid mediators has been brought into focus also in periodontal disease. The present study aimed to determine the profile of omega-3 or n3- as well as omega-6 or n6- polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and PUFA-metabolites of linoleic acid, arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva and serum in AgP patients and healthy controls. In total, 60 selected n3- and n6-PUFAs and various PUFA metabolites were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Of these, 51 could be quantified in this study. The concentrations of the majority were low in saliva samples compared with serum and GCF, but were mainly higher in AgP patients compared with healthy controls in all three kinds of sample. Ratios of n3- to n6-PUFAs (DHA + EPA)/AA were significantly lower in the GCF of AgP patients than in the healthy controls. Furthermore, various ratios of the direct precursors of the pro-resolution lipid mediators (precursors of resolvins and protectins) were calculated against the precursors of mainly pro-inflammatory lipid mediators. These ratios were mainly lower in GCF and saliva of AgP patients, compared with healthy controls, but only reached significance in GCF (P<0.05). To conclude, the ratios of precursors of pro-resolution/pro-inflammatory lipid mediators seem to be more relevant for describing the disease status of AgP than the concentration of specific lipid mediators.

Furthermore, we show with mixed-strain experiments that antibiotic-sensitive non-producing cells lacking Psl can gain tolerance by integrating into Psl-containing biofilms. However, non-producers dilute the protective capacity of the matrix and hence, excessive incorporation can result in the collapse of resistance of the entire community. Our data also reveal that Psl mediated protection is extendible to E. coli and S. aureus in co-culture biofilms.

The air permeability of SPG membranes, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, pollutant removal and oxygen utilization were investigated during the continuous operation of the bioreactor. The long-term stable continuous operation of the experimental system demonstrated the successful application of microbubble aeration in aerobic wastewater treatment processes. The air permeability of SPG membranes was influenced by its surface wettability and pore size. The air permeability of hydrophobic membrane was better than that of hydrophilic membrane. The air permeability could also be improved by increasing the pore size. DO concentration was affected by organic loading mainly at a certain air flux. The optimal SPG membrane area-based COD removal capacity of the experimental system was determined as 6.88 kg x (m2 x d)(-1). NH4(+)-N removal was mainly affected by DO concentration and its diffusion inside the biofilm. The simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was observed at a high organic loading rate. The oxygen utilization was much more efficient in microbubble aeration, compared to traditional bubble aeration, and it might be close to 100% at optimal running conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang"},{"name":"Ping Liu"},{"name":"Jin Ma"},{"name":"Jing Zhang"},{"name":"Ming Zhang"},{"name":"Gen Wu"}],"keywords":[]},"article44":{"pmid":"23946652","title":"Prevention and treatment of biofilms by hybrid- and nanotechnologies.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Bacteria growing as adherent biofilms are difficult to treat and frequently develop resistance to antimicrobial agents.

Surprisingly, cheats were unable to exploit this resistance in the presence of cooperators, which suggests that resistance does not appear to result from activation of QS-regulated public goods. Instead, elevated resistance of wild-type bacteria was related to the ability to form more predation-resistant biofilms. This could be explained by the expression of QS-regulated resistance traits in densely populated biofilms and floating cell aggregations, or alternatively, by a pleiotropic cost of cheating where less resistant cheats are selectively removed from biofilms.

Levels of the second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) are regulated by a variety of environmental stimuli and play a critical role in regulating cellular processes such as biofilm formation and cellular motility. Cyclic di-GMP signaling systems have been largely characterized in pathogenic bacteria; however, proteins that can impact the synthesis or degradation of c-di-GMP are prominent in cyanobacterial species and yet remain largely underexplored. In cyanobacteria, many putative c-di-GMP synthesis or degradation domains are found in genes that also harbor light-responsive signal input domains, suggesting that light is an important signal for altering c-di-GMP homeostasis. Indeed, c-di-GMP-associated domains are often the second most common output domain in photoreceptors-outnumbered only by a histidine kinase output domain. Cyanobacteria differ from other bacteria regarding the number and types of photoreceptor domains associated with c-di-GMP domains. Due to the widespread distribution of c-di-GMP domains in cyanobacteria, we investigated the evolutionary origin of a subset of genes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that c-di-GMP signaling systems were present early in cyanobacteria and c-di-GMP genes were both vertically and horizontally inherited during their evolution. Finally, we compared intracellular levels of c-di-GMP in two cyanobacterial species under different light qualities, confirming that light is an important factor for regulating this second messenger in vivo.","authors":[{"name":"Marco Agostoni"},{"name":"Benjamin J Koestler"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"Barry L Williams"},{"name":"Beronda L Montgomery"}],"keywords":[]},"article47":{"pmid":"23943256","title":"The 3.5-year survival rates of primary molars treated according to three treatment protocols: a controlled clinical trial.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"This study aimed to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the survival rates of molars treated according to the conventional restorative treatment (CRT) using amalgam, atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) using high-viscosity glass ionomer, and ultraconservative treatment (UCT) protocol after 3.5 years.","authors":[{"name":"Maite Mijan"},{"name":"Rodrigo Guedes de Amorim"},{"name":"Soraya Coelho Leal"},{"name":"Jan Mulder"},{"name":"Luciana Oliveira"},{"name":"Nico H J Creugers"},{"name":"Jo E Frencken"}],"keywords":[]},"article48":{"pmid":"23942459","title":"Involvement of heat shock proteins in Candida albicans biofilm formation.","date":"2013-10-28","abs":"Biofilm growth represents one of the most challenging problems associated with Candida infections, largely due to the natural resistance of biofilm to the common antifungal drugs.

The quorum quenching therapeutic approach promises a lower risk of resistance development, since interference with virulence generally does not affect the growth and fitness of the bacteria and, hence, does not exert an associated selection pressure for drug-resistant strains. With better understanding of bacterial communication networks and mechanisms, many quorum quenching methods have been developed against various clinically significant bacterial pathogens.

A biofilm is a complex microbial community in which bacteria attach to a biological or non-biological surface and are embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric substance. Biofilm related infections represent a major clinical challenge due to their resistance to both host immune defenses and standard antimicrobial therapies.

These observations along with the clinical presentation of the patients provide the first evidence that supports the presence of biofilm in such cases.

Failure to resolve these biofilm infections may necessitate the surgical removal of the prosthetic device which can be debilitating and costly. Recent studies have shown that application of surface acoustic waves to catheter surfaces can reduce the incidence of infections by a mechanism that has not yet been clarified. We report here the effects of surface acoustic waves (SAW) on the capacity of human neutrophils to eradicate S. epidermidis bacteria in a planktonic state and within biofilms. Utilizing a novel fibrin gel system that mimics a tissue-like environment, we show that SAW, at an intensity of 0.3 mW/cm(2), significantly enhances human neutrophil killing of S. epidermidis in a planktonic state and within biofilms by enhancing human neutrophil chemotaxis in response to chemoattractants. In addition, we show that the integrin CD18 plays a significant role in the killing enhancement observed in applying SAW. We propose from out data that this integrin may serve as mechanoreceptor for surface acoustic waves enhancing neutrophil chemotaxis and killing of bacteria.

It is frequently associated with subgingival biofilms of both chronic and aggressive periodontitis, and the diseased sites of the periodontium exhibit increased levels of the proinflammatory mediator interleukin (IL)-1β. Some bacterial species can alter their physiological properties as a result of sensing IL-1β. We have recently shown that this cytokine localizes to the cytoplasm of A. actinomycetemcomitans in co-cultures with organotypic gingival mucosa. However, current knowledge about the mechanism underlying bacterial IL-1β sensing is still limited. In this study, we characterized the interaction of A. actinomycetemcomitans total membrane protein with IL-1β through electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The interacting protein, which we have designated bacterial interleukin receptor I (BilRI), was identified through mass spectrometry and was found to be Pasteurellaceae specific. Based on the results obtained using protein function prediction tools, this protein localizes to the outer membrane and contains a typical lipoprotein signal sequence. All six tested biofilm cultures of clinical A. actinomycetemcomitans strains expressed the protein according to phage display-derived antibody detection. Moreover, proteinase K treatment of whole A. actinomycetemcomitans cells eliminated BilRI forms that were outer membrane specific, as determined through immunoblotting. The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli in both the outer membrane-associated form and a soluble cytoplasmic form. When assessed using flow cytometry, the BilRI-overexpressing E. coli cells were observed to bind 2.5 times more biotinylated-IL-1β than the control cells, as detected with avidin-FITC. Overexpression of BilRI did not cause binding of a biotinylated negative control protein. In a microplate assay, soluble BilRI bound to IL-1β, but this binding was not specific, as a control protein for IL-1β also interacted with BilRI. Our findings suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans expresses an IL-1β-binding surface-exposed lipoprotein that may be part of the bacterial IL-1β-sensing system.","authors":[{"name":"Annamari Paino"},{"name":"Tuuli Ahlstrand"},{"name":"Jari Nuutila"},{"name":"Indre Navickaite"},{"name":"Maria Lahti"},{"name":"Heidi Tuominen"},{"name":"Hannamari Välimaa"},{"name":"Urpo Lamminmäki"},{"name":"Marja T Pöllänen"},{"name":"Riikka Ihalin"}],"keywords":[]},"article67":{"pmid":"23936127","title":"Genotypic and phenotypic characterisation of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli from children in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is a significant cause of diarrhoeal illness in both children and adults.

The effect of licochalcone A on S.suis biofilm formation was characterized by crystal violet staining. The effect of licochalcone A on suilysin secretion was evaluated by titration of hemolytic activity. To understand the antimicrobial effect, gene expression profile of S.suis treated by licochalcone A was analyzed by DNA microarray. Our results demonstrated that licochalcone A showed antimicrobial activity on S.suis with MICs of 4 µg/ml for S.suis serotype 2 strains and 8 µg/ml for S.suis serotype 7 strains. Biofilm formation was inhibited by 30-40% in the presence of licochalcone A (3 µg/ml) and suilysin secretion was also significantly inhibited in the presence of licochalcone A (1.5 µg/ml). The gene expression profile of S.suis in the presence of licochalcone A showed that 132 genes were differentially regulated, and we analyzed the regulated genes in the aspect of the bacterial cell cycle control. Among the deregulated genes, the genes responsible for the mass doubling was increased expression, but the genes responsible for DNA replication and cell division were inhibited the expression.

The deletion of rpoS or soxRS decreased yjcC expression, implying an RpoS- or SoxRS-dependent control. After paraquat or H2O2 treatment, the deletion of yjcC reduced bacterial survival. These effects could be complemented by introducing the ΔyjcC mutant with the YjcC-expression plasmid pJR1. The recombinant protein containing only the YjcC-EAL domain exhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity; overexpression of yjcC has lower levels of cyclic di-GMP. The yjcC deletion mutant also exhibited increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, oxidation damage, and oxidative stress scavenging activity. In addition, the yjcC deletion reduced capsular polysaccharide production in the bacteria, but increased the LD50 in mice, biofilm formation, and type 3 fimbriae major pilin MrkA production. Finally, a comparative transcriptome analysis showed 34 upregulated and 29 downregulated genes with the increased production of YjcC. The activated gene products include glutaredoxin I, thioredoxin, heat shock proteins, chaperone, and MrkHI, and proteins for energy metabolism (transporters, cell surface structure, and transcriptional regulation). In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that YjcC positively regulates the oxidative stress response and mouse virulence but negatively affects the biofilm formation and type 3 fimbriae expression by altering the c-di-GMP levels after receiving oxidative stress signaling inputs.

The LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) protein PqsR (MvfR) is a key component of alkyl-quinolone (AQ)-dependent QS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PqsR is activated by 2-alkyl-4-quinolones including the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS; 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone), its precursor 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (HHQ) and their C9 congeners, 2-nonyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (C9-PQS) and 2-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (NHQ). These drive the autoinduction of AQ biosynthesis and the up-regulation of key virulence determinants as a function of bacterial population density. Consequently, PqsR constitutes a potential target for novel antibacterial agents which attenuate infection through the blockade of virulence. Here we present the crystal structures of the PqsR co-inducer binding domain (CBD) and a complex with the native agonist NHQ. We show that the structure of the PqsR CBD has an unusually large ligand-binding pocket in which a native AQ agonist is stabilized entirely by hydrophobic interactions. Through a ligand-based design strategy we synthesized and evaluated a series of 50 AQ and novel quinazolinone (QZN) analogues and measured the impact on AQ biosynthesis, virulence gene expression and biofilm development. The simple exchange of two isosteres (OH for NH₂) switches a QZN agonist to an antagonist with a concomitant impact on the induction of bacterial virulence factor production. We also determined the complex crystal structure of a QZN antagonist bound to PqsR revealing a similar orientation in the ligand binding pocket to the native agonist NHQ. This structure represents the first description of an LTTR-antagonist complex.

Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of brlR coincided with increased resistance of P. aeruginosa to colistin, while overexpression of brlR resulted in increased susceptibility. brlR expression correlated with reduced transcript abundances of phoP, phoQ, pmrA, pmrB, and arnC. Inactivation of pmrA and pmrB had no effect on the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilms to colistin, while inactivation of phoP and phoQ rendered biofilms more susceptible than the wild type. The susceptibility phenotype of ΔphoP biofilms to colistin was comparable to that of P. aeruginosa biofilms overexpressing brlR. BrlR was found to directly bind to oprH promoter DNA of the oprH-phoPQ operon. BrlR reciprocally contributed to colistin and tobramycin resistance in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and CF clinical isolates, with overexpression of brlR resulting in increased tobramycin MICs and increased tobramycin resistance but decreased colistin MICs and increased colistin susceptibility. The opposite trend was observed upon brlR inactivation. The difference in susceptibility to colistin and tobramycin was eliminated by combination treatment of biofilms with both antibiotics. Our findings establish BrlR as an unusual member of the MerR family, as it not only functions as a multidrug transport activator, but also acts as a repressor of phoPQ expression, thus suppressing colistin resistance.

Inactivation of dspI was shown to abolish biofilm dispersion autoinduction in continuous cultures of P. aeruginosa and resulted in biofilms that were significantly greater in thickness and biomass than those of the parental wild-type strain. Dispersion was shown to be inducible in dspI mutants by the exogenous addition of synthetic cis-2-decenoic acid or by complementation of ΔdspI in trans under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter. Mutation of dspI was also shown to abolish cis-2-decenoic acid production, as revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of cell-free spent culture medium.

Phenotypic characteristics of bacterial biofilms vary depending on the substratum to which they attach, the nutritional environment, and the microorganisms within the biofilm community. To develop an ex vivo biofilm model that more closely mimics biofilms in chronic skin wounds, we developed an optimal procedure to grow mature biofilms on a central partial-thickness wound in 12-mm porcine skin explants. Chlorine gas produced optimal sterilization of explants while preserving histological properties of the epidermis and dermis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus developed mature biofilms after 3 days that had dramatically increased tolerance to gentamicin and oxacillin (∼100× and 8,000× minimal inhibitory concentration, respectively) and to sodium hypochlorite (0.6% active chlorine). Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy verified extensive exopolymeric biofilm structures on the explants. Despite a significant delay, a ΔlasI quorum-sensing mutant of P. aeruginosa developed biofilm as antibiotic-tolerant as wild-type after 3 days. This ex vivo model simulates growth of biofilms on skin wounds and provides an accurate model to assess effects of antimicrobial agents on mature biofilms.

Motility and biofilm development are mutually exclusive events, and control of the phase of this 'swim-or-stick' switch involves the ability of the bacterium to sense and respond appropriately to a surface. Cairns et al. (2013) report that the Bacillus subtilis flagellum functions in surface-sensing. Using mutants of B. subtilis that prevent flagellum rotation, they measured the expression and activity of DegU, the response regulator of the two-component DegS-DegU circuit. DegU activity and degU transcription increased when flagellum rotation was prevented, and were dependent on the DegS kinase. Inhibiting flagellar rotation by overexpressing the EpsE flagellar 'clutch' or addition of anti-flagellin antiserum also increased degU transcription and activity. These results suggest B. subtilis senses restriction of flagellum rotation as the cell nears a surface. Inhibition of the flagellum activates the DegS-DegU circuit to turn on biofilm formation, i.e. the flagellum is acting as a mechanosensor of surfaces. B. subtilis joins an ever-expanding group of bacteria, including species of Vibrio, Proteus and Caulobacter that use the flagellum as a surface sensor.

In this study, the biofilm-forming ability of the major medically important clinical and laboratory reference strains was compared. Biofilms were quantified using traditional methods, that is, crystal violet (CV), tetrazolium (XTT) reduction and colony-forming unit assays (CFU), and two new methods: an automated cell counter (ACC) and biofilm suspension turbidity (BST) method. Biofilms could be categorized based on biofilm biomass (high, medium and low) and growth state (high and low). Candida albicans genotypes, A, B and C, showed medium biofilm mass and low growth rate, and only one C. albicans laboratory strain, ATCC MYA-2719, matched this biofilm category. Of all non-albicans Candida species tested, only Candida dubliniensis and Candida glabrata laboratory and clinical isolates had similar biofilm development. The ACC and BST methods for measuring biofilm significantly correlated with CV and CFU biofilm mass measurements. Thus, biofilm mass can be rapidly assessed using biofilm disruptive/cellular nondestructive methods allowing yeast biofilm cells to be used for further analysis. In conclusion, Candida laboratory reference strains and clinical isolates have been shown to form biofilms at different rates; hence for validity, the selection of laboratory reference strains in biofilm studies may be critical for virulence assessment.

To our knowledge, we now report for the first time that meningococcal strains from several capsular groups exhibit Ig-binding activity that is dependent on human serum factors. A protein mediating Ig binding was identified as T and B cell-stimulating protein B (TspB) by immunoprecipitation and by mass spectroscopic analysis of tryptic peptides. Recombinant TspB and derivatives verified Ig binding, with a preference for human IgG2 Fc, and localized the IgG-binding region to a highly conserved subdomain of TspB. Antiserum produced in mice against the conserved subdomain detected the presence of TspB on the cell surface by flow cytometry when bacteria were grown in the presence of human serum. By fluorescence microscopy, we observed formation of an extracellular matrix having characteristics of a biofilm containing TspB, human IgG, DNA, and large aggregates of bacteria. TspB is encoded by gene ORF6 in prophage DNA, which others have shown is associated with invasive meningococcal strains. Knocking out ORF6 genes eliminated IgG binding and formation of large bacterial aggregates in biofilm. Reintroduction of a wild-type ORF6 gene by phage transduction restored the phenotype. The results show that TspB mediated IgG binding and aggregate/biofilm formation triggered by factors in human serum. As has been observed for other Ig-binding proteins, the activities mediated by TspB may provide protection against immune responses, which is in accordance with the association of prophage DNA carrying ORF6 with invasive meningococcal strains.

Investigations of bacterial floras (aerobes, aero-anaerobes, and anaerobes), detection of the presence of biofilms by microscopic epifluorescence, and clinical assessment were performed. We characterized biofilms in 32 malignant wounds associated with breast cancer and bacterial floras in 25 such wounds. A mixed group of floras, composed of 54 different bacterial types, was identified, with an average number per patient of 3.6 aerobic species and 1.7 anaerobic species; the presence of strict anaerobic bacterial strains was evidenced in 70% of the wounds; biofilm was observed in 35% of the cases. Odor was a reliable indicator of colonization by anaerobes, even when this symptom was not directly linked to any of the identified anaerobic bacteria. Bacteria are more likely to be present during myelosuppression and significantly increase the emergence of odors and pain when present at amounts of >10(5) · g(-1).

The higher resistance of such microbial communities to stress conditions, including antibiotics and host immune response, is recently extensively studied. However, the weak activity of phagocytic cells against microbial biofilm is not yet fully understood and explained. The aim of this study was: (1) a qualitative and quantitative comparison of cell components/products released from Staphylococcus aureus biofilm or planktonic cultures, (2) evaluation of the influence of such cell components/products on murine leukocytes secretory function. For this, mouse peritoneal leukocytes were stimulated with biofilm or planktonic staphylococcal cultures or their acellular filtrates, and then the production of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1 and MIP-1α), hemolytic activity and staphylokinase (SAK) production was determined. It was found that similar staphylococcal components/products possessing the immunomodulatory properties, were present in both, biofilm and planktonic filtrates. Moreover, these compounds were similarly active in the stimulation of TNF-α and MCP-1 release from leukocytes. The hemolytic activity and SAK release by planktonic and biofilm cultures were also comparable. What is interesting, stronger stimulatory activity of biofilm-derived components/products of clinical S. aureus strains in the case of MIP-1α, IL-6 and IL-10 was noticed. On the other hand, taking into consideration the reference strains, MIP-1α production was enhanced by planktonic filtrates. Thus, in our study it was proved, first of all, that biofilm is not a structure fully separated from the external environment. Second, the influence of these S. aureus constituents/metabolites on leukocytes seems to be more strain-dependent than culture phenotype-dependent. The lack of one common profile of biofilm and planktonic S. aureus cultures/filtrates biological activity indicates that the disturbances in cytokines' production could not be the only reason for the so-called frustrated phagocytosis, connected with enhanced biofilm resistance.

One series was conducted using mechanical aeration (0.62 m(3) m(-2) h(-1)).

After 17 months of continuous operation at an HLR of 0.80 m(3) m(-2) d(-1), the removal efficiencies of the aerated biofilters were 92.0% biochemical oxygen demand, 79.7% chemical oxygen demand, 98.0% helminth eggs, 99.9% fecal coliforms and 91.9% total suspended solids. Statistical analysis showed that the chosen operational parameters significantly influenced the removal efficiencies of the biofilters. The effluent quality obtained under these conditions complied with the Mexican and US EPA standards for agricultural irrigation and green spaces, except for coliforms, which is why the effluents must be disinfected.

Using a comprehensive approach comprising of (15)N2 isotope labeling, acetylene reduction assay and nitrogenase gene expression analyses, we investigated nitrogen fixation in the sulfide-rich, chemoautotrophy-based Frasassi cave ecosystem (Italy). Nitrogen fixation was examined in three different microbial niches within the cave waters: (1) symbiotic bacterial community of Niphargus amphipods, (2) Beggiatoa-dominated biofilms, which occur at the sulfide-oxygen interface, and (3) sulfidic sediment. We found evidence for nitrogen fixation in all the three niches, and the nitrogenase gene (homologs of nifH) expression data clearly show niche differentiation of diazotrophic Proteobacteria within the water streams. The nifH transcript originated from the symbiotic community of Niphargus amphipods might belong to the Thiothrix ectosymbionts. Two abundantly expressed nifH genes in the Beggiatoa-dominated biofilms are closely related to those from Beggiatoa- and Desulfovibrio-related bacteria. These two diazotrophs were consistently found in Beggiatoa-dominated biofilms collected at various time points, thus illustrating species-specific associations of the diazotrophs in biofilm formation, and micron-scale niche partitioning of sulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria driven by steep redox gradients within the biofilm. Finally, putative heterotrophs (Geobacter, Azoarcus and Desulfovibrio related) were the active diazotrophs in the sulfidic sediment. Our study is the first to shed light on nitrogen fixation in permanently dark caves and suggests that diazotrophy may be widespread in chemosynthetic communities.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, such social behaviors are affected greatly by the environment. Although P. aeruginosa survive under anaerobic conditions, previous studies indicate that quorum sensing is attenuated under such conditions, and that this leads to decreased activity of extracellular virulence factors as compared to aerobic conditions. Hence it has come into question whether P. aeruginosa are virulent under anaerobic conditions. Here, we compared various phenotypes between PAO1 and clinical isolates under anaerobic conditions. Our data revealed that when grown anaerobically, growth and cell morphology greatly differed among the strains. One of the clinical isolates produced comparable amounts of quorum-sensing signaling molecules and extracellular virulence factors under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, while the other strains showed low production under anaerobic conditions. Biofilm formation also exhibited strain-dependent variations, suggesting that there are several mechanisms that lead to biofilm formation under anaerobic conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that the impact of anaerobiosis on the social interactions of P. aeruginosa is strain dependent, and suggest that multiple regulatory mechanisms are involved in the regulation of quorum sensing and biofilm formation under anaerobic conditions.

Despite the significance of bacterial biofilms, the mechanism of biofilm formation and associated drug tolerance is still not fully understood. A major challenge in biofilm research is the intrinsic heterogeneity in the biofilm structure, which leads to temporal and spatial variation in cell density and gene expression. To understand and control such structural heterogeneity, surfaces with patterned functional alkanthiols were used in this study to obtain Escherichia coli cell clusters with systematically varied cluster size and distance between clusters. The results from quantitative imaging analysis revealed an interesting phenomenon in which multicellular connections can be formed between cell clusters depending on the size of interacting clusters and the distance between them. In addition, significant differences in patterned biofilm formation were observed between wild-type E. coli RP437 and some of its isogenic mutants, indicating that certain cellular and genetic factors are involved in interactions among cell clusters. In particular, autoinducer-2-mediated quorum sensing was found to be important. Collectively, these results provide missing information that links cell-to-cell signaling and interaction among cell clusters to the structural organization of bacterial biofilms.

In seawater with added microalgae and maintained under turbot larvae rearing conditions, the probiofilter reduced the total Vibrionaceae count and the concentration of V. anguillarum, which was undetectable after 144 h by real-time PCR. The probiofilter also improved the survival of larvae challenged with V. anguillarum, showing an accumulated mortality similar to that of uninfected larvae (35-40 %) and significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that of infected larvae with no probiofilter (76 %) due to a decrease in the pathogen concentration and in total Vibrionaceae.

One such peptide, GL13NH2 (PSP residues 141 to 153) was shown previously to interfere with LPS binding and agglutinate bacteria without bactericidal activity. By introducing three additional positively charged lysine residues, the peptide was converted to the novel bactericidal cationic peptide GL13K (MIC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 8 μg/ml [5.6 μM]). We investigated the antibiofilm activity of GL13K against static, monospecies biofilms of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Two-hour exposure of a 24-h biofilm to 64 μg/ml (44.8 μM) GL13K reduced biofilm bacteria by 10(2), and 100 μg/ml (70 μM) GL13K reduced bacteria by 10(3). Similar results could be achieved on 48-h-old biofilms. Lower concentrations of GL13K (32 μg/ml [22.4 μM]) were successful in reducing biofilm cell numbers in combination with tobramycin. This combination treatment also achieved total eradication of the biofilm in a majority (67.5%) of tested samples. An alanine scan of GL13K revealed the importance of the leucine residue in position six of the peptide sequence, where replacement led to a loss of antibiofilm activity, whereas the impact of replacing charged residues was less pronounced. Bacterial metalloproteases were found to partially inactivate GL13K but not a d amino acid version of the peptide.

Thanatin is reported to display potent antibiotic activities, especially against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The present study aimed to investigate whether a shorter derivative peptide (R-thanatin) could be used as a novel antibacterial agent. We found that R-thanatin was highly potent in vitro against coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. hominis, and inhibited biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. Properties of little toxicity to human red blood cells (hRBCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, a low incidence of resistance, and relatively high stability in plasma were confirmed. Excellent in vivo protective effects were also observed using a methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE)-induced urinary tract infection rat model. Electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analyses suggested that R-thanatin disturbed cell division of MRSE severely, which might be the reason for inhibition of MRSE growth. These findings indicate that R-thanatin is active against the growth and biofilm formation of MRSE in vitro and in vivo.

A common resident of the human microbiome, C. albicans responds to environmental signals, such as cell contact with catheter materials and exposure to serum or CO2, by triggering the expression of a variety of traits, some of which are known to contribute to its pathogenic lifestyle. Such traits include adhesion, biofilm formation, filamentation, white-to-opaque (W-O) switching, and two recently described phenotypes, finger and tentacle formation. Under distinct sets of environmental conditions and in specific cell types (mating type-like a [MTLa]/alpha cells, MTL homozygotes, or daughter cells), C. albicans utilizes (or reutilizes) a single signal transduction pathway-the Ras pathway-to affect these phenotypes. Ras1, Cyr1, Tpk2, and Pde2, the proteins of the Ras signaling pathway, are the only nontranscriptional regulatory proteins that are known to be essential for regulating all of these processes. How does C. albicans utilize this one pathway to regulate all of these phenotypes? The regulation of distinct and yet related processes by a single, evolutionarily conserved pathway is accomplished through the use of downstream transcription factors that are active under specific environmental conditions and in different cell types.

We have identified specific optimal filament-inducing conditions for three NACS (C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. guilliermondii), which are very limited, suggesting that these species may be adapted for niche-specific filamentation in the host. Only a subset of evolutionarily conserved C. albicans filament-specific target genes were induced upon filamentation in C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. guilliermondii. One of the genes showing conserved expression was UME6, a key filament-specific regulator of C. albicans hyphal development. Constitutive high-level expression of UME6 was sufficient to drive increased filamentation as well as biofilm formation and partly restore conserved filament-specific gene expression in both C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis, suggesting that evolutionary differences in filamentation ability among pathogenic Candida species may be partially attributed to alterations in the expression level of a conserved filamentous growth machinery. In contrast to UME6, NRG1, an important repressor of C. albicans filamentation, showed only a partly conserved role in controlling NACS filamentation. Overall, our results suggest that C. albicans morphological regulatory functions are partially conserved in NACS and have evolved to respond to more specific sets of host environmental cues.

However, incorporation of EbpA into the pilus fiber only required its sortase recognition motif (LPXTG), while incorporation of EbpB only required its pilin-like motif. Only the sortase recognition motif would be required for incorporation of the pilus tip subunit, while incorporation of the base subunit would only require the pilin recognition motif. Thus, these data support a model with EbpA at the tip and EbpB at the base of an EbpC polymer. In addition, the housekeeping sortase, SrtA, was found to process EbpB and its predicted catalytic Cys residue was required for efficient cell wall anchoring of mature Ebp pili. Thus, we have defined molecular interactions involved in fiber polymerization, minor subunit organization, and pilus subcellular compartmentalization in the E. faecalis Ebp pilus system. These studies advance our understanding of unique molecular mechanisms of sortase-assembled pilus biogenesis.

The gentamicin-loaded MCHMs display the sustained drug release property, and the controlled release of gentamicin can minimize significantly bacterial adhesion and prevent biofilm formation against S. epidermidis. The biocompatibility tests by using human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) as cell models indicate that the gentamicin-loaded MCHMs have as excellent biocompatibility as the HAPs, and the dose of the released gentamicin from the MCHMs has no toxic effects on the hBMSCs.

Phenotypic analysis by transmission electron microscopy proved the essentiality of mtp for piliation in M. tuberculosis.

Furthermore, we examined mtp gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR in wild-type cells grown under biofilm versus planktonic growth conditions.

Here we investigated the effects of prior granular activated carbon (GAC) biofiltration [GAC-filtered water, unfiltered water, and a blend (30% GAC filtered and 70% unfiltered water)] and disinfectant type (chlorine, chloramine) on opportunistic pathogen occurrence using five annular reactors (ARs) to simulate water distribution systems, particularly premise plumbing. GAC pre-treatment effectively reduced total organic carbon (TOC), resulting in three levels of influent TOC investigated. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) provided molecular evidence of natural colonization of Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Acanthamoeba spp., Hartmannella vermiformis and Mycobacterium avium on AR coupons. Cultivable mycobacteria and amoeba, including pathogenic species, were also found in bulk water and biofilm samples. While q-PCR tends to overestimate live cells, it provided a quantitative comparison of target organisms colonizing the AR biofilms in terms of gene copy numbers. In most cases, total bacteria and opportunistic pathogens were higher in the three undisinfected ARs, but the levels were not proportional to the level of GAC pre-treatment/TOC. Chlorine was more effective for controlling mycobacteria and Acanthamoeba, whereas chloramine was more effective for controlling Legionella. Both chlorine and chloramine effectively inhibited M. avium and H. vermiformis colonization.

Salivary α-amylase is present in both monomeric and dimeric forms and we found that formation of the dimer depends on copper ions. The F. nucleatum adhered to both monomeric and dimeric salivary α-amylases, but the numbers of bacteria bound to the dimeric form were more than those bound to the monomeric form. The degree of adherence of F. nucleatum to four α-amylases from different sources was almost the same, however its binding to β-amylase was considerably decreased. Among four α-amylase inhibitors tested, acarbose and type 1 and 3 inhibitors derived from wheat flour showed significant activity against the adhesion of F.nucleatum to monomeric and dimeric amylases, however voglibose had little effect. Moreover F. nucleatum cells inhibited the enzymatic activity of salivary α-amylase in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that F. nucleatum plays more important and positive role as an early colonizer for maturation of oral microbial colonization.","authors":[{"name":"M Zulfiqar"},{"name":"T Yamaguchi"},{"name":"S Sato"},{"name":"T Oho"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anaerobes"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"oral microbiology"},{"word":"peridontal disease"}]},"article153":{"pmid":"23906317","title":"The effect of metal microstructure on the initial attachment of Escherichia coli to 1010 carbon steel.","date":"2013-09-03","abs":"Metallurgical features have been shown to play an important role in the attachment of microorganisms to metal surfaces.

Multi-drug resistance in these pathogens augments the complexity and severity of the diseases. Various studies have shown the role of biofilms in multi-drug resistance, where the pathogen resides inside a protective coat made of extracellular polymeric substances. Since biofilms directly influence the virulence and pathogenicity of a pathogen, it is optimal to employ a strategy that effectively inhibits the formation of biofilm. Pomegranate is a common food and is also used traditionally to treat various ailments. This study assessed the anti-biofilm activity of a methanolic extract of pomegranate against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Methanolic extract of pomegranate was shown to inhibit the formation of biofilms by Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. Apart from inhibiting the formation of biofilm, pomegranate extract disrupted pre-formed biofilms and inhibited germ tube formation, a virulence trait, in C. albicans. Characterization of the methanolic extract of pomegranate revealed the presence of ellagic acid (2,3,7,8-tetrahydroxy-chromeno[5,4,3-cde]chromene-5,10-dione) as the major component. Ellagic acid is a bioactive tannin known for its antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. Further studies revealed the ability of ellagic acid to inhibit the growth of all species in suspension at higher concentrations (>75 μg ml(-1)) and biofilm formation at lower concentrations (<40 μg ml(-1)) which warrants further investigation of the potential of ellagic acid or peel powders of pomegranate for the treatment of human ailments.

Biofilm formation is a key factor in the growth and transport of both beneficial and harmful bacteria. While much is known about the later stages of biofilm formation, less is known about its initiation which is an important first step in the biofilm formation. In this paper, we develop a non-linear system of partial differential equations of Keller-Segel type model in one-dimensional space, which couples the dynamics of bacterial movement to that of the sensing molecules. In this case, bacteria perform a biased random walk towards the sensing molecules. We derive the boundary conditions of the adhesion of bacteria to a surface using zero-Dirichlet boundary conditions, while the equation describing sensing molecules at the interface needed particular conditions to be set. The numerical results show the profile of bacteria within the space and the time evolution of the density within the free-space and on the surface. Testing different parameter values indicate that significant amount of sensing molecules present on the surface leads to a faster bacterial movement toward the surface which is the first step of biofilm initiation. Our work gives rise to results that agree with the biological description of the early stages of biofilm formation.

New technologies for decreasing water and energy consumption of cleaning systems are desired. Ultrasound can be used for cleaning a wide range of materials. Most commonly, baths containing fairly large amounts of water are used. One possibility to reduce water consumption is to use ultrasonic cavitation in a thin water film on a flat surface, like a conveyor belt. In order to test this possibility, a model system was set up, consisting of an ultrasound transducer/probe with a 70-mm-diameter flat bottom, operating at 19.8 kHz, and contaminated conveyor belt materials in the form of coupons covered with a thin layer of water or water with detergent. Ultrasound was then applied on the water surface at different power levels (from 46 to 260 W), exposure times (10 and 20 s), and distances (2 to 20 mm). The model was used to test two different belt materials with various contamination types, such as biofilms formed by bacteria in carbohydrate- or protein-fat-based soils, dried microorganisms (bacteria, yeasts, and mold spores), and allergens. Ultrasound treatment increased the reduction of bacteria and yeast by 1 to 2 log CFU under the most favorable conditions compared with water or water-detergent controls. The effect was dependent on the type of belt material, the power applied, the exposure time, and the distance between the probe and the belt coupon. Generally, dried microorganisms were more easily removed than biofilms. The effect on mold spores was variable and appeared to be species and material dependent. Spiked allergens were also efficiently removed by using ultrasound. The results in this study pave the way for new cleaning designs for flat conveyor belts, with possibilities for savings of water, detergent, and energy consumption.

With this review, the authors aim to provide an update on the current understanding of the role of P. acnes in the development of acne lesions and analysing the potential implications for future treatments. A total of 188 articles published between January 1980 and March 2013 were searched using key words such as acne, P. acnes, microbiology, Corynebacterium acnes, acne vulgaris, pathogenesis, antibiotic, vaccination and a combination of those key words. From those articles, 77 were analysed in depth. Recent data confirm that P. acnes has a strong proinflammatory activity and targets molecules involved in the innate cutaneous immunity, keratinocytes and sebaceous glands of the pilosebaceous follicle and leads to the development of comedones. Furthermore, the profile of its different strains may differ between healthy subjects and acne patients. The better understanding of the role of P. acnes may allow for new perspectives in the treatment of acne. Novel therapies should target molecules implicated in the activation of innate immunity, including toll-like receptors, protease-activated receptors and topical antimicrobial peptides; the latter may be an alternative to topical antibiotics and thus a solution for limiting bacterial resistance induced by topical macrolides. Vaccines may also be promising. However, the most appropriate candidate remains to be selected.

Accumulation of Se0 within biofilms occurred over a three-week interval at a rate of c. 9 mg Se0 m(-2) tubing day(-1). Removal was inferred to result from the activity of a mixed microbial community within the biofilms capable of coupling acetate oxidation to the reduction of oxygen, nitrate and selenate. Phylogenetic analysis of the biofilm revealed a community dominated by strains of Dechloromonas sp. and Thauera sp., with isolates exhibiting genetic similarity to the latter known to reduce selenate to Se0. Enrichment cultures of selenate-respiring microorganisms were readily established using Rifle site groundwater and acetate, with cultures dominated by strains closely related to D. aromatica (96-99% similarity).

Bacillus subtilis is a ubiquitous Gram-positive soil bacterium that functions as an effective plant growth-promoting agent. The biofilm matrix is composed of an exopolysaccharide and an amyloid fiber-forming protein, TasA, and assembles with the aid of a small secreted protein, BslA. Here we show that natively synthesized and secreted BslA forms surface layers around the biofilm. Biophysical analysis demonstrates that BslA can self-assemble at interfaces, forming an elastic film. Molecular function is revealed from analysis of the crystal structure of BslA, which consists of an Ig-type fold with the addition of an unusual, extremely hydrophobic cap region. A combination of in vivo biofilm formation and in vitro biophysical analysis demonstrates that the central hydrophobic residues of the cap are essential to allow a hydrophobic, nonwetting biofilm to form as they control the surface activity of the BslA protein. The hydrophobic cap exhibits physiochemical properties remarkably similar to the hydrophobic surface found in fungal hydrophobins; thus, BslA is a structurally defined bacterial hydrophobin. We suggest that biofilms formed by other species of bacteria may have evolved similar mechanisms to provide protection to the resident bacterial community.

In this study, we aimed to identify the DA-associated adhesin of the 1551-2 eae mutant. Electron microscopy of 1551-2 identified rigid rod-like pili composed of an 18-kDa protein, which was identified as the major pilin subunit of type 1 pilus (T1P) by mass spectrometry analysis. Deletion of fimA in 1551-2 affected biofilm formation but had no effect on adherence properties. Analysis of secreted proteins in supernatants of this strain identified a 150-kDa protein corresponding to SslE, a type 2 secreted protein that was recently reported to be involved in biofilm formation of rabbit and human EPEC strains. However, neither adherence nor biofilm formation was affected in a 1551-2 sslE mutant. We then investigated the role of the EspA filament associated with the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) in DA by generating a double eae espA mutant. This strain was no longer adherent, strongly suggesting that the T3SS translocon is the DA adhesin. In agreement with these results, specific anti-EspA antibodies blocked adherence of the 1551-2 eae mutant. Our data support a role for intimin in LA, for the T3SS translocon in DA, and for T1P in biofilm formation, all of which may act in concert to facilitate host intestinal colonization by aEPEC strains.

In the present study, the functions of quorum sensing in the pathogenesis of Vibrio vulnificus, a food-borne pathogen, were assessed by evaluating the virulence of a mutant deficient in SmcR, a quorum-sensing regulator and homologue of LuxR. When biofilms were used as an inoculum, the smcR mutant was impaired in virulence and colonization capacity in the infection of mice. The lack of SmcR also resulted in decreased histopathological damage in mouse jejunum tissue. These results indicated that SmcR is essential for V. vulnificus pathogenesis. Moreover, the smcR mutant exhibited significantly reduced biofilm detachment. Upon exposure to INT-407 host cells, the wild type, but not the smcR mutant, revealed accelerated biofilm detachment. The INT-407 cells increased smcR expression by activating the expression of LuxS, an autoinducer-2 synthase, indicating that host cells manipulate the cellular level of SmcR through the quorum-sensing signaling of V. vulnificus. A whole-genome microarray analysis revealed that the genes primarily involved in biofilm detachment and formation are up- and downregulated by SmcR, respectively. Among the SmcR-regulated genes, vvpE encoding an elastolytic protease was the most upregulated, and the purified VvpE appeared to dissolve established biofilms directly in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. These results suggest that the host cell-induced SmcR enhances the detachment of V. vulnificus biofilms entering the host intestine and thereby may promote the dispersal of the pathogen to new colonization loci, which is crucial for pathogenesis.

In vivo studies in our laboratory have shown that Salmonella can form biofilms on the surfaces of cholesterol gallstones in the gallbladders of mice and human carriers. Biofilm formation on gallstones has been demonstrated to be a mechanism of persistence. The purpose of this work was to identify and evaluate Salmonella sp. cholesterol-dependent biofilm factors. Differential gene expression analysis between biofilms on glass or cholesterol-coated surfaces and subsequent quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that type 1 fimbria structural genes and a gene encoding a putative outer membrane protein (ycfR) were specifically upregulated in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium biofilms grown on cholesterol-coated surfaces. Spatiotemporal expression of ycfR and FimA verified their regulation during biofilm development on cholesterol-coated surfaces. Surprisingly, confocal and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that a mutant of type 1 fimbria structural genes (ΔfimAICDHF) and a ycfR mutant showed increased biofilm formation on cholesterol-coated surfaces. In vivo experiments using Nramp1(+/+) mice harboring gallstones showed that only the ΔycfR mutant formed extensive biofilms on mouse gallstones at 7 and 21 days postinfection; ΔfimAICDHF was not observed on gallstone surfaces after the 7-day-postinfection time point. These data suggest that in Salmonella spp., wild-type type 1 fimbriae are important for attachment to and/or persistence on gallstones at later points of chronic infection, whereas YcfR may represent a specific potential natural inhibitor of initial biofilm formation on gallstones.

To study polymicrobial interactions with gingival epithelial cells, the oral commensal Fusobacterium nucleatum and the periodontal pathogen Treponema denticola were chosen due to their opposing effects on the expression of human beta-defensins (HBDs) and interleukin (IL)-8 in gingival epithelial cells. Immortalized gingival epithelial HOK-16B cells were infected with either F. nucleatum or T. denticola alone or together, and the expression of HBDs and IL-8 was investigated. Coinfection with F. nucleatum and T. denticola neutralized the stimulatory and suppressive effects on the expression of HBD-2 and -3, but the suppressive effect of T. denticola on IL-8 expression remained. In CHO/CD14/TLR2 reporter cells, T. denticola attenuated F. nucleatum-induced activation of TLR2, a receptor that mediates HBD induction. Although F. nucleatum facilitated the invasion of T. denticola into host cells, T. denticola interfered with the fusion of internalized F. nucleatum with lysosomes, which may avert TLR9-dependent IL-8 induction. Furthermore, T. denticola suppressed the F. nucleatum-stimulated accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group of essential signaling molecules for the TLR2 and TLR9 pathways. The elimination of ROS using N-acetyl cysteine completely blocked the inductions of HBD-3 and IL-8 and significantly reduced HBD-2 induction by F. nucleatum, confirming the importance of ROS in the host response. In sum, T. denticola incapacitates the F. nucleatum-induced expression of HBDs and IL-8 in gingival epithelial cells by interrupting endo-lysosomal maturation and ROS-dependent TLR activation.

The non-linear reactive transport equations were numerically solved using the symmetric sequential iterative scheme of the operator-splitting method. The transport and kinetic reaction modules in the developed model were separately verified, and the results were reasonably acceptable. From the sensitivity analysis, the uranium transport was generally more sensitive to the sorption rate rather than desorption rate of U(VI). Considering a uranium reduction reaction, bacteria could considerably retard the uranium transport no matter the uranium sorption/desorption rates. As the affinity of U(VI) onto the bacteria becomes higher than that onto a rock fracture surface, a biofilm effect, rather than a colloidal effect, of the bacteria becomes more influential on the uranium transport.

A high antimicrobial efficacy on biofilms of both plasma sources in comparison to CHX treatment was shown. The efficacy differs between the used strains and plasma sources. For illustration, the biofilms were examined under a scanning electron microscope before and after treatment. Additionally, cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay with L929 mouse fibroblast cell line. The cell toxicity of the used plasma limits its applicability on human tissue to maximally 150 s. The emitted UV irradiance was measured to estimate whether UV could limit the application on human tissue at the given parameters. It was found that the UV emission is negligibly low.

Biofilms are difficult to eradicate by the host immune system, even with antibiotics, and have been the number one cause of biomaterial implant and device failure for decades. Therefore, it is important to understand how immune cells interact with adhering pathogens. This study firstly aims to develop a simple method to quantify phagocytosis of six different strains of staphylococci adhering on a surface with phase-contrast-microscopy. Phagocytosis of adhering staphylococci to a glass surface by phagocytes was quantified in a parallel plate flow chamber, and expressed as a phagocytosis rate, accounting for the number of adhering staphylococci initially present and for the duration of phagocytosis. Murine macrophages were more effective in clearing staphylococci from a surface than human phagocytes, which require differentiation from their monocyte or promyelocytic state during an experiment. Direct visualization of internalization of a GFP-modified S. aureus strain inside phagocytes confirmed the validity of the method proposed. As a second aim, the differences in phagocytosis rates observed were investigated on a surface thermodynamic basis using measured contact angles of liquids on macroscopic lawns of staphylococci and phagocytes, confirming that phagocytosis of adhering pathogens can be regarded as a surface phenomenon. In addition, surface thermodynamics revealed that phagocytosis of adhering pathogens is determined by an interplay of physical attraction between pathogens and phagocytes and the influence of chemo-attractants. For future studies, these results will help to place in vitro experiments and murine infection models in better perspective with respect to human ones.

We operated MXCs containing either monocultures or defined cocultures of previously enriched phototrophic Chlorobium and anode-respiring Geobacter under anaerobic conditions in the absence of electron donor. Monoculture control MXCs containing Geobacter or Chlorobium neither responded to light nor produced current, respectively. Instead, light-responsive current generation occurred only in coculture MXCs. Current increased above background levels only in the dark and declined slowly over 96 h. This pattern suggested that Chlorobium exhausted intracellular glycogen reserves via dark fermentation to supply an electron donor, presumably acetate, to Geobacter. With medium containing sulfide as the sole photosynthetic electron donor, current generation had a similar and reproducible negative light response. To investigate whether this metabolic interaction also occurred without an electrode, we performed coculture experiments in batch serum bottles. In this setup, sulfide served as the sole electron donor, whose oxidation by Chlorobium was required to provide S(0) as the electron acceptor to Geobacter. Copies of Geobacter 16S rDNA increased approximately 14-fold in batch bottle cocultures containing sulfide compared to those lacking sulfide, and did not decline after termination of sulfide feeding. These results suggest that products of both photosynthesis and dark fermentation by Chlorobium were sufficient both to yield an electrochemical response by Geobacter biofilms, and to promote Geobacter growthin batch cocultures. Our work expands upon the fusion of MXCs with coculture techniques and reinforces the utility of microbial electrochemistry for sensitive, real-time monitoring of microbial interactions in which a metabolic intermediate can be converted to electrical current.","authors":[{"name":"Jonathan P Badalamenti"},{"name":"César I Torres"},{"name":"Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown"}],"keywords":[{"word":"coculture"},{"word":"fermentation"},{"word":"glycogen"},{"word":"microbial electrochemical cell"},{"word":"photosynthesis"}]},"article194":{"pmid":"23893487","title":"Adaptation of the osmotolerant yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii to an osmotic environment through copy number amplification of FLO11D.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to the adaptation process in two possible ways. First, they may have a direct role, in which a certain number of copies often provide a selective advantage. Second, CNVs can also indirectly contribute to adaptation because a higher copy number increases the so-called mutational target size. In this study, we show that the copy number amplification of FLO11D in the osmotolerant yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii promotes its further adaptation to a flor-formative environment, such as osmostress static culture conditions. We demonstrate that a gene, which was identified as FLO11D, is responsible for flor formation and that its expression is induced by osmostress under glucose-free conditions, which confer unique characteristics to Z. rouxii, such as osmostress-dependent flor formation. This organism possesses zero to three copies of FLO11D, and it appears likely that the FLO11D copy number increased in a branch of the Z. rouxii tree. The cellular hydrophobicity correlates with the FLO11D copy number, and the strain with a higher copy number of FLO11D exhibits a fitness advantage compared to a reference strain under osmostress static culture conditions. Our data indicate that the FLO gene-related system in Z. rouxii has evolved remarkably to adapt to osmostress environments.

The persistence of this bacterium in food processing environments is mainly attributed to its ability to form biofilms. The search for proteins associated with biofilm formation is an issue of great interest, with most studies targeting the whole bacterial proteome. Nevertheless, exoproteins constitute an important class of molecules participating in various physiological processes, such as cell signaling, pathogenesis, and matrix remodeling. The aim of this work was to quantify differences in protein abundance between exoproteomes from a biofilm and from the planktonic state. For this, two field strains previously evaluated to be good biofilm producers (3119 and J311) were used, and a procedure for the recovery of biofilm exoproteins was optimized. Proteins were resolved by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and identified by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. One of the proteins identified in higher abundance in the biofilm exoproteomes of both strains was the putative cell wall binding protein Lmo2504. A mutant strain with deletion of the gene for Lmo2504 was produced (3119Δlmo2504), and its biofilm-forming ability was compared to that of the wild type using the crystal violet and the ruthenium red assays as well as scanning electron microscopy. The results confirmed the involvement of Lmo2504 in biofilm formation, as strain 3119Δlmo2504 showed a significantly (P < 0.05) lower biofilm-forming ability than the wild type. The identification of additional exoproteins associated with biofilm formation may lead to new strategies for controlling this pathogen in food processing facilities.

To understand the dynamic interplay between and within these populations, quantitative measurements and statistical analysis of their localization patterns within the biofilms are necessary, and adequate automated tools for such analyses are needed. We have designed and applied new methods for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and digital image analysis of directionally dependent (anisotropic) multispecies biofilms. A sequential-FISH approach allowed multiple populations to be detected in a biofilm sample. This was combined with an automated tool for vertical-distribution analysis by generating in silico biofilm slices and the recently developed Inflate algorithm for coaggregation analysis of microbial populations in anisotropic biofilms. As a proof of principle, we show distinct stratification patterns of the ammonia oxidizers Nitrosomonas oligotropha subclusters I and II and the nitrite oxidizer Nitrospira sublineage I in three different types of wastewater biofilms, suggesting niche differentiation between the N. oligotropha subclusters, which could explain their coexistence in the same biofilms. Coaggregation analysis showed that N. oligotropha subcluster II aggregated closer to Nitrospira than did N. oligotropha subcluster I in a pilot plant nitrifying trickling filter (NTF) and a moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR), but not in a full-scale NTF, indicating important ecophysiological differences between these phylogenetically closely related subclusters.

The formation of biofilm, also called velum, depends on FLO11 gene length and expression. FLO11 encodes a cell wall mucin-like glycoprotein with a highly O-glycosylated central domain and an N-terminal domain that mediates homotypic adhesion between cells. In the present study, we tested previously known antimicrobial peptides with different mechanisms of antimicrobial action for their effect on the viability and ability to form biofilm of S. cerevisiae flor strains. We found that PAF26, a synthetic tryptophan-rich cationic hexapeptide that belongs to the class of antimicrobial peptides with cell-penetrating properties, but not other antimicrobial peptides, enhanced biofilm formation without affecting cell viability in ethanol-rich medium. The PAF26 biofilm enhancement required a functional FLO11 but was not accompanied by increased FLO11 expression. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analyses showed that the PAF26 peptide binds flor yeast cells and that a flo11 gene knockout mutant lost the ability to bind PAF26 but not P113, a different cell-penetrating antifungal peptide, demonstrating that the FLO11 gene is selectively involved in the interaction of PAF26 with cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the cationic and hydrophobic PAF26 hexapeptide interacts with the hydrophobic and negatively charged cell wall, favoring Flo11p-mediated cell-to-cell adhesion and thus increasing biofilm biomass formation. The results are consistent with previous data that point to glycosylated mucin-like proteins at the fungal cell wall as potential interacting partners for antifungal peptides.

Therefore, alternative approaches that are capable of killing pathogens are needed to supplement standard treatment modalities. One alternative is the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (PIB). The lethal effect of PIB is based on the principle that visible light activates a photosensitizer, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species, e.g., singlet oxygen, which induces phototoxicity immediately during illumination. SAPYR is a new generation of photosensitizers. Based on a 7-perinaphthenone structure, it shows a singlet oxygen quantum yield ΦΔ of 99% and is water soluble and photostable. Moreover, it contains a positive charge for good adherence to cell walls of pathogens. In this study, the PIB properties of SAPYR were investigated against monospecies and polyspecies biofilms formed in vitro by oral key pathogens. SAPYR showed a dual mechanism of action against biofilms: (I) it disrupts the structure of the biofilm even without illumination; (II) when irradiated, it inactivates bacteria in a polymicrobial biofilm after one single treatment with an efficacy of ≥ 99.99%. These results encourage further investigation on the potential of PIB using SAPYR for the treatment of localized infectious diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Fabian Cieplik"},{"name":"Andreas Späth"},{"name":"Johannes Regensburger"},{"name":"Anita Gollmer"},{"name":"Laura Tabenski"},{"name":"Karl-Anton Hiller"},{"name":"Wolfgang Bäumler"},{"name":"Tim Maisch"},{"name":"Gottfried Schmalz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"(1)O(2)"},{"word":"5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridino)-porphyrin tetra-(p-toluenesulfonate)"},{"word":"7-perinaphthenone, phenalen-1-one"},{"word":"AN"},{"word":"Actinomyces naeslundii"},{"word":"BA"},{"word":"Blood agar"},{"word":"CFU"},{"word":"CS"},{"word":"Colony-forming units"},{"word":"Complete saliva medium"},{"word":"Con A"},{"word":"Concanavalin A"},{"word":"EF"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substance"},{"word":"FN"},{"word":"Fusobacterium nucleatum"},{"word":"H(2)O(2)"},{"word":"HO"},{"word":"Hydrogen peroxide"},{"word":"Hydroxyl radical"},{"word":"ICG"},{"word":"Indocyanine green"},{"word":"MHA"},{"word":"Mueller-Hinton-agar"},{"word":"O(2)(−)"},{"word":"OD"},{"word":"Optical density"},{"word":"PBS"},{"word":"PIB"},{"word":"PN"},{"word":"PNS"},{"word":"PS"},{"word":"Perinaphthenone"},{"word":"Perinaphthenone-2-sulfonic acid, phenalen-1-one-2-sulfonic acid"},{"word":"Phosphate-buffered saline"},{"word":"Photodynamic"},{"word":"Photodynamic inactivation of bacteria"},{"word":"Photosensitizer"},{"word":"Polymicrobial biofilm"},{"word":"ROS"},{"word":"Reactive oxygen species"},{"word":"Singlet oxygen"},{"word":"Singlet oxygen quantum yield"},{"word":"TMPyP"},{"word":"superoxide ion"},{"word":"Φ(Δ)"}]},"article212":{"pmid":"23891584","title":"Concepts in disinfection of bacterial populations.","date":"2013-09-17","abs":"Bacteria are responsible for a range of human diseases that are difficult to clear for a variety of reasons.

Confocal microscopic observations showed that the most effective reagent to reduce P. gingivalis accumulation onto an S. gordonii substratum was erythritol, as compared with xylitol and sorbitol. In addition, erythritol moderately suppressed S. gordonii monotypic biofilm formation. To examine the inhibitory effects of erythritol, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of erythritol-treated P. gingivalis and S. gordonii cells. Metabolome analyses using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed that a number of nucleic intermediates and constituents of the extracellular matrix, such as nucleotide sugars, were decreased by erythritol in a dose-dependent manner. Next, comparative analyses of metabolites of erythritol- and sorbitol-treated cells were performed using both organisms to determine the erythritol-specific effects. In P. gingivalis, all detected dipeptides, including Glu-Glu, Ser-Glu, Tyr-Glu, Ala-Ala and Thr-Asp, were significantly decreased by erythritol, whereas they tended to be increased by sorbitol. Meanwhile, sorbitol promoted trehalose 6-phosphate accumulation in S. gordonii cells. These results suggest that erythritol has inhibitory effects on dual species biofilm development via several pathways, including suppression of growth resulting from DNA and RNA depletion, attenuated extracellular matrix production, and alterations of dipeptide acquisition and amino acid metabolism.","authors":[{"name":"E Hashino"},{"name":"M Kuboniwa"},{"name":"S A Alghamdi"},{"name":"M Yamaguchi"},{"name":"R Yamamoto"},{"name":"H Cho"},{"name":"A Amano"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Porphyromonas"},{"word":"Streptococcus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry"},{"word":"metabolomics"},{"word":"sugar alcohols"}]},"article215":{"pmid":"23890016","title":"Spatial distributions of Pseudomonas fluorescens colony variants in mixed-culture biofilms.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The emergence of colony morphology variants in structured environments is being recognized as important to both niche specialization and stress tolerance.

Decline in microbialite abundance and diversity during the terminal Proterozoic and early Phanerozoic has historically been attributed to the concurrent radiation of complex metazoans. Similarly, the apparent resurgence of microbialites in the wake of Paleozoic and Mesozoic mass extinctions is frequently linked to drastic declines in metazoan diversity and abundance. However, it has become increasing clear that microbialites are relatively common in certain modern shallow, normal marine carbonate environments-foremost the Bahamas. For the first time, we present data, collected from the Exuma Cays, the Bahamas, systematically characterizing the relationship between framework-building cyanobacteria, microbialite fabrics, and microbialite-associated metazoan abundance and diversity. We document the coexistence of diverse microbialite and infaunal metazoan communities and demonstrate that the predominant control upon both microbialite fabric and metazoan community structure is microbial mat type. These findings necessitate that we rethink prevalent interpretations of microbialite-metazoan interactions and imply that microbialites are not passive recipients of metazoan-mediated alteration. Additionally, this work provides support for the theory that certain Precambrian microbialites may have been havens of early complex metazoan life, rather than bereft of metazoans, as has been traditionally envisaged.

Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive model for biofilm formation. The DegS-DegU two-component system controls several multicellular behaviours in B. subtilis, including biofilm formation. Here we identify the B. subtilis flagellum as a mechanosensor that activates the DegS-DegU regulatory pathway. Inhibition of flagellar rotation by deletion or mutation of the flagellar stator gene, motB, results in an increase in both degU transcription and DegU∼P driven processes, namely exoprotease production and poly-γ-dl-glutamic acid biosynthesis. Similarly, inhibition of flagellar rotation by engaging the flagellar clutch or by tethering the flagella with antibodies also promotes an increase in degU transcription that is reflective of increased DegU∼P levels in the cell. Collectively, these findings strongly indicate that inhibition of flagellar rotation acts as a mechanical trigger to activate the DegS-DegU two-component signal transduction system. We postulate that inhibition of flagellar rotation could function as a mechanical trigger to activate bacterial signal transduction cascades in many motile bacteria upon contact with a surface.

However, there is little information about the contribution of ST131 to different clinical syndromes or the basis for its impressive emergence and epidemic spread. To investigate this, we studied 953 E. coli isolates from women of reproductive age in the central west region of New South Wales, Australia, including 623 urinary isolates from patients with cystitis (cystitis isolates) (n = 322) or pyelonephritis (pyelonephritis isolates) (n = 301) and 330 fecal isolates from healthy controls. The characteristics studied included ST131 clonal group status, resistance to different antibiotics, presence of virulence factor (VF) genes, and biofilm production. As expected, fecal isolates differed significantly from urinary (cystitis and pyelonephritis) isolates in most of the studied characteristics. Antibiotic resistance was significantly more common in ST131 than in non-ST131 isolates. Both antibiotic resistance and ST131 were more common in pyelonephritis than cystitis isolates and least so among fecal isolates. Within each source group, individual VF genes were more prevalent and VF scores were higher for ST131 than for non-ST131 isolates. For ST131 only, the prevalences of most individual VF genes and VF scores were the lowest in the fecal isolates, higher in the cystitis isolates, and highest in the pyelonephritis isolates. Biofilm production was strongly associated with ST131 status and antibiotic resistance. These results clarify the distribution of the ST131 clonal group and its epidemiological associations in our region and suggest that it exhibits both enhanced virulence and increased antibiotic resistance compared with those of other urinary tract infection (UTI) and fecal E. coli isolates from women of reproductive age.

It is now established that some streptococci utilize Rgg-type proteins in concert with short hydrophobic peptides (SHPs) to mediate QS, and sequence analysis reveals that several streptococcal species contain highly homologous Rgg/SHP pairs. In group A streptococcus (GAS), two SHPs (SHP2 and SHP3 [SHP2/3]) were previously identified to be important in GAS biofilm formation. SHP2/3 are detected by two antagonistic regulators, Rgg2 and Rgg3, which control expression of the shp genes. In group B streptococcus (GBS), RovS is a known virulence gene regulator and ortholog of Rgg2, whereas no apparent Rgg3 homolog exists. Adjacent to rovS is a gene (shp1520) encoding a peptide nearly identical to SHP2. Using isogenic mutant strains and transcriptional reporters, we confirmed that RovS/SHP1520 comprise a QS circuit in GBS. More important, we performed experiments demonstrating that production and secretion of SHP1520 by GBS can modulate Rgg2/3-regulated gene expression in GAS in trans; likewise, SHP2/3 production by GAS can stimulate RovS-mediated gene regulation in GBS. An isolate of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis also produced a secreted factor capable of simulating the QS circuits of both GAS and GBS, and sequencing confirms the presence of an orthologous Rgg2/SHP2 pair in this species as well.

Purified XC_0250 was active in cyclic GMP synthesis in vitro. The linked gene XC_0249 encodes a protein with a cyclic mononucleotide-binding (cNMP) domain and a GGDEF diguanylate cyclase domain. The activity of XC_0249 in cyclic di-GMP synthesis was enhanced by addition of cyclic GMP. The isolated cNMP domain of XC_0249 bound cyclic GMP and a structure-function analysis, directed by determination of the crystal structure of the holo-complex, demonstrated the site of cyclic GMP binding that modulates cyclic di-GMP synthesis.

Biofilms can form reproducible physical structures (i.e. architecture) at the millimetre-scale, which are central to their functioning. However, the spatial dynamics of the clusters conferring physical structure to biofilms remains often elusive. By experimenting with complex microbial communities forming biofilms in contrasting hydrodynamic microenvironments in stream mesocosms, we show that morphogenesis results in 'ripple-like' and 'star-like' architectures--as they have also been reported from monospecies bacterial biofilms, for instance. To explore the potential contribution of demographic processes to these architectures, we propose a size-structured population model to simulate the dynamics of biofilm growth and cluster size distribution.

We also provide evidence that the catalytic activity of BcpA and extracellular DNA are required for the characteristic biofilm pillars to form. We show using a bcpA-gfp fusion that within the biofilm, expression of the CDI system-encoding genes is below the limit of detection for the majority of bacteria and only a subset of cells express the genes strongly at any given time. Analysis of a strain constitutively expressing the genes indicates that native expression is critical for biofilm architecture. Although CDI systems have so far only been demonstrated to be involved in interbacterial competition, constitutive production of the system's immunity protein in the entire bacterial population did not alter biofilm formation, indicating a CDI-independent role for BcpA in this process.

This study systematically characterizes the signaling dynamics of a cascade of RNA-protein interactions in the CsrA system, which regulates stress responses and biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. Noncoding RNAs are at the center of the CsrA system; target mRNAs are bound by CsrA proteins that inhibit their translation, CsrA proteins are sequestered by CsrB noncoding RNAs, and the degradation of CsrB RNAs is increased by CsrD proteins. Here, we show using in vivo experiments and quantitative modeling that the CsrA system integrates three strategies to achieve rapid and robust signaling. These strategies include: (i) the sequestration of stable proteins by noncoding RNAs, which rapidly inactivates protein activity; (ii) the degradation of stable noncoding RNAs, which enables their rapid removal; and (iii) a negative-feedback loop created by CsrA repression of CsrD production, which reduces the time for the system to achieve steady state. We also demonstrate that sequestration in the CsrA system results in signaling that is robust to growth rates because it does not rely on the slow dilution of molecules via cell division; therefore, signaling can occur even during growth arrest induced by starvation or antibiotic treatment.

Moreover, expression of the nirS gene was upregulated by 9.65-fold in wild-type swarming cells compared to planktonic cells. Wild-type swarming levels were substantially restored upon the exogenous addition of nitroxide containing compounds, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that NO is necessary for swarming motility.

In addition, a nirS transposon mutant was deficient in biofilm formation relative to the wild type and the complemented strain, thus implicating NO in the formation of biofilms. Intriguingly, despite its stand-alone action in inhibiting biofilm formation and promoting dispersal, a nitroxide partially restored the ability of a nirS mutant to form biofilms.

Gallium(III) is structurally similar to iron(III), except that it cannot be reduced under physiological conditions, therefore gallium has the potential to serve as an iron analog, and thus an anti-microbial. Because Ga(III) can bind to virtually any complex that binds Fe(III), simple gallium salts as well as more complex siderophores and hemes are potential carriers to deliver Ga(III) to the microbes. These gallium complexes represent a new class of anti-infectives that is different in mechanism of action from conventional antibiotics. Simple gallium salts such as gallium nitrate, maltolate, and simple gallium siderophore complexes such as gallium citrate have shown good antibacterial activities. The most studied complex has been gallium citrate, which exhibits broad activity against many Gram negative bacteria at ∼1-5μg/ml MICs, strong biofilm activity, low drug resistance, and efficacy in vivo. Using the structural features of specific siderophore and heme made by pathogenic bacteria and fungi, researchers have begun to evaluate new gallium complexes to target key pathogens. This review will summarize potential iron-acquisition system targets and recent research on gallium-based anti-infectives.

Bacteria from the dental plaque are responsible for the development of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, stomatitis and peri-implantitis. Certain metal nanoparticles have been suggested for infection control and the management of the oral biofilm. Here, it is shown that application of a silver nano-coating directly on dentine can successfully prevent the biofilm formation on dentine surfaces as well as inhibit bacterial growth in the surrounding media. This silver nano-coating was found to be stable (>98.8%) and to maintain its integrity in biological fluids. Its antibacterial activity was compared to silver nitrate and the widely used clinical antiseptic, chlorhexidine. The bacterial growth and cell viability were quantitatively assessed by measuring the turbidity, proportion of live and dead cells and lactate production. All three bioassays showed that silver nanoparticles and silver nitrate dentine coatings were equally highly bactericidal (>99.5%), while inhibiting bacterial adhesion. However, the latter caused significant dentine discolouration (ΔE* = 50.3). The chlorhexidine coating showed no antibacterial effect. Thus, silver nanoparticles may be a viable alternative to both chlorhexidine and silver nitrate, protecting from dental plaque and secondary caries when applied as a dentine coating, while they may provide the platform for creating anti-biofilm surfaces in medical devices and other biomedical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Besinis"},{"name":"Tracy De Peralta"},{"name":"Richard D Handy"}],"keywords":[]},"article268":{"pmid":"23874964","title":"The synthetic amphipathic peptidomimetic LTX109 is a potent fungicide that disturbs plasma membrane integrity in a sphingolipid dependent manner.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The peptidomimetic LTX109 (arginine-tertbutyl tryptophan-arginine-phenylethan) was previously shown to have antibacterial properties.

LTX109 had similar killing kinetics to the membrane-permeabilizing fungicide amphotericin B, which led us to investigate the ability of LTX109 to disrupt plasma membrane integrity. S. cerevisiae cells exposed to a high concentration of LTX109 showed rapid release of potassium and amino acids, suggesting that LTX109 acted by destabilizing the plasma membrane. This was supported by the finding that cells were permeable to the fluorescent nucleic acid stain SYTOX Green after a few minutes of LTX109 treatment. We screened a haploid S. cerevisiae gene deletion library for mutants resistant to LTX109 to uncover potential molecular targets. Eight genes conferred LTX109 resistance when deleted and six were involved in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway (SUR1, SUR2, SKN1, IPT1, FEN1 and ORM2). The involvement of all of these genes in the biosynthetic pathway for the fungal-specific lipids mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide (MIPC) and mannosyl di-(inositol phosphoryl) ceramide (M(IP)2C) suggested that these lipids were essential for LTX109 sensitivity. Our observations are consistent with a model in which LTX109 kills S. cerevisiae by nonspecific destabilization of the plasma membrane through direct or indirect interaction with the sphingolipids.

Here, we created single and double deletion mutants of the pilus subunits and sortases; next, by combining western blotting, immunoelectron microscopy, and using ebpR in trans to increase pilus production, we identified EbpA as the tip pilin and EbpB as anchor at the pilus base, the latter attached to cell wall by the housekeeping sortase, SrtA. We also confirmed EbpC and Bps as the major pilin and pilin-specific sortase, respectively, both required for pilus polymerization. Interestingly, pilus length was increased and the number of pili decreased by deleting ebpA, while control overexpression of ebpA in trans restored wild-type levels, suggesting a dual role for EbpA in both initiation and termination of pilus polymerization. We next investigated the contribution of each pilin subunit to biofilm formation and UTI. Significant reduction in biofilm formation was observed with deletion of ebpA or ebpC (P<0.001) while ebpB was found to be dispensable; a similar result was seen in kidney CFUs in experimental UTI (ΔebpA, ΔebpC, P≤0.0093; ΔebpB, non-significant, each vs. OG1RF).

Our objective was to study the function of DSF in the plant growth promoting model strain S. maltophilia R551-3 using functional and transcriptomic analyses. For this purpose, we compared the wild-type strain with a mutant deficient in the rpfF (regulation of pathogenicity factors) gene that is essential for the synthesis of DSF. Oilseed rape seeds treated with the wild-type strain showed a statistically significant increase in germination rate compared with those treated with the rpfF mutant. Similarly, the wild-type strain exhibited better plant growth promotion and a greater efficiency in colonizing oilseed rape compared to the mutant strain. Moreover, only the wild-type was capable of forming structured cell aggregates both in vitro and in the rhizosphere, a characteristic mediated by DSF. Gene transcription analyses showed that numerous genes known to play a role in plant colonization (e.g. chemotaxis, cell motility, biofilm formation, multidrug efflux pumps) are controlled by the rpf/DSF system in S. maltophilia. In addition, we detected new potential functions of spermidine, primarily for both growth promotion and stress protection. Overall, our results showed a correspondence between the regulation of DSF and the positive interaction effect with the plant host.

The spatio-temporal interaction of the gshAB mutant with S. sanguinis was further investigated in a dual-species biofilm model by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Additional filters and an UV treatment lamp were installed. The whole system disinfection started 1.5 years later using a peracetic acid-based compound after confirming the material compatibility. Operator errors were found when a new water engineer took over the duty from his predecessor. It was also found that there were some deficiencies in the standard operating procedures (SOPs), and that on-the-job training was not enough. The water engineer failed to disinfect the sampling port and water drainage system. The RO membrane had been used for 4 years, even though the SOP standard specified changing it as every 3 years. Various bacteria, such as Rothia mucilaginosa, were cultured from the RO water sampled from the equipment. Because Rothia mucilaginosa is a resident in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract, it is believed that the bacteria were introduced into the system by the maintenance personnel or working environment. Therefore, the presence of R. mucilaginosa implied the failure of sanitary maintenance procedures. This study suggests that water systems should be designed based on the plans for profound system maintenance. It also suggests that SOP and on-the job training are essential to avoid any operator errors.

This review describes diverse strategies to combat bacterial biofilms, focusing firstly on small molecule interference with bacterial communication and signaling pathways, including quorum sensing and two-component signal transduction systems. Secondly we discuss enzymatic approaches to the degradation of extracellular matrix components to effect biofilm dispersal. Both of these approaches are based upon non-microbicidal mechanisms of action, and thereby do not place a direct evolutionary pressure on the bacteria to develop resistance. Such approaches have the potential to, in combination with conventional antibiotics, play an important role in the eradication of biofilm based bacterial infections.

Hence the role of immune response in the progression and resolution of PD must be considered vital. Any alteration in the immune system disturbs the homeostasis of the periodontium. Decline in immune system is the hallmark of aging, leading to increased susceptibility of elderly individuals to bacterial infections. The periodontal apparatus which is being constantly exposed to plaque biofilm is more vulnerable to destruction in aged individuals. Ageing related alterations in immune system has been discussed elsewhere as a contributor to various chronic inflammatory diseases like atherosclerosis, preterm, and low birth weight, etc. This paper reviews on the possible role of aging in periodontal destruction through altered immunity. Aging has long been associated with altered systemic inflammation. It has been discussed whether (1) this systemic inflammation is a consequence of increased occurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases upon aging or (2) aging associated systemic inflammation leads to such diseases. The immune responses which are protective at the first stages of life might result detrimental in the elderly. Hence it might be very difficult to individuate genetic profiles that might allow to identify individuals with a major risk for one or more age related diseases. Taking this into consideration, the cause of PDs in elderly is addressed with a systemic approach in order to understand the complex interplay between the aging immunity and PDs.

The diversity of functional associations supports a model of monochloramine action involving multiple cellular targets including cell membranes, nucleic acids, and proteins.

In Staphyloccocus epidermidis, the poly-N-acetylglucosamine polymer is partially de-N-acetylated by the extracellular protein IcaB. To understand the mechanism of action of IcaB, the enzyme was overexpressed and purified. IcaB demonstrates metal-dependent de-N-acetylase activity on β-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine oligomers with a broad preference for divalent metals. Steady-state kinetic analysis reveals the low catalytic efficiency (pentasaccharide kcat/KM 0.03 M(-1) s(-1)) of the enzyme toward the oligomeric substrates. While IcaB displays similar rates of de-N-acetylation with tri- through hexasaccharide PNAG oligomers, position specific de-N-acetylation was only observed with penta- and hexasaccharides. The enzyme preferentially de-N-acetylates the second residue from the reducing terminus in the pentasaccharide and second and third residues from the reducing terminus in the hexasaccharide. The data described here represent an important step toward a detailed understanding of dPNAG biosynthesis in S. epidermidis, an important nosocomial pathogen, as well as in other Gram-positive bacteria. The low catalytic activity of IcaB is consistent with reports of other enzymes which act on biofilm-related polysaccharides, and this emerging trend may indicate a common feature among this group of polysaccharide processing enzymes.

More than 85% of halitosis originates from oral bacterial infections. Foul-smelling breath mainly results from bacterial production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. To date, major treatments for elimination of oral malodor include periodontal therapy combined with antibiotics or antimicrobial agents, and mechanical approaches including tooth and tongue cleaning. These treatments may transiently reduce VSCs but carry risks of generating toxicity, increasing resistant strains and misbalancing the resident human flora. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative therapeutic modalities for halitosis. Plaque biofilms are the principal source for generating VSCs which are originally metabolized from amino acids during co-aggregation of oral bacteria. Blocking the bacterial coaggregation, therefore, may prevent various biofilm-associated oral diseases such as periodontitis and halitosis. Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), a Gram-negative anaerobe oral bacterium, is a main bacterial strain related to halitosis. Aggregation of F. nucleatum with other bacteria to form plaque biofilms in oral cavity causes bad breath. FomA, the major outer membrane protein of F. nucleatum, recruits other oral pathogenic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) in the periodontal pockets. A halitosis vaccine targeting F. bacterium FomA significantly abrogates the enhancement of bacterial co-aggregation, biofilms, production of VSCs, and gum inflammation mediated by an inter-species interaction of F. nucleatum with P. gingivalis, which suggests FomA of F. nucleatum to be a potential target for development of vaccines or drugs against bacterial biofilm formation and its associated pathogenicities.

Research studies on membrane fouling are extensive in the literature, with more than 200 publications on MBR fouling in the last 3 years; yet, improvements in practice on biofouling control and management have been remarkably slow. Commonly applied cleaning methods are only partially effective and membrane replacement often becomes frequent. The reason for the slow advancement in successful control of biofouling is largely attributed to the complex interactions of involved biological compounds and the lack of representative-for-practice experimental approaches to evaluate potential effective control strategies. Biofouling is driven by microorganisms and their associated extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS) and microbial products. Microorganisms and their products convene together to form matrices that are commonly treated as a black box in conventional control approaches. Biological-based antifouling strategies seem to be a promising constituent of an effective integrated control approach since they target the essence of biofouling problems. However, biological-based strategies are in their developmental phase and several questions should be addressed to set a roadmap for translating existing and new information into sustainable and effective control techniques. This paper investigates membrane biofouling in MBRs from the microbiological perspective to evaluate the potential of biological-based strategies in offering viable control alternatives. Limitations of available control methods highlight the importance of an integrated anti-fouling approach including biological strategies. Successful development of these strategies requires detailed characterization of microorganisms and EPS through the proper selection of analytical tools and assembly of results. Existing microbiological/EPS studies reveal a number of implications as well as knowledge gaps, warranting future targeted research. Systematic and representative microbiological studies, complementary utilization of molecular and biofilm characterization tools, standardized experimental methods and validation of successful biological-based antifouling strategies for MBR applications are needed. Specifically, in addition, linking these studies to relevant operational conditions in MBRs is an essential step to ultimately develop a better understanding and more effective and directed control strategy for biofouling.

The growth phenomenon of biofilm is relevant to the corrosion and clogging of water pipes, the chemical processes in a bioreactor, and bioremediation. In these phenomena, the behavior of the biofilm under flow has an important role. Therefore, controlling the biofilm behavior in each process is important. To provide a computational tool for analyzing biofilm growth, the present study proposes a computational model for the simulation of biofilm growth in flows. This model accounts for the growth, decay, detachment and adhesion of biofilms. The proposed model couples the computation of the surrounding fluid flow, using the finite volume method, with the simulation of biofilm growth, using the cellular automaton approach, a relatively low-computational-cost method. Furthermore, a stochastic approach for considering the adhesion process is proposed. Numerical simulations for the biofilm growth on a planar wall and that in an L-shaped rectangular channel were carried out. A variety of biofilm structures were observed depending on the strength of the flow. Moreover, the importance of the detachment and adhesion processes was confirmed.

Isolates from OI (n = 62), from healthy conjunctiva (HC; n = 45) and from healthy skin (HS; n = 53), were used to detect icaA and icaD genes, and the insertion sequence 256 (IS256) using PCR. The compositions of the biofilms were determined by treatment with NaIO₄, proteinase K and DNase I. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to characterize the isolates, and the expression of aap and embp genes was determined by real-time qPCR. A strong relationship between the icaA(-)/icaD(-)/IS256(-) genotype and protein- or protein/extracellular DNA (eDNA)-biofilm composition was found in the isolates from OI (53.6%), whereas the icaA(+)/icaD(+)/IS256(-) genotype and carbohydrate-biofilm was most prevalent in isolates from HC (25%) and HS (25%).

Diffusion characteristics of the flat-bed system to exposure with Meridol® tooth and tongue gel (TTG; 1,400 ppm F(-) from amine fluoride/stannous fluoride, 0.5 % zinc lactate, oral malodour counteractives) was assessed using a bioluminescent target species Escherichia coli Nissle 1917/pGLITE coupled with a low-light photon camera to visualise the kill kinetics. Tongue-flora derived, mixed culture biofilms (n = 4) received 5, 15 and 30 min treatment with TTG, respectively, to determine the optimum time of exposure. VSC biogenesis was measured from headspace samples by gas chromatography prior to and following treatment of two daily applications for 4 days of treatment (TTG), positive control (CHX gel) and negative controls (placebo and sham treatment). Viable counts were performed at the end of experiments by destructive sampling of the biofilms and plating onto selective and non-selective agar. Following a single treatment with TTG, the E. coli biofilm with lux target gave >50 % reduction of luminescence within 2 to 3 h before recovering to a steady state over 10 h, suggesting biofilm cidal activity rather biostasis. For mixed culture biofilms, 15- and 30-min treatment exposure with TTG gave almost identical reductions in final biofilm yields. For comparing efficacy of treatments, biofilms treated with TTG gave greatest reductions in both pre-post levels of H2S (P < 0.01) and CH3SH (P < 0.05) and population yields at the end of the experiments (P < 0.001) compared to placebo and positive control. The in vitro flat-bed perfusion model may be used to replicate many of the activities and reactions believed to be occurring by the tongue biofilm microflora within a real mouth, including VSC biogenesis and its inhibition by exposure to active agents as components of toothpastes and gels applied in direct contact with the biofilm.

Bacterial two-component system (TCS) signal transduction pathways control many pathogenic bacterial behaviors, such as virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance and are, therefore, an attractive target for the development of new drugs. This review presents an overview of TCS that are potential targets for such a strategy, describes small-molecules inhibitors of TCS identified to date and discusses assays for the identification of novel inhibitors.

An example of such a scenario is the secretion of siderophores by bacteria into their environment to fetch soluble iron. In a planktonic culture, these molecules diffuse rapidly, such that the same concentration is experienced by all bacteria. However, on solid substrates, bacteria form dense and packed colonies that may alter the diffusion dynamics through cell-cell contact interactions. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa microcolonies growing on solid substrate, we found that the concentration of pyoverdine, a secreted iron chelator, is heterogeneous, with a maximum at the center of the colony. We quantitatively explain the formation of this gradient by local exchange between contacting cells rather than by global diffusion of pyoverdine. In addition, we show that this local trafficking modulates the growth rate of individual cells. Taken together, these data provide a physical basis that explains the stability of public goods production in packed colonies.

The chemical structures of the TAs vary between bacteria, though they typically consist of zwitterionic polymers that are anchored to either the peptidoglycan layer as in the case of wall teichoic acid (WTA) or the cell membrane and named lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The polymers are modified with D-alanines and a lack of this decoration leads to increased susceptibility to cationic antimicrobial peptides. Four proteins, DltA-D, are essential for the incorporation of d-alanines into cell wall polymers and it has been established that DltA transfers D-alanines in the cytoplasm of the cell onto the carrier protein DltC. However, two conflicting models have been proposed for the remainder of the mechanism. Using a cellular protein localization and membrane topology analysis, we show here that DltC does not traverse the membrane and that DltD is anchored to the outside of the cell. These data are in agreement with the originally proposed model for D-alanine incorporation through a process that has been proposed to proceed via a D-alanine undecaprenyl phosphate membrane intermediate. Furthermore, we found that WTA isolated from a Staphylococcus aureus strain lacking LTA contains only a small amount of D-alanine, indicating that LTA has a role, either direct or indirect, in the efficient D-alanine incorporation into WTA in living cells.","authors":[{"name":"Nathalie T Reichmann"},{"name":"Carolina Picarra Cassona"},{"name":"Angelika Gründling"}],"keywords":[]},"article316":{"pmid":"23857917","title":"Imaging of extraradicular biofilm using combined scanning electron microscopy and stereomicroscopy.","date":"2015-10-02","abs":"Microorganisms are able to survive and induce persistent infection in extraradicular areas.

Our results demonstrate that the major isomer in each of the molecular species of TAGs and MMDAGs consists of the common structure in which Δ(9)18:1- and 16:0-fatty acyl substituents are exclusively located at sn-1 and sn-2, respectively. Several isomers were found for most of the molecular species, and thus hundreds of structures are present in this lipid family. More importantly, this study revealed the structures of MMDAG, a novel subclass of TAG that has not been previously reported by direct mass spectrometric approaches.

The gingiva is a unique and important tissue to study immune mechanisms because it is involved in host immune response against oral biofilm that might cause periodontal diseases. Furthermore, the close proximity of the gingiva to alveolar bone tissue enables also studying bone remodeling under inflammatory conditions. Our method yields large amount of immune cells that allows analysis of even rare cell populations such as Langerhans cells and T regulatory cells as we demonstrated previously (1). Employing mice to study local immune responses involved in alveolar bone loss during periodontal diseases is advantageous because of the availability of various immunological and experimental tools. Nevertheless, due to their small size and the relatively inconvenient access to the murine gingiva, many studies avoided examination of this critical tissue. The method described in this work could facilitate gingival analysis, which hopefully will increase our understating on the oral immune system and its role during periodontal diseases.

In order to acquire more insight in the composition of microbial communities occurring in the dairy concentrate industry, a bar-coded 16S amplicon sequencing analysis was carried out on milk, final products, and fouling samples taken from dairy concentrate production lines. The analysis of these samples revealed the presence of DNA from a broad range of bacterial taxa, including a majority of mesophiles and a minority of (thermophilic) spore-forming bacteria. Enrichments of fouling samples at 55°C showed the accumulation of predominantly Brevibacillus and Bacillus, whereas enrichments at 65°C led to the accumulation of Anoxybacillus and Geobacillus species. Bacterial population analysis of biofilms grown using fouling samples as an inoculum indicated that both Anoxybacillus and Geobacillus preferentially form biofilms on surfaces at air-liquid interfaces rather than on submerged surfaces. Three of the most potent biofilm-forming strains isolated from the dairy factory industrial samples, including Geobacillus thermoglucosidans, Geobacillus stearothermophilus, and Anoxybacillus flavithermus, have been characterized in detail with respect to their growth conditions and spore resistance. Strikingly, Geobacillus thermoglucosidans, which forms the most thermostable spores of these three species, is not able to grow in dairy intermediates as a pure culture but appears to be dependent for growth on other spoilage organisms present, probably as a result of their proteolytic activity. These results underscore the importance of abiotic and microbiotic factors in niche colonization in dairy factories, where the presence of thermophilic sporeformers can affect the quality of end products.","authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhao"},{"name":"Martien P M Caspers"},{"name":"Karin I Metselaar"},{"name":"Paulo de Boer"},{"name":"Guus Roeselers"},{"name":"Roy Moezelaar"},{"name":"Masja Nierop Groot"},{"name":"Roy C Montijn"},{"name":"Tjakko Abee"},{"name":"Remco Kort"}],"keywords":[]},"article330":{"pmid":"23851087","title":"Biofilm formation by the fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare: development and parameters affecting surface attachment.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Flavobacterium columnare is a bacterial fish pathogen that affects many freshwater species worldwide.

Nineteen F. columnare strains, including representatives of all of the defined genetic groups (genomovars), were compared in this study. The structure of biofilm was characterized by light microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. F. columnare was able to attach to and colonize inert surfaces by producing biofilm. Surface colonization started within 6 h postinoculation, and microcolonies were observed within 24 h. Extracellular polysaccharide substances and water channels were observed in mature biofilms (24 to 48 h). A similar time course was observed when F. columnare formed biofilm in microfluidic chambers under flow conditions. The virulence potential of biofilm was confirmed by cutaneous inoculation of channel catfish fingerlings with mature biofilm. Several physicochemical parameters modulate attachment to surfaces, with the largest influence being exerted by hardness, salinity, and the presence of mannose. Maintenance of hardness and salinity values within certain ranges could prevent biofilm formation by F. columnare in aquaculture systems.","authors":[{"name":"Wenlong Cai"},{"name":"Leonardo De La Fuente"},{"name":"Covadonga R Arias"}],"keywords":[]},"article331":{"pmid":"23851008","title":"Functional characterization of PccH, a key cytochrome for electron transfer from electrodes to the bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens.","date":"2013-11-21","abs":"The cytochrome PccH from Geobacter sulfurreducens (Gs) plays a crucial role in current-consuming fumarate-reducing biofilms.

All planktonic-grown isolates of MSSA were sensitive to chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin and 44% of isolates were resistant to streptomycin. Isolates grown as biofilm exhibited higher rates of antimicrobial resistance. Sequence analysis revealed three distinct spa types of the MRSA ST398 clonal type. This finding demonstrates the existence of a MSSA reservoir containing spa types resembling those of well-known MRSA strains.

In this study, we overexpressed acyltransferases of P. aeruginosa and screened them for the activity influencing the QS and QS-related virulence phenotypes. Among seven acyltransferases tested in this study, two acyltransferases, PA3984 (apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase) and PA2537 (putative acyltransferase), significantly affected both growth of P. aeruginosa and the activity of LasR, a major QS regulator, when overexpressed. These acyltransferases also reduced virulence and swarming motility of P. aeruginosa.

In the BC-SBR, granules formed within 2 weeks by swelling of Zoogloea colonies around flocs, developing subsequently smooth zoogloeal biofilms.

Proliferation of dense clusters of nitrifiers, Accumulibacter, and Competibacter from granule cores outwards resulted in heterogeneous bioaggregates, inside which only low abundance Zoogloea (<5%) were detected in biofilm interstices.

While it is accepted that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are major risk factors for the development and progression of periodontal disease, there is growing evidence that obesity is both an indirect risk factor because it affects glycaemic control and a direct risk factor because secretion of pro-inflammatory agents by adipose tissue modifies the periodontal reaction to the plaque biofilm. Recent research suggests that periodontitis may adversely affect glycaemic control, which can be improved by periodontal treatment with reduced risk of diabetic co-morbidity, thereby creating a two-way relationship. Furthermore it appears possible that periodontitis may stimulate inflammatory change in adipose tissue, creating a triangular self-generating cycle of morbidity linking obesity, diabetes and periodontal disease.

The functional strategies and physiological versatility of the bacterial populations growing in microbial mats allow bacteria to resist changing conditions within their environment. One of these strategies is the accumulation of carbon- and energy-rich polymers that permit the recovery of metabolic activities when favorable conditions are restored. In the present study, we systematically screened microbial mats for bacteria able to accumulate large amounts of the ester carbon polymers polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). Several of these strains were isolated from Ebro Delta microbial mats and their ability to accumulate PHA up to 40-60% of their dry weight was confirmed. According to two identification approaches (16S rRNA and rpoD genes), these strains were identified as Halomonas alkaliphila (MAT-7, -13, -16), H. neptunia (MAT-17), and H. venusta (MAT-28). To determine the mode of growth yielding maximum PHA accumulation, these three different species were cultured in an artificial biofilm in which the cells were immobilized on alginate beads. PHA accumulation by cells that had detached from the biofilm was compared with that of their planktonic counterparts. Experiments in different culture media showed that PHA accumulation, measured as the relative fluorescence intensity after 48 h of incubation at 30 degrees C, was higher in immobilized than in planktonic cells, with the exception of cells growing in 5% NaCl, in which PHA accumulation was drastically lower in both. Therefore, for obtaining high PHA concentrations, the use of immobilized cells may be a good alternative to the PHA accumulation by bacteria growing in the classical, planktonic mode. From the ecological point of view, increased PHA accumulation in detached cells from biofilms would be a natural strategy to improve bacterial dispersion capacity and, consequently, to increase survival in stressed environments.","authors":[{"name":"Mercedes Berlanga"},{"name":"David Miñana-Galbis"},{"name":"Oscar Domènech"},{"name":"Ricardo Guerrero"}],"keywords":[]},"article348":{"pmid":"23844477","title":"Destruction of single-species biofilms of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae by dextranase, lactoferrin, and lysozyme.","date":"2019-02-27","abs":"The aim of this work was to determine the destructive activity of dextranase, lactoferrin, and lysozyme, against single species biofilms composed of either Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae or Escherichia coli using the MBEC Assay.

This protein film forms the interface between enamel and the damage oral biofilm, which modulates the attachment of bacteria found in oral biofilm. The overall goal of this study was to gain insight into the biological formation of the human in vivo AEP. This study hypothesized that AEP is created by the formation of successive protein layers, which consist of initial binding to enamel and subsequent protein-protein interactions. This hypothesis was examined by observing quantitative and qualitative changes in pellicle composition during the first two hours of AEP formation in the oral cavity. Quantitative mass spectrometry approaches were used to generate an AEP protein profile for each time-point studied. Relative proteomic quantification was carried out for the 50 proteins observed in all four time-points. Notably, the abundance of important salivary proteins, such as histatin 1, decrease with increasing of the AEP formation, while other essential proteins such as statherin showed constant relative abundance in all time-points. In summary, this is the first study that investigates the dynamic process to the AEP formation by using proteomic approaches. Our data demonstrated that there are significant qualitative and quantitative proteome changes during the AEP formation, which in turn will likely impact the development of oral biofilms.

The sample was randomized into experimental (0.3125% ST, n = 14) and control (0.12% chlorhexidine/CHX, n = 13) groups. Products were masked as regards color, flavor and aroma. Intervention protocol consisted in supervised rinsing of 10 mL/day for 01 minute for 10 days. Gingival bleeding and simplified oral hygiene indexes were used to assess the efficacy variables, measured at baseline and after intervention by calibrated examiners. Data were statistically treated with paired t-test, unpaired t-test, and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests ( α = .05). Results. It was found that both ST and CHX were able to significantly reduce GI levels after 10 days (P < 0.001) and there was no significant difference between them (P > 0.05). CHX was the only product able to significantly reduce BA after 10 days when compared to baseline (P < 0.05). Conclusion.

We show that Qrr sRNAs also base-pair with and activate translation of the mRNA of a diguanylate cyclase (DGC), Vca0939; relieving an inhibitory structure in vca0939 that occludes the ribosome binding site. A nucleotide substitution in vca0939 disrupted sRNA/mRNA base-pairing and prevented vca0939 translation, while a compensating Qrr sRNA substitution restored pairing and Vca0939 levels.

In this study we report upon three recent clinical isolates and use the collection strain ATCC13637 as a reference. The adult-zebrafish model shows discrimination capacity, i.e. from very low to very high mortality rates, with clinical symptoms very similar to those observed in natural S. maltophilia infections in fish. Strain virulence correlates with resistance to human serum, in agreement with previous studies in mouse and rat and therefore supporting zebrafish as a replacement model. Despite its clinical origin, the collection strain ATCC13637 showed obvious signs of attenuation in zebrafish, with null mortality. Multilocus-sequence-typing analysis revealed that the most virulent strains, UV74 and M30, exhibit the strongest genetic similitude. Differential proteomic analysis led to the identification of 38 proteins with significantly different abundance in the three clinical strains relative to the reference strain. Orthologs of several of these proteins have been already reported to have a role in pathogenesis, virulence or resistance mechanisms thus supporting our strategy.

Accordingly, a bacterial agar invasion test based on colony/biofilm development was designed, which allows qualitative and quantitative characterization of bacterial growth into the agar culture medium. Once the culture conditions were optimized, the test was applied to 90 strains from nine bacterial species, validating its usefulness for differentiating invasive strains (positive) from those non invasive (negative). The test also allows sorting invasive strains according to agar invasion intensity (low, moderate, high) and topographic invasion pattern (peripheral, homogeneous, mixed). Moreover, an image analysis routine to quantify the invasion was developed.

The activity rates of the nitrifiers were measured and the activity decay was expressed by half-life times. It was found that anoxic and alternating anoxic/aerobic conditions were the best ways to preserve ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) during long starvation periods and resulted in half-life times of up to 34 and 28 days, respectively.

The activity of AOB biofilms that were kept for 97 days under anoxic conditions could be completely recovered in less than one week, while over 4 weeks was needed for AOB kept under anaerobic conditions.

Among the AOB, the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) technique showed that during starvation and recovery periods, the relative frequency of species shifted to Nitrosomonas europaea/eutropha, regardless of the starvation condition. The consequences of these findings for the operation of SFBBRs under low-load and starvation conditions are discussed.","authors":[{"name":"Abdelsalam Elawwad"},{"name":"Hendrik Sandner"},{"name":"Uwe Kappelmeyer"},{"name":"Heinz Koeser"}],"keywords":[]},"article370":{"pmid":"23837314","title":"Nutrient removal from separated pig manure digestate liquid using hybrid biofilters.","date":"2013-07-10","abs":"In this study, laboratory-scale hybrid biofilters were set up to treat the separated pig manure digestate liquid at two loading rates of 0.12 and 0.07 kg N m(-3) per day.

Surprisingly, A. actinomycetemcomitans shows resistance to high concentrations of LL-37.

Improved uptake of A. actinomycetemcomitans by neutrophils was mediated by their opsonization with LL-37. Enhanced phagocytosis and killing of A. actinomycetemcomitans by murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were dependent on their preagglutination by LL-37. Although A. actinomycetemcomitans is resistant to the bactericidal effect of LL-37, our results offer a rationale for the epidemiological association between LL-37 deficiency and the expansion of oral A. actinomycetemcomitans and indicate a possible therapeutic use of cationic peptides for host defense.

For each of the virulence genes detected in the environments, sequencing and NCBI BLAST analysis confirmed the identity of the PCR products. The virulence genes showed widespread environmental occurrence, as 17 different genes were observed. Sixteen genes were detected in beech wood soil, and 14 were detected in roadside and organic agricultural soils, while 11 were detected in the freshwater biofilm. All types of virulence traits were represented in all environments; however, the frequency at which they were detected was variable. A principal-component analysis suggested that several factors influenced the presence of the virulence genes; however, their distribution was most likely related to the level of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pH. The occurrence of the virulence genes in the environments generally did not appear to be the result of the presence of clinically relevant bacteria, indicating an environmental origin of the virulence genes.

The PS produced more biofilm than the TS in 48 h. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), the BC concentration at which the ATP bioluminescence of each bacterial strain decreased by 50 % relative to its maximum activity, was about 150-fold higher in the PS than in the TS. In contrast, when these values were measured in organisms in a planktonic state, the EC50 of the PS was only 2.2-fold higher than that of the TS. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were extracted from biofilms, and the glucose content of these biofilms was determined with the phenol-sulfuric acid method to estimate the quantity of EPS. The total amount of EPS in the PS biofilm was higher than that in the TS biofilm. These findings suggest that the PS produces greater amounts of biofilm and EPS than the TS, which results in greater resistance of the PS to disinfectants. The persistence of the strain in the fish processing plant might be attributable to these properties.

Herein, an optical sensor film is developed to detect local acidosis on an implanted surface. The film contains both upconverting particles (UCPs) that serve as a light source and a pH indicator that alters the luminescence spectrum. When irradiated with 980 nm light, the UCPs produce deeply penetrating red light emission, while generating negligible autofluorescence in the tissue. The basic form of the pH indicator absorbs more of upconversion luminescence at 661 nm than at 671 nm and consequently the spectral ratio indicates pH. Implanting this pH sensor film beneath 6-7 mm of porcine tissue does not substantially affect the calibration curve because the peaks are closely spaced. Furthermore, growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis on the sensor surface causes a local pH decrease that can be detected non-invasively through the tissue.

In this study, we investigated whether local delivery of D-Amino Acids (D-AAs), a biofilm dispersal agent, protects scaffolds from contamination and reduces microbial burden within contaminated rat segmental defects in vivo. In vitro testing on biofilms of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus demonstrated that D-Met, D-Phe, D-Pro, and D-Trp were highly effective at dispersing and preventing biofilm formation individually, and the effect was enhanced for an equimolar mixture of D-AAs. Incorporation of D-AAs into polyurethane scaffolds as a mixture (1:1:1 D-Met:D-Pro:D-Trp) significantly reduced bacterial contamination on the scaffold surface in vitro and within bone when implanted into contaminated femoral segmental defects. Our results underscore the potential of local delivery of d-AAs for reducing bacterial contamination by targeting bacteria within biofilms, which may represent a treatment strategy for improving healing outcomes associated with open fractures.","authors":[{"name":"Carlos J Sanchez"},{"name":"Edna M Prieto"},{"name":"Chad A Krueger"},{"name":"Katarzyna J Zienkiewicz"},{"name":"Desiree R Romano"},{"name":"Catherine L Ward"},{"name":"Kevin S Akers"},{"name":"Scott A Guelcher"},{"name":"Joseph C Wenke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Dispersal agent"},{"word":"Open fracture"},{"word":"Osteomyelitis"},{"word":"Scaffold"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"23831146","title":"Which metaproteome? The impact of protein extraction bias on metaproteomic analyses.","date":"2013-09-09","abs":"Culture-independent techniques such as LC-MS/MS-based metaproteomic analyses are being increasingly utilized for the study of microbial composition and function in complex environmental samples. Although several studies have documented the many challenges and sources of bias that must be considered in these types of analyses, none have systematically characterized the effect of protein extraction bias on the biological interpretation of true environmental biofilm metaproteomes. In this study, we compared three protein extraction methods commonly used in the analyses of environmental samples [guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), B-PER, sequential citrate-phenol (SCP)] using nano-LC-MS/MS and an environmental marine biofilm to determine the unique biases introduced by each method and their effect on the interpretation of the derived metaproteomes. While the protein extraction efficiencies of the three methods ranged from 2.0 to 4.3%, there was little overlap in the sequence (1.9%), function (8.3% of total assigned protein families) and origin of the identified proteins from each extract. Each extraction method enriched for different protein families (GuHCl - photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism; B-PER - membrane transport, oxidative stress; SCP - calcium binding, structural) while 23.7-45.4% of the identified proteins lacked SwissProt annotations. Taken together, the results demonstrated that even the most basic interpretations of this complex microbial assemblage (species composition, ratio of prokaryotic to eukaryotic proteins, predominant functions) varied with little overlap based on the protein extraction method employed. These findings demonstrate the heavy influence of protein extraction on biofilm metaproteomics and provide caveats for the interpretation of such data sets when utilizing single protein extraction methods for the description of complex microbial assemblages.","authors":[{"name":"Dagmar Hajkova Leary"},{"name":"W Judson Hervey"},{"name":"Jeffrey R Deschamps"},{"name":"Anne W Kusterbeck"},{"name":"Gary J Vora"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biological mass spectrometry"},{"word":"Community proteomics"},{"word":"Environmental proteomics"},{"word":"LC-MS/MS"},{"word":"Metaproteomics"}]},"article394":{"pmid":"23829709","title":"Limited impact of abiotic stress on surfactin production in planta and on disease resistance induced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens S499 in tomato and bean.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Understanding how temperature and water stress affect protocooperation between plants and beneficial rhizobacteria may enhance the efficacy of biocontrol agents in reducing plant diseases. However, little is known about the impact of these factors on biocontrol mechanisms and effectiveness, especially when provided by beneficial Bacillus spp. This work aimed to evaluate the influence of low/high temperature combined with a normal and reduced water regime on the interaction between Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain S499 and plants, resulting in the induction of systemic resistance (ISR). A reduction in ISR level was observed when plants were subjected to stress before bacterization; however, root treatment with S499 prior to stress exposure attenuated this negative effect. Colonization of S499 during exposure to temperature/water stress allowed the three crops to conserve their overall ability to mount defense lines to a similar degree at all the temperatures tested. Further investigation revealed that relative production of surfactin by S499 was clearly enhanced at low temperature, making it possible to counter-balance the negative effect on traits associated with rhizosphere fitness (colonization, motility, and biofilm formation) observed in vitro in cold conditions. This work thus represents a first step in deciphering the effect of high/low temperatures and/or drought on key plant-microorganism interactions culminating in ISR.

TC5. Aragusterol B (2) and 21-O-octadecanoyl-xestokerol A (4) exhibited the most potent antifouling activity with EC50 values close to these reported in the literature for tributyltin oxide, a marine anti-biofouling agent now considered to be a severe marine pollutant. Due to its comparable activity to tributyltin oxide and its absence of toxicity, the new 26,27-cyclosterol, 21-O-octadecanoyl-xestokerol A (4) constitutes a promising scaffold for further investigations.

This organism is therefore often used as a thermophilic model to investigate the molecular basis of type IV pili-mediated functions, such as the uptake of free DNA, adhesion, twitching motility, and biofilm formation, in hot environments. In this study, the phosphoproteome of T. thermophilus HB27 was analyzed via a shotgun approach and high-accuracy mass spectrometry. Ninety-three unique phosphopeptides, including 67 in vivo phosphorylated sites on 53 phosphoproteins, were identified. The distribution of Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation sites was 57%/36%/7%. The phosphoproteins were mostly involved in central metabolic pathways and protein/cell envelope biosynthesis. According to this analysis, the ATPase motor PilF, a type IV pili-related component, was first found to be phosphorylated on Thr-368 and Ser-372. Through the point mutation of PilF, mimic phosphorylated mutants T368D and S372E resulted in nonpiliated and nontwitching phenotypes, whereas nonphosphorylated mutants T368V and S372A displayed piliation and twitching motility. In addition, mimic phosphorylated mutants showed elevated biofilm-forming abilities with a higher initial attachment rate, caused by increasing exopolysaccharide production. In summary, the phosphorylation of PilF might regulate the pili and biofilm formation associated with exopolysaccharide production.

This variability can be observed between individuals with neither quantitative nor qualitative differences in plaque accumulation. The reported significant differences in gingival inflammatory response under quantitatively and/or qualitatively almost identical bacterial challenge suggest that the gingival response to plaque accumulation may be an individual trait, possibly genetic in origin. The most recent classification of periodontal diseases acknowledges that the clinical expression of plaque-induced gingival inflammation can be substantially modified by systemic factors, either inherent to the host or related to environmental influences. The aim of the present literature review is to describe (i) the factors influencing the development of plaque-induced gingivitis as well as (ii) those metabolic, environmental and systemic factors which have a direct impact on the etiopathogenetic pathway of plaque-induced gingivitis, thus altering the nature or course of the gingival inflammatory response to dental biofilm.
