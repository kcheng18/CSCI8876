The adherence of S. mutans to the NiCr and CoCr alloy surfaces immersed in Solution 2 for 24 h was verified by scanning electron microscopy, while the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed the importance of biofilm formation for the corrosion process. The R(QR) equivalent circuit was successfully used to fit the data obtained for the AS mixture without S. mutans, while the R(Q(R(QR))) circuit was found to be more suitable for describing the biofilm properties after treatment with the AS containing S. mutans species.

During the past decades, there has been tremendous progress in developing atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques to analyze biosystems, down to the single-molecule level. Force-distance (FD) curve-based AFM in particular has enabled researchers to map and quantify biophysical properties and biomolecular interactions on a wide variety of specimens. Despite its great potential, this AFM method has long been limited by its low spatial and temporal resolutions. Recently, novel FD-based multiparametric imaging modalities have been developed, allowing us to simultaneously image the structure, elasticity and interactions of biological samples at high spatiotemporal resolution. By oscillating the AFM tip, spatially resolved FD curves are obtained at much higher frequency than before, and as a result, samples are mapped at a speed similar to that of conventional topographic imaging. In this Account, we discuss the general principle of multiparametric AFM imaging and we provide a snapshot of recent studies showing how this new technology has been applied to biological specimens, from soluble proteins to membranes and cells. We emphasize novel methodologies that we recently developed, in which multiparametric imaging is combined with probes functionalized with chemical groups, ligands, or even live cells, in order to image and quantify receptor interaction forces and free-energy landscapes in a way not possible before. Key breakthroughs include observing the mechanical and chemical properties of single proteins in purple membranes, measuring the electrostatic potential of transmembrane pore forming proteins, structurally localizing chemical groups of water-soluble proteins, mapping and nanomechanical analysis of single sensors on yeast cells, imaging the sites of assembly and extrusion of single filamentous bacteriophages in living bacteria, unravelling the adhesive properties of biofilm-forming microbial pathogens, mapping the ligand-binding free energy landscape of human membrane receptors in proteoliposomes, and finally, the nanomechanical mapping of the first binding events of viruses to animal cells. In the coming years, it is anticipated that multiparametric AFM imaging will be increasingly used by chemists from broad horizons, enabling them to shed light into the sophisticated functions of biomolecular and cellular systems.","authors":[{"name":"David Alsteens"},{"name":"Daniel J Müller"},{"name":"Yves F Dufrêne"}],"keywords":[]},"article7":{"pmid":"28349908","title":"Comparison of Fluoridated Miswak and Toothbrushing with Fluoridated Toothpaste on Plaque Removal and Fluoride Release.","date":"2019-10-27","abs":"Dental caries and periodontal diseases are all induced by oral biofilm (dental plaque).

Previous transcriptome analyses of lytS (responsible for the regulation of lrgAB expression) and cidB mutants have revealed pleiotropic effects on carbohydrate metabolism and stress resistance genes. In this study, it was found that an lrgAB mutant, previously shown to have diminished aerobic and oxidative stress growth, was also much more growth impaired in the presence of heat and vancomycin stresses, relative to wild-type, lrgA and lrgB mutants. To obtain a more holistic picture of LrgAB and its involvement in stress resistance, RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were used to assess the transcriptional response of wild-type and isogenic lrgAB mutants under anaerobic (control) and stress-inducing culture conditions (aerobic, heat and vancomycin). Hierarchical clustering and principal components analyses of all differentially expressed genes revealed that the most distinct gene expression profiles between S. mutans UA159 and lrgAB mutant occurred during aerobic and high-temperature growth. Similar to previous studies of a cidB mutant, lrgAB stress transcriptomes were characterized by a variety of gene expression changes related to genomic islands, CRISPR-C as systems, ABC transporters, competence, bacteriocins, glucosyltransferases, protein translation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, carbohydrate metabolism/storage and transport. Notably, expression of lrgAB was upregulated in the wild-type strain under all three stress conditions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mutation of lrgAB alters the transcriptional response to stress, and further support the idea that the Cid/Lrg system acts to promote cell homeostasis in the face of environmental stress.","authors":[{"name":"Kelly C Rice"},{"name":"Matthew E Turner"},{"name":"O'neshia V Carney"},{"name":"Tongjun Gu"},{"name":"Sang-Joon Ahn"}],"keywords":[{"word":"LrgAB"},{"word":"S. mutans"},{"word":"heat-shock"},{"word":"oxygen"},{"word":"stress response"},{"word":"vancomycin"}]},"article11":{"pmid":"28348867","title":"The electrically conductive pili of Geobacter species are a recently evolved feature for extracellular electron transfer.","date":"2019-06-10","abs":"The electrically conductive pili (e-pili) of Geobactersulfurreducens have environmental and practical significance because they can facilitate electron transfer to insoluble Fe(III) oxides; to other microbial species; and through electrically conductive biofilms.

The downstream gene in all but one of the Desulfuromonadales that possess an e-pilin gene is a gene previously annotated as 'pilA-C' that has characteristics suggesting that it may encode an outer-membrane protein. Other genes associated with pilin function are clustered with e-pilin and 'pilA-C' genes in the Desulfuromonadales. In contrast, in the few bacteria outside the Desulfuromonadales that contain e-pilin genes, the other genes required for pilin function may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Of the 95 known Fe(III)-reducing micro-organisms for which genomes are available, 80 % lack e-pilin genes, suggesting that e-pili are just one of several mechanisms involved in extracellular electron transport.

In this study, we define mechanisms of resistance to bile salts and build on previous research highlighting induced virulence in Shigella flexneri strain 2457T following exposure to bile salts. Typical growth patterns were observed within the physiological range of bile salts; however, growth was inhibited at higher concentrations. Interestingly, extended periods of exposure to bile salts led to biofilm formation, a conserved phenotype that we observed among members of the Enterobacteriaceae Characterization of S. flexneri 2457T biofilms determined that both bile salts and glucose were required for formation, dispersion was dependent upon bile salts depletion, and recovered bacteria displayed induced adherence to HT-29 cells. RNA-sequencing analysis verified an important bile salt transcriptional profile in S. flexneri 2457T, including induced drug resistance and virulence gene expression. Finally, functional mutagenesis identified the importance of the AcrAB efflux pump and lipopolysaccharide O-antigen synthesis for bile salt resistance. Our data demonstrate that S. flexneri 2457T employs multiple mechanisms to survive exposure to bile salts, which may have important implications for multidrug resistance.

Sequence alignment reveals that the 26-bp attachment site recognized by pp3 is conserved in all P. aeruginosa strains sequenced to date, making it possible that pp3 could be extensively disseminated in P. aeruginosa.

Contrarily, carriers with a smaller (<15mm) or larger size (>15mm) either destroy the effective zone for anaerobic denitrifiers or damage the microaerobic environments due to poor mass transfer. This study is of particular use for optimal design of carriers in enhancing simultaneous nitrification-denitrification in microaerobic wastewater treatment processes.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ahmad"},{"name":"Sitong Liu"},{"name":"Nasir Mahmood"},{"name":"Asif Mahmood"},{"name":"Muhammad Ali"},{"name":"Maosheng Zheng"},{"name":"Jinren Ni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candidatus brocadia"},{"word":"Carrier size"},{"word":"Co-aggregation"},{"word":"Microbial distribution"},{"word":"Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification"},{"word":"Wastewater treatment"}]},"article22":{"pmid":"28342310","title":"Silver nanoparticles synthesized and coated with pectin: An ideal compromise for anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm action combined with wound-healing properties.","date":"2019-04-18","abs":"The synthesis of Ag nanoparticles from Ag","authors":[{"name":"P Pallavicini"},{"name":"C R Arciola"},{"name":"F Bertoglio"},{"name":"S Curtosi"},{"name":"G Dacarro"},{"name":"A D'Agostino"},{"name":"F Ferrari"},{"name":"D Merli"},{"name":"C Milanese"},{"name":"S Rossi"},{"name":"A Taglietti"},{"name":"M Tenci"},{"name":"L Visai"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-infective biomaterials"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Silver cation"},{"word":"Silver nanoparticles"},{"word":"Wound healing"}]},"article23":{"pmid":"28341961","title":"From smooth to rough, from water to air: the intertidal habitat of Northern clingfish (Gobiesox maeandricus).","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The Northern clingfish is a small, Eastern North Pacific fish that can attach to rough, fouled rocks in the intertidal. Their ability to attach to surfaces has been measured previously in the laboratory, and in this study, we show the roughness and fouling of the natural habitat of these fish. We introduce a new method for measuring surface roughness of natural substrates with time-limited accessibility. We expect this method to be broadly applicable in studies of animal/substrate surface interactions in habitats difficult to characterize. Our roughness measurements demonstrate that the fish's ability to attach to very coarse roughness is required in its natural environment. Some of the rocks showed even coarser roughness than the fish could attach to in the lab setting. We also characterized the clingfish's preference for other habitat descriptors such as the size of the rocks, biofilm, and Aufwuchs (macroalgae, encrusting invertebrates) cover, as well as grain size of underlying substrate. Northern clingfish seek shelter under rocks of 15-45 cm in size. These rocks have variable Aufwuchs cover, and gravel is the main underlying substrate type. In the intertidal, environmental conditions change with the tides, and for clingfish, the daily time under water (DTUW%) was a key parameter explaining distribution. Rather than location being determined by intertidal zonation, an 80% DTUW, a finer scale concept of tidal inundation, was required by the fish. We expect that this is likely because the mobility of the fish allows them to more closely track the ideal inundation in the marine intertidal.","authors":[{"name":"Petra Ditsche"},{"name":"Madeline Hicks"},{"name":"Lisa Truong"},{"name":"Christina Linkem"},{"name":"Adam Summers"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Aufwuchs"},{"word":"Fouling"},{"word":"Intertidal"},{"word":"Roughness measurement"},{"word":"Substrate"}]},"article24":{"pmid":"28341674","title":"Interbacterial Adhesion Networks within Early Oral Biofilms of Single Human Hosts.","date":"2019-02-16","abs":"Specific interbacterial adhesion, termed coaggregation, is well established for three early colonizers of the plaque biofilm: streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellae. However, little is known about interactions of other early colonizers and about the extent of interactions within the bacterial community from a single host. To address these gaps, subject-specific culture collections from two individuals were established using an intraoral biofilm retrieval device. Molecular taxonomy (Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray [HOMIM]) analysis of biofilm samples confirmed the integrity and completeness of the collections. HOMIM analysis verified the isolation of Streptococcus gordonii and S. anginosus from only one subject, as well as isolation of a previously uncultivated streptococcal phylotype from the other subject. Strains representative of clonal diversity within each collection were further characterized. Greater than 70% of these streptococcal strains from each subject coaggregated with at least one other coisolate. One-third of the strains carry a known coaggregation mediator: receptor polysaccharide (RPS). Almost all nonstreptococcal isolates coaggregated with other coisolates. Importantly, certain Rothia strains demonstrated more coaggregations with their coisolated bacteria than did any Streptococcus or Actinomyces strain, and certain Haemophilus isolates participated in twice as many. Confocal microscopy of undisturbed biofilms showed that Rothia and Haemophilus each occur in small multispecies microcolonies. However, in confluent high-biomass regions, Rothia occurred in islands whereas Haemophilus was distributed throughout. Together, the data demonstrate that coaggregation networks within an individual's oral microflora are extensive and that Rothia and Haemophilus can be important initiators of cell-cell interactions in the early biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Robert J Palmer"},{"name":"Nehal Shah"},{"name":"Alex Valm"},{"name":"Bruce Paster"},{"name":"Floyd Dewhirst"},{"name":"Taichi Inui"},{"name":"John O Cisar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Haemophilus"},{"word":"Rothia"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"coaggregation"},{"word":"oral microbiome"},{"word":"streptococci"}]},"article25":{"pmid":"31294156","title":"Slow and steady wins the race: an examination of bacterial persistence.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Bacterial persistence is a state of metabolic dormancy among a small fraction (<1%) of a genetically identical population of cells that, as a result, becomes transiently resistant to environmental stressors.

P. stutzeri A1501 tended to form biofilm in minimal media, especially under nitrogen depletion condition. Under such growth condition, the biofilms formed at the air-liquid interface (termed as pellicles) and the colony biofilms on agar plates exhibited nitrogenase activity in air. The two kinds of biofilms both contained large ovoid shape 'cells' that were multiple living bacteria embedded in a sac of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). We proposed to name such large 'cells' as A1501 cyst. Our results suggest that the EPS, especially exopolysaccharides enabled the encased bacteria to fix nitrogen while grown under aerobic condition. The formation of A1501 cysts was reversible in response to the changes of carbon or nitrogen source status. A1501 cyst formation depended on nitrogen-limiting signaling and the presence of sufficient carbon sources, yet was independent of an active nitrogenase. The pellicles formed by Azospirillum brasilense, another free-living nitrogen-fixing rhizobacterium, which also exhibited nitrogenase activity and contained the large EPS-encapsuled A1501 cyst-like 'cells'.

The planktonic and biofilm growth modes differ dramatically with respect to spatial constraints, nutrient access, population density and cell-cell interactions. Fitness trade-offs underlie how successfully bacteria compete in each of these environments. Accordingly, some bacteria have evolved to be specialists in biofilm formation, while others specialize in planktonic growth. There are species, however, that possess flexible strategies: they can transition between the molecular programs required for biofilm formation and for planktonic growth. Such flexible strategies often sacrifice competitive ability against specialists in a given habitat. There is little exploration of the ecological conditions favoring the evolution of the flexible biofilm production strategy for bacteria in competition with specialist biofilm producers or specialist non-producers. Here, we study the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, a flexible biofilm-former, as well as constitutive biofilm-producing and non-producing mutants. We assess the fitness of these strains under biofilm conditions, planktonic conditions and conditions that demand the ability to transition between the two growth modes. We show that, relative to the specialists, the wild type is superior at dispersal from biofilms to the planktonic phase; however, this capability comes at the expense of reduced competitive fitness against constitutive biofilm producers on surfaces. Wild-type V. cholerae can outcompete the constitutive biofilm producers and non-producers if habitat turnover is sufficiently frequent. Thus, selection for phenotypic flexibility in biofilm production depends on the frequency of environmental fluctuations encountered by bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Jing Yan"},{"name":"Carey D Nadell"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"}],"keywords":[]},"article36":{"pmid":"28338408","title":"Clofazimine encapsulation in nanoporous silica particles for the oral treatment of antibiotic-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.","date":"2017-12-27","abs":"First extensive reformulation of clofazimine (CLZ) in nanoporous silica particles (NSPs) for tackling antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis (TB) infections.","authors":[{"name":"Sabrina Valetti"},{"name":"Xin Xia"},{"name":"Joana Costa-Gouveia"},{"name":"Priscille Brodin"},{"name":"Marie-Françoise Bernet-Camard"},{"name":"Margareta Andersson"},{"name":"Adam Feiler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Caco-2 cells"},{"word":"HPLC"},{"word":"amorphous"},{"word":"clofazimine"},{"word":"drug carrier"},{"word":"intramacrophage in vitro assay"},{"word":"nanoporous silica particles"},{"word":"oral drug delivery"},{"word":"tuberculosis"}]},"article37":{"pmid":"28338095","title":"The Effect Of microbial Mats In The Decay Of Anurans With Implications For Understanding Taphonomic Processes In The Fossil Record.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The pattern and sequence of the decomposition of the Pipidae African dwarf frog (Hymenochirus boettgeri) is tracked in an experiment with microbial mats in order to explore soft tissue preservation over three years.

How could simply sealing a carious lesion, with all the associated bacteria and decayed tissues, possibly be clinically successful? Since then, growing understanding that caries is essentially a biofilm driven disease rather than an infectious disease, explains why the Hall Technique, and other 'sealing in' carious lesion techniques, are successful. The intervening ten years has seen robust evidence from several randomised control trials that are either completed or underway. These have found the Hall Technique superior to comparator treatments, with success rates (no pain or infection) of 99% (UK study) and 100% (Germany) at one year, 98% and 93% over two years (UK and Germany) and 97% over five years (UK). The Hall Technique is now regarded as one of several biological management options for carious lesions in primary molars. This paper covers commonly asked questions about the Hall Technique and speculates on what lies ahead.","authors":[{"name":"N P T Innes"},{"name":"D J P Evans"},{"name":"C C Bonifacio"},{"name":"M Geneser"},{"name":"D Hesse"},{"name":"M Heimer"},{"name":"M Kanellis"},{"name":"V Machiulskiene"},{"name":"J Narbutaité"},{"name":"I C Olegário"},{"name":"A Owais"},{"name":"M P Araujo"},{"name":"D P Raggio"},{"name":"C Splieth"},{"name":"E van Amerongen"},{"name":"K Weber-Gasparoni"},{"name":"R M Santamaria"}],"keywords":[]},"article45":{"pmid":"28335808","title":"Potential for hydrogen-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophic and diazotrophic populations to initiate biofilm formation in oligotrophic, deep terrestrial subsurface waters.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Deep terrestrial biosphere waters are separated from the light-driven surface by the time required to percolate to the subsurface.

As a means to investigate natural products from these microorganisms, an opportunistic sampling protocol was developed, which focused on exploring bacteria isolated from roadkill mammals. This initiative was made possible through the establishment of a newly created discovery pipeline, which couples laser ablation electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LAESIMS) with bioassay testing, to target biologically active metabolites from microbiome-associated bacteria. To illustrate this process, this report focuses on samples obtained from the ear of a roadkill opossum (Dideiphis virginiana) as the source of two bacterial isolates (Pseudomonas sp. and Serratia sp.) that produced several new and known cyclic lipodepsipeptides (viscosin and serrawettins, respectively). These natural products inhibited biofilm formation by the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans at concentrations well below those required to inhibit yeast viability. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries revealed the presence of diverse microbial communities associated with different sites throughout the opossum carcass. A putative biosynthetic pathway responsible for the production of the new serrawettin analogues was identified by sequencing the genome of the Serratia sp. isolate. This study provides a functional roadmap to carrying out the systematic investigation of the genomic, microbiological, and chemical parameters related to the production of natural products made by bacteria associated with non-anthropoidal mammalian microbiomes. Discoveries emerging from these studies are anticipated to provide a working framework for efforts aimed at augmenting microbiomes to deliver beneficial natural products to a host.","authors":[{"name":"Jeremy L Motley"},{"name":"Blake W Stamps"},{"name":"Carter A Mitchell"},{"name":"Alec T Thompson"},{"name":"Jayson Cross"},{"name":"Jianlan You"},{"name":"Douglas R Powell"},{"name":"Bradley S Stevenson"},{"name":"Robert H Cichewicz"}],"keywords":[]},"article48":{"pmid":"28335448","title":"A Community Multi-Omics Approach towards the Assessment of Surface Water Quality in an Urban River System.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"A multi-omics approach was applied to an urban river system (the Brisbane River (BR), Queensland, Australia) in order to investigate surface water quality and characterize the bacterial population with respect to water contaminants.

However, little is known about the physiological role of MazEFsa and YefM-YoeBsa in S. aureus. Upon characterizing the phenotypes of single, double and triple gene deletion mutants, we found that mazFsa deletion led to increased biofilm formation. Subsequently, transcriptional analysis revealed that expression of intercellular adhesin (ica) gene, icaADBC, increased in a mazFsa deletion mutant. mazFsa/icaADBC double gene deletion and genetic complementation approaches provided convincing evidence that increased biofilm formation was caused by an increase in polysaccharide intercellular adhesin synthesized by icaADBC-encoded proteins. Furthermore, through the use of alanine substitutions at the conserved active residues of MazFsa, our results suggested that ica-mediated biofilm formation depended on the mRNA interferase activity of MazFsa. These findings give new insights not only into the physiological role of MazEFsa in S. aureus, but also into the regulatory mechanism of ica-dependent biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Fuminori Kato"},{"name":"Yusuke Yabuno"},{"name":"Yoshihiro Yamaguchi"},{"name":"Motoyuki Sugai"},{"name":"Masayori Inouye"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"toxin-antitoxin system"}]},"article53":{"pmid":"28334141","title":"Distribution of antimicrobial resistance determinants, virulence-associated factors and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats loci in isolates of Enterococcus faecalis from various settings and genetic lineages.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis represents an important factor of hospital-associated infections (HAIs).

This material is a disordered structure with high transparency and electrical conductivity. For this purpose, we used a cell line (SN4741) from substantia nigra dopaminergic cells derived from transgenic mouse embryos. Cells were cultured either in a powder of increasing concentrations of NGLC microflakes (82±37μm) in the medium or on top of nanometer-thin films bathed in the same culture medium. The metabolism activity of SN4741 cells in presence of NGLC was assessed using methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT) and apoptosis/necrosis flow cytometry assay respectively. Growth and proliferation as well as senescence were demonstrated by western blot (WB) of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), monoclonal phosphorylate Histone 3 (serine 10) (PH3) and SMP30 marker. Specific dopaminergic differentiation was confirmed by the WB analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Cell maturation and neural capability were characterized using specific markers (SYP: synaptophysin and GIRK2: G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier potassium channel 2 protein) via immunofluorescence and coexistence measurements. The results demonstrated cell positive biocompatibility with different concentrations of NGLC. The cells underwent a process of adaptation of SN4741 cells to NGLC where their metabolism decreases. This process is related to a decrease of PH3 expression and significant increase SMP30 related to senescence processes. After 7 days, the cells increased the expression of TH and PCNA that is related to processes of DNA replication. On the other hand, cells cultured on top of the film showed axonal-like alignment, edge orientation, and network-like images after 7 days. Neuronal capability was demonstrated to a certain extent through the analysis of significant coexistence between SYP and GIRK2. Furthermore, we found a direct relationship between the thickness of the films and cell maturation.

Although it is not clear why NTM diseases have been increasing, one possibility is an increase of mycobacterial infection sources in the environment. Thus, in this review, we focused on the infection sources of pathogenic NTM, especially MAC. The environmental niches for MAC include water, soil, and dust. The formation of aerosols containing NTM arising from shower water, soil, and pool water implies that these niches can be infection sources. Furthermore, genotyping has shown that clinical isolates are identical to environmental ones from household tap water, bathrooms, potting soil, and garden soil. Therefore, to prevent and treat MAC diseases, it is essential to identify the infection sources for these organisms, because patients with these diseases often suffer from reinfections and recurrent infections with them. In the environmental sources, MAC and other NTM organisms can form biofilms, survive within amoebae, and exist in a free-living state. Mycobacterial communities are also likely to occur in these infection sources in households. Water distribution systems are a transmission route from natural water reservoirs to household tap water. Other infection sources include areas with frequent human contact, such as soil and bathrooms, indicating that individuals may carry NTM organisms that concomitantly attach to their household belongings. To explore the mechanisms associated with the global spread of infection and MAC transmission routes, an epidemiological population-wide genotyping survey would be very useful. A good example of the power of genotyping comes from M. avium subsp. hominissuis, where close genetic relatedness was found between isolates of it from European patients and pigs in Japan and Europe, implying global transmission of this bacterium. It is anticipated that whole genome sequencing technologies will improve NTM surveys so that the mechanisms for the global spread of MAC disease will become clearer in the near future. Better understanding of the niches exploited by MAC and its ecology is essential for preventing MAC infections and developing new methods for its effective treatment and elimination.","authors":[{"name":"Yukiko Nishiuchi"},{"name":"Tomotada Iwamoto"},{"name":"Fumito Maruyama"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Mycobacterium avium complex"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"epidemiology"},{"word":"genotyping"},{"word":"infection source"},{"word":"non-tuberculous mycobacteria"},{"word":"showerhead"},{"word":"transmission route"}]},"article77":{"pmid":"28326155","title":"Dental plaque microbial profiles of children from Khartoum, Sudan, with congenital heart defects.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Few studies have focused on the bacterial species associated with the deterioration of the dental and gingival health of children with congenital heart defects (CHD).

In this cross-sectional study, participants were children (3-12 years) recruited in Khartoum State, Sudan. A total of 80 CHD cases from the Ahmed Gasim Cardiac Centre and 80 healthy controls from randomly selected schools and kindergartens were included. Participants underwent clinical oral examinations for caries (decayed, missing, and filled teeth indices [DMFT] for primary dentition, and DMFT for permanent dentition), and gingivitis (simplified gingival index [GI]). Pooled dental biofilm samples were obtained from four posterior teeth using paper points. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection and quantification of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcussanguinis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was used for the detection of 40 additional bacterial species. CHD cases had a significantly higher caries experience (DMFT = 4.1 vs. 2.3, p < 0.05; DMFT = 1.4 vs. 0.7, p < 0.05) and a higher mean number of examined teeth with gingivitis (4.2 vs. 2.0; p < 0.05) compared with controls.

Systematic phenotypic tests identified longitudinal bacterial series that manifested progressive changes in liquid media growth, motility, biofilm formation, and acute insect virulence, but not in mucoidy. The results suggest that distinct lineages follow distinct evolutionary trajectories during lung infection. Pan-genome analysis identified 10,110 homologous gene clusters present only in a subset of strains, including genes restricted to different molecular types. Our phylogenetic analysis based on 2148 orthologous gene clusters from all isolates is consistent with patient-specific clades. This suggests that initial colonization of patients was likely by individual strains, followed by subsequent diversification. Evidence of clonal lineages shared by some patients was observed, suggesting inter-patient transmission. We observed recurrent gene losses in multiple independent longitudinal series, including complete loss of Chromosome III and deletions on other chromosomes. Recurrently observed loss-of-function mutations were associated with decreases in motility and biofilm formation.

A central molecule regulating the processes of this motile-sessile transition is the second messenger c-di-GMP, which stimulates the production of a variety of exopolysaccharide adhesins in different bacterial model organisms. In Caulobacter crescentus, c-di-GMP regulates the synthesis of the polar holdfast adhesin during the cell cycle, yet the molecular and cellular details of this control are currently unknown. Here we identify HfsK, a member of a versatile N-acetyltransferase family, as a novel c-di-GMP effector involved in holdfast biogenesis. Cells lacking HfsK form highly malleable holdfast structures with reduced adhesive strength that cannot support surface colonization. We present indirect evidence that HfsK modifies the polysaccharide component of holdfast to buttress its cohesive properties. HfsK is a soluble protein but associates with the cell membrane during most of the cell cycle. Coincident with peak c-di-GMP levels during the C. crescentus cell cycle, HfsK relocalizes to the cytosol in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner. Our results indicate that this c-di-GMP-mediated dynamic positioning controls HfsK activity, leading to its inactivation at high c-di-GMP levels. A short C-terminal extension is essential for the membrane association, c-di-GMP binding, and activity of HfsK. We propose a model in which c-di-GMP binding leads to the dispersal and inactivation of HfsK as part of holdfast biogenesis progression.","authors":[{"name":"Kathrin S Sprecher"},{"name":"Isabelle Hug"},{"name":"Jutta Nesper"},{"name":"Eva Potthoff"},{"name":"Mohamed-Ali Mahi"},{"name":"Matteo Sangermani"},{"name":"Volkhard Kaever"},{"name":"Torsten Schwede"},{"name":"Julia Vorholt"},{"name":"Urs Jenal"}],"keywords":[]},"article81":{"pmid":"28325766","title":"Staphylococcal β-Toxin Modulates Human Aortic Endothelial Cell and Platelet Function through Sphingomyelinase and Biofilm Ligase Activities.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus causes many infections, such as skin and soft tissue, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and infective endocarditis (IE).

This work uses bioremediation of U(VI)-contaminated groundwater as the context to develop a two-dimensional and multispecies biofilm model. The model simulates the transverse mixing zone in which U(VI) is mixed with propionate, a nutrient externally supplied to stimulate the growth of microorganisms. The model considers multiple interactions among fluid flow, transport and reaction of chemical species, and growth of biofilm. The biofilm consists of two types of active biomass (syntrophs and dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria [DMBR]) and inert biomass. The two types of active biomass collaboratively remove U(VI). The model outputs biomass distribution, chemical species concentrations, and fluid flow at the pore scale to fundamentally study the multiple interactions. The model also outputs the contaminant removal rate that can be potentially used for up-scaling studies. The simulated results are generally consistent with experimental observations from other studies in trend. The trend can be explained by the multiple interactions based on thermodynamics and microbial kinetics. Biotechnol.

It is also a common resident of the human gastrointestinal tract and has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of green and black tea extracts as well as two of their bioactive components, EGCG and theaflavins, on the growth and virulence properties of F. nucleatum. The tea extracts and components displayed various degrees of antibacterial activity that may involve damage to the bacterial cell membrane and the chelation of iron. They also prevented biofilm formation by F. nucleatum at concentrations that did not interfere with bacterial growth. In addition, the treatment of a pre-formed F. nucleatum biofilm with the green tea extract and EGCG caused a time-dependent decrease in biofilm viability. The green and black tea extracts, EGCG, and theaflavins decreased the adherence of F. nucleatum to oral epithelial cells and matrix proteins. Moreover, these tea components also attenuated F. nucleatum-mediated hemolysis and hydrogen sulfide production, two other virulence factors expressed by this bacterium. In summary, this study showed that tea polyphenols may be of interest for treating F. nucleatum-associated disorders.","authors":[{"name":"Amel Ben Lagha"},{"name":"Bruno Haas"},{"name":"Daniel Grenier"}],"keywords":[]},"article87":{"pmid":"28322109","title":"TiO","date":"2017-12-18","abs":"To investigate the photocatalytic inactivation of fungi and bacteria mediated by TiO","authors":[{"name":"Lu Jia"},{"name":"Jichuan Qiu"},{"name":"Lingqian Du"},{"name":"Zhi Li"},{"name":"Hong Liu"},{"name":"Shaohua Ge"}],"keywords":[{"word":"TiO2 nanorod arrays"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"fungi"},{"word":"photocatalysis"},{"word":"planktonic"},{"word":"surface modification"}]},"article88":{"pmid":"28321991","title":"Atomic Layer Deposition of a Silver Nanolayer on Advanced Titanium Orthopedic Implants Inhibits Bacterial Colonization and Supports Vascularized de Novo Bone Ingrowth.","date":"2018-03-06","abs":"Joint replacement surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality following infection with either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Staphylococcus epidermidis.

These metabolites are synthesized by dedicated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which assemble architecturally complex molecules from simple building blocks. The majority of BGCs in a given bacterium are not expressed under normal laboratory growth conditions, and our understanding of how they are silenced is in its infancy. Here, we have addressed this question in the Gram-negative model bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis E264 using genetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and chemical approaches. We report that a previously unknown, quorum-sensing-controlled LysR-type transcriptional regulator, which we name ScmR (for secondary metabolite regulator), serves as a global gatekeeper of secondary metabolism and a repressor of numerous BGCs. Transcriptionally, we find that 13 of the 20 BGCs in B. thailandensis are significantly (threefold or more) up- or down-regulated in a scmR deletion mutant (ΔscmR) Metabolically, the ΔscmR strain displays a hyperactive phenotype relative to wild type and overproduces a number of compound families by 18- to 210-fold, including the silent virulence factor malleilactone. Accordingly, the ΔscmR mutant is hypervirulent both in vitro and in a Caenorhabditis elegans model in vivo. Aside from secondary metabolism, ScmR also represses biofilm formation and transcriptionally activates ATP synthesis and stress response. Collectively, our data suggest that ScmR is a pleiotropic regulator of secondary metabolism, virulence, biofilm formation, and other stationary phase processes. A model for how the interplay of ScmR with pathway-specific transcriptional regulators coordinately silences virulence factor production is proposed.","authors":[{"name":"Dainan Mao"},{"name":"Leah B Bushin"},{"name":"Kyuho Moon"},{"name":"Yihan Wu"},{"name":"Mohammad R Seyedsayamdost"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia thailandensis"},{"word":"biosynthetic gene clusters"},{"word":"natural products"},{"word":"regulation"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article94":{"pmid":"28320940","title":"Molecular interactions and inhibition of the staphylococcal biofilm-forming protein SdrC.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus forms biofilms on indwelling medical devices using a variety of cell-surface proteins. There is growing evidence that specific homophilic interactions between these proteins represent an important mechanism of cell accumulation during biofilm formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not well-understood. Here we report the direct measurement of homophilic binding forces by the serine-aspartate repeat protein SdrC and their inhibition by a peptide. Using single-cell and single-molecule force measurements, we find that SdrC is engaged in low-affinity homophilic bonds that promote cell-cell adhesion. Low-affinity intercellular adhesion may play a role in favoring biofilm dynamics. We show that SdrC also mediates strong cellular interactions with hydrophobic surfaces, which are likely to be involved in the initial attachment to biomaterials, the first stage of biofilm formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a peptide derived from β-neurexin is a powerful competitive inhibitor capable of efficiently blocking surface attachment, homophilic adhesion, and biofilm accumulation. Molecular modeling suggests that this blocking activity may originate from binding of the peptide to a sequence of SdrC involved in homophilic interactions. Our study opens up avenues for understanding the role of homophilic interactions in staphylococcal adhesion, and for the design of new molecules to prevent biofilm formation during infection.","authors":[{"name":"Cécile Feuillie"},{"name":"Cécile Formosa-Dague"},{"name":"Leanne M C Hays"},{"name":"Ophélie Vervaeck"},{"name":"Sylvie Derclaye"},{"name":"Marian P Brennan"},{"name":"Timothy J Foster"},{"name":"Joan A Geoghegan"},{"name":"Yves F Dufrêne"}],"keywords":[{"word":"SdrC"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"adhesion"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"inhibition"}]},"article95":{"pmid":"28320886","title":"Optogenetic Module for Dichromatic Control of c-di-GMP Signaling.","date":"2019-01-15","abs":"Many aspects of bacterial physiology and behavior, including motility, surface attachment, and the cell cycle, are controlled by cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP)-dependent signaling pathways on the scale of seconds to minutes. Interrogation of such processes in real time requires tools for introducing rapid and reversible changes in intracellular c-di-GMP levels. Inducing the expression of genes encoding c-di-GMP-synthetic (diguanylate cyclases) and -degrading (c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase) enzymes by chemicals may not provide adequate temporal control. In contrast, light-controlled diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases can be quickly activated and inactivated. A red/near-infrared-light-regulated diguanylate cyclase, BphS, was engineered previously, yet a complementary light-activated c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase has been lacking. In search of such a phosphodiesterase, we investigated two homologous proteins from Allochromatium vinosum and Magnetococcus marinus, designated BldP, which contain C-terminal EAL-BLUF modules, where EAL is a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase domain and BLUF is a blue light sensory domain. Characterization of the BldP proteins in Escherichia coli and in vitro showed that they possess light-activated c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activities. Interestingly, light activation in both enzymes was dependent on oxygen levels. The truncated EAL-BLUF fragment from A. vinosum BldP lacked phosphodiesterase activity, whereas a similar fragment from M. marinus BldP, designated EB1, possessed such activity that was highly (>30-fold) upregulated by light. Following light withdrawal, EB1 reverted to the inactive ground state with a half-life of ∼6 min. Therefore, the blue-light-activated phosphodiesterase EB1 can be used in combination with the red/near-infrared-light-regulated diguanylate cyclase BphS for the bidirectional regulation of c-di-GMP-dependent processes in E. coli as well as other bacterial and nonbacterial cells.","authors":[{"name":"Min-Hyung Ryu"},{"name":"Anastasia Fomicheva"},{"name":"Oleg V Moskvin"},{"name":"Mark Gomelsky"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"diguanylate cyclase"},{"word":"gene expression"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"optogenetics"},{"word":"phosphodiesterase"},{"word":"photoreceptors"},{"word":"photosensory reception"},{"word":"signal transduction"}]},"article96":{"pmid":"28320837","title":"The Suf Iron-Sulfur Cluster Biosynthetic System Is Essential in Staphylococcus aureus, and Decreased Suf Function Results in Global Metabolic Defects and Reduced Survival in Human Neutrophils.","date":"2019-03-29","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus remains a causative agent for morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Vascular catheters impregnated with minocycline-rifampin (M/R) and M/R with chlorhexidine coating (M/R plus CHD) have previously demonstrated antimicrobial activity. Therefore, in this study, we examined whether these combinations could be applied to PCN catheters and effectively inhibit biofilm formation by common uropathogens. An in vitro biofilm colonization model was used to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of M/R and M/R-plus-CHD PCN catheters against nine common multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative uropathogens as well as Candida glabrata and Candida albicans Experimental catheters were also assessed for durability of antimicrobial activity for up 3 weeks. PCN catheters coated with M/R plus CHD completely inhibited biofilm formation for up to 3 weeks for all the organisms tested. The reduction in colonization compared to uncoated PCN catheters was significant for all Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal organisms (P < 0.05). M/R-plus-CHD PCN catheters also produced significant reductions in biofilm colonization relative to M/R PCN catheters for Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, C. glabrata, and C. albicans (P < 0.05).

This study experimentally manipulated contaminated coastal sediments in mesocosms with additions of a common fertiliser to investigate the impact on both bacterial biofilms and macrofouling communities on nearby hard substrates. Field mesocosms were deployed sub-tidally for two weeks in a fully crossed design with two levels of metal contamination (ambient or high) and three levels of organic enrichment (ambient, low and high). Developing biofilm and macrofaunal communities were collected on acetate settlement sheets above the mesocosm sediments and censused with a combination of high-throughput sequencing (biofilm) and microscopy (macrofauna). Organic enrichment of sediments induced compositional shifts in biofilm communities, reducing their diversity, evenness and richness. Furthermore, co-occurrence networks built from microbial assemblages exposed to contaminated sediments displayed reduced connectivity compared to controls, suggesting a more stochastic assembly dynamic, where microbial interactions are reduced. Macrofouling community composition shifted in response to increased enrichment with separate and interactive effects of metals also observed for individual taxa. Specifically, antagonistic stressor interactions were observed for colonial ascidians and arborescent bryozoans; metal contamination decreased abundances of these taxa, except under high enrichment conditions. Together these micro- and macrofaunal responses indicate selection for depauperate, but contaminant-tolerant, communities and a potential breakdown in biotic connectivity through multiple stressor impacts across habitat boundaries.","authors":[{"name":"Jasmin C Lawes"},{"name":"Katherine A Dafforn"},{"name":"Graeme F Clark"},{"name":"Mark V Brown"},{"name":"Emma L Johnston"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial biofilms"},{"word":"Bacterial network connectivity"},{"word":"Contaminated sediments"},{"word":"Heavy metals"},{"word":"Organic enrichment"},{"word":"Sub-tidal fouling communities"}]},"article104":{"pmid":"28319414","title":"Preparation and characterization of ZnO nanoparticles coated by chitosan-linoleic acid; fungal growth and biofilm assay.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This study has been carried out on reviewing the use of new synthetic component of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) coated by Chitosan-linoleic acid (CS-LA) and to assess Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of nanoparticles on clinical samples and biofilm formation in vitro.","authors":[{"name":"S Barad"},{"name":"M Roudbary"},{"name":"A Nasrollahi Omran"},{"name":"M Porgham Daryasari"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida biofilm antifungal."},{"word":"chitosan"},{"word":"linoleic acid"},{"word":"zinc oxide"}]},"article105":{"pmid":"28319101","title":"A Vibrio cholerae autoinducer-receptor pair that controls biofilm formation.","date":"2019-10-08","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-cell communication process that enables bacteria to track cell population density and orchestrate collective behaviors.

His-CalR protected two DNA regions upstream of mfpABC against DNase I digestion, but no binding sites were detected in the promoter region of cpsQ-mfpABC, suggesting a direct and an indirect regulatory manner for mfpABC and cpsQ-mfpABC transcription by CalR, respectively. Collectively, the results presented here confirmed a new physiological role for CalR that acts as an activator for cpsQ-mfpABC and mfpABC transcription.","authors":[{"name":"He Gao"},{"name":"Lingyu Zhang"},{"name":"George Osei-Adjei"},{"name":"Wenhui Yang"},{"name":"Dongsheng Zhou"},{"name":"Xinxiang Huang"},{"name":"Huiying Yang"},{"name":"Zhe Yin"},{"name":"Yiquan Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus"},{"word":"cpsQ-mfpABC"},{"word":"CalR"},{"word":"regulation"}]},"article110":{"pmid":"28317572","title":"Opportunistic Oral Infections.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"An opportunistic infection (OI) is a disease of microbial cause or pathogenesis generally thought to occur in hosts with weakened immunity.

Despite increased knowledge of CF airway microbiomes the interaction between established CF pathogens and other resident microbes and resulting impact on disease progression is poorly understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that oral commensal streptococci of the Anginosus group (AGS) can establish chronic pulmonary infections and become numerically dominant in CF sputa indicating that they play an important role in CF microbiome dynamics. In this study a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (DWW2) of the mucoid alginate overproducing phenotype associated with chronic CF airway infection and a strain of the oral commensal AGS species Streptococcus anginosus (3a) from CF sputum were investigated for their ability to co-exist and their responses to biofilm co-culture. Bacteria in biofilms were quantified, pyocyanin expression by DWW2 was measured and the effect of AGS strain 3a on reversion of DWW2 to a non-mucoidal phenotype investigated. The virulence of DWW2, 3a and colony variant phenotypes of DWW2 in mono- and co-culture were compared in a Galleria mellonella infection model. Co-culture biofilms were formed in normoxic, hypercapnic (10% CO2) and anoxic atmospheres with the streptococcus increasing in number in co-culture, indicating that these bacteria would be able to co-exist and thrive within the heterogeneous microenvironments of the CF airway. The streptococcus caused increased pyocyanin expression by DWW2 and colony variants by stimulating reversion of the mucoid phenotype to the high pyocyanin expressing non-mucoid phenotype. The latter was highly virulent in the infection model with greater virulence when in co-culture with the streptococcus. The results of this study demonstrate that the oral commensal S. anginosus benefits from interaction with P. aeruginosa of the CF associated mucoid phenotype and modulates the behaviour of the pseudomonad in ways that may be clinically relevant.","authors":[{"name":"Richard D Waite"},{"name":"Muhammad R Qureshi"},{"name":"Robert A Whiley"}],"keywords":[]},"article138":{"pmid":"28301290","title":"Production of a halotolerant biofilm from green coffee beans immobilized on loofah fiber (Luffa cylindrica) and its effect on phenanthrene degradation in seawater.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"A biofilm developed from low quality green coffee beans was tested for its capacity to degrade the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), phenanthrene (Phe), in seawater.

The bacterial infection surrounding dental implants can lead to bone loss and, in turn, to implant failure. A promising strategy to prevent these common complications is the development of implant surfaces that inhibit biofilm development. A reproducible and easy-to-use biofilm model as a test system for large scale screening of new implant surfaces with putative antibacterial potency is therefore of major importance. In the present study, we developed a highly reproducible in vitro four-species biofilm model consisting of the highly relevant oral bacterial species Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The application of live/dead staining, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and urea-NaCl fluorescence in situ hybridization (urea-NaCl-FISH) revealed that the four-species biofilm community is robust in terms of biovolume, live/dead distribution and individual species distribution over time. The biofilm community is dominated by S. oralis, followed by V. dispar, A. naeslundii and P. gingivalis. The percentage distribution in this model closely reflects the situation in early native plaques and is therefore well suited as an in vitro model test system. Furthermore, despite its nearly native composition, the multispecies model does not depend on nutrient additives, such as native human saliva or serum, and is an inexpensive, easy to handle and highly reproducible alternative to the available model systems. The 96-well plate format enables high content screening for optimized implant surfaces impeding biofilm formation or the testing of multiple antimicrobial treatment strategies to fight multispecies biofilm infections, both exemplary proven in the manuscript.","authors":[{"name":"Nadine Kommerein"},{"name":"Sascha N Stumpp"},{"name":"Mathias Müsken"},{"name":"Nina Ehlert"},{"name":"Andreas Winkel"},{"name":"Susanne Häussler"},{"name":"Peter Behrens"},{"name":"Falk F R Buettner"},{"name":"Meike Stiesch"}],"keywords":[]},"article148":{"pmid":"28296935","title":"Peptide modification results in the formation of a dimer with a 60-fold enhanced antimicrobial activity.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) occur naturally in numerous organisms and are considered as a class of antibiotics with promising potential against multi-resistant bacteria.

This peptide is produced in small intestinal Paneth cells, stored as an 81-residue precursor peptide named proHD6 in granules, and released into the lumen. One unusual feature of HD6 is that it lacks the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity observed for other human α-defensins, including the Paneth cell peptide human α-defensin 5 (HD5). HD6 exhibits unprecedented self-assembly properties, which confer an unusual host-defense function. HD6 monomers self-assemble into higher-order oligomers termed nanonets, which entrap microbes and prevent invasive gastrointestinal pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes from entering host cells. One possible advantage of this host-defense mechanism is that HD6 helps to keep microbes in the lumen such that they can be excreted or attacked by other components of the immune system, such as recruited neutrophils. In this Account, we report our current understanding of HD6 and focus on work published since 2012 when Bevins and co-workers described the discovery of HD6 nanonets in the literature. First, we present studies that address the biosynthesis, storage, and maturation of HD6, which demonstrate that nature uses a propeptide strategy to spatially and temporally control the formation of HD6 nanonets in the small intestine. The propeptide is stored in Paneth cell granules, and proteolysis occurs during or following release into the lumen, which affords the 32-residue mature peptide that self-assembles. We subsequently highlight structure-function studies that provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis for why HD6 exhibits unusual self-assembly properties compared with other characterized defensins. The disposition of hydrophobic residues in the HD6 primary structure differs from that of other human α-defensins and is an important structural determinant for oligomerization. Lastly, we consider functional studies that illuminate how HD6 contributes to mucosal immunity. We recently discovered that in addition to blocking bacterial invasion into host epithelial cells by Gram-negative and Gram-positive gastrointestinal pathogens, HD6 suppresses virulence traits displayed by the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. In particular, we found that C. albicans biofilm formation, which causes complications in the treatment of candidiasis, is inhibited by HD6. This observation suggests that HD6 may contribute to intestinal homeostasis by helping to keep C. albicans in its commensal state. We intend for this Account to inspire further biochemical, biophysical, and biological investigations that will advance our understanding of HD6 in mucosal immunity and the host-microbe interaction.","authors":[{"name":"Phoom Chairatana"},{"name":"Elizabeth M Nolan"}],"keywords":[]},"article150":{"pmid":"28296352","title":"The role of inoculum and reactor configuration for microbial community composition and dynamics in mainstream partial nitritation anammox reactors.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Implementation of partial nitritation anammox (PNA) in the mainstream (municipal wastewater treatment) is still under investigation.

Therefore, this study investigated the community structure of inocula of different origin and their consecutive community dynamics in four different lab-scale PNA reactors with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. These reactors were operated for almost 1 year and subjected to realistic seasonal temperature fluctuations as in moderate climate regions, that is, from 20°C in summer to 10°C in winter. The sequencing analysis revealed that the bacterial community in the reactors comprised: (1) a nitrifying community (consisting of anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB)); (2) different heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and other putative heterotrophic bacteria (HB). The nitrifying community was the same in all four reactors at the genus level, although the biomasses were of different origin. Community dynamics revealed a stable community in the moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR) in contrast to the sequencing batch reactors (SBR) at the genus level. Moreover, the reactor design seemed to influence the community dynamics, and reactor operation significantly influenced the overall community composition.

In this work, we identified new traits whose expression levels are modulated by light in this pathogen, which comprise not only important determinants related to pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance but also metabolic pathways, which represents a novel concept for chemotrophic bacteria. Indeed, the phenylacetic acid catabolic pathway and trehalose biosynthesis were modulated by light, responses that completely depend on BlsA. We further show that tolerance to some antibiotics and modulation of antioxidant enzyme levels are also influenced by light, likely contributing to bacterial persistence in adverse environments. Also, we present evidence indicating that surfactant production is modulated by light. Finally, the expression of whole pathways and gene clusters, such as genes involved in lipid metabolism and genes encoding components of the type VI secretion system, as well as efflux pumps related to antibiotic resistance, was differentially induced by light.

One of their most interesting properties is that they do not readily select for resistant strains, which is likely due to the fact that their targets are essential for the viability of the bacterial cell. Moreover, genetic engineering allows the design of new tailor-made proteins that may exhibit improved antibacterial properties. One example of this is the chimeric protein CHAPSH3b, which consists of a catalytic domain from the virion-associated peptidoglycan hydrolase of phage vB_SauS-phiIPLA88 (HydH5) and the cell wall binding domain of lysostaphin. CHAPSH3b had previously shown the ability to kill Staphylococcus aureus cells. Here, we demonstrate that this lytic protein also has potential for the control of biofilm-embedded S. aureus cells. Additionally, subinhibitory doses of CHAPSH3b can decrease biofilm formation by some S. aureus strains. Transcriptional analysis revealed that exposure of S. aureus cells to this enzyme leads to the downregulation of several genes coding for bacterial autolysins. One of these proteins, namely, the major autolysin AtlA, is known to participate in staphylococcal biofilm development. Interestingly, an atl mutant strain did not display inhibition of biofilm development when grown at subinhibitory concentrations of CHAPSH3b, contrary to the observations made for the parental and complemented strains. Also, deletion of atl led to low-level resistance to CHAPSH3b and the endolysin LysH5.

The abundance of ARG in biofilms sharply decreased after addition of high concentrations of sulfonamides, but this was not observed in the mesocosms treated with low concentrations of sulfonamides. Sulfonamide degradation was faster in polluted waters and at high concentrations of sulfonamide (and lower ARG abundances), suggesting that both degradation and ARG are two complementary resistance strategies employed by the microbial community.

In this study, we found that a small phenolic compound, Biatriosporin D (BD), isolated from an endolichenic fungus, Biatriospora sp., displayed anti-virulence activity by inhibiting adhesion, hyphal morphogenesis and biofilm formation of C. albicans. Of note is the high efficacy of BD in preventing filamentation with a much lower dose than its MIC value. Furthermore, BD prolonged the survival of worms infected by C. albicans in vivo. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis, exogenous cAMP rescue experiments and intracellular cAMP measurements revealed that BD regulates the Ras1-cAMP-Efg1 pathway by reducing cAMP levels to inhibit the hyphal formation. Further investigation showed that BD could upregulate Dpp3 to synthesize much more farnesol, which could inhibit the activity of Cdc35 and reduce the generation of cAMP. Taken together, these findings indicate that BD stimulates the expression of Dpp3 to synthesize more farnesol that directly inhibits the Cdc35 activity, reducing intracellular cAMP and thereby disrupting the morphologic transition and attenuating the virulence of C. albicans.

However, recent molecular evidence indicates that multiple levels of specificity restrict CDI toxin delivery and activity to the same bacterial strain, and that CDI system proteins can mediate cooperative behaviors among 'self' cells, a phenomenon called contact-dependent signaling (CDS). Here we review these recent findings and discuss potential biological and evolutionary implications of CDI system-mediated interbacterial competition and cooperation.","authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth S Danka"},{"name":"Erin C Garcia"},{"name":"Peggy A Cotter"}],"keywords":[]},"article184":{"pmid":"28285703","title":"Biofilm processes in treating mariculture wastewater may be a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Antibiotics are heavily used in Chinese mariculture, but only a small portion of the added antibiotics are absorbed by living creatures.

The results demonstrated that there was no significant effect of sub-μg/L-sub-mg/L concentrations of antibiotics on TOC removal. Moreover, the relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) in MBBR biofilm increased because of selective pressure of antibiotics. In addition, antibiotics decreased the diversity of the biofilm bacterial community and altered bacterial community structure. These findings provide an empirical basis for the development of appropriate practices for mariculture, and suggest that disinfection and advanced oxidation should be applied to eliminate antibiotics, ARGs, and ARB from mariculture wastewater.","authors":[{"name":"Shuai Li"},{"name":"Shenghua Zhang"},{"name":"Chengsong Ye"},{"name":"Wenfang Lin"},{"name":"Menglu Zhang"},{"name":"Lihua Chen"},{"name":"Jinmei Li"},{"name":"Xin Yu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ARB"},{"word":"ARGs"},{"word":"Antibiotics"},{"word":"Bacterial community structure"},{"word":"Mariculture wastewater"}]},"article185":{"pmid":"28285238","title":"Operation of passive membrane systems for drinking water treatment.","date":"2017-12-01","abs":"The widespread adoption of submerged hollow fibre ultrafiltration (UF) for drinking water treatment is currently hindered by the complexity and cost of these membrane systems, especially in small/remote communities. Most of the complexity is associated with auxiliary fouling control measures, which include backwashing, air sparging and chemical cleaning. Recent studies have demonstrated that sustained operation without fouling control measures is possible, but little is known regarding the conditions under which extended operation can be sustained with minimal to no fouling control measures. The present study investigated the contribution of different auxiliary fouling control measures to the permeability that can be sustained, with the intent of minimizing the mechanical and operational complexity of submerged hollow fiber UF membrane systems while maximizing their throughput capacity. Sustained conditions could be achieved without backwashing, air sparging or chemical cleaning (i.e. passive operation), indicating that these fouling control measures can be eliminated, substantially simplifying the mechanical and operational complexity of submerged hollow fiber UF systems. The adoption of hydrostatic pressure (i.e. gravity) to provide the driving force for permeation further reduced the system complexity. Approximately 50% of the organic material in the raw water was removed during treatment. The sustained passive operation and effective removal of organic material was likely due to the microbial community that established itself on the membrane surface. The permeability that could be sustained was however only approximately 20% of that which can be maintained with fouling control measures. Retaining a small amount of air sparging (i.e. a few minutes daily) and incorporating a daily 1-h relaxation (i.e. permeate flux interruption) period prior to sparging more than doubled the permeability that could be sustained. Neither the approach used to interrupt the permeate flux nor that developed to draw air into the system for sparging using gravity add substantial mechanical or operational complexity to the system. The high throughput capacity that can be sustained by eliminating all but a couple of simple fouling control measures make passive membrane systems ideally suited to provide high quality water especially where access to financial resources, technical expertise and/or electrical power is limited.","authors":[{"name":"P A Oka"},{"name":"N Khadem"},{"name":"P R Bérubé"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Gravity permeation"},{"word":"Low energy"},{"word":"Membrane relaxation"},{"word":"Small system"}]},"article186":{"pmid":"28285095","title":"Quantitative proteomic analysis of extracellular matrix extracted from mono- and dual-species biofilms of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis.","date":"2017-04-24","abs":"The Gram-negative bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis are members of a complex dental biofilm associated with periodontal disease.

The objectives of this study were to start investigate if heavy-metal based antifouling paints can pose a risk for co-selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and, if so, identify the underlying genetic basis. Plastic panels with one side painted with copper and zinc-containing antifouling paint were submerged in a Swedish marina and biofilms from both sides of the panels were harvested after 2.5-4weeks. DNA was isolated from the biofilms and subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Biofilm bacteria were cultured on marine agar supplemented with tetracycline, gentamicin, copper sulfate or zinc sulfate. Biofilm communities from painted surfaces displayed lower taxonomic diversity and enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria. Bacteria from these communities showed increased resistance to both heavy metals and tetracycline but not to gentamicin. Significantly higher abundance of metal and biocide resistance genes was observed, whereas mobile antibiotic resistance genes were not enriched in these communities. In contrast, we found an enrichment of chromosomal RND efflux system genes, including such with documented ability to confer decreased susceptibility to both antibiotics and biocides/heavy metals. This was paralleled by increased abundances of integron-associated integrase and ISCR transposase genes. The results show that the heavy metal-based antifouling paint exerts a strong selection pressure on marine bacterial communities and can co-select for certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, likely by favoring species and strains carrying genes that provide cross-resistance. Although this does not indicate an immediate risk for promotion of mobile antibiotic resistance, the clear increase of genes involved in mobilizing DNA provides a foundation for increased opportunities for gene transfer in such communities, which might also involve yet unknown resistance mechanisms.","authors":[{"name":"Carl-Fredrik Flach"},{"name":"Chandan Pal"},{"name":"Carl Johan Svensson"},{"name":"Erik Kristiansson"},{"name":"Marcus Östman"},{"name":"Johan Bengtsson-Palme"},{"name":"Mats Tysklind"},{"name":"D G Joakim Larsson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Integron"},{"word":"Marine bacteria"},{"word":"Metagenomics"},{"word":"Metal resistance"},{"word":"RND efflux pump"}]},"article189":{"pmid":"28284510","title":"Breast-implant texturing associated with delamination of capsular layers: A histological analysis of the double capsule phenomenon.","date":"2018-04-30","abs":"Macro-texturing of breast implants was developed with the double goal of improving implant stabilization within the breast cavity and decreasing the rate of capsular contractures.

The principal component of biofilm is a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) which is composed of a beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine polymer synthesized by an enzyme (N-acetylglucosamine transferase) encoded by the ica operon found on the bacterial chromosome. This operon is composed of four genes (A, B, C, and D), and a transposable element IS256. In this study, we aimed to determine the biofilm production characteristics of invasive/non-invasive staphylococcus isolates and different staphylococcus species. Biofilm production of 166 staphylococci was phenotypically investigated on Congo Red Agar (CRA); the presence of icaA, icaD and IS256 genes were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 74 of the isolates (44.6%) were identified as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 25 (15.1%) as methicillin sensitive S.aureus (MSSA), 25 (37.3%) as Staphylococcus hominis, 20 (12%) as S.epidermidis, ten (15%) as Staphylococcus haemolyticus, nine (13.4%) as Staphylococcus capitis, two (3%) Staphylococcus saprophyticus and one (1.5%) as Staphylococcus warnerii. Of the MRSA strains, 52 were isolated from blood and 22 from nose; all MSSA strains were isolated from nose cultures. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) strains were composed of invasive and non-invasive strains isolated from nose, catheter tip and blood cultures from patients with catheter. Production with CRA method was found to be statistically significant in invasive isolates (p< 0.001). It is concluded that; as the biofilm formation capacity of invasive isolates can cause refractory infections and the importance of carriage and hospital infections of these bacteria, it is important to prevent the spread of these isolates. A combination of phenotypic and genotypic tests is recommended for the investigation of biofilm formation in staphylococci. 40.3% of the CoNS isolates, and 85.8% of S.aureus isolates produced biofilm on CRA (p< 0.001) and with PCR method the ratio of carrying three genes was found to be statistically important in S.aureus when compared with CoNS.

An electronic and manual literature search was conducted by three independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register databases for articles up to September 2016 with no language restriction. Local bone metabolism is subject to signals from systemic calcium-phosphate homeostasis and bone remodeling. Three areas of interest were reviewed due to recent reported compromises in bone healing including the putative effects of (1) cholesterol, (2) hyperlipidemia, and (3) low vitamin D intake. Moreover, the prominent influence of osteocytes and immune cells is discussed as being key regulators during dental implant osseointegration and maintenance. These cells are of crucial importance in the presence of biofilm accumulation and their associated byproducts that leads to hard and soft tissue breakdown; the so called peri-implantitis. Factors that could negatively impact osteoclastogenesis or osteal macrophage activation should be monitored in future research including implant placement/torque protocols, bone characteristics, as well as meticulous maintenance programs to favor osseointegration and future long-term stability and success of dental implants. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PD-2, was isolated from the microalga Prorocentrum donghaiense, and its N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated QS system was verified. In this study, we analyzed the AHLs profile of strain PD-2. Two AHLs, 3-oxo-C8-HSL and 3-oxo-C10-HSL, were detected using a biosensor overlay assay and GC-MS methods. Two complete AHL-QS systems (designated zlaI/R and zlbI/R) were identified in the genome of strain PD-2. When expressed in Escherichia coli, both zlaI and zlbI genes could each produce 3-oxo-C8-HSL and 3-oxo-C10-HSL. Algicidal activity was investigated by evaluating the inhibitory rate (IR) of microalgae growth by measuring the fluorescence of viable cells. We found that the metabolites of strain PD-2 had algicidal activity against its host P. donghaiense (IR 84.81%) and two other red tide microalgae, Phaeocystis globosa (IR 78.91%) and Alexandrium tamarense (IR 67.14%). β-cyclodextrin which binds to AHLs and inhibits the QS system reduced the algicidal activity more than 50%. This indicates that inhibiting the QS system may affect the algicidal metabolites production of strain PD-2. Our study indicated that a QS-regulated algicidal system may play a potential role in the process of red tides disintegration. QS might be a potential way to control red tides.","authors":[{"name":"Wendan Chi"},{"name":"Li Zheng"},{"name":"Changfei He"},{"name":"Bin Han"},{"name":"Minggang Zheng"},{"name":"Wei Gao"},{"name":"Chengjun Sun"},{"name":"Gefei Zhou"},{"name":"Xiangxing Gao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AHLs"},{"word":"Algicidal activity"},{"word":"Microalgae-associated bacteria"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"β-Cyclodextrin"}]},"article204":{"pmid":"28281171","title":"The Stent Patency and Migration Rate of Different Shaped Plastic Stents in Bile Flow Phantom Model and In Vivo Animal Bile Duct Dilation Model.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"In research and development of biliary plastic stents (PS), continuous efforts have been made to overcome short patency time and high rate of migration.

The synergistic relationship between these two species has been deeply explored in many studies. In the present study, the effect of alkaloid nicotine on the interspecies between S. mutans and C. albicans is explored. We developed a dual-species biofilm model and studied biofilm biomass, biofilm structure, synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), and expression of glucosyltransferases (Gtfs). Biofilm formation and bacterial and fungal cell numbers in dual-species biofilms increased in the presence of nicotine. More C. albicans cells were present in the dual-species biofilms in the nicotine-treated groups as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The synthesis of EPS was increased by 1 mg/ml of nicotine as detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The result of qRT-PCR showed gtfs expression was upregulated when 1 mg/ml of nicotine was used. We speculate that nicotine promoted the growth of S. mutans, and more S. mutans cells attracted more C. albicans cells due to the interaction between two species. Since S. mutans and C. albicans are putative pathogens for dental caries, the enhancement of the synergistic relationship by nicotine may contribute to caries development in smokers.","authors":[{"name":"Shiyu Liu"},{"name":"Wei Qiu"},{"name":"Keke Zhang"},{"name":"Xuedong Zhou"},{"name":"Biao Ren"},{"name":"Jinzhi He"},{"name":"Xin Xu"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"},{"name":"Mingyun Li"}],"keywords":[]},"article207":{"pmid":"28280714","title":"Anti-Biofilm Activity of a Long-Chain Fatty Aldehyde from Antarctic Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 against Staphylococcus epidermidis Biofilm.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a harmless human skin colonizer responsible for ~20% of orthopedic device-related infections due to its capability to form biofilm. Nowadays there is an interest in the development of anti-biofilm molecules. Marine bacteria represent a still underexploited source of biodiversity able to synthesize a broad range of bioactive compounds, including anti-biofilm molecules. Previous results have demonstrated that the culture supernatant of Antarctic marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 impairs the formation of S. epidermidis biofilm. Further, evidence supports the hydrophobic nature of the active molecule, which has been suggested to act as a signal molecule. In this paper we describe an efficient activity-guided purification protocol which allowed us to purify this anti-biofilm molecule and structurally characterize it by NMR and mass spectrometry analyses. Our results demonstrate that the anti-biofilm molecule is pentadecanal, a long-chain fatty aldehyde, whose anti-S. epidermidis biofilm activity has been assessed using both static and dynamic biofilm assays. The specificity of its action on S. epidermidis biofilm has been demonstrated by testing chemical analogs of pentadecanal differing either in the length of the aliphatic chain or in their functional group properties. Further, indications of the mode of action of pentadecanal have been collected by studying the bioluminescence of a Vibrio harveyi reporter strain for the detection of autoinducer AI-2 like activities. The data collected suggest that pentadecanal acts as an AI-2 signal. Moreover, the aldehyde metabolic role and synthesis in the Antarctic source strain has been investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of an anti-biofilm molecule form from cold-adapted bacteria and on the action of a long-chain fatty aldehyde acting as an anti-biofilm molecule against S. epidermidis.","authors":[{"name":"Angela Casillo"},{"name":"Rosanna Papa"},{"name":"Annarita Ricciardelli"},{"name":"Filomena Sannino"},{"name":"Marcello Ziaco"},{"name":"Marco Tilotta"},{"name":"Laura Selan"},{"name":"Gennaro Marino"},{"name":"Maria M Corsaro"},{"name":"Maria L Tutino"},{"name":"Marco Artini"},{"name":"Ermenegilda Parrilli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"long fatty acid aldehyde"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"28280492","title":"Mitochondrial Complex V α Subunit Is Critical for Candida albicans Pathogenicity through Modulating Multiple Virulence Properties.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The α subunit (ATP1) is a vital component of mitochondrial complex V which counts for the majority of cellular ATP production in a living organism.

We characterized the interaction using biofilm assays and evaluated the effect of miconazole treatment using in vitro and in vivo assays. Finally, we assessed the impact of biofilm extracellular matrix (ECM) on these interactions. Data indicated that the C. albicans mycofilms supported adhesion and colonization by S. aureus through close interactions with hyphal elements, significantly increasing S. aureus biofilm formation throughout biofilm maturation. Miconazole sensitivity was shown to be reduced in both mono- and dual-species biofilms compared to planktonic cells. Within a three-dimensional biofilm model sensitivity was also hindered. Galleria mellonella survival analysis showed both enhanced pathogenicity of the dual-species infection, which was concomitantly desensitized to miconazole treatment.

Biofilms' resistance to the host immunity and antibiotics makes this kind of infection particularly intractable. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a ubiquitous facet of innate immunity in animals. However, AMPs activity was studied mainly on planktonic bacteria and little is known about their effects on biofilms. We studied structure and anti-biofilm activity of AMP complex produced by the maggots of blowfly Calliphora vicina living in environments extremely contaminated by biofilm-forming germs. The complex exhibits strong cell killing and matrix destroying activity against human pathogenic antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms as well as non-toxicity to human immune cells. The complex was found to contain AMPs from defensin, cecropin, diptericin and proline-rich peptide families simultaneously expressed in response to bacterial infection and encoded by hundreds mRNA isoforms. All the families combine cell killing and matrix destruction mechanisms, but the ratio of these effects and antibacterial activity spectrum are specific to each family. These molecules dramatically extend the list of known anti-biofilm AMPs. However, pharmacological development of the complex as a whole can provide significant advantages compared with a conventional one-component approach. In particular, a similar level of activity against biofilm and planktonic bacteria (MBEC/MIC ratio) provides the complex advantage over conventional antibiotics. Available methods of the complex in situ and in vitro biosynthesis make this idea practicable.","authors":[{"name":"Natalia Gordya"},{"name":"Andrey Yakovlev"},{"name":"Anastasia Kruglikova"},{"name":"Dmitry Tulin"},{"name":"Evdokia Potolitsina"},{"name":"Tatyana Suborova"},{"name":"Domenico Bordo"},{"name":"Camillo Rosano"},{"name":"Sergey Chernysh"}],"keywords":[]},"article214":{"pmid":"28278272","title":"Additional regulatory activities of MrkH for the transcriptional expression of the Klebsiella pneumoniae mrk genes: Antagonist of H-NS and repressor.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections. One of the main virulence determinants of K. pneumoniae is the type 3 pilus (T3P). T3P helps the bacterial interaction to both abiotic and biotic surfaces and it is crucial for the biofilm formation. T3P is genetically organized in three transcriptional units: the mrkABCDF polycistronic operon, the mrkHI bicistronic operon and the mrkJ gene. MrkH is a regulatory protein encoded in the mrkHI operon, which positively regulates the mrkA pilin gene and its own expression. In contrast, the H-NS nucleoid protein represses the transcriptional expression of T3P. Here we reported that MrkH and H-NS positively and negatively regulate mrkJ expression, respectively, by binding to the promoter of mrkJ. MrkH protein recognized a sequence located at position -63.5 relative to the transcriptional start site of mrkJ gene. Interestingly, our results show that, in addition to its known function as classic transcriptional activator, MrkH also positively controls the expression of mrk genes by acting as an anti-repressor of H-NS; moreover, our results support the notion that high levels of MrkH repress T3P expression.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of exposure of CAP against mature biofilm for different time intervals and to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with vitamin C. We demonstrate that CAP is not very effective against 48 h mature bacterial biofilms of several common opportunistic pathogens: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, if bacterial biofilms are pre-treated with vitamin C for 15 min before exposure to CAP, a significantly stronger bactericidal effect can be obtained. Vitamin C pretreatment enhances the bactericidal effect of cold plasma by reducing the viability from 10 to 2% in E. coli biofilm, 50 to 11% in P. aeruginosa, and 61 to 18% in S. epidermidis biofilm.

Here, we demonstrate that the P. aeruginosa gene PA4463 [hibernation promoting factor (HPF)], but not the ribosome modulation factor (PA3049), is required for ribosomal RNA preservation during prolonged nutrient starvation conditions. Single-cell-level studies using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and growth in microfluidic drops demonstrate that, in the absence of hpf, the rRNA abundances of starved cells decrease to levels that cause them to lose their ability to resuscitate from starvation, leaving intact nondividing cells. P. aeruginosa defective in the stringent response also had reduced ability to resuscitate from dormancy. However, FISH analysis of the starved stringent response mutant showed a bimodal response where the individual cells contained either abundant or low ribosome content, compared with the wild-type strain.

To understand how bacteria migrate and proliferate to form complex multicellular behaviours such as biofilms, it is desirable to track individual bacteria and detect cell division events.

Furthermore, bacteria may detach, migrate close to other bacteria and may orientate themselves at an angle to the horizontal plane. Our system trains a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) model from tracked and aligned bacteria division sequences. The HCRF model classifies a set of image frames as division or otherwise. The performance of our HCRF model is compared with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The results show that a HCRF classifier outperforms a HMM classifier.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how colistin affects both the extracellular biofilm matrix and the embedded bacteria in biofilms of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a species with intrinsic resistance to colistin, and colistin-susceptible Escherichia coli. Biofilms of MRSA and E. coli were treated with different concentrations of colistin. The minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) and the effectiveness of colistin at reducing the planktonic fraction were defined as the remaining viable bacteria measured as CFU/mL. In addition, biofilm-embedded cells were LIVE/DEAD-stained and were analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Quantification of the biofilm CLSM images was conducted using an open-access in-house algorithm (qBA). In contrast to MRSA, E. coli biofilms and planktonic cells were significantly reduced by colistin in a concentration-dependent manner. Nevertheless, colistin has been shown to exert a matrix-reducing effect following treatment both in laboratory strains and clinical isolates of MRSA and E. coli. Because exposure to colistin rapidly triggered the emergence of highly resistant clones, monotherapy with colistin should be applied with caution. These results suggest that colistin destabilises the biofilm matrix structure even in species with intrinsic colistin resistance, such as S. aureus, leading to the release of planktonic cells that are more susceptible to antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Mareike Klinger-Strobel"},{"name":"Claudia Stein"},{"name":"Christina Forstner"},{"name":"Oliwia Makarewicz"},{"name":"Mathias W Pletz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Biofilm quantification"},{"word":"Combined antibiotic treatment"},{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"Nosocomial infection"},{"word":"Polymyxin"}]},"article248":{"pmid":"28267493","title":"Biological, mechanical, optical and physicochemical properties of natural chitin films obtained from the dorsal pronotum and the wing of cockroach.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"In previous studies, chitin-based films were produced from chitin nanofibers in dust form and fully characterized.

It can also heal autonomously from repeated damage, through mussel-inspired catechol-mediated hydrogen bonding and aromatic interactions, exhibiting great potential in bioengineering applications.","authors":[{"name":"Lin Li"},{"name":"Bin Yan"},{"name":"Jingqi Yang"},{"name":"Weijuan Huang"},{"name":"Lingyun Chen"},{"name":"Hongbo Zeng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antifouling"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"catechol"},{"word":"hydrogel"},{"word":"self-healing"}]},"article251":{"pmid":"28266778","title":"Haematoxylin and eosin staining identifies medium to large bacterial aggregates with a reliable specificity: A comparative analysis of follicular bacterial aggregates in axillary biopsies using peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization and haematoxylin and eosin staining.","date":"2018-07-31","abs":"Although peptide nucleic acid (PNA), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) are the reference tools in the study of bacterial aggregates/biofilms, it may also be rather time-consuming.

Prominent human and/or animal pathogens that express a T2S system(s) include Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica T2S-expressing plant pathogens include Dickeya dadantii, Erwinia amylovora, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas campestris, Xanthomonas oryzae, and Xylella fastidiosa T2S also occurs in nonpathogenic bacteria, facilitating symbioses, among other things. The output of a T2S system can range from only one to dozens of secreted proteins, encompassing a diverse array of toxins, degradative enzymes, and other effectors, including novel proteins. Pathogenic processes mediated by T2S include the death of host cells, degradation of tissue, suppression of innate immunity, adherence to host surfaces, biofilm formation, invasion into and growth within host cells, nutrient assimilation, and alterations in host ion flux. The reach of T2S is perhaps best illustrated by those bacteria that clearly use it for both environmental survival and virulence; e.g., L. pneumophila employs T2S for infection of amoebae, growth within lung cells, dampening of cytokines, and tissue destruction. This minireview provides an update on the types of bacteria that have T2S, the kinds of proteins that are secreted via T2S, and how T2S substrates promote infection.","authors":[{"name":"Nicholas P Cianciotto"},{"name":"Richard C White"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Legionella"},{"word":"T2S"},{"word":"Vibrio"},{"word":"animal pathogens"},{"word":"degradative enzymes"},{"word":"human pathogens"},{"word":"plant pathogens"},{"word":"toxins"},{"word":"type II secretion"}]},"article262":{"pmid":"28264443","title":"The Structure-Activity Relationship of Pterostilbene Against Candida albicans Biofilms.","date":"2018-12-07","abs":"Candida albicans biofilms contribute to invasive infections and dramatic drug resistance, and anti-biofilm agents are urgently needed in the clinic.

Our results demonstrated that there was less metabolic activity in dual species biofilms compared to S. aureus biofilms.

The largest effect on metabolic activity was observed in biofilms of S. aureus Mu50 and S. epidermidis ET-024. A transcriptomic analysis of these dual species biofilms showed that urease genes and genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism were downregulated in comparison to monospecies biofilms. These results were subsequently confirmed by phenotypic assays. As metabolic activity is related to acid production, the pH in dual species biofilms was slightly higher compared to S. aureus Mu50 biofilms. Our results showed that S. epidermidis ET-024 in dual species biofilms inhibits metabolic activity of S. aureus Mu50, leading to less acid production. As a consequence, less urease activity is required to compensate for low pH. Importantly, this effect was biofilm-specific. Also S. aureus Mu50 genes encoding virulence-associated proteins (Spa, SplF and Dps) were upregulated in dual species biofilms compared to monospecies biofilms and using Caenorhabditis elegans infection assays, we demonstrated that more nematodes survived when co-infected with S. epidermidis ET-024 and S. aureus mutants lacking functional spa, splF or dps genes, compared to nematodes infected with S. epidermidis ET-024 and wild- type S. aureus.

The sensor-regulator hybrid SagS plays a central role in biofilm development by enabling the switch from the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth, and by facilitating the transition of biofilm cells to a highly tolerant state. However, the mechanism by which SagS accomplishes both functions is unknown. SagS harbours a periplasmic sensory HmsP, and phosphorelay HisKA and Rec domains. SagS domain was used as constructs and site-directed mutagenesis to elucidate how SagS performs its dual functions. It was demonstrated that HisKA-Rec and the phospho-signalling between SagS and BfiS contribute to the switch to the biofilm mode of growth, but not to the tolerant state. Instead, expression of SagS domain constructs harbouring HmsP rendered ΔsagS biofilm cells as recalcitrant to antimicrobial agents as wild-type biofilms, likely by restoring BrlR production and cellular c-di-GMP levels to wild-type levels. Restoration of biofilm tolerance by HmsP was independent of biofilm biomass accumulation, RsmA, RsmYZ, HptB and BfiSR-downstream targets. Our findings thus suggest that SagS likely makes use of a divide-and-conquer mechanism to regulate its dual switch function, by activating two distinct regulatory networks via its individual domains.","authors":[{"name":"Olga E Petrova"},{"name":"Kajal Gupta"},{"name":"Julie Liao"},{"name":"James S Goodwine"},{"name":"Karin Sauer"}],"keywords":[]},"article270":{"pmid":"28261574","title":"Persistent and Recurrent Bacterial Bronchitis-A Paradigm Shift in Our Understanding of Chronic Respiratory Disease.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The recent recognition that the conducting airways are not sterile and that they have their own dynamic microbiome, together with the rapid advances in our understanding of microbial biofilms and their roles in the causation of respiratory diseases (such as chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, and chronic otitis media), permit us to update the vicious circle hypothesis of the causation of bronchiectasis.

Due to a range of mechanisms for adaptation, survival and resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, infections by P. aeruginosa strains can be life-threatening and it is emerging worldwide as public health threat. This review highlights the diversity of mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa promotes its survival and persistence in various environments and particularly at different stages of pathogenesis. We will review the importance and complexity of regulatory networks and genotypic-phenotypic variations known as adaptive radiation by which P. aeruginosa adjusts physiological processes for adaptation and survival in response to environmental cues and stresses. Accordingly, we will review the central regulatory role of quorum sensing and signaling systems by nucleotide-based second messengers resulting in different lifestyles of P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, various regulatory proteins will be discussed which form a plethora of controlling systems acting at transcriptional level for timely expression of genes enabling rapid responses to external stimuli and unfavorable conditions. Antibiotic resistance is a natural trait for P. aeruginosa and multiple mechanisms underlying different forms of antibiotic resistance will be discussed here. The importance of each mechanism in conferring resistance to various antipseudomonal antibiotics and their prevalence in clinical strains will be described. The underlying principles for acquiring resistance leading pan-drug resistant strains will be summarized. A future outlook emphasizes the need for collaborative international multidisciplinary efforts to translate current knowledge into strategies to prevent and treat P. aeruginosa infections while reducing the rate of antibiotic resistance and avoiding the spreading of resistant strains.","authors":[{"name":"M Fata Moradali"},{"name":"Shirin Ghods"},{"name":"Bernd H A Rehm"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article273":{"pmid":"28261188","title":"Marine Sponge-Derived Streptomyces sp.

Indwelling medical devices and contact lenses are ideal ecological niches for formation of staphylococcal biofilms. Bacteria within biofilms are known to display reduced susceptibilities to antimicrobials and are protected from the host immune system. High rates of acquired antibiotic resistances in staphylococci and other biofilm-forming bacteria further hamper treatment options and highlight the need for new anti-biofilm strategies. Here, we aimed to evaluate the potential of marine sponge-derived actinomycetes in inhibiting biofilm formation of several strains of S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results from in vitro biofilm-formation assays, as well as scanning electron and confocal microscopy, revealed that an organic extract derived from the marine sponge-associated bacterium Streptomyces sp. SBT343 significantly inhibited staphylococcal biofilm formation on polystyrene, glass and contact lens surfaces, without affecting bacterial growth. The extract also displayed similar antagonistic effects towards the biofilm formation of other S. epidermidis and S. aureus strains tested but had no inhibitory effects towards Pseudomonas biofilms. Interestingly the extract, at lower effective concentrations, did not exhibit cytotoxic effects on mouse fibroblast, macrophage and human corneal epithelial cell lines. Chemical analysis by High Resolution Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) of the Streptomyces sp. SBT343 extract proportion revealed its chemical richness and complexity. Preliminary physico-chemical characterization of the extract highlighted the heat-stable and non-proteinaceous nature of the active component(s). The combined data suggest that the Streptomyces sp. SBT343 extract selectively inhibits staphylococcal biofilm formation without interfering with bacterial cell viability. Due to absence of cell toxicity, the extract might represent a good starting material to develop a future remedy to block staphylococcal biofilm formation on contact lenses and thereby to prevent intractable contact lens-mediated ocular infections.","authors":[{"name":"Srikkanth Balasubramanian"},{"name":"Eman M Othman"},{"name":"Daniel Kampik"},{"name":"Helga Stopper"},{"name":"Ute Hentschel"},{"name":"Wilma Ziebuhr"},{"name":"Tobias A Oelschlaeger"},{"name":"Usama R Abdelmohsen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptomyces"},{"word":"actinomycetes"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"contact lens"},{"word":"marine sponges"},{"word":"staphylococci"}]},"article274":{"pmid":"28261183","title":"Effect of Quorum Quenching Lactonase in Clinical Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Comparison with Quorum Sensing Inhibitors.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram negative pathogenic bacterium involved in many human infections including otitis, keratitis, pneumonia, and diabetic foot ulcers. P. aeruginosa uses a communication system, referred to as quorum sensing (QS), to adopt a group behavior by synchronizing the expression of certain genes.

Many efforts have been dedicated to the development of quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) and quorum quenching (QQ) agents to disrupt QS. QQ enzymes have been particularly considered as they may act in a catalytic way without entering the cell. Here we focus on the lactonase SsoPox which was previously investigated for its ability to degrade the signaling molecules, acyl-homoserine lactones, in particular on the engineered variant SsoPox-W263I. We highlight the potential of SsoPox-W263I to inhibit the virulence of 51 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from diabetic foot ulcers by decreasing the secretion of two virulence factors, proteases and pyocyanin, as well as biofilm formation. We further compared the effect of SsoPox-W263I to the comprehensively described QSI, 5-fluorouracil and C-30.

Primary hOBs and S. epidermidis were co‑cultured on cylindrical titanium samples (Ti6Al4V) coated with pure magnesium via magnetron sputtering (5 µm thickness) for 7 days. Uncoated titanium test samples served as controls. Vital hOBs were identified by trypan blue staining at days 2 and 7. Planktonic S. epidermidis were quantified by counting the number of colony forming units (CFU). The quantification of biofilm‑bound S. epidermidis on the surfaces of test samples was performed by ultrasonic treatment and CFU counting at days 2 and 7. The number of planktonic and biofilm‑bound S. epidermidis on the magnesium‑coated samples decreased by four orders of magnitude when compared with the titanium control following 7 days of co‑culture. The number of vital hOBs on the magnesium‑coated samples was observed to increase (40,000 cells/ml) when compared with the controls (20,000 cells/ml). The results of the present study indicate that rapidly corroding magnesium‑coated titanium may be a viable coating material that possesses antibacterial and biocompatible properties.

Crucial concerns focus on inhibiting biofilm formation by antibiotic‑resistant bacteria, and preventing scar formation by fibroblastic hyperproliferation.

The present study used Staphylococcus epidermidis (strain ATCC 35984) to assess the effects of TBO‑PDT on bacterial adherence and biofilm formation, using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), tissue culture plating (TCP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Primary human fibroblast cells were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of TBO‑PDT using the 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and CLSM. Six different treatment groups were investigated: Medium only [tryptone soy broth (TSB) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)]; red light control (light dose, 30 J/cm2); TBO group (50 mM TBO); TBO‑PDT1 (TBO irradiated with 10 J/cm2); TBO‑PDT2 (TBO irradiated with 20 J/cm2); and TBO‑PDT3 (TBO irradiated with 30 J/cm2). The results of the S. epidermidis adhesion assay indicated that the TSB, light and TBO groups exhibited significant bacterial adherence, compared with the TBO‑PDT groups. Analysis of biofilm formation revealed significant light dose‑dependent differences between the TBO‑PDT groups and the TSB, light, and TBO groups. Furthermore, SEM indicated fewer colony masses in the TBO‑PDT groups compared with the control groups. The MTT assay for fibroblastic cell toxicity demonstrated ~1.1, 4.6, 14.5, 29.7 and 43.4% reduction in optical density for the light, TBO, TBO‑PDT1, TBO‑PDT2 and TBO‑PDT3 groups, respectively, compared with the DMEM control group. There was no difference in toxicity between the light and control groups, however, there were significant differences among the TBO‑PDT groups. Finally, alterations in fibroblast morphology and cell spreading were revealed by CLSM, following TBO‑PDT treatment. TBO‑PDT inhibited bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, and exhibited significant cytotoxic effects on human fibroblasts. These results indicate that the local use of TBO‑PDT in limb lesions may be a useful treatment method for inhibiting bacterial biofilm formation and fibroblastic hyperproliferation, which may prevent infectious hypertrophic scar formation.","authors":[{"name":"Xin Li"},{"name":"Zizhong Liu"},{"name":"Houfang Liu"},{"name":"Xi Chen"},{"name":"Yue Liu"},{"name":"Honglue Tan"}],"keywords":[]},"article280":{"pmid":"28259673","title":"Unexplored endemic fruit species from Brazil: Antibiofilm properties, insights into mode of action, and systemic toxicity of four Eugenia spp.","date":"2017-05-05","abs":"Brazilian endemic fruit species have aroused attention due to their highly valuable, yet unexplored, agro-industrial, food and therapeutic potential.

The synthesis of c-di-GMP is catalyzed by di-guanylate cyclases (DGCs) and the enzymes are characterized by the presence of a conserved GGDEF domain. In the sequenced staphylococcal genomes, gdpS is the only gene encoding a GGDEF domain-containing protein. Previous studies have shown that gdpS contributes to staphylococcal biofilm formation, but its effect remains under debate. In the present study, we deleted gdpS in Staphylococcus epidermidis strain RP62A. Disruption of gdpS in this strain impaired biofilm formation under both static and dynamic flow conditions, suggesting that gdpS act as a positive regulator of biofilm development in this high-biofilm-forming isolate. The predicted translational start site of gdpS in S. epidermidis differs between the Refseq database and the Genbank database. By using site-directed mutagenesis and Western blot analysis, we determined GdpS is translated from the start codon annotated in the Refseq database. In addition, mutation in the GGDEF domain did not affect the ability of gdpS to complement the biofilm defect of the gdpS mutant. Heterologous di-guanylate cyclases expressed in trans failed to complement the gdpS mutant. These results confirmed that gdpS modulates staphylococcal biofilm independently of c-di-GMP signaling pathway. Furthermore, mutations of the start codon did not abolish the capacity of gdpS to enhance biofilm formation. Taken together, these findings indicated that the S. epidermidis gdpS regulates biofilm formation independently of its protein-coding function.","authors":[{"name":"Tao Zhu"},{"name":"Yanfeng Zhao"},{"name":"Yang Wu"},{"name":"Di Qu"}],"keywords":[]},"article282":{"pmid":"28259434","title":"Effect of yeasts on biodegradation potential of immobilized cultures of white rot fungi.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The aim was to investigate the effect of yeast organisms on the degradation process by immobilized cultures of ligninolytic fungi.

Whereas indium tin oxide (ITO) is a well-known transparent conductive oxide, it is a non-ideal platform for biofilm growth. Here, a straightforward approach of surface modification of ITO anodes with gold (Au) is demonstrated, to enhance direct microbial biofilm cultivation on their surface and to improve the produced current densities. The trade-off between the electrode transmittance (critical for the underlying integrated sensors) and the enhanced growth of biofilms (crucial for direct monitoring) is studied. Au-modified ITO electrodes show a faster and reproducible biofilm growth with three times higher maximum current densities and about 6.9 times thicker biofilms compared to their unmodified ITO counterparts. The electrochemical analysis confirms the enhanced performance and the reversibility of the ITO/Au electrodes. The catalytic effect of Au on the ITO surface seems to be the key factor of the observed performance improvement since the changes in the electrode conductivity and their surface wettability are relatively small and in the range of ITO. An integrated platform for the ITO/Au transparent electrode with light-emitting diodes was fabricated and its feasibility for optical biofilm thickness monitoring is demonstrated.

Membrane-anchored proteins Alg8 (catalytic subunit) and Alg44 (copolymerase) constitute the alginate polymerase that is being activated by the second messenger molecule bis-(3', 5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), but the mechanism of activation remains elusive. To shed light on the c-di-GMP-mediated activation of alginate polymerization in vivo, an in silico structural model of Alg8 fused to the c-di-GMP binding PilZ domain informed by the structure of cellulose synthase, BcsA, was developed. This structural model was probed by site-specific mutagenesis and different cellular levels of c-di-GMP. Results suggested that c-di-GMP-mediated activation of alginate polymerization involves amino acids residing at two loops, including H323 (loop A) and T457 and E460 (loop B), surrounding the catalytic site in the predicted model. The activities of the respective Alg8 variants suggested that c-di-GMP-mediated control of substrate access to the catalytic site of Alg8 is dissimilar to the known activation mechanism of BcsA. Alg8 variants responded differently to various c-di-GMP levels, while MucR imparted c-di-GMP for activation of alginate polymerase. Furthermore, we showed that Alg44 copolymerase constituted a stable dimer, with its periplasmic domains required for protein localization and alginate polymerization and modification.

As an important surface property, topography has been shown to affect bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. Here, we demonstrate that micrometer-scale surface topographies also affect horizontal gene transfer through conjugation in bacterial biofilms. Specifically, biofilm formation and associated conjugation on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) surfaces with 10 μm tall protruding patterns were studied using fluorescently labeled donor and recipient strains of Escherichia coli. The results demonstrate that square-shaped topographic patterns with side length of 20, 50, and 100 μm and interpattern distance equal to or larger than 10 μm promote biofilm formation and conjugation compared to the smooth control. The vertical sides of these topographic features were found to be the hot spots for bacterial conjugation compared to the top of patterns and grooves between topographic features. The increase in conjugation frequency on the sides of topographic patterns was attributed to the high cell density of recipient cells at these locations. A motility (motB) mutant of the recipient strain exhibited defects in biofilm formation at the hot spots and conjugation, which were recovered by complementing the motB gene on a plasmid. These results also provided guidance for designing surface topographies that can reduce conjugation. Specifically, 10 μm tall hexagon-shaped topographic patterns with side length of 15 μm and interpattern distance of 2 μm were prepared to reduce biofilm formation on the side of protruding patterns and interrupt cell-cell interaction in the grooves.

During biofilm development, primary colonizers such as S. gordonii first attach to the surface and allow the subsequent adhesion of periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis. Interactions between those two bacteria have been extensively studied during the adhesion step of the biofilm. The aim of the study was to understand interactions of both species during the growing phase of the biofilm, for which little knowledge is available, using a mathematical model. This two-species biofilm model was based on a substrate-dependent growth, implemented with damage parameters, and validated thanks to data obtained on experimental biofilms. Three different hypothesis of interactions were proposed and assayed using this model: independence, competition between both bacteria species, or induction of toxicity by one species for the other species. Adequacy between experimental and simulated biofilms were found with the last hypothetic mathematical model. This new mathematical model of two species bacteria biofilms, dependent on different substrates for growing, can be applied to any bacteria species, environmental conditions, or steps of biofilm development.

Cysteine proteases (gingipains) from the key periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis have been implicated in periodontal disease pathogenesis by inhibiting inflammation resolution and are linked with systemic chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells is essential for the resolution of inflammation and tissue restoration. Here we sought to characterise the innate immune clearance of apoptotic cells and its modulation by gingipains. We examined the capacity of gingipain-treated macrophages to migrate towards and phagocytose apoptotic cells. Lysine gingipain treatment of macrophages impaired macrophage migration towards apoptotic neutrophils. Furthermore, lysine gingipain treatment reduced surface expression levels of CD14, a key macrophage receptor for apoptotic cells, which resulted in reduced macrophage interactions with apoptotic cells. Additionally, while apoptotic cells and their derived secretome were shown to inhibit TNF-α-induced expression by P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, we demonstrated that gingipain preparations induced a rapid inflammatory response in macrophages that was resistant to the anti-inflammatory effects of apoptotic cells or their secretome. Taken together, these data indicate that P. gingivalis may promote the chronic inflammation seen in periodontal disease patients by multiple mechanisms, including rapid, potent gingipain-mediated inflammation, coupled with receptor cleavage leading to defective clearance of apoptotic cells and reduced anti-inflammatory responses. Thus, gingipains represent a potential therapeutic target for intervention in the management of chronic periodontal disease.","authors":[{"name":"Sowmya A Castro"},{"name":"Russell Collighan"},{"name":"Peter A Lambert"},{"name":"Irundika Hk Dias"},{"name":"Parbata Chauhan"},{"name":"Charlotte E Bland"},{"name":"Ivana Milic"},{"name":"Michael R Milward"},{"name":"Paul R Cooper"},{"name":"Andrew Devitt"}],"keywords":[]},"article312":{"pmid":"28252208","title":"A fluorescence-based assay for in vitro screening of Saprolegnia inhibitors.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"The incidence of fish pathogenic oomycetes, Saprolegnia, has increased significantly in aquaculture since the ban of malachite green.

Planktonic culture of S. aureus was exposed to antibiotics for one hour followed by 24 hours incubation with fresh nutrients in MWP or continuous flow of nutrients in DFR. The DFR grown biofilms were significantly more tolerant to the antibiotics than those grown in MWP without the continuous flow. The differences in log reductions (LR) between the two models could not be attributed to differences in the cell density, the planktonic inoculum concentration or the surface-area-to-volume ratios. However, eliminating the flow in the DFR significantly restored the antibiotic susceptibility.

The model was adapted for use with four major Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli This model enabled noninvasive imaging and tracking of lux-tagged bacteria, the influx of activated neutrophils, and production of reactive oxygen-nitrogen species at the infection site. Screening antimicrobials against high-density infections showed that local but not intravenous administration of gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem significantly but incompletely reduced bacterial counts and superficial tissue dermonecrosis. Bacterial RNA isolated from the abscess tissue revealed that Pseudomonas genes involved in iron uptake, toxin production, surface lipopolysaccharide regulation, adherence, and lipase production were highly upregulated whereas phenazine production and expression of global activator gacA were downregulated. The model was validated for studying virulence using mutants of more-virulent P. aeruginosa strain PA14. Thus, mutants defective in flagella or motility, type III secretion, or siderophore biosynthesis were noninvasive and suppressed dermal necrosis in mice, while a strain with a mutation in the bfiS gene encoding a sensor kinase showed enhanced invasiveness and mortality in mice compared to controls infected with wild-type P. aeruginosa PA14.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Pletzer"},{"name":"Sarah C Mansour"},{"name":"Kelli Wuerth"},{"name":"Negin Rahanjam"},{"name":"Robert E W Hancock"}],"keywords":[]},"article321":{"pmid":"28245928","title":"Evaluation of dental adhesive systems incorporating an antibacterial monomer eugenyl methacrylate (EgMA) for endodontic restorations.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The purpose of this study was to incorporate EgMA, an antibacterial monomer into two commercial dental adhesive systems for their application in endodontic restoration with the aim to disinfect the root canal space before curing and to inhibit bacterial growth on their surfaces after being cured.","authors":[{"name":"A Almaroof"},{"name":"S A Niazi"},{"name":"L Rojo"},{"name":"F Mannocci"},{"name":"S Deb"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial dental adhesives"},{"word":"Antibacterial monomer"},{"word":"Dental bonding agents"},{"word":"Eugenyl methacrylate"},{"word":"Push-out bond strength"},{"word":"Water sorption and solubility"},{"word":"Wettability"}]},"article322":{"pmid":"28245470","title":"Evidence of an in vitro Coupled Diffusion Mechanism of Lesion Formation within Microcosm Dental Plaque.","date":"2018-07-22","abs":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not the dual constant-depth film fermenter (dCDFF) is able to produce caries-like enamel lesions and to ascertain further information regarding the performance of this fully functional biological caries model.

The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces the cationic exopolysaccharide Pel, which protects bacteria from aminoglycoside antibiotics and contributes to biofilm architecture through ionic interactions with extracellular DNA. A bioinformatics analysis of genome databases suggests that gene clusters for Pel biosynthesis are present in >125 bacterial species, yet little is known about how this biofilm exopolysaccharide is synthesized and exported from the cell. In this work, we characterize PelC, an outer membrane lipoprotein essential for Pel production. Crystal structures of PelC from Geobacter metallireducens and Paraburkholderia phytofirmans coupled with structure-guided disulfide cross-linking in P. aeruginosa suggest that PelC assembles into a 12- subunit ring-shaped oligomer. In this arrangement, an aromatic belt in proximity to its lipidation site positions the highly electronegative surface of PelC toward the periplasm. PelC is structurally similar to the Escherichia coli amyloid exporter CsgG; however, unlike CsgG, PelC does not possess membrane-spanning segments required for polymer export across the outer membrane. We show that the multidomain protein PelB with a predicted C-terminal β-barrel porin localizes to the outer membrane, and propose that PelC functions as an electronegative funnel to guide the positively charged Pel polysaccharide toward an exit channel formed by PelB. Together, our findings provide insight into the unique molecular architecture and export mechanism of the Pel apparatus, a widespread exopolysaccharide secretion system found in environmental and pathogenic bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Lindsey S Marmont"},{"name":"Jacquelyn D Rich"},{"name":"John C Whitney"},{"name":"Gregory B Whitfield"},{"name":"Henrik Almblad"},{"name":"Howard Robinson"},{"name":"Matthew R Parsek"},{"name":"Joe J Harrison"},{"name":"P Lynne Howell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PEL"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"X-ray crystallography"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides"}]},"article330":{"pmid":"28242666","title":"Adjuvant Antibiotic Activity of Acidic Sophorolipids with Potential for Facilitating Wound Healing.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The sophorolipid class of biosurfactants is finding increasing use in personal care as well as pharmaceutical products and has the potential to disrupt biofilm formation and inhibit the growth of a variety of clinically relevant organisms.

NCK-10 was capable of inhibiting the growth of various species of fungi (including Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., and Aspergillus fumigatus) at concentrations similar to those of antifungal drugs used clinically. It was observed that polarization and permeability of the fungal cell membrane were compromised upon addition of NCK-10, indicating its mechanism is disruption of the fungal cell membrane. In addition to interfering with the growth of planktonic fungi, NCK-10 demonstrated the ability to both inhibit biofilm formation and reduce the metabolic activity of cells in C. albicans biofilm.

In recent years, it has become evident that bacteria respond to low levels of NO in order to modulate their group behavior. Many bacteria respond via NO ligation to a well-established NO sensor called H-NOX (heme-nitric oxide/oxygen binding domain). Many others, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, lack an annotated hnoX gene in their genome yet are able to respond to low levels of NO to disperse their biofilms. This suggests the existence of a previously uncharacterized NO sensor. In this study, we describe the discovery of a novel nitric oxide binding protein (NosP; NO-sensing protein), which is much more widely conserved in bacteria than H-NOX, as well as a novel NO-responsive pathway in P. aeruginosa. We demonstrate that biofilms of a P. aeruginosa mutant lacking components of the NosP pathway lose the ability to disperse in response to NO. Upon cloning, expressing, and purifying NosP, we find it binds heme and ligates to NO with a dissociation rate constant that is comparable to that of other well-established NO-sensing proteins. Moreover, we show that NO-bound NosP is able to regulate the phosphorelay activity of a hybrid histidine kinase that is involved in biofilm regulation in P. aeruginosa.

However, recent outbreaks in Italy and Norway have revealed a link between giardiasis and the subsequent development of chronic post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. While the mechanisms underlying the causation of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome remain obscure, recent findings suggest that alterations in gut microbiota communities are linked to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome. In the present study, we use a laboratory biofilm system to culture and enrich mucosal microbiota from human intestinal biopsies. Subsequently, we show that co-culture with Giardia induces disturbances in biofilm species composition and biofilm structure resulting in microbiota communities that are intrinsically dysbiotic - even after the clearance of Giardia. These microbiota abnormalities were mediated in part by secretory-excretory Giardia cysteine proteases. Using in vitro cell culture and germ-free murine infection models, we show that Giardia-induced disruptions of microbiota promote bacterial invasion, resulting in epithelial apoptosis, tight junctional disruption, and bacterial translocation across an intestinal epithelial barrier. Additionally, these dysbiotic microbiota communities resulted in increased activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 signalling pathway, and overproduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in humanized germ-free mice. Previous studies that have sought explanations and risk factors for the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome have focused on features of enteropathogens and attributes of the infected host. We propose that polymicrobial interactions involving Giardia and gut microbiota may cause persistent dysbiosis, offering a new interpretation of the reasons why those afflicted with giardiasis are predisposed to gastrointestinal disorders post-infection.","authors":[{"name":"Jennifer K Beatty"},{"name":"Sarah V Akierman"},{"name":"Jean-Paul Motta"},{"name":"Stacy Muise"},{"name":"Matthew L Workentine"},{"name":"Joe J Harrison"},{"name":"Amol Bhargava"},{"name":"Paul L Beck"},{"name":"Kevin P Rioux"},{"name":"Gordon Webb McKnight"},{"name":"John L Wallace"},{"name":"Andre G Buret"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Gastrointestinal microbiome"},{"word":"Giardia duodenalis"},{"word":"Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome"}]},"article350":{"pmid":"28237767","title":"Comparison between virulence characteristics of dominant and non-dominant Escherichia coli strains of the gut and their interaction with Caco-2 cells.","date":"2017-12-13","abs":"Escherichia coli strains are normal inhabitants of the gut and are normally found in the faeces of the host at different population sizes.

Objective • This study was intended to investigate whether the Huang Lian Jie Du decoction (HLJJD) possesses the ability to produce anti-QS activity. Design • P aeruginosa PAO1 was cultivated in the presence and absence of HLJDD or of the aqueous extracts of each of its 4 constituent herbs: Rhizoma coptidis (RC), Radix scutellariae (RS), Cortex phellodendri (CP), and Fructus gardeniae jasminoidis (FGJ). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found for the HLJDD or its 4 constituents through testing each for evidence of antibacterial activity at 3.13, 6.25, 2.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/mL. Outcome Measures • QS-dependent virulence factors were analyzed at subminimum MICs (sub-MICs) for the HLJDD and its constituent herbs. The mRNA of the QS genes was also assessed by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results • The HLJDD exhibited the lowest MIC of 100 mg/mL, compared with MICs of 200 mg/mL for the RC and RS, 400 mg/mL for the CP, and more than 400 mg/mL for the FGJ. At the sub-MIC of 50 mg/mL for HLJDD, the results showed a significant reduction in pyocyanin pigment, elastolytic activity, proteolytic activity, biofilm formation, and bacterial motilities in the PAO1, without inhibiting the bacterial growth. The mRNA level of the P aeruginosa elastase gene (lasB) was also significantly reduced. The mRNA analysis also showed an increasing tendency for overexpressed QS genes when observed at sub-MICs. That inhibitory tendency was also observed in the sub-MICs of the constituent herbs in different degrees. Conclusions • The HLJDD showed the synergism of its 4 constituents against the growth of P aeruginosa and the QS-dependent virulence factors. Its anti-QS activity may interrupt the QS domination of the virulence factors of P aeruginosa downstream, leading to the overexpressed QS genes.","authors":[{"name":"Fei Xia"},{"name":"Lihua Ye"},{"name":"Ping Wang"},{"name":"Mingwei Zhang"}],"keywords":[]},"article358":{"pmid":"28236509","title":"Synthetic analogs of rhamnolipids modulate structured biofilms formed by rhamnolipid-nonproducing mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2017-12-08","abs":"Rhamnolipids secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are required for the bacteria to form biofilm efficiently and form biofilm with internal structures including pores and channels.

The bioactive synthetic analogs of rhamnolipids promote biofilm formation by rhlA mutant at low concentrations, but inhibit the biofilm formation at high concentrations. To explore the internal structures formed by the biofilms, we first demonstrate that wild-type biofilms are formed with substantial topography (hills and valleys) when the sample is under shaking conditions. Using this observation as a comparison, we found that synthetic analogs of rhamnolipids promoted structured (porous) biofilm of rhlA mutant, at intermediate concentrations between the low ones that promoted biofilm formation and the high ones that inhibited biofilm formation.

However, when the GFP-expressing E. coli cells were allowed to mature in the P-trap under conditions similar to those in a hospital environment, a GFP-expressing E. coli-containing putative biofilm extended upward over 7 days to reach the strainer. This subsequently resulted in droplet dispersion to the surrounding areas (<30 in.) during faucet operation. We also demonstrated that P-trap colonization could occur by retrograde transmission along a common pipe. We postulate that the organisms mobilize up to the strainer from the P-trap, resulting in droplet dispersion rather than dispersion directly from the P-trap.

Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to improve anti-biofilm efficacy and support reduction in antibiotic use. Treatment with exogenous nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to modulate bacterial signaling and metabolic processes that render biofilms more susceptible to antibiotics. We previously reported on cephalosporin-3'-diazeniumdiolates (C3Ds) as NO-donor prodrugs designed to selectively deliver NO to bacterial infection sites following reaction with β-lactamases. With structures based on cephalosporins, C3Ds could, in principal, also be triggered to release NO following β-lactam cleavage mediated by transpeptidases/penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), the antibacterial target of cephalosporin antibiotics. Transpeptidase-reactive C3Ds could potentially show both NO-mediated anti-biofilm properties and intrinsic (β-lactam-mediated) antibacterial effects. This dual-activity concept was explored using Streptococcus pneumoniae, a species that lacks β-lactamases but relies on transpeptidases for cell-wall synthesis. Treatment with PYRRO-C3D (a representative C3D containing the diazeniumdiolate NO donor PYRRO-NO) was found to significantly reduce viability of planktonic and biofilm pneumococci, demonstrating that C3Ds can elicit direct, cephalosporin-like antibacterial activity in the absence of β-lactamases. While NO release from PYRRO-C3D in the presence of pneumococci was confirmed, the anti-pneumococcal action of the compound was shown to arise exclusively from the β-lactam component and not through NO-mediated effects. The compound showed similar potency to amoxicillin against S. pneumoniae biofilms and greater efficacy than azithromycin, highlighting the potential of C3Ds as new agents for treating pneumococcal infections.","authors":[{"name":"Raymond N Allan"},{"name":"Michael J Kelso"},{"name":"Ardeshir Rineh"},{"name":"Nageshwar R Yepuri"},{"name":"Martin Feelisch"},{"name":"Odel Soren"},{"name":"Sanjita Brito-Mutunayagam"},{"name":"Rami J Salib"},{"name":"Paul Stoodley"},{"name":"Stuart C Clarke"},{"name":"Jeremy S Webb"},{"name":"Luanne Hall-Stoodley"},{"name":"Saul N Faust"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cephalosporin-NO-Donor"},{"word":"Nitric oxide"},{"word":"Streptococcus pneumoniae"}]},"article366":{"pmid":"28235610","title":"Microbial activities in hydrocarbon-laden wastewaters: Impact on diesel fuel stability and the biocorrosion of carbon steel.","date":"2018-04-05","abs":"Anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation not only diminishes fuel quality, but also exacerbates the biocorrosion of the metallic infrastructure. While successional events in marine microbial ecosystems impacted by petroleum are well documented, far less is known about the response of communities chronically exposed to hydrocarbons. Shipboard oily wastewater was used to assess the biotransformation of different diesel fuels and their propensity to impact carbon steel corrosion. When amended with sulfate and an F76 military diesel fuel, the sulfate removal rate in the assay mixtures was elevated (26.8μM/d) relative to incubations receiving a hydroprocessed biofuel (16.1μM/d) or a fuel-unamended control (17.8μM/d). Microbial community analysis revealed the predominance of Anaerolineae and Deltaproteobacteria in F76-amended incubations, in contrast to the Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria in the original wastewater. The dominant Smithella-like sequences suggested the potential for syntrophic hydrocarbon metabolism.

Epidemiological evidence has linked periodontal disease (PD) with atherosclerotic CVD. Accordingly, viable periodontal pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, have been found in atherosclerotic plaques in humans and mice. We aimed to determine whether cholesterol crystals (CHCs) and oral bacteria synergize in the stimulation of human monocytes. Incubation of human monocytes with CHCs induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, and IL-8. Moreover, CHCs markedly enhanced secretion of IL-1β by monocytes stimulated with the toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonist Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the TLR2 agonist Staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid. Notably, CHCs also enhanced IL-1β secretion induced by P. gingivalis LPS and IL-1β secretion induced by whole P. gingivalis bacteria. This enhancement was abrogated by the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors Z-YVAD-FMK and glibenclamide. CHCs had no effect on cytokine production induced by P. gingivalis gingipains. Taken together, our findings support that CHCs, via stimulation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, act in synergy with the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis to promote monocyte secretion of pro-atherogenic cytokines.","authors":[{"name":"Tania Køllgaard"},{"name":"Christian Enevold"},{"name":"Klaus Bendtzen"},{"name":"Peter R Hansen"},{"name":"Michael Givskov"},{"name":"Palle Holmstrup"},{"name":"Claus H Nielsen"}],"keywords":[]},"article368":{"pmid":"28234997","title":"The best of both worlds: A combined approach for analyzing microalgal diversity via metabarcoding and morphology-based methods.","date":"2019-02-08","abs":"An increasing number of studies use next generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze complex communities, but is the method sensitive enough when it comes to identification and quantification of species?

The physiological state of nonreplication in bacteria is associated with phenotypic drug tolerance. Many of these host microenvironments, when modeled in vitro by carbon starvation, complete nutrient starvation, stationary phase, acidic pH, reactive nitrogen intermediates, hypoxia, biofilms, and withholding streptomycin from the streptomycin-addicted strain SS18b, render M. tuberculosis profoundly tolerant to many of the antibiotics that are given to tuberculosis patients in clinical settings. Targeting nonreplicating persisters is anticipated to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment and rate of posttreatment relapse. Some promising drugs to treat tuberculosis, such as rifampin and bedaquiline, only kill nonreplicating M. tuberculosisin vitro at concentrations far greater than their minimal inhibitory concentrations against replicating bacilli. There is an urgent demand to identify which of the currently used antibiotics, and which of the molecules in academic and corporate screening collections, have potent bactericidal action on nonreplicating M. tuberculosis.

As their retrospective treatment is difficult, there is a need for biomedical materials that inhibit bacterial colonization from the start without using antibacterial agents, as these can promote resistance development. The promising concept of slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) possesses enormous potential for this purpose. In the present study, this principle was applied to titanium, a common material in implantology, and its biofilm-repellent properties were demonstrated. To simplify prospective approval of the medical device and to avoid chemical contamination, surface structuring was performed by ultrashort pulsed laser ablation. Four different structures (hierarchical micro- and nanosized spikes, microsized grooves, nanosized ripples, and unstructured surfaces) and five infusing perfluoropolyethers of different viscosities were screened; the best results were obtained with the biomimetic, hierarchical spike structure combined with lubricants of medium viscosities (20-60 cSt at 37 °C, 143 AZ, and GPL 104). The surfaces exhibited extremely low contact angle hysteresis, as is typical for liquid-infused materials and a reliable 100-fold reduction of human oral pathogen Streptococcus oralis biofilms. This characteristic was maintained after exposure to shear forces and gravity. The titanium SLIPS also inhibited adherence of human fibroblasts and osteoblasts. Toxicity tests supported the explanation that solely the surface's repellent properties are responsible for the vigorous prevention of the adhesion of bacteria and cells. This use of physically structured and liquid-infused titanium to avoid bioadhesion should support the prevention of bacterial implant-associated infections without the use of antibacterial agents.","authors":[{"name":"Katharina Doll"},{"name":"Elena Fadeeva"},{"name":"Joern Schaeske"},{"name":"Tobias Ehmke"},{"name":"Andreas Winkel"},{"name":"Alexander Heisterkamp"},{"name":"Boris N Chichkov"},{"name":"Meike Stiesch"},{"name":"Nico S Stumpp"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus oralis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"implant infection"},{"word":"laser structuring"},{"word":"slippery liquid-infused porous surface"},{"word":"titanium"}]},"article382":{"pmid":"28228624","title":"Antibacterial efficacy of several intracanal medicaments for endodontic therapy.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The antibacterial efficacy of intracanal medicaments for 2 and 7 days, in open apex root canals contaminated with Enterococcus faecalis biofilms was compared.

It was suspected that this organism was not native to the soil sample because it lacked the diversity that is characteristic of other soil organisms; this suspicion was confirmed when PCR testing failed to detect the bacterium in the original soil samples. D. acidovorans was also identified in 16 previously published metagenomes from multiple environments, but detailed-scale single nucleotide polymorphism analysis grouped these into five distinct clades. All of the strains indicated as contaminants fell into one clade. Fragment length anomalies were identified in paired reads mapping to the contaminant clade genotypes only. This finding was used to establish that the DNA was present in specific size selection reagents used during sequencing. Ultimately, the source of the contaminant was identified as bacterial biofilms growing in tubing. On the basis of direct measurement of the rate of fixation of mutations across the period of time in which contamination was occurring, we estimated the time of separation of the contaminant strain from the genomically sequenced ancestral population within a factor of 2.

Also, standard FD (1,100 ppm F) in combination with professional fluoride application has been recommended to control dentine caries, but the effect of this combination on enamel has been considered modest. Considering the lack of evaluation comparing the use of 5,000 ppm FD (5,000-FD) versus acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) application combined with 1,100 ppm FD (1,100-FD) on the inhibition and repair of caries lesions in both enamel and dentine, we conducted this in situ, double-blind, crossover study of 3 phases of 14 days. In each phase, 18 volunteers wore palatal appliances containing enamel and root dentine specimens, either sound or carious, to evaluate the effect of the treatments on the inhibition or repair of caries lesions, respectively. The treatments were non-FD (negative control), 5,000-FD, or 1 APF gel application on dental specimens combined with 1,100-FD used twice per day (APF + 1,100-FD). The reduction of demineralization and enhancement of remineralization were assessed by surface and cross-sectional hardness. Fluoride concentration was determined on dental specimens and on the formed biofilm. For enamel, APF + 1,100-FD and 5,000-FD did not differ regarding the inhibition of demineralization and repair of caries lesions. However, for dentine the difference between these treatments was inconclusive because while APF + 1,100-FD was more effective than 5,000-FD in caries lesion reduction and repair, 5,000-FD was more effective than APF + 1,100-FD in the reduction of surface demineralization. Therefore, the findings show that the combination of APF + 1,100-FD is as effective as 5,000-FD in enamel inhibition of demineralization and enhancement of remineralization.","authors":[{"name":"Constanza E Fernández"},{"name":"Livia Maria Andaló Tenuta"},{"name":"Altair Antoninha Del Bel Cury"},{"name":"Diego Figueiredo Nóbrega"},{"name":"Jaime Aparecido Cury"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acidulated phosphate fluoride"},{"word":"Calcium fluoride"},{"word":"Fluorides"},{"word":"High-concentration toothpaste"},{"word":"Tooth demineralization"},{"word":"Toothpastes"},{"word":"Topical fluorides"}]},"article394":{"pmid":"28221971","title":"Characterizing Salmonella Contamination in Two Rendering Processing Plants.","date":"2018-02-02","abs":"A microbiological investigation on Salmonella contamination was conducted in two U.S. rendering plants to investigate the potential cross-contamination of Salmonella in the rendering processing environment. Sampling locations were predetermined at the areas where Salmonella contamination may potentially occur, including raw materials receiving, crax (rendered materials before grinding process) grinding, and finished meal loading-out areas. Salmonella was either enumerated directly on xylose lysine Tergitol 4 agar plates or enriched in Rappaport-Vassiliadis and tetrathionate broths. The presumptive Salmonella isolates were confirmed using CHROMagar plating and latex agglutination testing and then characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, serotyping, and biofilm-forming determination. Among 108 samples analyzed, 79 (73%) samples were Salmonella positive after enrichment. Selected Salmonella isolates (n = 65) were assigned to 31 unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, with 16 Salmonella serotypes, including Typhimurium and Mbandaka, identified as predominant serotypes and 10 Salmonella strains determined as strong biofilm formers. Our results indicated that the raw materials receiving area was the primary source of Salmonella and that the surfaces surrounding crax grinding and finished meal loading-out areas harbor Salmonella in biofilms that may recontaminate the finished meals. The same Salmonella serotypes found in both raw materials receiving and the finished meal loading-out areas suggested a potential of cross-contamination between different areas in the rendering processing environment.","authors":[{"name":"Chao Gong"},{"name":"Xiuping Jiang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cross-contamination"},{"word":"Rendering processing environment"},{"word":"Salmonella"}]},"article395":{"pmid":"28221917","title":"Escherichia coli O157:H7 Strains Isolated from High-Event Period Beef Contamination Have Strong Biofilm-Forming Ability and Low Sanitizer Susceptibility, Which Are Associated with High pO157 Plasmid Copy Number.","date":"2018-02-01","abs":"In the meat industry, a high-event period (HEP) is defined as a time period when beef processing establishments experience an increased occurrence of product contamination by Escherichia coli O157:H7. Our previous studies suggested that bacterial biofilm formation and sanitizer resistance might contribute to HEPs. We conducted the present study to further characterize E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated during HEPs for their potential to cause contamination and to investigate the genetic basis for their strong biofilm-forming ability and high sanitizer resistance. Our results show that, compared with the E. coli O157:H7 diversity control panel strains, the HEP strains had a significantly higher biofilm-forming ability on contact surfaces and a lower susceptibility to common sanitizers. No difference in the presence of disinfectant-resistant genes or the prevalence of antibiotic resistance was observed between the HEP and control strains. However, the HEP strains retained significantly higher copy numbers of the pO157 plasmid. A positive correlation was observed among a strain's high plasmid copy number, strong biofilm-forming ability, low sanitizer susceptibility, and high survival and recovery capability after sanitization, suggesting that these specific phenotypes could be either directly correlated to gene expression on the pO157 plasmid or indirectly regulated via chromosomal gene expression influenced by the presence of the plasmid. Our data highlight the potential risk of biofilm formation and sanitizer resistance in HEP contamination by E. coli O157:H7, and our results call for increased attention to proper and effective sanitization practices in meat processing facilities.","authors":[{"name":"Rong Wang"},{"name":"Brandon E Luedtke"},{"name":"Joseph M Bosilevac"},{"name":"John W Schmidt"},{"name":"Norasak Kalchayanand"},{"name":"Terrance M Arthur"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Escherichia coli O157:H7"},{"word":"High-event period"},{"word":"Sanitizer"},{"word":"pO157 plasmid"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"28221135","title":"Impaired respiration elicits SrrAB-dependent programmed cell lysis and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Biofilms are communities of microorganisms attached to a surface or each other. Biofilm-associated cells are the etiologic agents of recurrent Staphylococcus aureus infections. Infected human tissues are hypoxic or anoxic. S. aureus increases biofilm formation in response to hypoxia, but how this occurs is unknown. In the current study we report that oxygen influences biofilm formation in its capacity as a terminal electron acceptor for cellular respiration. Genetic, physiological, or chemical inhibition of respiratory processes elicited increased biofilm formation. Impaired respiration led to increased cell lysis via divergent regulation of two processes: increased expression of the AtlA murein hydrolase and decreased expression of wall-teichoic acids. The AltA-dependent release of cytosolic DNA contributed to increased biofilm formation. Further, cell lysis and biofilm formation were governed by the SrrAB two-component regulatory system. Data presented support a model wherein SrrAB-dependent biofilm formation occurs in response to the accumulation of reduced menaquinone.","authors":[{"name":"Ameya A Mashruwala"},{"name":"Adriana van de Guchte"},{"name":"Jeffrey M Boyd"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus"},{"word":"aureus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell death"},{"word":"infectious disease"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"oxygen"},{"word":"respiration"}]},"article397":{"pmid":"28221026","title":"Nanomechanics of pH-Responsive, Drug-Loaded, Bilayered Polymer Grafts.","date":"2018-07-25","abs":"Stimuli-responsive polymer films play an important role in the development of smart antibacterial coatings. In this study, we consider complementary architectures of polyelectrolyte films, including a thin chitosan layer (CH), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brushes, and a bilayer structure of CH grafted to PAA brushes (CH/PAA) as possible candidates for targeted drug delivery platforms. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to study the structure-mechanical property relationship for these mono- and bi-layered polymer grafts at pH 7.4 and 4.0, corresponding to physiological and biofilm formation conditions, respectively. Herein, the surface interactions between polymer grafts and the negatively charged silica colloid attached to an AFM lever are considered as representative interactions between the antibacterial coating and a bacteria/biofilm. The bilayered structure of CH/PAA showed significantly reduced adhesive interactions in comparison to pure CH but slightly higher interactions in comparison to PAA films. Among PAA and CH/PAA films, upon grafting CH over the PAA brushes, the normal stiffness increased by 10-fold at pH 7.4 and 20-fold at pH 4.0. Notably, the study also showed that the addition of an antibiotic drug such as multicationic Tobramycin (TOB) impacts the mechanical properties of the antibacterial coatings. Competition between TOB and water molecules for the PAA chains is shown to determine the structural properties of PAA and CH/PAA films loaded with TOB. At high pH (7.4), the TOB molecules, which remain multicationic, strongly interact with polyanionic PAA, thereby reducing the film's compressibility. On the contrary, at low pH (4.0), the water molecules preferentially interact with TOB in comparison to uncharged PAA chains and, upon TOB release, results in a stronger film collapse together with an increase in adhesive interactions between the probe, the surface, and the elastic modulus of the film. The bacterial proliferation on these platforms when compared to the measured mechanical properties shows a direct correlation; hence, understanding nanomechanical properties can provide insights into designing new antibacterial polymer coatings.","authors":[{"name":"Prathima C Nalam"},{"name":"Hyun-Su Lee"},{"name":"Nupur Bhatt"},{"name":"Robert W Carpick"},{"name":"David M Eckmann"},{"name":"Russell J Composto"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial coatings"},{"word":"atomic force microscopy"},{"word":"drug delivery"},{"word":"nanomechanics"},{"word":"pH responsive polymers"},{"word":"polyelectrolyte grafts"}]},"article398":{"pmid":"28220386","title":"Clogging development and hydraulic performance of the horizontal subsurface flow stormwater constructed wetlands: a laboratory study.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The horizontal subsurface constructed wetland (HSSF CW) is a highly effective technique for stormwater treatment.

Electrical and chemical signaling mechanism are the key to understand the bacterial communication network. Quorum sensing so far has been able to explain the coordinated motion of bacteria through its chemical signaling mechanism. Bacteria residing within biofilm communities are trivial to communicate. But the recent observation in 2017 by Humphries et al. has revealed that the ion channels enabled electrical signaling mechanism can be as powerful as to attract the distant cells i.e., this signaling mechanism are capable of holding a long range behavior. As a result long range cross species communication in the bacterial world have been possible. This substantial outcome has brought this field into a new paradigm to investigate the complex co-existence of biofilm communities and distant cells with a possible scope of application in synthetic biology. In this present article, we briefly describe this new signaling mechanism and how it gives rise to a long range communication ability in bacterial communities.","authors":[{"name":"Sarangam Majumdar"},{"name":"Sukla Pal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Electrical signaling"},{"word":"Ion channels"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"}]}}
