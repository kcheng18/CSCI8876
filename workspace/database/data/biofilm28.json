One such route is directional movement or chemotaxis toward or away from self-secreted or externally employed chemicals. In some bacteria, the self-produced signaling chemicals or autoinducers themselves act as chemoattractants or chemorepellents and thereby regulate the directional movements of the cells in the colony. In addition, bacteria follow a certain growth kinetics which is integrated in the process of colony development. Here, we study the interplay of bacterial growth dynamics, cell motility, and autochemotactic motion with respect to the self-secreted diffusive signaling chemicals in spatial pattern formation. Using a continuum model of motile bacteria, we show growth can act as a crucial tuning parameter in determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of a colony. In action of growth dynamics, while chemoattraction toward autoinducers creates arrested phase separation, pattern transitions and suppression can occur for a fixed chemorepulsive strength.","authors":[{"name":"Mrinmoy Mukherjee"},{"name":"Pushpita Ghosh"}],"keywords":[]},"article3":{"pmid":"30966238","title":"Impact of Nanoclays on the Biodegradation of Poly(Lactic Acid) Nanocomposites.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a well-known biodegradable and compostable polymer, was used in this study as a model system to determine if the addition of nanoclays affects its biodegradation in simulated composting conditions and whether the nanoclays impact the microbial population in a compost environment.

Additionally, the organo-modifier of MMT, methyl, tallow, bis-2-hydroxyethyl, quaternary ammonium (QAC), was studied.

A biofilm formation essay and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate microbial attachment on the surface of PLA and BNCs. The results obtained from four different biodegradation tests with PLA and its BNCs showed a significantly higher mineralization of the films containing nanoclay in comparison to the pristine PLA during the first three to four weeks of testing, mainly attributed to the reduction in the PLA lag time. The effect of the nanoclays on the initial molecular weight during processing played a crucial role in the evolution of CO2.

MecA also inhibits sporulation and biofilm formation by down-regulating spoIIG and sinI, genes that are dependent for their transcription on the phosphorylated protein Spo0A-P. Additionally, MecA has been shown to interact in vitro with Spo0A. Although the inhibitory effect on transcription requires MecA's binding partner ClpC, inhibition is not accompanied by the degradation of Spo0A, pointing to a previously unsuspected regulatory mechanism involving these proteins. Here, we further investigate the MecA and ClpC effects on Spo0A-P-dependent transcription. We show that MecA inhibits the transcription of several Spo0A-P activated genes, but fails to de-repress several Spo0A-P repressed promoters. This demonstrates that MecA and ClpC do not act by preventing the binding of Spo0A-P to its target promoters. Consistent with this, MecA by itself has no effect in vitro on the transcription from PspoIIG while the addition of both MecA and ClpC has a strong inhibitory effect. A complex of MecA and ClpC likely binds to Spo0A-P on its target promoters, preventing the activation of transcription.

HD implies the existence of a vascular access, such as an arteriovenous fistula/graft or a venous catheter, whereas PD implies a long-term peritoneal catheter and the constant inflow of peritoneal dialysate.

The geometric mean MICs was of 289.30 μg/mL, with a MIC50 of 256 μg/mL and a MIC90 of 512 μg/mL for Cu-NWs. Cellular viability of 28 a biofilm tends to decrease the longer it is exposed to Cu-NWs. Synthesized and characterized Cu-NWs have a good antimicrobial effect against clinical strains used in the present study and has a potential to be used for disinfection of the root canal system.","authors":[{"name":"G Sánchez-Sanhueza"},{"name":"S Rebolledo"},{"name":"J López"},{"name":"M Encalada"},{"name":"H Bello-Toledo"},{"name":"D Rojas"},{"name":"C Medinam"},{"name":"M F Melendrez"}],"keywords":[]},"article24":{"pmid":"29442016","title":"Properties and role of the quorum sensing molecule farnesol in relation to the yeast Candida albicans.","date":"2018-08-22","abs":"Farnesol is a quorum sensing (QS) molecule synthesized by Candida albicans acting as a negative regulator of morphogenesis; it blocks the yeast-to-hyphae transformation. This molecule is currently studied in particular from the viewpoint of possible use as a substance with anticancer properties and with an antimicrobial, and anti-biofilm effect in yeasts resistant or tolerant to conventional therapeutic agents, for example fluconazole. Besides the aforementioned effect on morphological transformation through cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathway, it also affects other biochemical pathways of yeasts, for example those ones for sterol biosynthesis or triggering of apoptosis via accumulation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) that damage essential cellular compartments. ROS activate intracellular caspases that are indicators of apoptotic response in C. albicans. However, an influence of farnesol on C. albicans yeasts is dependent on used concentrations; while higher concentrations (200 - 300 μM) are stressful for yeasts, lower concentrations (about 40 μM) protect them from stress. This QS molecule is also able to modulate efflux pumps in resistant yeasts. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about production, role, and mode of action of farnesol in the clinically most important yeast C. albicans.","authors":[{"name":"S Dižová"},{"name":"H Bujdáková"}],"keywords":[]},"article25":{"pmid":"29441824","title":"Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles combined to calcium glycerophosphate: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"To synthesize, characterize and evaluate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of novel nanocomposites containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) associated or not to β-calcium glycerophosphate.","authors":[{"name":"José As Souza"},{"name":"Debora B Barbosa"},{"name":"Andresa A Berretta"},{"name":"Jackeline G do Amaral"},{"name":"Luiz F Gorup"},{"name":"Francisco N de Souza Neto"},{"name":"Renan A Fernandes"},{"name":"Gabriela L Fernandes"},{"name":"Emerson R Camargo"},{"name":"Alessandra M Agostinho"},{"name":"Alberto Cb Delbem"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"silver nanoparticles"},{"word":"‘green’ synthesis"}]},"article26":{"pmid":"29441822","title":"Role and regulation of the orphan AphA protein of quorum sensing in pathogenic Vibrios.","date":"2018-12-18","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS), a cell-to-cell communication process, is widely distributed in the bacterial kingdom.

However, excessive formation of biofilm in combination with a corresponding deregulated immune response leads to intra-oral diseases, such as dental caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Moreover, oral commensal bacteria, which are classified as so-called pathobionts according to a now widely accepted terminology, were recently shown to be present in extra-oral lesions with distinct bacterial species found to be involved in the onset of various pathophysiological conditions, including cancer, atherosclerosis, chronic infective endocarditis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Polyamines have been implicated in playing a role in biofilm formation, and during salt stress the content of spermidine, the major polyamine in Synechocystis, was reduced. Two putative arginine decarboxylases, Adc1 and Adc2, in Synechocystis were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Adc2 had high arginine decarboxylase activity, whereas Adc1 was much less active. Disruption of the adc genes in Synechocystis resulted in decreased spermidine content and formation of biofilms even under nonstress conditions. Based on the characterization of the adc mutants, Adc2 was the major arginine decarboxylase whose activity led to inhibition of biofilm formation, and Adc1 contributed only minimally to the process of polyamine synthesis.

Depending on their affinity for the oily phase and ability to proliferate in multicellular structures, microbes might either attach to the oil surface and directly uptake compounds from the oily phase, or grow suspended in the aqueous phase consuming solubilized oil, or form three-dimensional biofilms over the oil-water interface. In this work, a compound particle model that accounts for all three microbial strategies is developed for the biodegradation of solitary oil microdroplets moving through a water column.

Our understanding of how these bacteria ultimately cause disease is highly dependent upon understanding how they coexist and interact with one another in biofilm communities and the mechanisms by which biofilms are formed. Our research has demonstrated that the DNABII family of DNA-binding proteins are important components of the extracellular DNA (eDNA)-dependent matrix of bacterial biofilms and that sequestering these proteins via protein-specific antibodies results in the collapse of the biofilm structure and release of the resident bacteria. While the high degree of similarity among the DNABII family of proteins has allowed antibodies derived against specific DNABII proteins to disrupt biofilms formed by a wide range of bacterial pathogens, the DNABII proteins of P. gingivalis have proven to be antigenically distinct, allowing us to determine if we can use anti-P. gingivalis HUβ antibodies to specifically target this species for removal from a mixed-species biofilm.

The total protein of S. mutans was extracted before and after C11H, and matrix-assisted laser adsorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry identification was performed. The antibacterial activity on planktonic S. mutans was increased 3- to 4-fold via C8H, C11H, C12H, C13H, and C14H compared with hLF1-11 (H) alone, and there was no difference between Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii) and Streptococcus sanguis (S. sanguis).

As systemic antibiotic treatment is often ineffective, there is an urgent need for antimicrobial biomaterials and coatings. The term antimicrobial can encompass different mechanisms of action (here termed antimicrobial surface designs), such as antimicrobial-releasing, contact-killing or non-adhesivity. Biomaterials equipped with antimicrobial surface designs based on different mechanisms of action require different in vitro evaluation methods. Available industrial standard evaluation tests do not address the specific mechanisms of different antimicrobial surface designs and have therefore been modified over the past years, adding to the myriad of methods available in the literature to evaluate antimicrobial surface designs. The aim of this review is to categorize fourteen presently available methods including industrial standard tests for the in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial surface designs according to their suitability with respect to their antimicrobial mechanism of action. There is no single method or industrial test that allows to distinguish antimicrobial designs according to all three mechanisms identified here. However, critical consideration of each method clearly relates the different methods to a specific mechanism of antimicrobial action. It is anticipated that use of the provided table with the fourteen methods will avoid the use of wrong methods for evaluating new antimicrobial designs and therewith facilitate translation of novel antimicrobial biomaterials and coatings to clinical use. The need for more and better updated industrial standard tests is emphasized.","authors":[{"name":"Jelmer Sjollema"},{"name":"Sebastian A J Zaat"},{"name":"Veronique Fontaine"},{"name":"Madeleine Ramstedt"},{"name":"Reto Luginbuehl"},{"name":"Karin Thevissen"},{"name":"Jiuyi Li"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial-releasing"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Biomaterial-associated infection"},{"word":"Contact-killing"},{"word":"Non-adhesive"}]},"article61":{"pmid":"29432687","title":"Hexagonal Boron Nitride: The Thinnest Insulating Barrier to Microbial Corrosion.","date":"2019-08-05","abs":"We report the use of a single layer of two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (SL-hBN) as the thinnest insulating barrier to microbial corrosion induced by the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20.

Cyclic voltammetry results show that SL-hBN-Cu is effective in suppressing corrosion effects of the planktonic cells at potentials as high as 0.2 V ( vs Ag/AgCl). The peak anodic current for the SL-hBN coatings is ∼36 times lower than that of bare Cu. Linear polarization resistance tests confirm that the SL-hBN coatings serve as a barrier against corrosive effects of the G20 biofilm when compared to bare Cu. The SL-hBN serves as an impermeable barrier to aggressive metabolites and offers ∼91% corrosion inhibition efficiency, which is comparable to much thicker commercial coatings such as polyaniline.

Like most pathogenic bacteria, V. cholerae secretes virulence factors to assist colonization of human hosts, several of which bind carbohydrate receptors found on cell-surfaces. Understanding how pathogenic virulence proteins specifically target host cells is important for the development of treatment strategies to fight bacterial infections. Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) is a secreted pore-forming toxin with a carboxy-terminal β-prism domain that targets complex N-glycans found on mammalian cell-surface proteins. To investigate glycan selectivity, we studied the VCC β-prism domain and two additional β-prism domains found within the V. cholerae biofilm matrix protein RbmC. We show that the two RbmC β-prism domains target a similar repertoire of complex N-glycan receptors as VCC and find through binding and modeling studies that a branched pentasaccharide core (GlcNAc2-Man3) represents the likely footprint interacting with these domains. To understand the structural basis of V. cholerae β-prism selectivity, we solved high-resolution crystal structures of fragments of the pentasaccharide core bound to one RbmC β-prism domain and conducted mutagenesis experiments on the VCC toxin. Our results highlight a common strategy for cell-targeting utilized by both toxin and biofilm matrix proteins in Vibrio cholerae and provide a structural framework for understanding the specificity for individual receptors. Our results suggest that a common strategy for disrupting carbohydrate interactions could affect multiple virulence factors produced by V. cholerae, as well as similar β-prism domains found in other vibrio pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Swastik De"},{"name":"Katherine Kaus"},{"name":"Shada Sinclair"},{"name":"Brandon C Case"},{"name":"Rich Olson"}],"keywords":[]},"article63":{"pmid":"29431875","title":"Phytosynthesized silver nanoparticles as antiquorum sensing and antibiofilm agent against the nosocomial pathogen Serratia marcescens: an in vitro study.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Serratia marcescens is an important multidrug-resistant human pathogen.

Cr(VI) reduction rates were greatly diminished at 20 °C for both 50 and 100 μM Cr(VI), particularly for the electron acceptor limited (EAL) condition in which Cr(VI) reduction was much slower, the growth lag much longer (200 h), and viability decreased compared to balanced (BAL) and electron donor limited (EDL) conditions. When sulfate levels were increased in the presence of Cr(VI), cellular responses improved via a shorter lag time to growth. Similar results were observed between the different resource (donor/acceptor) ratio conditions when the sulfate levels were normalized (10 mM), and these results indicated that resource ratio (donor/acceptor) impacted D. vulgaris response to Cr(VI) and not merely sulfate limitation. The results suggest that temperature and resource ratios greatly impacted the extent of Cr(VI) toxicity, Cr(VI) reduction, and the subsequent cellular health via Cr(VI) influx and overall metabolic rate. The results also emphasized the need to perform experiments at lower temperatures with nutrient limitation to make accurate predictions of heavy metal reduction rates as well as physiological states in the environment.","authors":[{"name":"Lauren C Franco"},{"name":"Sadie Steinbeisser"},{"name":"Grant M Zane"},{"name":"Judy D Wall"},{"name":"Matthew W Fields"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chromate"},{"word":"Energy balance"},{"word":"Sulfate-reducing bacteria"}]},"article75":{"pmid":"29428998","title":"Turbulence accelerates the growth of drinking water biofilms.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Biofilms are found at the inner surfaces of drinking water pipes and, therefore, it is essential to understand biofilm processes to control their formation. Hydrodynamics play a crucial role in shaping biofilms. Thus, knowing how biofilms form, develop and disperse under different flow conditions is critical in the successful management of these systems. Here, the development of biofilms after 4 weeks, the initial formation of biofilms within 10 h and finally, the response of already established biofilms within 24-h intervals in which the flow regime was changed, were studied using a rotating annular reactor under three different flow regimes: turbulent, transition and laminar. Using fluorescence microscopy, information about the number of microcolonies on the reactor slides, the surface area of biofilms and of extracellular polymeric substances and the biofilm structures was acquired. Gravimetric measurements were conducted to characterise the thickness and density of biofilms, and spatial statistics were used to characterise the heterogeneity and spatial correlation of biofilm structures. Contrary to the prevailing view, it was shown that turbulent flow did not correlate with a reduction in biofilms; turbulence was found to enhance both the initial formation and the development of biofilms on the accessible surfaces. Additionally, after 24-h changes of the flow regime it was indicated that biofilms responded to the quick changes of the flow regime. Overall, this work suggests that different flow conditions can cause substantial changes in biofilm morphology and growth and specifically that turbulent flow can accelerate biofilm growth in drinking water.","authors":[{"name":"E Tsagkari"},{"name":"W T Sloan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Drinking water"},{"word":"Flow regimes"},{"word":"Reactor"}]},"article76":{"pmid":"29428859","title":"Decoupled water-sediment interactions restrict the phosphorus buffer mechanism in agricultural streams.","date":"2018-03-29","abs":"Our study aimed to explore the effects of agriculture on the phosphorus buffer capacity of 11 headwater streams in Austria.

M. pneumoniae infections often recur even after successful treatment of symptoms with antibiotics, and resistance to antibiotics is increasing worldwide, with nearly complete resistance in some places. Although biofilms often contribute to chronicity and resistance, M. pneumoniae biofilms remain poorly characterized. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that cells of wild-type (WT) M. pneumoniae strain M129 biofilms, as well as mutants II-3 and II-3R, in vitro became increasingly rounded as the biofilm towers matured over 5 days. The role of gliding motility in biofilm formation was addressed by analyzing differences in biofilm architecture in non-motile mutant II-3R and hypermotile mutant prpC-and by using time-lapse microcinematography to measure flux of cells around biofilm towers. There were no major differences in biofilm architecture between WT and motility mutants, with perhaps a slight tendency for the prpC- cells to spread outside towers during early stages of biofilm formation. Consistent with an insignificant role of motility in biofilm development, flux of cells near towers, which was low, was dominated by exit of cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that motility-associated attachment organelle (AO) proteins exhibited no discernable changes in localization to foci over time, but immunoblotting identified a decrease in steady-state levels of protein P200, which is required for normal gliding speed, as the WT culture aged. Non-adherent strain II-3 and non-motile strain II-3R also exhibited a steady decrease in P200 steady-state levels, suggesting that the decrease in P200 levels was not a response to changes in gliding behavior during maturation. We conclude that M. pneumoniae cells undergo morphological changes as biofilms mature, motility plays no major role in biofilm development, and P200 loss might be related to maturation of cells.

However, following stress there are changes in the nasopharyngeal microenvironment that triggers the transition of the commensal M. haemolytica into a pulmonary pathogen. The factors responsible for this transition in- vivo are unknown. In this study we developed an in-vitro biofilm model and investigated the effect of three stress- related compounds: norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and substance P (SP) on M. haemolytica biofilms. Biofilm formation was demonstrated for 3 bovine nasal isolates of M. haemolytica by growing them in basal culture media, basal media with additional glucose, and basal media with a reduced pH. Increased glucose enhanced biofilm biomass for 2/3 isolates, but acidic media did not increase biofilm biomass when compared to biofilm biomass in basal media. When the biofilm was exposed to NE, E and SP, there was a dispersal of the biofilm which was most effective with E, followed by NE, and SP being the least effective.

Oil sands tailings are comprised of sand, clay and process-affected water (OSPW). OSPW contains an extremely complex matrix of organic contaminants (e.g., naphthenic acids (NAs), residual bitumen, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), which has proven to be toxic to a variety of aquatic species. Biodegradation, among a variety of examined methods, is believed to be one of the most cost effective and practical to treat OSPW. A number of studies have been published on the removal of oil sands related contaminants using biodegradation-based practices. This review focuses on the treatment of OSPW using various bioreactors, comparing bioreactor configurations, operating conditions, performance evaluation and microbial community dynamics. Effort is made to identify the governing biotic and abiotic factors in engineered biological systems receiving OSPW.

In addition, 53 earlier published sequences of C. coli clade 2 and 3 from environmental waters were included for in silico analyses. Generally, clade 2 isolates had larger genomes, which included a functional tricarballylate utilization locus, while clade 3 isolates contained different genes involved in oxidative stress as well as putative virulence factors. The Swedish water isolates of clade 2 formed large, blurry bacterial colonies on agar, whereas clade 3 colonies were smaller. All Swedish isolates were motile, but clade 3 isolates formed larger motility zones on soft agar, and none of these isolates produced biofilm. Although water survival varied between the analyzed isolates, there were hardly any clade-specific significant differences.

The two, 2-hydroxy derivatives are produced from PCA via the activity of a phenazine-modifying enzyme encoded by phzO. In addition to the seven biosynthetic genes responsible for the production of PCA, many other Pseudomonas strains possess one or more modifying genes, which encode enzymes that act independently or together to convert PCA into other phenazine derivatives.

Altering the type of phenazines produced by P. chlororaphis 30-84 enhanced the spectrum of fungal pathogens inhibited and altered the degree of take-all disease suppression.

In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this, and to identify factors determining lipid deposition and exchange at lipid membranes, we here employ neutron reflection (NR) and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) to study the effect of membrane charge on lipoprotein deposition and lipid exchange. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayers containing varying amounts of negatively charged dimyristoylphosphatidylserine (DMPS) were used to vary membrane charge. It was found that the amount of hydrogenous material deposited from either HDL or LDL to the bilayer depends only weakly on membrane charge density. In contrast, increasing membrane charge resulted in an increase in the amount of lipids removed from the supported lipid bilayer, an effect particularly pronounced for LDL. The latter effects are in line with previously reported observations on atherosclerotic plaque prone regions of long-term hyperlipidaemia and type 2 diabetic patients, and may also provide some molecular clues into the relation between oxidative stress and atherosclerosis.","authors":[{"name":"Kathryn Louise Browning"},{"name":"Tania Kjellerup Lind"},{"name":"Selma Maric"},{"name":"Robert David Barker"},{"name":"Marité Cárdenas"},{"name":"Martin Malmsten"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Atherosclerosis"},{"word":"HDL"},{"word":"LDL"},{"word":"Lipid exchange"},{"word":"Lipoprotein"},{"word":"Neutron reflection"}]},"article121":{"pmid":"29421760","title":"Effect of organic loading rate on the removal of DMF, MC and IPA by a pilot-scale AnMBR for treating chemical synthesis-based antibiotic solvent wastewater.","date":"2018-06-29","abs":"This study focuses on the effects of organic loading rate (OLR) on the removal of N,N-Dimethylformamide(DMF), m-Cresol (MC) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) by a pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) for treating chemical synthesis-based antibiotic solvent wastewater at period of improved influent COD concentration with decreased HRT.

Limonene is a major constituent of citrus oil and most frequently used terpene in food and beverage industry due to its pleasant fragrance, nontoxic, and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) flavoring agent as well as treatment option in many gastrointestinal diseases.Limonene exhibited excellent anti-Candida activity and was equally effective against planktonic growth of C. albicans isolates differentially susceptible to FLC (N = 35). Limonene inhibited morphogenesis significantly at low concentration. However, it showed stage dependent activity against biofilm formation, that is, it was more effective against adhesion followed by development and maturation. Limonene also exhibited excellent synergy with FLC against planktonic and biofilm growth. SWATH-MS analysis led to identification of limonene responsive proteins that provided molecular insight of its anti-Candida activity. Proteomic analysis revealed upregulation of proteins involved in cell wall glucan synthesis (Kre6); oxidative stress (Rhr2, Adh7 and Ebp1); DNA damage stress (Mbf1 and Npl3); nucleolar stress (Rpl11, Rpl7, Rpl29, Rpl15) and down regulation of cytoskeleton organization (Crn1, Pin3, Cct8, Rbl2), and so forth, in response to limonene. Limonene mediated down regulation of Tps3 indicates activation of caspase (CaMca1) and induction of apoptosis in C. albicans.

The antifungal activity of promethazine against C. tropicalis was investigated by performing time-kill curve assays and assessing rhodamine 6G efflux, cell size/granularity, membrane integrity, and mitochondrial transmembrane potential, through flow cytometry. Promethazine showed antifungal activity against planktonic cells and biofilms at concentrations of 64 and 128 μg/ml, respectively. The addition of two subinhibitory concentrations of promethazine reduced the antifungal MICs for all tested azole drugs against planktonic growth, reversing the resistance phenotype to all azoles.

Aspergillus species cause most of the airborne fungal infections. Life-threatening invasive aspergillosis was formerly found only in immune-suppressed patients, but recently some strains of A. fumigatus have become primary pathogens. Many fungal cell wall components are absent from mammalian systems, so they are potential drug targets. Cell-wall-targeting drugs such as echinocandins are used clinically, although echinocandin-resistant strains were discovered shortly after their introduction. Currently there are no fully effective anti-fungal drugs. Fungal cell wall glycoconjugates modulate human immune responses, as well as fungal cell adhesion, biofilm formation, and drug resistance. Guanosine diphosphate (GDP) mannose transporters (GMTs) transfer GDP-mannose from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen prior to mannosylation. Aspergillus nidulans GMTs are encoded by gmtA and gmtB. Here we elucidate the roles of A. nidulans GMTs. Strains engineered to lack either or both GMTs were assessed for hyphal and colonial morphology, cell wall ultrastructure, antifungal susceptibility, spore hydrophobicity, adherence and biofilm formation. The gmt-deleted strains had smaller colonies with reduced sporulation and with thicker hyphal walls. The gmtA deficient spores had reduced hydrophobicity and were less adherent and less able to form biofilms in vitro. Thus, gmtA not only participates in maintaining the cell wall integrity but also plays an important role in biofilm establishment and adherence of A. nidulans. These findings suggested that GMTs have roles in A. nidulans growth and cell-cell interaction and could be a potential target for new antifungals that target virulence determinants.","authors":[{"name":"Ashraf A Kadry"},{"name":"Amira M El-Ganiny"},{"name":"Rasha A Mosbah"},{"name":"Susan G W Kaminskyj"}],"keywords":[]},"article131":{"pmid":"29420616","title":"Lactobacillus plantarum lipoteichoic acid inhibits biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Dental caries is a biofilm-dependent oral disease and Streptococcus mutans is the known primary etiologic agent of dental caries that initiates biofilm formation on tooth surfaces.

Surveillance of water systems is based on microbiological culture-based techniques; however, it has been shown that high percentages of the Legionella populations in water systems are not culturable. In the past two decades, the relevance of such viable but non-culturable (VBNC) legionellae has been controversially discussed, and whether VBNC legionellae can directly infect human macrophages, the primary targets of Legionella infections, remains unclear. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that several starved VBNC Legionella strains (four L. pneumophila serogroup 1 strains, a serogroup 6 strain and a L. micdadei strain) can directly infect different types of human macrophages and amoebae even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water. However, under these conditions, the strains caused infection with reduced efficacy, as represented by the lower percentages of infected cells, prolonged time in co-culture and higher multiplicities of infection required. Interestingly, the VBNC cells remained mostly non-culturable even after multiplication within the host cells. Amoebal infection by starved VBNC Legionella, which likely occurs in oligotrophic biofilms, would result in an increase in the bacterial concentration in drinking-water systems. If cells remain in the VBNC state, the real number of active legionellae will be underestimated by the use of culture-based standard techniques. Thus, further quantitative research is needed in order to determine, whether and how many starved VBNC Legionella cells are able to cause disease in humans.","authors":[{"name":"Elisabeth Dietersdorfer"},{"name":"Alexander Kirschner"},{"name":"Barbara Schrammel"},{"name":"Anna Ohradanova-Repic"},{"name":"Hannes Stockinger"},{"name":"Regina Sommer"},{"name":"Julia Walochnik"},{"name":"Sílvia Cervero-Aragó"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acanthamoeba"},{"word":"Legionella"},{"word":"Macrophages"},{"word":"Starvation"},{"word":"VBNC"}]},"article173":{"pmid":"29409364","title":"Graphene onto medical grade titanium: an atom-thick multimodal coating that promotes osteoblast maturation and inhibits biofilm formation from distinct species.","date":"2018-12-17","abs":"The time needed for the osseointegration of titanium implants is deemed too long.

The graphene-coated titanium is cytocompatible, did not induce cell membrane damage, induced human osteoblast maturation (gene and protein level), and increased the deposition of mineralized matrix compared to titanium alone. Moreover, graphene decreased the formation of biofilms from Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis and even from whole saliva on titanium without killing the bacteria.

In this study, we found that 0.1 and 0.5 M Mg2+ stress significantly reduced the total biomass of biofilm in a dose-dependent manner. The observation results of extracellular polymeric substances and bacteria using confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the biofilm became thinner and looser under Mg2+ stress. Whereas 0.1 and 0.5 M Mg2+ stress had no remarkable effect on the bacterial viability, the attachment rate of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans to pentlandite was reduced by Mg2+ stress. Furthermore, sliding motility, twitching motility and the gene expression level of pilV and pilW were inhibited under Mg2+ stress. These results suggested that Mg2+ reduced biofilm formation through inhibiting pilV and pilW gene expression, decreasing Type IV pili formation and then attenuating the ability of attachment, subduing the active expansion of biofilms mediated by twitching motility.

These biofilms are detrimental to aquaculture species as they resist antibiotics and other agents that are used to control them. Two bacterial pathogens isolated from infected prawn samples were identified as Vibrio alginolyticus and Pseudomonas gessardii on the basis of morphological features, biochemical characteristics, 16S r RNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Their pathogenic nature was confirmed by performing in vivo challenge experiments using Artemia salina as a model system. Seven days post infection, the mortality observed with V. alginolyticus and P. gessardii was 97 ± 4.08% and 77.5 ± 5.24%, respectively. The isolates formed extensive biofilms on polystyrene and glass surfaces. These infections could be controlled in an effective manner by using the cell free supernatant (CFS) of a tropical marine epizoic strain of Bacillus licheniformis D1 that is earlier reported to contain an antimicrobial protein (BLDZ1). The CFS inhibited biofilms in an efficient manner (82.35 ± 1.69 and 82.52 ± 1.11% for V. alginolyticus and P. gessardii, respectively) on co-incubation. In addition, pre-formed biofilms of V. alginolyticus and P. gessardii were also removed (84.53 ± 1.26 and 67.08 ± 1.43%, respectively). Fluorescence and scanning electron microscopic studies confirmed the antibiofilm potential of this protein on glass surfaces. The antibiofilm nature was due to the anti-adhesion and antimicrobial properties exhibited by the CFS.

We report the anticandidal activity of battacin lipopeptide antibiotics with previously unexplored antifungal activity. From amongst sixteen battacin lipopeptides tested against C. alibicans (SC5314) the 4-methyl hexanoyl conjugated trimeric lipopeptide 13 emerged as the lead candidate with a MIC of 6.25 μM and negligible haemolysis of mouse red blood cells. The potency of this lipopeptide was maintained under acidic conditions. Additionally, antifungal activity was further enhanced with amphotericin B at its non-haemolytic concentrations. Herein we have demonstrated for the first time that battacin lipopeptides prevent C. albicans biofilm colonisation as well as inhibit pre-formed biofilms of this fungal pathogen. XTT biofilm assays revealed that 13 prevented colonisation of C. albicans biofilms at its MIC (6.25 μM) and, at a higher concentration, eradicated 24 h (25 μM) and 48 h (62.5 μM) old preformed biofilms. In comparison, we found that amphotericin at much lower concentrations prevented biofilm colonisation (0.78 μM) and inhibited 24 h old preformed biofilms (6.25 μM), however was completely inactive against 48 h old preformed biofilms. Thus, lipopeptide 13 is more effective than amphotericin at eradicating more mature C. albicans biofilms. The membrane lytic mechanism of action of compound 13 was validated by a colorimetric assay using lipid vesicles mimicking fungal membranes in which compound 13 effected an immediate dark purple to red colour transition of suspended vesicles upon peptide interaction. In addition, TEM images of C. albicans cells exposed to 13 showed clearly disrupted cellular membranes. Interestingly, compound 13 increased the endogenous generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a concentration dependent manner. In the presence of an antioxidant, ascorbic acid, ROS production was diminished yet antifungal activity persisted, possibly indicating that ROS production is a secondary effect from membrane lysis caused by lipopeptide 13. The lipopeptide was non-haemolytic against mouse red blood cells at the highest tested concentration (1 mM).","authors":[{"name":"Gayan Heruka De Zoysa"},{"name":"Hugh Douglas Glossop"},{"name":"Vijayalekshmi Sarojini"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungal"},{"word":"Battacin"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Lipopeptide"},{"word":"Minimal inhibitory concentration"}]},"article185":{"pmid":"29407907","title":"Silver complex of salicylic acid and its hydrogel-cream in wound healing chemotherapy.","date":"2018-10-29","abs":"The known metallotherapeutic [Ag(salH)]","authors":[{"name":"Maria-Eleni K Stathopoulou"},{"name":"Christina N Banti"},{"name":"Nikolaos Kourkoumelis"},{"name":"Antonios G Hatzidimitriou"},{"name":"Angelos G Kalampounias"},{"name":"Sotiris K Hadjikakou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-inflammatory"},{"word":"Antibacterial"},{"word":"Bioinorganic materials chemistry"},{"word":"Salicylic acid"},{"word":"Silver(I) complexes"},{"word":"Wound healing"}]},"article186":{"pmid":"29407752","title":"Presence of the esp gene in Enterococcus faecium derived from oropharyngeal microbiota of haematology patients.","date":"2018-10-05","abs":"Antibiotic use and immunocompromised status in haematology patients have been shown to determine the constituents of commensal microbiota with highly increased resistance, including vancomycin resistant enterococci.

In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and microarray analysis to investigate the genomic determinants of the phenotypic changes observed in two C. albicans clinical isolates (YL1 and YQ2). In vitro experiments employing epithelial, microglial, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were thus used to evaluate C. albicans isolates interaction with first line host defenses, measuring adhesion, susceptibility to phagocytosis, and induction of secretory responses. Moreover, a murine model of peritoneal infection was used to compare the in vivo pathogenic potential of the two isolates. Genome sequence and gene expression analysis of C. albicans YL1 and YQ2 showed significant changes in cellular pathways involved in environmental stress response, adhesion, filamentous growth, invasiveness, and dimorphic transition. This was in accordance with the observed marked phenotypic differences in biofilm production, dimorphic switch efficiency, cell adhesion, invasion, and survival to phagocyte-mediated host defenses. The mutations in key regulators of the hyphal growth pathway in the more virulent strain corresponded to an overall greater number of budding yeast cells released. Compared to YQ2, YL1 consistently showed enhanced pathogenic potential, since in vitro, it was less susceptible to ingestion by phagocytic cells and more efficient in invading epithelial cells, while in vivo YL1 was more effective than YQ2 in recruiting inflammatory cells, eliciting IL-1β response and eluding phagocytic cells. Overall, these results indicate an unexpected isolate-specific variation in pathways important for host invasion and colonization, showing how the genetic background of C. albicans may greatly affect its behavior both in vitro and in vivo. Based on this approach, we propose that the co-occurrence of changes in sequence and expression in genes and pathways driving dimorphic transition and pathogenicity reflects a selective balance between traits favoring dissemination of the pathogen and traits involved in host defense evasion. This study highlights the importance of investigating strain-level, rather than species level, differences, when determining fungal-host interactions and defining commensal or pathogen behavior.","authors":[{"name":"Duccio Cavalieri"},{"name":"Monica Di Paola"},{"name":"Lisa Rizzetto"},{"name":"Noemi Tocci"},{"name":"Carlotta De Filippo"},{"name":"Paolo Lionetti"},{"name":"Andrea Ardizzoni"},{"name":"Bruna Colombari"},{"name":"Simona Paulone"},{"name":"Ivo G Gut"},{"name":"Luisa Berná"},{"name":"Marta Gut"},{"name":"Julie Blanc"},{"name":"Misha Kapushesky"},{"name":"Eva Pericolini"},{"name":"Elisabetta Blasi"},{"name":"Samuele Peppoloni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"fungal isolates"},{"word":"genomic"},{"word":"host adaptation"},{"word":"pathogenic traits"},{"word":"phagocytes"}]},"article207":{"pmid":"29403454","title":"Environmental Factors Support the Formation of Specific Bacterial Assemblages on Microplastics.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"While the global distribution of microplastics (MP) in the marine environment is currently being critically evaluated, the potential role of MP as a vector for distinct microbial assemblages or even pathogenic bacteria is hardly understood. To gain a deeper understanding, we investigated how different in situ conditions contribute to the composition and specificity of MP-associated bacterial communities in relation to communities on natural particles. Polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and wooden pellets were incubated for 2 weeks along an environmental gradient, ranging from marine (coastal Baltic Sea) to freshwater (waste water treatment plant, WWTP) conditions. The associated assemblages as well as the water communities were investigated applying high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our setup allowed for the first time to determine MP-dependent and -independent assemblage factors as subject to different environmental conditions in one system. Most importantly, plastic-specific assemblages were found to develop solely under certain conditions, such as lower nutrient concentration and higher salinity, while the bacterial genus Erythrobacter, known for the ability to utilize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), was found specifically on MP across a broader section of the gradient. We discovered no enrichment of potential pathogens on PE or PS; however, the abundant colonization of MP in a WWTP by certain bacteria commonly associated with antibiotic resistance suggests MP as a possible hotspot for horizontal gene transfer. Taken together, our study clarifies that the surrounding environment prevailingly shapes the biofilm communities, but that MP-specific assemblage factors exist.

A common pathogenic factor of mycobacteria is the formation of biofilms. Various molecules are involved in this process, including glycopeptidolipids, shorter-chain mycolic acids, and GroEL1 chaperone. Nutrients, ions, and carbon sources influence bacterial behavior and have a regulatory role in biofilm formation. The ultrastructure of mycobacterial biofilms can be studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy, a technique that reveals different phenotypic characteristics. Cording is associated with NTM pathogenicity, and is also considered an important property of M. tuberculosis strains. Mycobacterial biofilms are more resistant to environmental aggressions and disinfectants than the planktonic form. Biofilm-forming mycobacteria have been reported in many environmental studies, especially in water systems. NTM cause respiratory disease in patients with underlying diseases, such as old tuberculosis scars, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. Pathogens can be either slowly growing mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium avium complex, or rapidly growing species, such as Mycobacterium abscessus. Another important biofilm-related group of infections are those associated with biomaterials, and in this setting the most frequently isolated organisms are rapidly growing mycobacteria. M. tuberculosis can develop a biofilm which plays a role in the process of casseous necrosis and cavity formation in lung tissue. M. tuberculosis also develops biofilms on clinical biomaterials. Biofilm development is an important factor for antimicrobial resistance, as it affords protection against antibiotics that are normally active against the same bacteria in the planktonic state.

Cationic antimicrobial peptides and their derivatives are interesting potential alternatives to antibiotics due to their rapid action, broad-spectrum of antimicrobial activity and limited emergence of bacterial resistance. This study reports the novel antimicrobial properties of histone H5, purified from chicken erythrocytes, and histone H5-derived synthetic peptides. Broth microdilution assays revealed that histone H5 has potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative planktonic bacteria (MIC range: 1.9 ± 1.8 to 4.9 ± 1.5 µg/mL), including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Moreover, histone H5 displayed anti-biofilm activity against established Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated bacterial membrane damage after histone H5 treatment, while a hemolytic assay revealed that histone H5 is non-toxic towards mammalian erythrocytes, even at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Although the predicted H5-derived antimicrobial peptides tested in this study were located within the antimicrobial domain of histone H5, their synthetic versions did not possess more potent antimicrobial activity than the full length protein. Overall, this study demonstrates that histone H5 is a potent antimicrobial and therefore a promising template for the development of novel histone H5-derived antimicrobial peptides.","authors":[{"name":"Joelle Jodoin"},{"name":"Maxwell T Hincke"}],"keywords":[]},"article211":{"pmid":"29402863","title":"Antibacterial Activity, Cytotoxicity, and the Mechanism of Action of Bacteriocin from Bacillus subtilis GAS101.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"The aim of this study was to purify and characterize bacteriocin from the soil isolate Bacillus subtilis GAS101, and to determine its antimicrobial as well as antibiofilm potential.

Innovative design strategies for intravenous catheters can help reduce these preventable infections. Antimicrobial coatings can play a major role in preventing disease. These coatings can be divided into two major categories: drug eluting and non-drug eluting. Much of these catheter designs are targeted at preventing the formation of microbial biofilms that make treatment of CRBSI nearly impossible without removal of the intravenous device. Exciting developments in catheter impregnation with antibiotics as well as nanoscale surface design promise innovative changes in the way that physicians manage intravenous catheters. Occlusion of a catheter renders the catheter unusable and is often treated by tissue plasminogen activator administration or replacement of the line. Prevention of this complication requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of platelet aggregation, signaling and cross-linking.

The complex cell wall architecture contributes to their ability to form biofilms, which are often implicated in hospital-acquired infections. Biofilms promote antibiotic resistance by enabling the bacteria to survive hostile environments such as UV radiation, pH shifts, and antibiotics. The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which plays a role in adhesion to surfaces and formation of biofilms. The main focus of this work was the synthesis of a library of glycolipids designed to be simplified analogues of the Lipid A, the membrane embedded portion component of LPS, to be tested as substrates or inhibitors of Heptosyltransferase I (HepI or WaaC, a glycosyltransferase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of LPS). Fourteen analogues were synthesized successfully and characterized. While these compounds were designed to function as nucleophilic substrates of HepI, they all demonstrated mild inhibition of HepI. Kinetic characterization of inhibition mechanism identified that the compounds exhibited uncompetitive and mixed inhibition of HepI. Since both uncompetitive and mixed inhibition result in the formation of an Enzyme-Substrate-inhibitor complex, molecular docking studies (using AutoDock Vina) were performed, to identify potential allosteric binding site for these compounds. The inhibitors were shown to bind to a pocket formed after undergoing a conformational change from an open to a closed active site state. Inhibition of HepI via an allosteric site suggest that disruption of protein dynamics might be a viable mechanism for the inhibition of HepI and potentially other enzymes of the GT-B structural class.","authors":[{"name":"Noreen K Nkosana"},{"name":"Daniel J Czyzyk"},{"name":"Zarek S Siegel"},{"name":"Joy M Cote"},{"name":"Erika A Taylor"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Allosterism"},{"word":"AutoDock Vina"},{"word":"GT-B"},{"word":"Glycosyltransferase"},{"word":"Heptosyltransferase"},{"word":"Inhibition kinetics"},{"word":"Inhibitor design"},{"word":"LPS"},{"word":"Lipopolysaccharide"},{"word":"Structural rearrangement"}]},"article224":{"pmid":"29398289","title":"Tracking of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilm formation of a microbial electrochemical system via differential pulse voltammetry.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"In this study, the electrochemical properties of a Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilm were investigated using a mini-microbial electrochemical system.

Comprehensive evaluations of the morphology, swelling kinetics, permeability, mechanical characteristics, cytotoxicity, capability to inhibit metalloproteinases and of antibacterial property were conducted. Biological in vitro studies demonstrated that hyaluronic acid released by the membrane is able to stimulate the wound healing meanwhile the metal silver exploits an efficient antibacterial activity against both planktonic bacteria and biofilms. Overall, the experimental data evidence that the studied material could be used as antibacterial wound dressing for wound healing promotion.","authors":[{"name":"Lorena Tarusha"},{"name":"Sergio Paoletti"},{"name":"Andrea Travan"},{"name":"Eleonora Marsich"}],"keywords":[]},"article234":{"pmid":"29396559","title":"Early skeletal colonization of the coral holobiont by the microboring Ulvophyceae Ostreobium sp.","date":"2019-02-02","abs":"Ostreobium sp.

Primary polyps were surprisingly already colonized by microboring filaments and their level of invasion depended on the nature of settlement substrate and the extent of its pre-colonization by microborers. Growth of early coral recruits was unaffected even when microborers were in close vicinity to the polyp tissue. In addition to morphotype observations, chloroplast-encoded rbcL gene sequence analyses revealed nine new Ostreobium clades (OTU99%) in Pocillopora coral. Recruits and adults shared one dominant rbcL clade, undetected in larvae, but also present in aquarium seawater, carbonate and non-carbonate settlement substrates, and in corals from reef settings. Our results show a substratum-dependent colonization by Ostreobium clades, and indicate horizontal transmission of Ostreobium-coral associations.","authors":[{"name":"A Massé"},{"name":"I Domart-Coulon"},{"name":"S Golubic"},{"name":"D Duché"},{"name":"A Tribollet"}],"keywords":[]},"article235":{"pmid":"29396526","title":"Broad impact of extracellular DNA on biofilm formation by clinically isolated Methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a major causative agent for biofilm-associated infections.

In most (42/47) of the strains, biofilm formation was augmented by glucose supplementation. Sodium chloride (NaCl)-triggered biofilm formation was more prevalent in methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (15/24) than in methicillin-resistant strain (1/23). DNase I most effectively inhibited and disrupted massive biofilms, and Proteinase K was also effective. Anti-biofilm effects of Dispersin B, which cleaves PIA, were restricted to PIA-dependent biofilms formed by specific strains and showed significant negative correlations with those of Proteinase K, suggesting independent roles of PIA and proteins in each biofilm. ECM profiling demonstrated that eDNA was present in all strains, although its level differed among strains and culture conditions. These results indicate that eDNA is the most common component in S. aureus biofilms, whereas PIA is important for a small number of isolates. Therefore, eDNA can be a primary target for developing eradication strategies against S. aureus biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Shinya Sugimoto"},{"name":"Fumiya Sato"},{"name":"Reina Miyakawa"},{"name":"Akio Chiba"},{"name":"Shoichi Onodera"},{"name":"Seiji Hori"},{"name":"Yoshimitsu Mizunoe"}],"keywords":[]},"article236":{"pmid":"29394879","title":"Dysbiotic Biofilms Deregulate the Periodontal Inflammatory Response.","date":"2019-06-20","abs":"Periodontal diseases originate from a dysbiosis within the oral microbiota, which is associated with a deregulation of the host immune response.

Our aim was to quantify biases associated with six DNA extraction methods and identify one which is optimal for eDNA research targeting multiple organisms and sample types. We assessed each methods' ability to simultaneously extract bacterial, fungal, plant, animal and fish DNA from soil, leaf litter, stream water, stream sediment, stream biofilm and kick-net samples, as well as from mock communities.

The consistency of methods, as measured by the similarity of community compositions resulting from replicate extractions, varied and was lowest for the animal communities. Collectively, these data provide the first comprehensive assessment of the biases associated with DNA extraction for both different sample types and taxa types, allowing us to identify DNeasy PowerSoil as a universal DNA extraction method.

Once established, P. aeruginosa infections become incredibly difficult to treat due to the development of antibiotic tolerant, aggregated communities known as biofilms. A hyper-biofilm forming clinical variant of P. aeruginosa, known as a rugose small-colony variant (RSCV), is frequently isolated from chronic infections and is correlated with poor clinical outcome. The development of these mutants during infection suggests a selective advantage for this phenotype, but it remains unclear how this phenotype promotes persistence. While prior studies suggest RSCVs could survive by evading the host immune response, our study reveals infection with the RSCV, PAO1ΔwspF, stimulated an extensive inflammatory response that caused significant damage to the surrounding host tissue. In both a chronic wound model and acute pulmonary model of infection, we observed increased bacterial burden, host tissue damage, and a robust neutrophil response during RSCV infection. Given the essential role of neutrophils in P. aeruginosa-mediated disease, we investigated the impact of the RSCV phenotype on neutrophil function. The RSCV phenotype promoted phagocytic evasion and stimulated neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We also demonstrate that bacterial aggregation and TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production contribute to the immune response to RSCVs. Additionally, RSCVs exhibited enhanced tolerance to neutrophil-produced antimicrobials including H2O2 and the antimicrobial peptide LL-37. Collectively, these data indicate RSCVs elicit a robust but ineffective neutrophil response that causes significant host tissue damage. This study provides new insight on RSCV persistence, and indicates this variant may have a critical role in the recurring tissue damage often associated with chronic infections.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew J Pestrak"},{"name":"Sarah B Chaney"},{"name":"Heather C Eggleston"},{"name":"Sheri Dellos-Nolan"},{"name":"Sriteja Dixit"},{"name":"Shomita S Mathew-Steiner"},{"name":"Sashwati Roy"},{"name":"Matthew R Parsek"},{"name":"Chandan K Sen"},{"name":"Daniel J Wozniak"}],"keywords":[]},"article241":{"pmid":"29394284","title":"The role of the type VI secretion system vgrG gene in the virulence and antimicrobial resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) is an important virulence system that exists in many bacterial pathogens, and has emerged as a potent mediator of pathogenicity in Acinetobacter baumannii.

Components of coconut oil, which include lauric acid, have been revealed to inhibit C. difficile growth in vitro. In this study, we demonstrated that lauric acid exhibits potent antimicrobial activities against multiple toxigenic C. difficile isolates in vitro. The inhibitory effect of lauric acid is partly due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell membrane damage. The administration of lauric acid considerably reduced biofilm formation and preformed biofilms in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, in a mouse infection model, lauric acid pretreatment reduced CDI symptoms and proinflammatory cytokine production.

One of the PHA derivatives, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBH) has flexible material properties and a low melting temperature.

On the other hand, the dominant OTUs in the biofilms that formed on the surfaces of broken PHBH films were assigned to the families Rhodobacteraceae, Rhodospirillaceae, and Oceanospirillaceae, and the genus Glaciecola mostly disappeared. The bacterial community in the biofilms on PHBH films was assumed to have dynamically changed according to the progression of degradation. Approximately 50 colonies were isolated from the biofilm samples that formed on the PHBH films and their PHBH-degrading activities were assessed. Two out of three PHBH-degrading isolates showed high similarities to Glaciecola lipolytica and Aestuariibacter halophilus in the family Alteromonadaceae.

Here, we use simulation models to investigate whether spatial structure per se can account for this increased cell density in the presence of phages. A measure is derived for comparing cell densities between growth in spatially structured environments versus well mixed environments (known as mass action). Maintenance of sensitive cells requires some form of phage death; we invoke death mechanisms that are spatially fixed, as if produced by cells. Spatially structured phage death provides cells with a means of protection that can boost cell densities an order of magnitude above that attained under mass action, although the effect is sometimes in the opposite direction. Phage and bacteria self organize into separate refuges, and spatial structure operates so that the phage progeny from a single burst do not have independent fates (as they do with mass action).

By the same metric, mass action dynamics either show no sustained bacterial elevation or oscillate between states of low and high cell densities and an elevated average. The elevated cell densities observed in models with spatial structure do not approach the empirically observed increased density of cells in structured environments with phages (which can be many orders of magnitude), so the empirical phenomenon likely requires additional mechanisms than those analyzed here.","authors":[{"name":"James J Bull"},{"name":"Kelly A Christensen"},{"name":"Carly Scott"},{"name":"Benjamin R Jack"},{"name":"Cameron J Crandall"},{"name":"Stephen M Krone"}],"keywords":[{"word":"agent based"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"mass action"},{"word":"models"},{"word":"phage therapy"},{"word":"resistance"}]},"article277":{"pmid":"29382105","title":"Study of the Anti-Staphylococcal Potential of Honeys Produced in Northern Poland.","date":"2018-12-07","abs":"The antimicrobial activity of 144 samples of honeys including 95 products from apiaries located in Northern Poland was evaluated.

In this study, biofilms developed in marine and freshwater locations were exposed to prolonged darkness and aging by mimicking ballast water conditions in the laboratory. Upon prolonged darkness, the decay of phytoplankton, as indicated by the decrease in chlorophyll a in marine biofilms, led to remineralization and enhanced bacterial and protist populations. However, the same trend was not observed in the case of freshwater biofilms wherein the microbial parameters (i.e., bacteria, protists) and chlorophyll a decreased drastically. The bacterial community structure in such conditions was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and results showed that the biofilm bacterial communities changed significantly over a period of time. α-Proteobacteria was the most stable taxonomic group in the marine biofilms under dark conditions. However, β-proteobacteria dominated the freshwater biofilms and seemed to play an important role in organic matter remineralization. γ-Proteobacteria, which includes most of the pathogenic genera, were affected significantly and decreased in both the types of biofilms. This study revealed that marine biofilm communities were able to adapt better to the dark conditions while freshwater biofilm communities collapsed. Adaptation of tolerant bacterial communities, regeneration of nutrients via cell lysis, and presence of grazers appeared to be key factors for survival upon prolonged darkness.

The analogue peptides generated comprised 12 amino acids and displayed amphipathic α-helical structures, with higher hydrophobic moments and net positive charge than those of the Hp1404.

In good agreement with these results, in a cpxR mutant background, prtA is derepressed at 37°C, while overexpression of the NlpE lipoprotein, a well-known CpxAR-inducing condition, inhibits PrtA expression, suggesting that the levels of the activated form of CpxR are increased at 37°C over those at 30°C. In addition, we establish that PrtA is involved in the ability of S. marcescens to develop biofilm. In accordance, CpxR influences the biofilm phenotype only when bacteria are grown at 37°C.

In addition, biofilm heterogeneity led to minor differences in either disinfectant's biofilm penetration, and prior biofilm exposure to monochloramine provided little impact to subsequent free chlorine biofilm penetration.","authors":[{"name":"Woo Hyoung Lee"},{"name":"Jonathan G Pressman"},{"name":"David G Wahman"}],"keywords":[]},"article299":{"pmid":"29375642","title":"In Vitro Control of Uropathogenic Microorganisms with the Ethanolic Extract from the Leaves of Cochlospermum regium (Schrank) Pilger.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The roots of Cochlospermum regium, popularly known as algodãozinho-do-cerrado, are used for the treatment of genitourinary infections.

Therefore, the antimicrobial activity of Cochlospermum regium leaf's ethanolic extract and its action on the biofilm formation of microorganisms associated with urinary infection were evaluated. The total phenolic compounds, flavoids, and tannins were quantified using the reagents Folin-Ciocalteu, aluminum chloride, and vanillin, respectively. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the broth microdilution method and the effect of the extract in the biofilm treatment was measured by the drop plate method. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the method based on the reduction of MTS and the mutagenicity by the Ames test. The ethanolic extract of C. regium leaves presented 87.4 mg/EQ of flavonoids, 167.2 mg/EAG of total phenolic compounds, and 21.7 mg/ECA of condensed tannins. It presented reduction of the biofilm formation for E. coli and C. tropicalis and antimicrobial action of 1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively.

Altered immune recognition during this phase of growth is also evident by changes in the cytokine profiles of monocytes and macrophages exposed to biofilm. In this manuscript, we review the host response to fungal biofilms, focusing on how these structures are recognized by the innate immune system.

Dispersed bacterial cells from attached biofilms on medical devices or host tissues may also serve as the origin of further infections. Understanding how bacteria develop biofilms is pertinent to tackle biofilm-associated infections and transmission. Biofilms have been suggested as a continuum of growth modes for adapting to different environments, initiating from bacterial cells sensing their attachment to a surface and then switching cellular physiological status for mature biofilm development. It is crucial to understand bacterial gene regulatory networks and decision-making processes for biofilm formation upon initial surface attachment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the model microorganisms for studying bacterial population behaviors.

Bacterial biofilms are the major cause of chronic wound infections and are notoriously recalcitrant to treatments with antibiotics, making them difficult to eradicate. Thus, new approaches are required to combat biofilms in chronic wounds. One possible approach is to use drug combination therapies. Manuka honey has potent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and has previously shown synergistic activity in combination with antibiotics against common wound pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, manuka honey exhibits anti-biofilm activity, thereby warranting the investigation of its potential as a combination therapy with antibiotics for the topical treatment of biofilm-related infections. Here we report the first use of MacSynergy II to investigate the response of established S. aureus (strain NCTC 8325) biofilms to treatment by combinations of Medihoney (medical grade manuka honey) and conventional antibiotics that are used for preventing or treating infections: rifampicin, oxacillin, fusidic acid, clindamycin, and gentamicin. Using checkerboard microdilution assays, viability assays and MacSynergy II analysis we show that the Medihoney-rifampicin combination was more effective than combinations using the other antibiotics against established staphylococcal biofilms. Medihoney and rifampicin were strongly synergistic in their ability to reduce both biofilm biomass and the viability of embedded S. aureus cells at a level that is likely to be significant in vivo. Other combinations of Medihoney and antibiotic produced an interesting array of effects: Medihoney-fusidic acid treatment showed minor synergistic activity, and Medihoney-clindamycin, -gentamicin, and -oxacillin combinations showed overall antagonistic effects when the honey was used at sub-inhibitory concentration, due to enhanced biofilm formation at these concentrations which could not be counteracted by the antibiotics. However, these combinations were not antagonistic when honey was used at the inhibitory concentration. Confocal scanning laser microscopy confirmed that different honey-antibiotic combination treatments could eradicate biofilms. Our results suggest that honey has potential as an adjunct treatment with rifampicin for chronic wounds infected with staphylococcal biofilms. We also show that MacSynergy II allows a comprehensive examination of the synergistic effects of honey-antibiotic combinations, and can help to identify doses for clinical use.","authors":[{"name":"Michael Y Liu"},{"name":"Nural N Cokcetin"},{"name":"Jing Lu"},{"name":"Lynne Turnbull"},{"name":"Dee A Carter"},{"name":"Cynthia B Whitchurch"},{"name":"Elizabeth J Harry"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MacSynergy II"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"antibiotic"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"manuka"},{"word":"medihoney"},{"word":"natural product"},{"word":"synergy"}]},"article303":{"pmid":"29375516","title":"Synergistic Interactions within a Multispecies Biofilm Enhance Individual Species Protection against Grazing by a Pelagic Protozoan.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilm formation has been shown to confer protection against grazing, but little information is available on the effect of grazing on biofilm formation and protection in multispecies consortia. With most biofilms in nature being composed of multiple bacterial species, the interactions and dynamics of a multispecies bacterial biofilm subject to grazing by a pelagic protozoan predator were investigated. To this end, a mono and multispecies biofilms of four bacterial soil isolates, namely Xanthomonas retroflexus, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Microbacterium oxydans and Paenibacillus amylolyticus, were constructed and subjected to grazing by the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis. In monocultures, grazing strongly reduced planktonic cell numbers in P. amylolyticus and S. rhizophila and also X. retroflexus. At the same time, cell numbers in the underlying biofilms increased in S. rhizophila and X. retroflexus, but not in P. amylolyticus. This may be due to the fact that while grazing enhanced biofilm formation in the former two species, no biofilm was formed by P. amylolyticus in monoculture, either with or without grazing. In four-species biofilms, biofilm formation was higher than in the best monoculture, a strong biodiversity effect that was even more pronounced in the presence of grazing. While cell numbers of X. retroflexus, S. rhizophila, and P. amylolyticus in the planktonic fraction were greatly reduced in the presence of grazers, cell numbers of all three species strongly increased in the biofilm. Our results show that synergistic interactions between the four-species were important to induce biofilm formation, and suggest that bacterial members that produce more biofilm when exposed to the grazer not only protect themselves but also supported other members which are sensitive to grazing, thereby providing a shared grazing protection within the four-species biofilm model. Hence, complex interactions shape the dynamics of the biofilm and enhance overall community fitness under stressful conditions such as grazing. These emerging inter- and intra-species interactions could play a vital role in biofilm dynamics in natural environments like soil or aquatic systems.","authors":[{"name":"Prem K Raghupathi"},{"name":"Wenzheng Liu"},{"name":"Koen Sabbe"},{"name":"Kurt Houf"},{"name":"Mette Burmølle"},{"name":"Søren J Sørensen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Tetrahymena pyriformis"},{"word":"grazing"},{"word":"multispecies biofilm"},{"word":"species protection"},{"word":"synergy"}]},"article304":{"pmid":"29375501","title":"Impact of Seed Exudates on Growth and Biofilm Formation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ALB629 in Common Bean.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"We aimed to unravel the events which favor the seed-rhizobacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain ALB629 (hereafter ALB629) interaction and which may interfere with the rhizobacterium colonization and growth on the spermosphere of common bean.

Because of the danger and expense of cleanup of such radioactive sites by physicochemical processes, in situ bioremediation methods are being developed for cleanup of contaminated ground and groundwater. To date, the most developed microbial treatment proposed for high-level radioactive sites employs the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. However, the use of Deinococcus spp. and other bacteria is limited by their sensitivity to low pH. We report the characterization of 27 diverse environmental yeasts for their resistance to ionizing radiation (chronic and acute), heavy metals, pH minima, temperature maxima and optima, and their ability to form biofilms. Remarkably, many yeasts are extremely resistant to ionizing radiation and heavy metals. They also excrete carboxylic acids and are exceptionally tolerant to low pH. A special focus is placed on Rhodotorula taiwanensis MD1149, which was the most resistant to acid and gamma radiation. MD1149 is capable of growing under 66 Gy/h at pH 2.3 and in the presence of high concentrations of mercury and chromium compounds, and forming biofilms under high-level chronic radiation and low pH. We present the whole genome sequence and annotation of R. taiwanensis strain MD1149, with a comparison to other Rhodotorula species.

In this regard, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are increasingly recognized as a promising template for the development of antibiofilm drugs. Indeed, owing to their main mechanism of action, which relies on the permeabilization of bacterial membranes, AMPs exhibit a strong antimicrobial activity also against multidrug-resistant bacteria and slow-growing or dormant biofilm-forming cells and are less prone to induce resistance compared to current antibiotics. Furthermore, the antimicrobial potency of AMPs can be highly increased by combining them with conventional (antibiotics) as well as unconventional bioactive molecules. Combination treatments appear particularly attractive in the case of biofilms since the heterogeneous nature of these microbial communities requires to target cells in different metabolic states (e.g., actively growing cells, dormant cells) and environmental conditions (e.g., acidic pH, lack of oxygen or nutrients). Therefore, the combination of different bioactive molecules acting against distinct biofilm components has the potential to facilitate biofilm control and/or eradication.

In this study, it has been observed that the isolate UCN 34 is resistant to 20 mg/ml lysozyme in BHI medium, whereas the strain BAA-2069 builds more biofilm in the presence of lysozyme compared to in a control of BHI without lysozyme. A transcriptome analysis with whole genome microarrays of these two isolates in BHI medium with lysozyme compared to control without lysozyme revealed changes in gene expression levels. In the isolate BAA-2069, 67 genes showed increased expression in the presence of lysozyme, while in the isolate UCN 34, 165 genes showed increased expression and 30 genes showed decreased expression through lysozyme treatment. Products of genes which were higher expressed are in involved in transcription and translation, in cell-wall modification, in hydrogen peroxide resistance and in bacterial immunity. Furthermore, the adhesion ability of different strains of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus to collagen type I and IV was analyzed.

Full genome microarray analysis of these two strains revealed strain-dependent gene expression due to adhesion. The expression of 25 genes of a transposon and 15 genes of a phage region in strain DSM 16831 were increased, which corresponds to horizontal gene transfer.

However, there is scarce information about their proteolytic and lipolytic potential, and their biotechnological application is currently limited because enterococcal strains have been related to nosocomial infections. In this work, next-generation sequencing and optimised bioinformatic pipelines were used to annotate the genomes of two Enterococcus strains-one E. faecium and one E. faecalis-isolated from the Mexican artisanal ripened Cotija cheese. A battery of genes involved in their proteolytic system was annotated. Genes coding for lipases, esterases and other enzymes whose final products contribute to cheese aroma and flavour were identified as well. As for the production of antibacterial compounds, several peptidoglycan hydrolase- and bacteriocin-coding genes were identified in both genomes experimentally and by bioinformatic analyses. E. faecalis showed resistance to aminoglycosides and E. faecium to aminoglycosides and macrolides, as predicted by the genome functional annotation. No pathogenicity islands were found in any of the strains, although traits such as the ability of biofilm formation and cell aggregation were observed. Finally, a comparative genomic analysis was able to discriminate between the food strains isolated and nosocomial strains. In summary, pathogenic strains are resistant to a wide range of antibiotics and contain virulence factors that cause host damage; in contrast, food strains display less antibiotic resistance, include genes that encode class II bacteriocins and express virulence factors associated with host colonisation rather than invasion.","authors":[{"name":"Myrna Olvera-García"},{"name":"Alejandro Sanchez-Flores"},{"name":"Maricarmen Quirasco Baruch"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial compounds"},{"word":"Bacteriocins"},{"word":"Bioinformatic tools"},{"word":"Comparative genomics"},{"word":"Lactic acid bacteria proteolytic system"}]},"article319":{"pmid":"29372251","title":"Temporal Expression of Genes in Biofilm-Forming Ocular Candida albicans Isolated From Patients With Keratitis and Orbital Cellulitis.","date":"2018-07-27","abs":"To study antibiotic susceptibility and biofilm-forming potential of ocular isolates of Candida albicans along with gene expression.","authors":[{"name":"Konduri Ranjith"},{"name":"Sama Kalyana Chakravarthy"},{"name":"HariKrishna Adicherla"},{"name":"Savitri Sharma"},{"name":"Sisinthy Shivaji"}],"keywords":[]},"article320":{"pmid":"29372248","title":"Prevalence of High-Risk Human Papillomavirus in Tonsil Tissue in Healthy Adults and Colocalization in Biofilm of Tonsillar Crypts.","date":"2019-09-17","abs":"The pathogenesis of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is currently an important topic of elucidation.

Moreover, data obtained from transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies have shown that responses to phage predation are complex and diverse, varying greatly depending on the bacterial host, phage, and multiplicity of infection. Interestingly, phage exposure may alter different phenotypes, including virulence and biofilm formation. The complexity of the interactions between microbes and their viral predators is also evidenced by the link between quorum-sensing signaling pathways and bacteriophage resistance. Overall, new data increasingly suggests that both temperate and virulent phages have a positive effect on the evolution and adaptation of microbial populations.

Attachment rates of C. albicans WT cells were nearly 2-fold higher than C. albicans Δhog1 cells, although Δhog1 cells formed 4-fold higher biomass. The reduced normalized detachment rate was the primary factor responsible for the increased biomass of Δhog1 biofilm, showing that cell detachment rates are an important predictor for ultimate biofilm mass under flow.

A vast majority of invasive fungal infections are caused by species of Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus. Novel antifungal molecules consisting of unexploited chemical scaffolds with a unique mechanism are a pressing need. The present study identifies a dibromoquinoline compound (4b) with broad-spectrum antifungal activity that inhibits the growth of pertinent species of Candida (chiefly C. albicans), Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus at a concentration of as low as 0.5 μg/mL. Furthermore, 4b, at a subinhibitory concentration, interfered with the expression of two key virulence factors (hyphae and biofilm formation) involved in C. albicans pathogenesis. Three yeast deletion strains ( cox17Δ, ssa1Δ, and aft2Δ) related to metal ion homeostasis were found to be highly sensitive to 4b in growth assays, indicating that the compound exerts its antifungal effect through a unique, previously unexploited mechanism. Supplementing the media with either copper or iron ions reversed the strain sensitivity to 4b, further corroborating that the compound targets metal ion homeostasis. 4b's potent antifungal activity was validated in vivo, as the compound enhanced the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans infected with fluconazole-resistant C. albicans. The present study indicates that 4b warrants further investigation as a novel antifungal agent.","authors":[{"name":"Haroon Mohammad"},{"name":"Nehal H Elghazawy"},{"name":"Hassan E Eldesouky"},{"name":"Youssef A Hegazy"},{"name":"Waleed Younis"},{"name":"Larisa Avrimova"},{"name":"Tony Hazbun"},{"name":"Reem K Arafa"},{"name":"Mohamed N Seleem"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. elegans"},{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chemogenomic profiling"},{"word":"hyphae"}]},"article341":{"pmid":"29370419","title":"Study of the role of the covalently linked cell wall protein (Ccw14p) and yeast glycoprotein (Ygp1p) within biofilm formation in a flor yeast strain.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"Flor yeasts are Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains noted by their ability to create a type of biofilm in the air-liquid interface of some wines, known as 'flor' or 'velum', for which certain proteins play an essential role.

In addition, cytotoxicity of the most promising compounds was assessed using murine fibroblasts and expressed as half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50). Antifungal activity was determined using a broth microdilution assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was established against planktonic cells cultured in a range of concentrations of the test agents. The minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was determined by measuring re-growth of cells after pre-formed biofilm was treated for 24 h with the test agents. All tested commercial essential oils demonstrated anticandidal activity (MICs from 0.06% (v/v) to 0.4% (v/v)) against planktonic cultures, with a noticeable increase in resistance exhibited by biofilms (MBECs > 1.5% (v/v)). The IC50s of the commercial essential oils were lower than the MICs, while a one hour application of chlorhexidine was not cytotoxic at concentrations lower than the MIC.

It is increasingly argued that hosts and their microbiota must be studied together as 'holobionts' to better understand the effects of environmental stressors on host functioning. Disruptions of host-microbiota interactions by environmental stressors can negatively affect host performance and survival. Substantial ecological impacts are likely when the affected hosts are habitat-forming species (e.g., trees, kelps) that underpin local biodiversity. In marine systems, coastal urbanisation via the addition of artificial structures is a major source of stress to habitat formers, but its effect on their associated microbial communities is unknown. We characterised kelp-associated microbial communities in two of the most common and abundant artificial structures in Sydney Harbour-pier-pilings and seawalls-and in neighbouring natural rocky reefs. The kelp Ecklonia radiata is the dominant habitat-forming species along 8000 km of the temperate Australian coast. Kelp-associated microbial communities on pilings differed significantly from those on seawalls and natural rocky reefs, possibly due to differences in abiotic (e.g., shade) and biotic (e.g., grazing) factors between habitats. Many bacteria that were more abundant on kelp on pilings belonged to taxa often associated with macroalgal diseases, including tissue bleaching in Ecklonia. There were, however, no differences in kelp photosynthetic capacity between habitats. The observed differences in microbial communities may have negative effects on the host by promoting fouling by macroorganisms or by causing and spreading disease over time. This study demonstrates that urbanisation can alter the microbiota of key habitat-forming species with potential ecological consequences.","authors":[{"name":"Ezequiel M Marzinelli"},{"name":"Zhiguang Qiu"},{"name":"Katherine A Dafforn"},{"name":"Emma L Johnston"},{"name":"Peter D Steinberg"},{"name":"Mariana Mayer-Pinto"}],"keywords":[]},"article352":{"pmid":"29367593","title":"Active microbial biofilms in deep poor porous continental subsurface rocks.","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Deep continental subsurface is defined as oligotrophic environments where microorganisms present a very low metabolic rate.

At the same time, advanced knowledge of the natural composition of oral biofilm is needed. Early stages of caries-free permanent dentition with healthy gums provide a widely unaffected subgingival habitat that can serve as an in situ baseline for studying features of oral health and disease. Analysis of children's oral biofilm during different stages in life is thus an important theme in the field. Modern molecular analysis methods can provide comprehensive information about the bacterial diversity of such biofilms. To enable microbiota data comparison, it is important to standardize each step in the procedure for molecular data generation. This procedure spans from clinical sampling, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), bioinformatic data processing, to taxonomic interpretation. One of the most critical factors here is biofilm sampling.

Deletion of prhO substantially reduced the expression of the type III secretion system (T3SS) both in vitro and in planta, and resulted in significantly impaired virulence in tomato and tobacco plants. Complementary prhO completely restored the reduced virulence and T3SS expression to that of the wild-type. Moreover, PrhO-dependent T3SS and virulence were conserved amongst R. solanacearum species.

The expression of some type III effectors was significantly reduced in prhO mutants, but the hypersensitive response was not affected in tobacco leaves. Consistent with the key regulatory role of HrpB on T3SS, PrhO positively regulated the T3SS through HrpB. Furthermore, PrhO regulated hrpB expression via two close paralogues, HrpG and PrhG, which are two-component response regulators and positively regulate hrpB expression in a parallel manner. However, deletion of prhO did not alter the expression of phcA, prhJ and prhN, which are also involved in hrpB regulation.

Our study seeks to examine the differences in metabolome of low and high biofilm-formers using the metabolomic approach. Eight H. pylori clinical strains with different biofilm-forming-capability were chosen for metabolomic analysis. Bacterial metabolites were extracted using Bligh and Dyer method and analyzed by Liquid Chromatography/Quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry. The data was processed and analyzed using the MassHunter Qualitative Analysis and the Mass Profiler Professional programs. Based on global metabolomic profiles, low and high biofilm-formers presented as two distinctly different groups. Interestingly, low-biofilm-formers produced more metabolites than high-biofilm-formers. Further analysis was performed to identify metabolites that differed significantly (p-value < 0.005) between low and high biofilm-formers. These metabolites include major categories of lipids and metabolites involve in prostaglandin and folate metabolism. Our findings suggest that biofilm formation in H. pylori is complex and probably driven by the bacterium' endogenous metabolism.

The biofilm formation ability of E. faecalis plays a key role in its virulence and drug resistance attributes. The formation of E. faecalis biofilms on implanted medical devices often results in treatment failure. In the present study, we report protein markers associated with the biofilm formation ability of E. faecalis using iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics approach. In order to elucidate the biofilm-associated protein markers, we investigated the proteome of strong and weak biofilm-forming E. faecalis clinical isolates in comparison with standard American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) control strains. Comparison of E. faecalis strong and weak biofilm-forming clinical isolates with ATCC control strains showed that proteins associated with shikimate kinase pathway and sulfate transport were up-regulated in the strong biofilm former, while proteins associated with secondary metabolites, cofactor biosynthesis, and tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis were down-regulated. In the weak biofilm former, proteins associated with nucleoside and nucleotide biosynthesis were up-regulated, whereas proteins associated with sulfate and sugar transport were down-regulated. Further pathway and gene ontology analyses revealed that the major differences in biofilm formation arise from differences in metabolic activity levels of the strong and weak biofilm formers, with higher levels of metabolic activity observed in the weak biofilm former. The differences in metabolic activity could therefore be a major determinant of the biofilm ability of E. faecalis The new markers identified from this study can be further characterized in order to understand their exact role in E. faecalis biofilm formation ability.

The biofilms in GDM systems are able of removing harmful chemical components, particularly toxic cyanobacterial metabolites such as microcystins (MCs). This is relevant for the application of GDM filtration because anthropogenic nutrient input and climate change have led to an increase of toxic cyanobacterial blooms. However, removal of MCs in newly developing GDM biofilms is only established after a prolonged period of time. Since cyanobacterial blooms are transient phenomena, it is important to understand MC removal in mature biofilms with or without prior toxin exposure. In this study, the microbial community composition of GDM biofilms was investigated in systems fed with water from a lake with periodic blooms of MC-producing cyanobacteria. Two out of three experimental treatments were supplemented with dead biomass of a MC-containing cyanobacterial strain, or of a non-toxic mutant, respectively. Analysis of bacterial rRNA genes revealed that both biomass-amended treatments were significantly more similar to each other than to a non-supplemented control. Therefore, it was hypothesized that biofilms could potentially be 'primed' for rapid MC removal by prior addition of non-toxic biomass. A subsequent experiment showed that MC removal developed significantly faster in mature biofilms that were pre-fed with biomass from the mutant strain than in unamended controls, indicating that MC degradation was a facultative trait of bacterial populations in GDM biofilms. The significant enrichment of bacteria related to both aerobic and anaerobic MC degraders suggested that this process might have occurred in parallel in different microniches.","authors":[{"name":"Marisa O D Silva"},{"name":"Judith F Blom"},{"name":"Yana Yankova"},{"name":"Jörg Villiger"},{"name":"Jakob Pernthaler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Cyanotoxins"},{"word":"Gravity-driven membrane filtration"},{"word":"Microbial community structure"}]},"article379":{"pmid":"29357848","title":"Identification, synthesis and regulatory function of the N-acylated homoserine lactone signals produced by Pseudomonas chlororaphis HT66.","date":"2019-01-08","abs":"Pseudomonas chlororaphis HT66 isolated from the rice rhizosphere is an important plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria that produce phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) in high yield.

Transmission efficiency varies among flea species and the results from different studies have not always been consistent. One complicating variable is the species of rodent blood used for the infectious blood meal. To gain insight into the mechanism of EPT and the effect that host blood has on it, fleas were fed bacteremic mouse, rat, guinea pig, or gerbil blood; and the location and characteristics of the infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pestis were assessed 1 to 3 days after infection. Surprisingly, 10-28% of two rodent flea species fed bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood refluxed a portion of the infected blood meal into the esophagus within 24 h of feeding. We term this phenomenon post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). In contrast, PIER was rarely observed in rodent fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER correlated with the accumulation of a dense mixed aggregate of Y. pestis, red blood cell stroma, and oxyhemoglobin crystals that filled the proventriculus. At their next feeding, fleas with PIER were 3-25 times more likely to appear partially blocked, with fresh blood retained within the esophagus, than were fleas without PIER. Three days after feeding on bacteremic rat blood, groups of Oropsylla montana transmitted significantly more CFU than did groups infected using mouse blood, and this enhanced transmission was biofilm-dependent. Our data support a model in which EPT results from regurgitation of Y. pestis from a partially obstructed flea foregut and that EPT and BDT can sometimes temporally overlap. The relative insolubility of the hemoglobin of rats and Sciurids and the slower digestion of their blood appears to promote regurgitative transmission, which may be one reason why these rodents are particularly prominent in plague ecology.","authors":[{"name":"David M Bland"},{"name":"Clayton O Jarrett"},{"name":"Christopher F Bosio"},{"name":"B Joseph Hinnebusch"}],"keywords":[]},"article382":{"pmid":"29357283","title":"Perdeuteration of cholesterol for neutron scattering applications using recombinant Pichia pastoris.","date":"2019-01-22","abs":"Deuteration of biomolecules has a major impact on both quality and scope of neutron scattering experiments.

Crystal violet assay and XTT reduction assay were performed to evaluate the effects of 3,5-DCQA on biofilm biomass, extracellular matrix, and metabolic activity alteration of cells in biofilms. Real-time PCR was performed to quantify the expression of hydrophobin genes. The cytotoxicity of 3,5-DCQA on human erythrocytes was evaluated by a hemolytic assay. RESULTS The results indicated that 3,5-DCQA in subminimum inhibitory concentrations (256 to 1024 mg/L) elicited optimal A. fumigatus biofilm dispersion activity and improved the efficacy of VRC and AMB in minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) to combat fungal cells embedded in biofilms. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed 3,5-DCQA facilitated the entry of antifungal agents into the A. fumigatus biofilm through eliminating the hydrophobic extracellular matrix (ECM) without affecting fungal growth.

Catheters used for ECMO were prospectively collected aseptically from the femoral vein, internal jugular vein, and femoral artery of 81 patients with acute cardiorespiratory failure between January 2015 and October 2016. Prepared catheter sections were investigated by fluorescence microscopy, confocal scanning laser microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and using semiquantitative culture methods. Of the 81 patients, 51 were assigned to the infection group and 30 to a control group. Biofilms were identified in 43.1% patients in the infection group, and in 20% controls (p = 0.034). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flow, systemic infection, and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infection were associated with biofilm formation in a univariate analysis (odds ratio [OR]: 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.00, p = 0.007; OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.06-8.69, p = 0.039; OR: 9.60, 95% CI: 2.94-31.30, p < 0.001, respectively). However, of these factors, only CRAB infection was found to independently predict the presence of a biofilm by a multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR: 9.60, 95% CI: 2.94-31.30; p < 0.001). Biofilms were more prevalent in patients with an infection than in uninfected controls. Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infection was identified as an independent risk factor for biofilm formation on ECMO catheters.","authors":[{"name":"Hye Ju Yeo"},{"name":"Seong Hoon Yoon"},{"name":"Seung Eun Lee"},{"name":"Woo Hyun Cho"},{"name":"Dohyung Kim"},{"name":"Doosoo Jeon"},{"name":"Kyung-Hwa Shin"},{"name":"Yun Seong Kim"}],"keywords":[]},"article387":{"pmid":"29356343","title":"Metataxonomic approach to decipher the polymicrobial burden in diabetic foot ulcer and its biofilm mode of infection.","date":"2018-11-16","abs":"Chronic diabetic foot is a global burden affecting millions of people, and the chronicity of an ulcer is directly linked to the diverse bacterial burden and its biofilm mode of infection. The bacterial diversity of 100 chronic diabetic ulcer samples was profiled via traditional culturing method as well as metagenomic approach by sequencing the 16S rRNA V3 hyper-variable region on Illumina Miseq Platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). All the relevant clinical metadata, including duration of diabetes, grade of ulcer, presence of neuropathy, and glycaemic level, were noted and correlated with the microbiota. The occurrence and establishment of bacterial biofilm over chronic wound tissues was revealed by Fluorescent in situ Hybridization and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The biofilm-forming ability of predominant bacterial isolates was studied via crystal violet assay and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy. The dominant phyla obtained from bacterial diversity analysis were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. The dominant aerobic pathogens identified by culture method are Pseudomonas, Proteus, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus, whereas high-throughput sequencing revealed heightened levels of Streptococcus and Corynebacterium along with 22 different obligate anaerobes. The biofilm occurrence in chronic diabetic ulcer infection is well analysed. Herein, we illustrate the comprehensive pattern of bacterial infection and identify the community composition of chronic wound pathogenic biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Karthika Suryaletha"},{"name":"Joby John"},{"name":"Megha Periyappilly Radhakrishnan"},{"name":"Sanil George"},{"name":"Sabu Thomas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"diabetic ulcer"},{"word":"metagenomics"},{"word":"polymicrobial infection"}]},"article388":{"pmid":"29356249","title":"Effect of Origanum vulgare essential oil on biofilm formation and motility capacity of Pseudomonas fluorescens strains isolated from discoloured Mozzarella cheese.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The study was focused on Pseudomonas fluorescens strains isolated from Mozzarella cheese, with the aim of evaluating the effects of Origanum vulgare L. essential oil (OEO) on the biofilm formation and eradication, as well as on the motility and blue pigment production at 10°C.","authors":[{"name":"C Rossi"},{"name":"C Chaves-López"},{"name":"A Serio"},{"name":"F Anniballi"},{"name":"L Valbonetti"},{"name":"A Paparella"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas fluorescens"},{"word":"Mozzarella cheese"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"blue pigment"},{"word":"dairy products"},{"word":"essential oil"},{"word":"hydrophobicity"},{"word":"motility"}]},"article389":{"pmid":"29355905","title":"Hidradenitis suppurativa, a review of pathogenesis, associations and management.

Inoculation of wastewater samples with free carriers resulted in the greater removal of target pollutants. Removal efficiency of atrazine and chemical oxygen demand (COD) increased to 27% and 16%, with respect to the control, respectively. The total biomass accumulation in HMPBR exceeded 5g/L, and the microalgae tended to aggregate and attached to biofilm carriers. The removal efficiency of HMPBR improved significantly via inoculation of kenaf fiber carriers with bioremediation microalgal strains (p < 0.01). A lower stabilization ratio (VSS/TSS) was also recorded. The biomass in HMPBR included more lipids and carbohydrates. The results revealed that kenaf fibers could improve and upgrade the biological activity of different wastewater treatment applications, considering the great potential of biofilm carriers and their effluent quality.","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Derakhshan"},{"name":"Amir Hossein Mahvi"},{"name":"Mohammad Hassan Ehrampoush"},{"name":"Mohammad Taghi Ghaneian"},{"name":"Saeed Yousefinejad"},{"name":"Mohammad Faramarzian"},{"name":"Seyed Mohammad Mazloomi"},{"name":"Mansooreh Dehghani"},{"name":"Hossein Fallahzadeh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Algal biofilm"},{"word":"Biofilm carriers"},{"word":"Hybrid membrane photobioreactor"},{"word":"Microalgae"},{"word":"Sludge yield"},{"word":"Wastewater treatment"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"29355743","title":"Usefulness of sonication for diagnosing infection in explanted orthopaedic implants.","date":"2019-10-07","abs":"Orthopaedic implant infection is a rare but serious complication whose optimal treatment requires an accurate microbiological diagnosis.

While polyols have been used traditionally (for about 80 y) to replace sugar in sweet foods to reduce demineralization of tooth enamel and to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels, benefits achieved merely through the absence of sugar, emerging evidence shows that erythritol can play a number of functional roles to actively support maintenance of oral and systemic health. Oral health studies revealed that erythritol can reduce dental plaque weight, reduce dental plaque acids, reduce counts of mutans streptococci in saliva and dental plaque, and reduce the risk for dental caries better than sorbitol and xylitol, resulting in fewer tooth restorations by dentist intervention. Systemic health studies have shown that erythritol, unlike other polyols, is readily absorbed from the small intestine, not systemically metabolized, and excreted unchanged within the urine. This metabolic profile renders erythritol to be noncaloric, to have a high gastrointestinal tolerance, and not to increase blood glucose or insulin levels. Published evidence also shows that erythritol can act as an antioxidant and that it may improve endothelial function in people with type 2 diabetes. This article reviews the key research demonstrating erythritol's oral and systemic health functionalities and underlying mechanisms.","authors":[{"name":"P de Cock"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"diabetes mellitus"},{"word":"plaque biofilms"},{"word":"prevention"},{"word":"vascular biology"}]},"article395":{"pmid":"29355424","title":"Silver Diamine Fluoride: A Successful Anticarious Solution with Limits.","date":"2018-12-26","abs":"Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a solution containing ionic silver, fluoride, and ammonia that arrests the progress of carious lesions and prevents the development of future caries. The silver particle extends into the dentin tubules and could create some bonding problems for subsequent composite resin restorations placed over SDF-treated darkened tooth structures. The fluoride penetrates deeper into the tooth with SDF as compared with other fluoride solutions, creating a fluoride reservoir in the tooth structure. The fluoride component of SDF contributes to remineralization and fluorapatite formation, producing harder, more caries-resistant tooth structures. The silver provides the antimicrobial activity for the material and inhibits biofilm formation. It has been evaluated in >20 clinical studies and reviewed in systemic reviews. The material was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for desensitizing cold-sensitive teeth and has been used off-label to treat carious lesions. SDF will produce a caries lesion darker (brown to black) than the original, which is the major criticism of the material. A nanoparticle-sized silver material was recently developed that may retain the antimicrobial properties of the larger-sized ion silver material without the discoloring effects. The application of SDF is easily adapted for field use. The lesion is isolated, and the solution is painted onto the clean caries lesion and dried. This simple application process requires little equipment, and its low cost per application makes the material ideal for large populations.","authors":[{"name":"J O Burgess"},{"name":"P M Vaghela"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"demineralization"},{"word":"hypersensitivity"},{"word":"prevention"},{"word":"remineralization"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"29355423","title":"The Evidence for Caries Management by Risk Assessment (CAMBRA®).","date":"2019-02-01","abs":"A system for Caries Management by Risk Assessment (CAMBRA","authors":[{"name":"J D B Featherstone"},{"name":"B W Chaffee"}],"keywords":[{"word":"caries risk assessment"},{"word":"chlorhexidine"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"disease indicators"},{"word":"fluoride"}]},"article397":{"pmid":"29355422","title":"Oral Microbiome Studies: Potential Diagnostic and Therapeutic Implications.","date":"2018-12-26","abs":"Understanding the microbiology of dental caries is not a mere academic exercise; it provides the basis for preventive, diagnostic, and treatment strategies and gives the dentist a theoretical framework to become a better professional. The last years have seen the development of new research methodologies, ranging from high-throughput sequencing or omics techniques to new fluorescence microscopy applications and microfluidics, which have allowed the study of the oral microbiome to an unprecedented level of detail. Those studies have provided new insights about oral biofilm formation, biomarkers of caries risk, microbial etiology, appropriate sampling, identification of health-associated bacteria, and new anticaries strategies, among others. Several pitfalls are associated with the new technologies, including a small number of samples per study group, elevated cost, and genus- or species-based analyses that do not take into consideration intraspecies variability. However, the new data strongly suggest that saliva may not be an appropriate sample for etiological studies or for bacterial caries-risk tests, that microbial composition alone may be insufficient to predict caries risk, and that antimicrobial or immunization strategies targeting single species are unlikely to be effective. Strategies directed toward modulation of the oral biofilm, such as pre- and probiotics, emerge as promising new approaches to prevent tooth decay.","authors":[{"name":"A Mira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CLASI-FISH"},{"word":"Streptococcus dentisani"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"caries risk"},{"word":"diagnostic test"},{"word":"probiotics"}]},"article398":{"pmid":"29355421","title":"Therapeutic Strategies Targeting Cariogenic Biofilm Microenvironment.","date":"2019-02-01","abs":"Cariogenic biofilms are highly structured microbial communities embedded in an extracellular matrix, a multifunctional scaffold that is essential for the existence of the biofilm lifestyle and full expression of virulence. The extracellular matrix provides the physical and biological properties that enhance biofilm adhesion and cohesion, as well as create a diffusion-modulating milieu, protecting the resident microbes and facilitating the formation of localized acidic pH niches. These biochemical properties pose significant challenges for the development of effective antibiofilm therapeutics to control dental caries. Conventional approaches focusing solely on antimicrobial activity or enhancing remineralization may not achieve maximal efficacy within the complex biofilm microenvironment. Recent approaches disrupting the biofilm microbial community and the microenvironment have emerged, including specific targeting of cariogenic pathogens, modulation of biofilm pH, and synergistic combination of bacterial killing and matrix degradation. Furthermore, new smart nanotechnologies that trigger drug release or activation in response to acidic pH are being developed that could enhance the efficacy of current and prospective chemical modalities. Therapeutic strategies that can locally disrupt the pathogenic niche by targeting the biofilm structure and its microenvironment to eliminate the embedded microorganism and facilitate the action of remineralizing agents may lead to enhanced and precise anticaries approaches.","authors":[{"name":"Y Liu"},{"name":"Z Ren"},{"name":"G Hwang"},{"name":"H Koo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"acidic pH"},{"word":"antibiofilm therapeutics"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"matrix"},{"word":"nanotechnology"}]},"article399":{"pmid":"29355420","title":"The Anticaries Efficacy of a 1.5% Arginine and Fluoride Toothpaste.","date":"2018-12-26","abs":"Dental caries remains a world-wide disease despite the global distribution of fluoride. It has become apparent that the introduction of significant levels of sugar (fermentable carbohydrate) into the diet has resulted in a change in the biofilm, encouraging acid formation. Further, there has been a shift in the microbiota in the biofilm to a flora that produces acid, and thrives and reproduces in an acidic environment. The management of caries activity under these conditions has focused on brushing to remove the biofilm with fluoride pastes, and high-dose fluoride treatments. Kleinberg, in the 1970s, identified an arginine-containing compound in saliva that several oral biofilm bacterial species metabolize to produce base. Multiple in situ and in vivo studies have been conducted, and have discussed the ability of multiple bacteria to increase the resting pH of the biofilm and even reduce the decrease in pH when the biofilm is challenged with glucose. This shift in resting pH can shift the level of caries formation by the biofilm. Here, we present 8 clinical studies, with different clinical designs, measuring different clinical outcomes, for a diverse, world-wide population. Each of these studies demonstrates reductions in caries formation beyond that seen with fluoride alone and several demonstrate the reversal of early caries lesions. Significant clinical research has been shown that 1.5% arginine combined with fluoride toothpaste has superior anti-caries efficacy to toothpaste containing fluoride alone.","authors":[{"name":"M S Wolff"},{"name":"A B Schenkel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm(s)"},{"word":"caries"},{"word":"clinical studies/trials"},{"word":"plaque/plaque biofilms"},{"word":"root caries/resorption"},{"word":"salivary antimicrobial proteins"}]}}
