Poultry has been suggested to be a reservoir for antibiotic resistance that may aggravate the problem of transmission of enterococci infections. Between January and December 2016, 106 Enterococcus spp. were isolated from a total of three poultry species. The collection included isolates recovered from chickens (n = 30), ducks (n = 35) and pigeons (n = 41). All enterococci isolates were screened for their ability to form biofilm. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined against 13 antibiotics using the disc diffusion method. The presence of the eight resistance genes, vanA, vanB, vanC, catA, catB, fexA, fexB and cfr was determined by PCR. All 106 isolates were resistant to clindamycin, whereas majority of isolates (>90%) were resistant to erythromycin, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and vancomycin.

In addition, the viability of these bacteria to survive under simulated human gastrointestinal tract conditions as well as the production of virulence factors (homoserine lactones signal molecules, gelatinases, proteases, siderophores and biofilm formation) were studied. The results suggests that all the bacteria presented the capacity to attach and internalize into Caco-2 cells. A. salmonicida and P. fluorescens exhibited the highest ability to internalize. These bacteria were also found to be the highest proteases producers. A. salmonicida and K. pneumoniae survived under simulated human gastrointestinal conditions.

Diffusion of tobramycin from the deposit was modelled using a 3D geometric version of Fick's second law of diffusion. The time-dependent gradual increase in the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was studied using a Calgary Biofilm Device. The early inhibition zone was visible after 5 h of incubation. The corresponding calculated tobramycin concentration at the border was 1.9 µg/mL, which increased to 3.2 µg/mL and 6.3 µg/mL after 7 h and 24 h, respectively. The inhibition zone increased to the stable final zone after 7 h of incubation. Bacterial growth and small aggregate formation (young biofilms) took place inside the inhibition zone until the small aggregates contained less than ca. 64 cells and production of polysaccharide matrix including PSL had begun; thereafter, the small bacterial aggregates were killed by tobramycin. Bacteria at the border of the stable inhibition zone and beyond continued to grow to a mature biofilm and produced large amount of polysaccharide-containing matrix.

Understanding this complex process and its relationship to the community functions becomes a very important task for the applications of microbial biotechnology. In this study, we applied microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) with moderate species numbers and easily tractable functions as a model ecosystem, and constructed a series of biofilm communities with gradient biodiversity to examine the roles of community assembly in determining microbial community structure and functions. After stable biofilms formed, the best MEC reactor performances (e.g., gas productivity, total energy efficiency) were achieved in the group in which biofilms had the second highest α-diversity, and biofilms with even lower diversity showed declining performance. Null model analyses indicated that both deterministic and stochastic assembly played roles in the formation of biofilm communities. When deterministic assembly dominates this formation, the higher diversity of the biofilm community would generally show better reactor performance. However, when the stochasticity dominates the assembly process, the bioreactor performance would decline. This study provides novel evidence that the assembly mechanism could be one of the key processes to shift the functions, and proposes an important guidance for selecting the most efficient microorganisms for environmental biotechnologies.","authors":[{"name":"Zhaojing Zhang"},{"name":"Ye Deng"},{"name":"Kai Feng"},{"name":"Weiwei Cai"},{"name":"Shuzhen Li"},{"name":"Huaqun Yin"},{"name":"Meiying Xu"},{"name":"Daliang Ning"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Qu"}],"keywords":[]},"article5":{"pmid":"30615829","title":"Linking Exoproteome Function and Structure to Anammox Biofilm Development.","date":"2019-09-17","abs":"Extracellular proteins are of paramount importance in the cell-cell interactions of anammox biofilms. However, the inherent aggregation mechanisms of anammox have largely remained elusive. Herein, using a quartz sand extraction protocol and follow-up iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics, we identified 367 extracellular proteins from initial colonizers, mature biofilm, and detached biofilm. The extracellular proteins were mainly membrane-associated. Most of the recovered proteins (226, 72.5%) originated from the phylum Planctomycetes. In summary, 215 and 190 of the 367 proteins recovered were up- and/or downregulated at least 1.2-fold during the biofilm formation and detachment periods, respectively. These differentially expressed proteins were dominantly involved in metal ion binding, which was regarded as strong evidence for their abilities to enhance ionic bridges in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analysis of the biofilms further showed substantial levels of calcium and iron minerals. Critically, representative Sec-dependent secretory proteins affiliated with coccoid Planctomycetes, rod-shaped Proteobacteria, and filamentous Chloroflexi (11, 4, and 2 with differential expression, respectively) were found to have typical and abundant inner β-sheet structures, wherein hydrophobic moieties can promote anammox aggregation. Overall, these findings highlight links between differentially expressed protein functions and morphologic traits of anammox consortia during biofilm development.","authors":[{"name":"Zijian Chen"},{"name":"Yabing Meng"},{"name":"Binbin Sheng"},{"name":"Zhongbo Zhou"},{"name":"Chao Jin"},{"name":"Fangang Meng"}],"keywords":[]},"article6":{"pmid":"30615607","title":"CDI/CDS system-encoding genes of Burkholderia thailandensis are located in a mobile genetic element that defines a new class of transposon.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Intercellular communication and self-recognition are critical for coordinating cooperative and competitive behaviors during sociomicrobiological community development. Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) proteins are polymorphic toxin delivery systems that inhibit the growth of non-self neighboring bacteria that lack the appropriate immunity protein. In Burkholderia thailandensis, CDI system proteins (encoded by bcpAIOB genes) also induce cooperative behaviors among sibling (self) cells, a phenomenon called contact-dependent signaling (CDS). Here we describe a mobile genetic element (MGE) that carries the bcpAIOB genes in B. thailandensis E264. It is a ~210 kb composite transposon with insertion sequence (IS) elements at each end. Although the ISs are most similar to IS2 of Escherichia coli, the transposase-dependent intermediate molecule displays characteristics more similar to those of the IS26 translocatable unit (TU). A reaction requiring only the left IS-encoded transposase results in formation of an extrachromosomal circular dsDNA intermediate (the megacircle) composed of the left IS and the sequences intervening between the ISs. Insertion of the megacircle into the chromosome occurs next to a pre-existing copy of an IS2-like element, recreating a functional composite transposon. We found that BcpA activity is required for megacircle formation, and in turn, megacircle formation is required for CDS phenotypes. Our data support a model in which the bcpAIOB genes function as both helping and harming greenbeard genes, simultaneously enhancing the fitness of self bacteria that possess the same allele plus tightly linked genes that mediate cooperative behaviors, and killing non-self bacteria that do not possess the same bcpAIOB allele. Mobility of the megacircle between cells could allow bacteria invading a community to be converted to self, and would facilitate propagation of the bcpAIOB genes in the event that the invading strain is capable of overtaking the resident community.","authors":[{"name":"Angelica B Ocasio"},{"name":"Peggy A Cotter"}],"keywords":[]},"article7":{"pmid":"30614873","title":"Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Infection Compromises Wound Healing by Causing Deficiencies in Granulation Tissue Collagen.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"The objective of this work was to causatively link biofilm properties of bacterial infection to specific pathogenic mechanisms in wound healing.","authors":[{"name":"Sashwati Roy"},{"name":"Suman Santra"},{"name":"Amitava Das"},{"name":"Sriteja Dixith"},{"name":"Mithun Sinha"},{"name":"Subhadip Ghatak"},{"name":"Nandini Ghosh"},{"name":"Pradipta Banerjee"},{"name":"Savita Khanna"},{"name":"Shomita Mathew-Steiner"},{"name":"Piya Das Ghatak"},{"name":"Britani N Blackstone"},{"name":"Heather M Powell"},{"name":"Valerie K Bergdall"},{"name":"Daniel J Wozniak"},{"name":"Chandan K Sen"}],"keywords":[]},"article8":{"pmid":"30614760","title":"Disinfectant Resistance Profiles and Biofilm Formation Capacity of Escherichia coli Isolated from Retail Chicken.","date":"2019-11-29","abs":"Disinfectant resistance and biofilm formation capacity are two important characteristics that contribute to the persistence of microorganisms in food processing environments and contamination of food products.

In the present study, the antibiofilm activities of butenolide were examined using biofilms formed by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic model species. Four Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were used as targets in antibiofilm assays that examined the effects of butenolide, including the following: (i) on bacterial growth; (ii) in inhibiting biofilm formation and eradicating mature biofilm; (iii) on biofilm structures. In addition, the synergistic effect between butenolide with tetracycline was also examined. Butenolide not only effectively inhibited the biofilm formation but also eradicated pre-formed biofilms of tested bacteria. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) indicated that butenolide was a potential tetracycline enhancer against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA.

Here, by analyzing 9,000,000 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences and 270 Gb of metagenomic data, we comprehensively explored the taxa and functions related to biofilm formation in subtidal zones of the Red Sea. A clear difference was observed between the biofilm and adjacent seawater microbial communities in terms of the taxonomic structure at phylum and genus levels, and a huge number of genera were only present in the biofilms. Saturated alpha-diversity curves suggested the existence of more than 14,000 operational taxonomic units in one biofilm sample, which is much higher than previous estimates. Remarkably, the biofilms contained abundant and diverse transposase genes, which were localized along microbial chromosomal segments and co-existed with genes related to metal ion transport and resistance. Genomic analyses of two cyanobacterial strains that were abundant in the biofilms revealed a variety of metal ion transporters and transposases.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of DPO binding, we used structural analyses and biochemical assays to study the V. cholerae VqmA-DPO-DNA complex. These analyses revealed that VqmA contains an N-terminal homodimer domain (PAS) and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD). We observed that VqmA directly binds to a DPO molecule via a compact hydrophobic pocket, consisting of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and several α-helices. We also found that the VqmA dimer interacts with the quasi-palindromic sequence of the vqmR promoter through its DBD. The results of the biochemical studies indicated that a water atom and VqmA residues Phe-67 and Lys-101 play a key role in effector recognition, which is also assisted by Tyr-36 and Phe-99. This is the first molecular level view of the VqmA dimer bound to DPO and DNA.

Beta-helical structures merge features of the two motifs, containing two or three beta-sheet faces connected by loops or turns in a single protein. Beta-helical structures form the basis of proteins with diverse mechanical functions such as bacterial adhesins, phage cell-puncture devices, antifreeze proteins, and extracellular matrices. Alpha-helices are commonly found in cellular and extracellular matrix components, whereas beta-helices such as curli fibrils are more common as bacterial and biofilm matrix components. It is currently not known whether it may be advantageous to use one helical motif over the other for different structural and mechanical functions. To better understand the mechanical implications of using different helix motifs in networks, here we use Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations to mechanically unfold multiple alpha- and beta-helical proteins at constant velocity at the single molecule scale. We focus on the energy dissipated during unfolding as a means of comparison between proteins and work normalized by protein characteristics (initial and final length, # H-bonds, # residues, etc.). We find that although alpha-helices such as keratin and beta-helices CsgA and CsgB can require similar amounts of work to unfold, the normalized work per hydrogen bond, initial end to end length, and number of residues is greater for beta-helices at the same pulling rate. To explain this, we analyze the orientation of the backbone alpha carbons and backbone hydrogen bonds during unfolding. We find that the larger width and shorter height of beta-helices results in smaller angles between the protein backbone and the pulling direction during unfolding. As subsequent strands are separated from the beta-helix core, the angle between the backbone and the pulling direction diminishes. This marks a transition where beta-sheet hydrogen bonds become loaded predominantly in a collective shearing mode, which requires a larger rupture force. This finding underlines the importance of geometry in optimizing resistance to mechanical unfolding in proteins. The helix radius is identified here as an important parameter that governs how much sacrificial energy dissipation capacity can be stored in protein networks, where beta-helices offer unique properties.","authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth P DeBenedictis"},{"name":"Sinan Keten"}],"keywords":[]},"article51":{"pmid":"30604487","title":"In vivo detection of endotracheal tube biofilms in intubated critical care patients using catheter-based optical coherence tomography.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The formation of biofilms in the endotracheal tubes (ETTs) of intubated patients on mechanical ventilation is associated with a greater risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and death.

A major staphylococcal biofilm accumulation molecule is polysaccharide intracellular adhesin (PIA), which is synthesized by enzymes encoded by the icaADBC operon. Expression of PIA is highly variable among clinical isolates, suggesting that PIA expression levels are selected in certain niches of the host. However, the mechanisms that govern enhanced icaADBC transcription and PIA synthesis in these isolates are not known. We hypothesized that enhanced PIA synthesis in these isolates was due to function of IcaR and/or TcaR. Thus, two S. epidermidis isolates (1457 and CSF41498) with different icaADBC transcription and PIA expression levels were studied. Constitutive expression of both icaR and tcaR demonstrated that both repressors are functional and can completely repress icaADBC transcription in both 1457 and CSF41498. However, it was found that IcaR was the primary repressor for CSF41498 and TcaR was the primary repressor for 1457. Further analysis demonstrated that icaR transcription was repressed in 1457 in comparison to CSF41498, suggesting that TcaR functions as a repressor only in the absence of IcaR. Indeed, DNase I footprinting suggests IcaR and TcaR may bind to the same site within the icaR-icaA intergenic region. Lastly, we found mutants expressing variable amounts of PIA could rapidly be selected from both 1457 and CSF41498. Collectively, we propose that strains producing enhanced PIA synthesis are selected within certain niches of the host through several genetic mechanisms that function to repress icaR transcription, thus increasing PIA synthesis.","authors":[{"name":"Tra-My Hoang"},{"name":"C Zhou"},{"name":"J K Lindgren"},{"name":"M R Galac"},{"name":"B Corey"},{"name":"J E Endres"},{"name":"M E Olson"},{"name":"P D Fey"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"transcriptional regulation"}]},"article59":{"pmid":"30602371","title":"Pathobiont release from dysbiotic gut microbiota biofilms in intestinal inflammatory diseases: a role for iron?","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Gut microbiota interacting with an intact mucosal surface are key to the maintenance of homeostasis and health.

Here, we detail a model-based approach developed to characterize the viscoelastic properties of soft materials and bacterial biofilms based on experimental data obtained using the nondestructive dynamic optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique. The model predicted the frequency- and geometry-dependent propagation velocities of elastic waves in a soft viscoelastic plate supported by a rigid substratum. Our numerical calculations suggest that the dispersion curves of guided waves recorded in thin soft plates by the dynamic OCE technique are dominated by guided waves, whose phase velocities depend on the viscoelastic properties and plate thickness. The numerical model was validated against experimental measurements in agarose phantom samples with different thicknesses and concentrations. The model was then used to interpret guided wave dispersion curves obtained by the OCE technique in bacterial biofilms developed in a rotating annular reactor, which allowed the quantitative characterization of biofilm shear modulus and viscosity. This study is the first to employ measurements of elastic wave propagation to characterize biofilms, and it provides a novel framework combining a theoretical model and an experimental approach for studying the relationship between the biofilm internal physical structure and mechanical properties.","authors":[{"name":"Hong-Cin Liou"},{"name":"Fabrizio Sabba"},{"name":"Aaron I Packman"},{"name":"George Wells"},{"name":"Oluwaseyi Balogun"}],"keywords":[]},"article64":{"pmid":"30601523","title":"Synthesis and antimicrobial photodynamic effect of methylene blue conjugated carbon nanotubes on E. coli and S. aureus.","date":"2019-03-14","abs":"Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are one of the leading causes of high morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients.

In the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), light of the appropriate wavelength, and molecular oxygen, aPDT generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which lead to microbial cell death and cell damage.

We measured growth, architecture, pigment production and levels of ATP and reactive oxygen species in cyanobacterial biofilms formed on different coloured substrates.

Some of these substances (toxic contaminants) stress biological activity at all concentrations, while others (e.g., nutrients) subsidize it at low concentrations and stress it above a threshold, causing subsidy-stress responses. Thus, the overall effects of WWTP effluents depend mostly on their composition and the dilution capacity of the receiving water bodies. We assessed the immediate and legacy effects of WWTP effluents in artificial streams, where we measured the uptake of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) by the biofilm, biomass accrual, benthic metabolism and organic matter decomposition (OMD). In a first phase (32 d), the channels were subjected to a gradient of effluent contribution, from pure stream water to pure effluent. WWTP effluent affected the ecosystem processes we measured, although we found no clear subsidy-stress patterns except for biofilm biomass accrual. Instead, most of the processes were subsidized, although they showed complex and process-specific patterns. Benthic metabolism and OMD were subsidized without saturation, as they peaked at medium and high levels of pollution, respectively, but they never fell below control levels. SRP uptake was the only process that decreased with increasing effluent concentration. In a second phase of the experiment (23 d), all channels were kept on pure stream water to analyse the legacy effects of the effluent. For most of the processes, there were clear legacy effects, which followed either subsidy, stress, or subsidy-stress patterns. SRP uptake capacity was stressed with increasing pollution legacy, whereas algal accrual and benthic metabolism continued being subsidized. Conversely, biofilm biomass accrual and OMD showed no legacy effects. Overall, the WWTP effluent caused complex and process-specific responses in our experiment, mainly driven by the mixed contribution of subsidizers and stressors.

This work demonstrates how the moduli and/or local polymer concentration play critical roles in sustaining contact, dynamic adhesion, and transport of bacterial cells along a hydrogel or hydrated brush surface. In particular, stiffer more concentrated hydrogels and brushes maintained the greatest dynamic contact, still allowing cells to travel along the surface in flow. This study addressed how the mechanical properties, molecular architectures, and thicknesses of minimally adhesive poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based coatings influence the flow-driven surface motion of Staphylococcus aureus MS2 cells. Three protein-repellant PEG-dimethylacrylate hydrogel films (∼100 μm thick) and two protein-repellant PEG brushes (8-16 nm thick) were sufficiently fouling-resistant to prevent the accumulation of flowing bacteria. However, the rolling or hopping-like motions of gently flowing S. aureus cells along the surfaces were specific to the particular hydrogel or brush, distinguishing these coatings in terms of their mechanical properties (with moduli from 2 to 1300 kPa) or local PEG concentrations (in the range 10-50% PEG). On the stiffer hydrogel coatings having higher PEG concentrations, S. aureus exhibited long runs of surface rolling, 20-50 μm in length, an increased tendency of cells to repeatedly return to some surfaces after rolling and escaping, and relatively long integrated contact times. By contrast, on the softer more dilute hydrogels, bacteria tended to encounter the surface for brief periods before escaping without return. The dynamic adhesion and motion signatures of the cells on the two brushes were bracketed by those on the soft and stiff hydrogels, demonstrating that PEG coating thickness was not important in these studies where the vertically oriented surfaces minimized the impact of gravitational forces. Control studies with similarly sized poly(ethylene oxide)-coated rigid spherical microparticles, that also did not arrest on the PEG coatings, established that the bacterial skipping and rolling signatures were specific to the S. aureus cells and not simply diffusive. Dynamic adhesion of the S. aureus cells on the PEG hydrogel surfaces correlated well with quiescent 24 h adhesion studies in the literature, despite the orientation of the flow studies that eliminated the influence of gravity on bacteria-coating normal forces.","authors":[{"name":"Kristopher W Kolewe"},{"name":"Surachate Kalasin"},{"name":"Molly Shave"},{"name":"Jessica D Schiffman"},{"name":"Maria M Santore"}],"keywords":[{"word":"S. aureus MS2"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofouling"},{"word":"hydrogel"},{"word":"infection"},{"word":"microparticle"},{"word":"microsphere"},{"word":"polyethylene glycol"},{"word":"polyethylene oxide"}]},"article97":{"pmid":"32140057","title":"Pathogen profile and MMP-3 levels in areas with varied attachment loss in generalized aggressive and chronic periodontitis.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"The progression of periodontitis depends on the changes in bone and connective tissue homeostasis and the imbalance of the biofilm and the host immunoinflammatory response, particularly matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).","authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Yilmaz"},{"name":"GöKHAN Kasnak"},{"name":"Nuray G Polat"},{"name":"Nursen E Topcuoglu"},{"name":"GüVEN KüLEKCI"},{"name":"Erhan Firatli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MMP"},{"word":"aggressive periodontitis"},{"word":"chronic periodontitis"},{"word":"gingival crevicular fluid"},{"word":"pathogens"}]},"article98":{"pmid":"32134584","title":"Is antibiotic lock therapy effective for the implantable longterm catheter-related bloodstream infections in children?","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Tural Kara T, Özdemir H, Erat T, Yahşi A, Aysev AD, Taçyıldız N, Ünal E, İleri T, İnce E, Haskoloğlu Ş, Çiftçi E, İnce E.

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are an important problem in pediatric patients with central venous catheters. This study aimed to determine the incidence of CRBSIs, responsible pathogens and outcomes of antibiotic lock treatment (ALT) in pediatric patients. Between January 2010 and November 2015 all hospitalized pediatric hematology, oncology and immunology patients diagnosed with CRBSIs were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-eight CRBSI episodes were detected in 60 pediatric patients. The incidence of CRBSIs was 4.20/1000 catheter days. The most frequently detected pathogen was methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., and Escherichia coli were other commonly isolated microorganisms. ALT was administered in 42 patients. The success rate of ALT was 81% (34/42). Catheter was removed without ALT in 36 episodes. Common reasons for catheter removal were sepsis and causative microorganisms which had high probability of biofilm formation. CRBSIs are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. ALT is safe and effective. It is possible to obtain satisfactory results when ALT is used with intravenous systemic antibiotics for CRBSIs, though in some cases catheter removal is necessary. ALT helps to prevent unnecessary catheter removal in pediatric patients.","authors":[{"name":"Tuğçe Tural Kara"},{"name":"Halil Özdemir"},{"name":"Tuğba Erat"},{"name":"Aysun Yahşi"},{"name":"Ahmet Derya Aysev"},{"name":"Nurdan Taçyıldız"},{"name":"Emel Ünal"},{"name":"Talia İleri"},{"name":"Elif İnce"},{"name":"Şule Haskoloğlu"},{"name":"Ergin Çiftçi"},{"name":"Erdal İnce"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic lock therapy"},{"word":"catheter-related bloodstream infections"},{"word":"central venous catheter"}]},"article99":{"pmid":"30594743","title":"Whole room disinfection with hydrogen peroxide mist to control Listeria monocytogenes in food industry related environments.","date":"2019-03-26","abs":"Listeria monocytogenes surviving daily cleaning and disinfection is a challenge for many types of food industries.

In the current study, bench-scale biofilters were designed according to a biofilter scaling model from the literature, and the ability of the bench-scale biofilters to accurately represent the organics removal of pilot-scale biofilters was tested. To ensure similarity in effluent water quality between bench- and pilot- or full-scale biofilters at the same influent substrate concentration, the tested model requires that either mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss takes primacy over the other. The potential primacy of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss was evaluated via water quality testing (dissolved organic carbon, specific ultraviolet absorbance, liquid chromatography - organic carbon detection, trihalomethane formation potential, and haloacetic acid formation potential). The biofilters also were characterized for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, enzyme activity, extracellular polymeric substances, and microbial community structure. The results of this study indicate that biofilm shear loss takes primacy over mass transport resistance for bench-scale biofilter design in this system; thus, bench-scale biofilters designed in this manner accurately represent organics removal in pilot-scale biofilters. Applying this scaling procedure can reduce filter media requirements from many kilograms to just a few grams and daily water requirements from thousands of liters to less than 10 L. This scaling procedure will allow future researchers to test alternative treatment designs and operating conditions without the need for expensive pilot-scale studies.","authors":[{"name":"Michael J McKie"},{"name":"Michal C Ziv-El"},{"name":"Liz Taylor-Edmonds"},{"name":"Robert C Andrews"},{"name":"Mary Jo Kirisits"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bench-scale biofilters"},{"word":"Biofilter scaling procedure"},{"word":"Biomass characterization"},{"word":"Enzyme activity"},{"word":"Microbial community analysis"},{"word":"Organics removal"}]},"article106":{"pmid":"30594092","title":"Impact of blending for direct potable reuse on premise plumbing microbial ecology and regrowth of opportunistic pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria.","date":"2019-09-25","abs":"Little is known about how introducing recycled water intended for direct potable reuse (DPR) into distribution systems and premise plumbing will affect water quality at the point of use, particularly with respect to effects on microbial communities and regrowth.

In this study, the impact of blending purified DPR water with traditional drinking water sources was investigated with respect to treatment techniques, blending location, and blending ratio. Water from four U.S. utility partners was treated in bench- and pilot-scale treatment trains to simulate DPR with blending.

The microbial community composition was profiled and the resistome (i.e., all ARGs present) was characterized in select samples using next generation sequencing. While regrowth of total bacteria (16S rRNA genes) from the start of the incubation through week eight consistently occurred across tested scenarios (Wilcoxon, p ≤ 0.0001), total bacteria were not more abundant in the water or biofilm of any DPR scenario than in the corresponding conventional potable condition (p ≥ 0.0748).

The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans expresses three copper-only SODs, and deletion of one of them, SOD5, eradicated candidal biofilms on venous catheters in a rodent model. Fungal copper-only SODs harbor an irregular active site that, unlike their Cu,Zn-SOD counterparts, contains a copper co-factor unusually open to solvent and lacks zinc for stabilizing copper binding, making fungal copper-only SODs highly vulnerable to metal chelators. We found that unlike mammalian Cu,Zn-SOD1, C. albicans SOD5 indeed rapidly loses its copper to metal chelators such as EDTA, and binding constants for Cu(II) predict that copper-only SOD5 has a much lower affinity for copper than does Cu,Zn-SOD1. We screened compounds with a variety of indications and identified several metal-binding compounds, including the ionophore pyrithione zinc (PZ), that effectively inhibit C. albicans SOD5 but not mammalian Cu,Zn-SOD1.

We found differences in the distribution of spa types between the strains from clinical and subclinical cases. Prevalence of lukM was also higher in strains from clinical cases than in strains from subclinical cases. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was then used to determine factors influencing the duration of the infection. Considering a multivariable model of the logistic regression, time to elimination was shorter with the strains of the subclinical lactation series compared to the clinical series (series with at least one clinical case). Strains from the spa type t359 and t529 were less likely to persist compared to those of spa type t13410. In sum, strain characterization including determination of the spa type helps to predict duration of infection and the clinical or subclinical outcome of S. aureus IMIs.","authors":[{"name":"S Pichette-Jolette"},{"name":"G Millette"},{"name":"E Demontier"},{"name":"D Bran-Barrera"},{"name":"M Cyrenne"},{"name":"C Ster"},{"name":"D Haine"},{"name":"G Keefe"},{"name":"F Malouin"},{"name":"J P Roy"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bovine mastitis"},{"word":"Duration of infection"},{"word":"Persistency"},{"word":"S. aureus"},{"word":"Severity of infection"}]},"article115":{"pmid":"30593363","title":"Induction of arthritis in chickens by infection with novel virulent Salmonella Pullorum strains.","date":"2019-01-14","abs":"Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum biovar Pullorum (Salmonella Pullorum) is a host-specific serovar causing systemic infection with high mortality in young chicks. Pullorum disease is characterized by white diarrhea. However, arthritis has become increasingly frequent recently, particularly in southern China. The aim of the present study was to determine the pathogenesis and arthritis induction of new Salmonella Pullorum isolates. We isolated and identified five Salmonella Pullorum strains from broilers with bacterial arthritis and lameness in a commercial poultry farm. Four of five isolates were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics and were defined as multidrug-resistant Salmonella Pullorum. All isolates had the same CRISPR sequence type and belonged to a single major cluster. The isolates exhibited high capability of biofilm formation, which may facilitate their dispersal and survival in hostile habitats, and showed high virulence based on embryo lethality and inoculation of newly hatched chicks. Tissue distribution analysis confirmed that SP1621 was more adapted to colonize the joint when compared to the white diarrhoea-causing Salmonella Pullorum reference strain S06004. Reproducible arthritis and typical joint lesions were observed in SP1621-infected chicks, and histopathological examination showed necrotic synovitis and cartilage tissue hyperplasia of the joint. Koch's postulates were confirmed when the novel Salmonella Pullorum strain was re-isolated from the joint tissues of experimentally inoculated chicks. These novel Salmonella Pullorum isolates have unique ability to induce arthritis in chickens, representing expanded pathogenic diversity in China. These results suggest the need for strict control strategies and new vaccines to prevent the disease.","authors":[{"name":"Rongxian Guo"},{"name":"Zhuoyang Li"},{"name":"Xiaohui Zhou"},{"name":"Cuiying Huang"},{"name":"Yachen Hu"},{"name":"Shizhong Geng"},{"name":"Xiang Chen"},{"name":"Qiuchun Li"},{"name":"Zhiming Pan"},{"name":"Xinan Jiao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Arthritis"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Chicken"},{"word":"Salmonella Pullorum"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article116":{"pmid":"30592554","title":"Imperfect repeats in the functional amyloid protein FapC reduce the tendency to fragment during fibrillation.","date":"2020-03-26","abs":"Functional amyloid (FA) is widespread in bacteria and serves multiple purposes such as strengthening of biofilm and contact with eukaryotic hosts. Unlike pathological amyloid, FA has been subjected to evolutionary optimization which is likely to be reflected in the aggregation mechanism. FA from different bacteria, including Escherichia coli (CsgA) and Pseudomonas (FapC), contains a number of imperfect repeats which may be key to efficient aggregation. Here we report on the aggregative behavior of FapC constructs which represent all single, double, and triple deletions of the protein's three imperfect repeats. Analysis of the fibrillation kinetics by the program Amylofit reveals that the removal of these repeats increases the tendency of the growing fibrils to fragment and also generally increases aggregation half-times. Remarkably, even the mutant lacking all three repeats was able to fibrillate, although fibrillation was much more irregular and led to significantly altered and destabilized fibrils. We conclude that imperfect repeats can promote fibrillation efficiency thanks to their modular design, though the context of the imperfect repeats also plays a significant role.","authors":[{"name":"Casper B Rasmussen"},{"name":"Gunna Christiansen"},{"name":"Brian S Vad"},{"name":"Carina Lynggaard"},{"name":"Jan J Enghild"},{"name":"Maria Andreasen"},{"name":"Daniel Otzen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Amylofit"},{"word":"FapC"},{"word":"Thioflavin T"},{"word":"aggregation mechanisms"},{"word":"kinetic analysis"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"30592324","title":"Inhibitory effects of fruit berry extracts on Streptococcus mutans biofilms.","date":"2019-12-30","abs":"Dark-colored fruit berries are a rich source of polyphenols that could provide innovative bioactive molecules as natural weapons against dental caries.

Cisplatin was found to effectively kill strains of P. aeruginosa. In such experiments, transcriptomic profiling showed upregulation of the recA gene, which is known to be important for DNA repair, implicating that cisplatin could interfere with DNA replication in P. aeruginosa. Cisplatin treatment significantly repressed the type III secretion system (T3SS), which is important for the secretion of exotoxins. Furthermore, cisplatin was also demonstrated to eradicate in vitro biofilms and in vivo biofilms in a murine keratitis model. This showed that cisplatin could be effectively used to eradicate biofilm infections which were otherwise difficult to be treated by conventional antibiotics. Although cisplatin is highly toxic for humans upon systemic exposure, a low toxicity was demonstrated with topical treatment.

Current treatments using antimicrobials are under increasing scrutiny due to rising prevalence of multi-drug resistance in S. aureus. Objectives of this study were to determine: (1) genetic diversity of Staphylococcus species isolated from clinical mastitis in cows from large Chinese dairy farms; and (2) prevalence and distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) in these isolates. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 96) were isolated from 26 herds located in 12 provinces of China, whereas NAS (n = 112) were isolated from 59 herds located in 18 provinces of China. The NAS were identified at the species level using a partial 16S rRNA sequencing method, whereas random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR was done to determine genetic relationships of isolates. Finally, PCR was used to detect resistance and biofilm formation genes. Staphylococcus chromogenes (33%) was the most common NAS species, followed by Staphylococcus sciuri (17%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%). Staphylococcus aureus was grouped in 12 genotypes, of which 2 types represented 56% of isolates. Staphylococcus chromogenes (n = 37) clustered into 8 RAPD types, with 2 prevalent types containing 73% of isolates. The most prevalent ARG in S. aureus isolates was blaZ (95%), followed by tetM (33%), tetK (31%), ermT (26%), and aacA-aphD (23%). The mecA and vanA were detected in 16 and 4% of isolates, respectively. In NAS, blaZ (100%), mecA (73%), tetK (79%), tetM (96%), mphC (63%), and msrA (54%) were frequently detected. Antimicrobial resistance genes mecA, tetK, tetL, tetM, dfrG, ermB, msrA, mphC, aadD, and aphA3 were more commonly detected in NAS than in S. aureus. Biofilm formation genes (icaA and icaD) were frequently detected in staphylococci isolated from bovine clinical mastitis.

At the initial stage of the cell attachment, the electrochemical activity of Gs cells at a submonolayer coverage on the SAM-Au surface was independent of the linker length. Subsequently, multiple potential cyclings indicated that longer linkers provided more biocompatible conditions for Gs cells than shorter ones. For Gs biofilms, on the other hand, the turnover current decreased exponentially with the linker length. During the biofilm formation, bacteria need to adjust from the initial planktonic state to an electrode-respiring state, which was triggered by a strong electrochemical stress found for shorter linkers, resulting in the formation of mature biofilms.

Chronic wounds are a silent epidemic essentially affecting people with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and obesity and elderly persons particularly those with movement limitations. The development of complementary and alternative effective strategies to antibiotics for the treatment of chronic wounds is highly desired. Phage therapy constitutes a very promising approach in the control of topical microbial populations. In this work newly isolated phages were tested for their efficacy to control bacterial species that predominate in chronic wounds. Phage effectiveness was studied on 24-h old biofilms formed in polystyrene microplates and in porcine skin explants using two treatment approaches: individual phage and a cocktail of phages against four main pathogens commonly isolated from chronic wounds. The two models produced variations in the surface colonization ability, assessed by viable bacterial counts and microscopy visualization after using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) or locked nucleic acid probes (LNA) and 2'-O-methyl (2'-OMe) in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and in the phage-host interactions. Phages alone and combined caused greater reductions in the number of viable cells when biofilms had been formed on porcine skins and with greater variations detected at 4 h and 24 h of sampling. These results suggest that porcine skin models should be preferentially used to assess the use of phages and phage cocktails intended for topical use in order to understand the fate, throughout treatment time, of the population when dealing with biofilm-related infections.","authors":[{"name":"C Milho"},{"name":"M Andrade"},{"name":"D Vilas Boas"},{"name":"D Alves"},{"name":"S Sillankorva"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacteriophages"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Chronic wounds"},{"word":"Porcine skin model"}]},"article131":{"pmid":"30589497","title":"PEEK materials as an alternative to titanium in dental implants: A systematic review.","date":"2019-06-27","abs":"Evaluation of the available research on PEEK materials to find that whether PEEK material has favorable properties and can enhance osseointegration, so that they can be utilize as implants material.","authors":[{"name":"Sunil Mishra"},{"name":"Ramesh Chowdhary"}],"keywords":[{"word":"carbon fiber-reinforced "},{"word":"fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone-nanohydroxyapatite"},{"word":"osseointegration"},{"word":"periimplantitis"},{"word":"polyetheretherketone"}]},"article132":{"pmid":"30589261","title":"Selective Labeling and Growth Inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Aminoguanidine Carbon Dots.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly virulent bacterium, particularly associated with the spread of multidrug resistance.

Murein lytic transglycosylases (LT), potentially involved in XccA pathogenicity, are enzymes responsible for peptidoglycan structure assembly, remodeling and degradation. They directly impact cell wall expansion during bacterial growth, septum division allowing cell separation, cell wall remodeling allowing flagellar assembly, bacterial conjugation, muropeptide recycling, and secretion system assembly, in particular the Type 3 Secretion System involved in bacterial virulence, which play a fundamental role in XccA pathogenicity. Information about the XccA LT arsenal is patchy: little is known about family diversity, their exact role or their connection to virulence in this bacterium. Among the LTs with possible involvement in virulence, two paralogue open reading frames (ORFs) (one on the chromosome and one in plasmid pXAC64) are passenger genes of the Tn3 family transposon TnXax1, known to play a significant role in the evolution and emergence of pathogenicity in Xanthomonadales and to carry a variety of virulence determinants. This study addresses LT diversity in the XccA genome and examines the role of plasmid and chromosomal TnXax1 LT passenger genes using site-directed deletion mutagenesis and functional characterization. We identified 13 XccA LTs: 12 belong to families 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D (two copies), 1F, 1G, 3A, 3B (two copies), 5A, 6A and one which is non-categorized. The non-categorized LT is exclusive to the Xanthomonas genus and related to the 3B family but contains an additional domain linked to carbohydrate metabolism. The categorized LTs are probably involved in cell wall remodeling to allow insertion of type 3, 4 and 6 secretion systems, flagellum assembly, division and recycling of cell wall and degradation and control of peptidoglycan production. The TnXax1 passenger LT genes (3B family) are not essential to XccA or for CC development but are implicated in peptidoglycan metabolism, directly impacting bacterial fitness and CC symptom enhancement in susceptible hosts (e.g., Citrus sinensis). This underlines the role of TnXax1 as a virulence and pathogenicity-propagating agent in XccA and suggests that LT acquisition by horizontal gene transfer mediated by TnXax1 may improve bacterial fitness, conferring adaptive advantages to the plant-pathogen interaction process.","authors":[{"name":"Amanda C P Oliveira"},{"name":"Rafael M Ferreira"},{"name":"Maria Inês T Ferro"},{"name":"Jesus A Ferro"},{"name":"Mick Chandler"},{"name":"Alessandro M Varani"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Comparative genomics"},{"word":"Lateral gene transfer"},{"word":"Tn3"},{"word":"Xanthan gum"}]},"article136":{"pmid":"30588133","title":"Inhibition of bacterial attachment and biofilm formation by a novel intravenous catheter material using an in vitro percutaneous catheter insertion model.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Despite sterile barrier precautions and vigorous skin antisepsis, percutaneous insertion of intravenous catheters has been shown to result in attachment to the catheter surface of bacteria residing in the deep structures of the skin.

To eliminate the bacteria, immune system cells release substances that inflame and damage the gums, periodontal ligament, or alveolar bone, leading to swollen bleeding gums, which is a sign of gingivitis. Damage from periodontal disease can cause teeth to loosen also. Studies have demonstrated the proteomic approach to be a promising tool for the discovery and identification of biochemical markers of periodontal diseases. Recently, many studies have applied expression proteomics to identify proteins whose expression levels are altered by disease. As a fluid lying in close proximity to the periodontal tissue, the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is the principal target in the search for periodontal disease biomarkers because its protein composition may reflect the disease pathophysiology. Biochemical marker analysis of GCF is effective for objective diagnosis in the early and advanced stages of periodontal disease.

Peptides isolated from Peganum harmala (PhAMP) exhibited maximum activity against laboratory strains. As clinical-isolates are more virulent and resistant to antibiotics, we tested the potential of PhAMP on these bacterial strains isolated from infected wounds. Pathogens isolated from burn-wounds (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae) and surgical-wounds (P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae) exhibited zones of inhibition against PhAMP when tested by disc diffusion method. Biofilm formation of wound pathogens in the presence/absence of PhAMP was analyzed to check its effect. Surgical-wound pathogens and K. pneumoniae from burn-wound showed significant reduction in biofilm formation and planktonic bacteria. While biofilms of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa from burn-wound showed resistance against PhAMP. An effective antibiotic treatment should not only inhibit but should also disrupt already developed biofilms. PhAMP was very effective in the disruption of developed biofilm of all pathogens after 36 hours.

Bacillus cereus can metabolize a variety of xenobiotic aromatic compounds as carbon sources and is used in bioremediation. GOQDs contain a variety of aromatic hydrocarbon structures, explaining why the bacteria achieve strong tolerance to PAHs. GOQD-activated cytokinesis increases the secretion of substances important for biofilm formation (extracellular polymeric substances), which further accelerates PAH removal. Proteomic analysis reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying GOQD-induced microbial proliferation. GOQDs induce the overexpression of microbial divisomal proteins associated with division initiation, DNA replication and peptidoglycan hydrolysis/synthesis. Importantly, PAH removal mediated by GOQD-treated Bacillus cereus does not require the addition of GOQDs.

Until now, restorative polymeric fillings present no bioactivity. The complexity of oral biofilms contributes to the difficulty in developing effective novel dental materials. Nanotechnology has been explored in the development of bioactive dental materials to reduce or modulate the activities of caries-related bacteria. Nano-structured platforms based on calcium phosphate and metallic particles have advanced to impart an anti-caries potential to restorative materials. The bioactivity of these platforms induces prevention of mineral loss of the hard tooth structure and antibacterial activities against carries-related pathogens.

The results obtained will be compiled with existing data on antibiotic resistant staphylococci from Portugal in a user-friendly database, to generate a geographically detailed epidemiological output for surveillance of AMR in MRSA. To achieve this, we will first characterize AMR and genetic lineages of MRSA circulating in northern Portugal in hospital wastewaters, farms near hospitals, farm animals that contact with humans, and wild animals. This will indicate the extent of the AMR problem in the context of local and regional human-animal-environment interactions. MRSA strains will then be tested for their ability to form biofilms. The proteomes of the strains will be compared to better elucidate their AMR mechanisms. Proteomics data will be integrated with the genomic and transcriptomic data obtained. The vast amount of information expected from this omics approach will improve our understanding of AMR in MRSA biofilms, and help us identify new vaccine candidates and biomarkers for early diagnosis and innovative therapeutic strategies to tackle MRSA biofilm-associated infections and potentially other AMR superbugs.","authors":[{"name":"Gilberto Igrejas"},{"name":"Susana Correia"},{"name":"Vanessa Silva"},{"name":"Michel Hébraud"},{"name":"Manuela Caniça"},{"name":"Carmen Torres"},{"name":"Catarina Gomes"},{"name":"Fernanda Nogueira"},{"name":"Patrícia Poeta"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"One Health"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"omics"},{"word":"surveillance"}]},"article159":{"pmid":"30581112","title":"A Surface-Induced Asymmetric Program Promotes Tissue Colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-03-14","abs":"The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa effectively colonizes host epithelia using pili as primary adhesins. Here we uncover a surface-specific asymmetric virulence program that enhances P. aeruginosa host colonization. We show that when P. aeruginosa encounters surfaces, the concentration of the second messenger c-di-GMP increases within a few seconds. This leads to surface adherence and virulence induction by stimulating pili assembly through activation of the c-di-GMP receptor FimW. Surface-attached bacteria divide asymmetrically to generate a piliated, surface-committed progeny (striker) and a flagellated, motile offspring that leaves the surface to colonize distant sites (spreader). Cell differentiation is driven by a phosphodiesterase that asymmetrically positions to the flagellated pole, thereby maintaining c-di-GMP levels low in the motile offspring. Infection experiments demonstrate that cellular asymmetry strongly boosts infection spread and tissue damage. Thus, P. aeruginosa promotes surface colonization and infection transmission through a cooperative virulence program that we termed Touch-Seed-and-Go.","authors":[{"name":"Benoît-Joseph Laventie"},{"name":"Matteo Sangermani"},{"name":"Fabienne Estermann"},{"name":"Pablo Manfredi"},{"name":"Rémi Planes"},{"name":"Isabelle Hug"},{"name":"Tina Jaeger"},{"name":"Etienne Meunier"},{"name":"Petr Broz"},{"name":"Urs Jenal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"asymmetric division"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"flagella"},{"word":"second messenger"},{"word":"surface sensing"},{"word":"tissue colonization"},{"word":"type IV pili"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article160":{"pmid":"30580408","title":"High Content Screening Confocal Laser Microscopy (HCS-CLM) to Characterize Biofilm 4D Structural Dynamic of Foodborne Pathogens.","date":"2019-06-17","abs":"The functional properties of biofilms are intimately related to their spatial architecture.

Currently, the most common method to analyze and quantify TEP only allows offline, and often offsite measurement, causing delays and slow response times. This paper introduces an improved method for TEP monitoring using a membrane-based spectrophotometric technique to quantify TEP in various water bodies. The proposed TEP monitor involves a crossflow filtration unit, reagent injection and a spectrophotometer system. The TEP retained on the membrane surface is stained by Alcian blue and the amount deposited is quantified directly using an optic fibre reflectance probe coupled with a spectrophotometer. The novel method shows a linear relationship with various concentrations of Xanthan gum (a model representing TEP). When tested with various water samples, the proposed method was found to correlate well with the conventional method. Several advantages of this novel method are shorter analysis time, increased accuracy, and the potential to be further developed into an online system.","authors":[{"name":"Lee Nuang Sim"},{"name":"Stanislaus Raditya Suwarno"},{"name":"Darren Yong Shern Lee"},{"name":"Emile R Cornelissen"},{"name":"Anthony G Fane"},{"name":"Tzyy Haur Chong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Alcian blue"},{"word":"Algae"},{"word":"Fouling"},{"word":"Monitoring"},{"word":"Transparent exopolymer particles"}]},"article165":{"pmid":"30579946","title":"Antimicrobial activity and safety applications of meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)platinum(II) porphyrin.","date":"2019-03-19","abs":"Tetra-platinated(II) porphyrin hexafluorophosphate compound (4-PtTPyPor) was synthetized and along 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrin (4-TPyPor), evaluated about the antimicrobial activity and safety.

The deletion of smu_833 decreases glucan and increases eDNA but maintains the overall biofilm biomass. The decrease in glucan is caused by a reduction in GtfB and GtfC, two key enzymes responsible for the synthesis of glucan. The increase in eDNA was accompanied by an elevated production of membrane vesicles, suggesting that SMU_833 modulates the release of eDNA via the membrane vesicles, thereby altering biofilm matrix constituents. Furthermore, glucan and eDNA were colocalized. The complete deletion of gtfBC from the smu_833 mutant significantly reduced the biofilm biomass despite the elevated eDNA, suggesting the requirement of minimal glucans as a binding substrate for eDNA within the biofilm. Despite no changes in overall biofilm biomass, the mutant biofilm was altered in biofilm architecture and was less acidic in vitro Concurrently, the mutant was less virulent in an in vivo rat model of dental caries, demonstrating that SMU_833 is a new virulence factor.

Seawater desalination by reverse osmosis (RO) suffers from biofilm growth on the membranes (biofouling), which limits its widespread use because biofouling decreases water permeance and necessitates module cleaning and replacement, leading to increased economic and environmental costs. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) bound covalently to RO membranes inhibit biofilm growth and might delay membrane biofouling. Here we examined how various hydrophilic membrane coatings composed of zwitterionic, neutral, positively charged, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-grafted polymers affected the biocidal activity and the biofilm inhibition of a covalently bonded AMP on RO membranes. AMP magainin-2 was linked by the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction to a series of RO membranes that were grafted with different methacrylate polymers. Surface characterization by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water drop contact angle gave evidence of successful RO modifications, and zeta potential analysis reflected the increase in surface charge due to the linked, positively charged peptide. All AMP-modified membranes inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth compared to unmodified membranes, and the grafted methacrylic polymers did not significantly interfere with the peptide activity. On the other hand, membranes coated with zwitterionic and other acrylate polymers including AMP attachment inhibited biofilm growth more than either the AMP or the polymer coating alone. This enhancement led to ∼20% less biofilm biovolume on the membrane surfaces. The combination of antimicrobial coatings with polymer coatings known to resist fouling might aid future designs of surface coatings susceptible to biofilm growth.","authors":[{"name":"Nitzan Shtreimer Kandiyote"},{"name":"Tehila Avisdris"},{"name":"Christopher J Arnusch"},{"name":"Roni Kasher"}],"keywords":[]},"article182":{"pmid":"30576101","title":"Biological Engineered Living Materials: Growing Functional Materials with Genetically Programmable Properties.","date":"2020-01-27","abs":"Natural biological materials exhibit remarkable properties: self-assembly from simple raw materials, precise control of morphology, diverse physical and chemical properties, self-repair, and the ability to sense-and-respond to environmental stimuli.

A total of 26 APEC strains were isolated from different farms in this study, and analysis showed that all of those isolates carried multiple virulence-associated genes and drug-resistance genes, which led to high pathogenicity (15/26), strong or moderate biofilm formation (24/26) and multidrug-resistant abilities (26/26). On the other hand, coinfection with APEC, H9 avian influenza virus (AIV) and Tembusu virus (TMUV) was very common on those farms (11/26), with APEC and TMUV sharing a similar morbidity peak (from May to September) and susceptibility (60% infections occurred in ducklings); thus, we speculated that the emerging TMUV infection escalated the APEC incidence in ducks. Finally, the data presented in this report enhance the current understanding of the epidemiology of APEC and different viral infections in ducks and provide additional insight into the critical factors that determine their pathogenicity.

We sequenced whole genomes of a diverse set of clinical oral Streptococcus isolates and examined the genetic basis of variability in ADS and antagonistic activities.

Host recognition of pathogens is mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) that bind conserved molecular patterns shared by large groups of microorganisms. The oral epithelial cells respond to most periodontopathic bacteria via TLR-2 and TLR-4. In addition to the membrane-associated receptors, soluble forms of TLR-2 (sTLR-2) and TLR-4 (sTLR-4) have been identified and are thought to play a regulatory role by binding microbial ligands. sTLR-2 has been shown to arise from ectodomain shedding of the extracellular domain of the membrane receptor and sTLR-4 is thought to be an alternate spliced form. Many studies have previously reported the presence of elevated numbers of viable exfoliated epithelial cells in the saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential value of salivary sTLR-2 and sTLR-4 together with the paired epithelial cell-associated TLR-2/4 mRNA as diagnostic markers for chronic periodontitis. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected after obtaining informed consent from 40 individuals with either periodontitis or gingivitis. The sTLR-2 and sTLR4 in saliva was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TLR-2 and TLR-4 transcript in the epithelial cells in saliva was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction. While levels of sTLR-2 exhibited an inverse correlation, sTLR-4 positively correlated with clinical parameters in the gingivitis cohort. Interestingly, both correlations were lost in the periodontitis cohort indicating a dysregulated host response. On the other hand, while the sTLR-2 and the paired epithelial cell associated TLR-2 mRNA exhibited a direct correlation (r2 = 0.62), that of sTLR4 and TLR-4 mRNA exhibited an inverse correlation (r2 = 0.53) in the periodontitis cohort. Collectively, assessments of salivary sTLR2 and sTLR4 together with the respective transcripts in the epithelial cells could provide clinically relevant markers of disease progression from gingivitis to periodontitis.","authors":[{"name":"Hawra AlQallaf"},{"name":"Yusuke Hamada"},{"name":"Steven Blanchard"},{"name":"Daniel Shin"},{"name":"Richard Gregory"},{"name":"Mythily Srinivasan"}],"keywords":[]},"article196":{"pmid":"30570729","title":"Techniques to Assess Phage-Biofilm Interaction.","date":"2019-06-07","abs":"Biofilms are ubiquitous in nature found on nearly every type of living and inert surface.

Therefore, knowledge about the diversity of plant pathogens, about potential reservoirs of inoculum and about the processes that contribute to their survival and adaptation is limited to these contexts. The agro-centric perspective of plant pathogen life histories is incoherent with respect to the capacity of many of them to persist as saprophytes on various substrates. In this context we have investigated the ubiquity of the broad host range necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea, outside of agricultural settings and have determined if the populations in these natural habitats can be distinguished phenotypically and phylogenetically from populations isolated from diseased crops. Over a period of 5 years, we isolated B. cinerea from 235 samples of various substrates collected in France including rainfall, snowpack, river, and lake water, epilithic biofilms in mountain streams, leaf litter and plant debris, rock surfaces, bird feathers and healthy wild plants from outside of agricultural fields. All substrates except rock surfaces harbored B. cinerea leading us to establish a collection of purified strains that were compared to B. cinerea from diseased tomato, grapes and various other crops in France. Phylogenetic comparisons of 321 strains from crop plants and 100 strains from environmental substrates based on sequences of 9 microsatellite markers revealed that strains from crops and the environment could not be distinguished. Furthermore, the genetic diversity of strains outside of agriculture was just as broad as within agriculture. In tests to determine the aggressiveness of strains on tomato stems, the mean disease severity caused by strains from environmental substrates was statistically identical to the severity of disease caused by strains from tomato, but was significantly greater than the severity caused by strains from grape or other crops.

The ability of this pathogen to colonize healthcare workers (HCW)' hands, and to form biofilm on medical devices has been associated with the occurrence of nosocomial outbreaks and high mortality rates. Fluconazole has been the leading antifungal drug for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in developing countries. However, azole-resistant C. parapsilosis isolates are emerging worldwide, including in Brazil. Few studies have correlated outbreak infections due to C. parapsilosis with virulence factors, such as biofilm production. We thus conducted a microbiological investigation of C. parapsilosis complex isolates from a Brazilian teaching hospital. Additionally, we identified a previously unrecognized outbreak caused by a persistent azole-resistant C. parapsilosis (sensu stricto) clone in the intensive care unit (ICU), correlating it with the main clinical data from the patients with invasive candidiasis. The molecular identification of the isolates was carried out by PCR-RFLP assay; antifungal susceptibility and biofilm formation were also evaluated. The genotyping of all C. parapsilosis (sensu stricto) was performed by microsatellite analysis and the presence of ERG11 mutations was assessed in the azole non-susceptible isolates. Fourteen C. parapsilosis (sensu stricto) isolates were recovered from patients with invasive candidiasis, eight being fluconazole and voriconazole-resistant, and two intermediate only to fluconazole (FLC). All non-susceptible isolates showed a similar pattern of biofilm formation with low biomass and metabolic activity. The A395T mutation in ERG11 was detected exclusively among the azole-resistant isolates. According to the microsatellite analysis, all azole non-susceptible isolates from the adult ICU were clustered together indicating the occurrence of an outbreak. Regarding clinical data, all patients infected by the clonal non-susceptible isolates and none of the patients infected by the susceptible isolates had been previously exposed to corticosteroids (p = 0.001), while the remaining characteristics showed no statistical significance. The current study revealed the persistence of an azole non-susceptible C. parapsilosis clone with low capacity to form biofilm over two years in the adult ICU. These results reinforce the need of epidemiological surveillance and monitoring antifungal susceptibility of C. parapsilosis isolates in hospital wards.","authors":[{"name":"Danilo Yamamoto Thomaz"},{"name":"João Nobrega de Almeida"},{"name":"Glaucia Moreira Espindola Lima"},{"name":"Maína de Oliveira Nunes"},{"name":"Carlos Henrique Camargo"},{"name":"Rafaella de Carvalho Grenfell"},{"name":"Gil Benard"},{"name":"Gilda M B Del Negro"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida parapsilosis"},{"word":"ERG11"},{"word":"antifungal susceptibility"},{"word":"azole"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"candidemia"},{"word":"genotyping"},{"word":"resistance"}]},"article204":{"pmid":"30568640","title":"An Update on the Evolution of Glucosyltransferase (Gtf) Genes in Streptococcus.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"In many caries-promoting Streptococcus species, glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) are recognized as key enzymes contributing to the modification of biofilm structures, disruption of homeostasis of healthy microbiota community and induction of caries development. It is therefore of great interest to investigate how Gtf genes have evolved in Streptococcus. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive survey of Gtf genes among 872 streptococci genomes of 37 species and identified Gtf genes from 364 genomes of 18 species. To clarify the relationships of these Gtf genes, 45 representative sequences were used for phylogenic analysis, which revealed two clear clades. Clade I included 12 Gtf genes from nine caries-promoting species of the Mutans and Downei groups, which produce enzymes known to synthesize sticky, water-insoluble glucans (WIG) that are critical for modifying biofilm structures. Clade II primarily contained Gtf genes responsible for synthesizing water-soluble glucans (WSG) from all 18 species, and this clade further diverged into three subclades (IIA, IIB, and IIC). An analysis of 16 pairs of duplicated Gtf genes revealed high divergence levels at the C-terminal repeat regions, with ratios of the non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) to synonymous substitution rate (dS) ranging from 0.60 to 1.03, indicating an overall relaxed constraint in this region. However, among the clade I Gtf genes, some individual repeat units possessed strong functional constraints by the same criterion. Structural variations in the repeat regions were also observed, with detection of deletions or recent duplications of individual repeat units. Overall, by establishing an updated phylogeny and further elucidating their evolutionary patterns, this work enabled us to gain a greater understanding of the origination and divergence of Gtf genes in Streptococcus.","authors":[{"name":"Rong-Rong Xu"},{"name":"Wei-Dong Yang"},{"name":"Ke-Xin Niu"},{"name":"Bin Wang"},{"name":"Wen-Mei Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus"},{"word":"duplication"},{"word":"evolution"},{"word":"glucosyltransferase gene (Gtf)"},{"word":"selection"}]},"article205":{"pmid":"30568441","title":"Silica-gentamicin nanohybrids: combating antibiotic resistance, bacterial biofilms, and in vivo toxicity.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern in health care.

Recent studies have shown that a variety of enteric pathogens are able to colonize plant surfaces by forming biofilms and thereby persist for long periods, which can subsequently lead to human infections. Therefore, biofilm formation by enteric pathogens on plants poses a risk to human health. Here, we deciphered the roles of YcfR in biofilm formation by Salmonella enterica. YcfR is a putative outer membrane protein associated with bacterial stress responses. The lack of YcfR facilitated the formation of multicellular aggregates on cabbage leaves as well as glass surfaces while reducing bacterial motility. ycfR deletion caused extensive structural alterations in the outer membrane, primarily in lipopolysaccharides, outer membrane proteins, cellulose, and curli fimbria, thereby increasing cell surface hydrophobicity. However, the absence of YcfR rendered Salmonella susceptible to stressful treatments, despite the increased multicellular aggregation. These results suggest that YcfR is an essential constituent of Salmonella outer membrane architecture and its absence may cause multifaceted structural changes, thereby compromising bacterial envelope integrity. In this context, YcfR may be further exploited as a potential target for controlling Salmonella persistence on plants.","authors":[{"name":"Seul I Kim"},{"name":"Hyunjin Yoon"}],"keywords":[]},"article209":{"pmid":"30565778","title":"Multifunctional nanocarriers for the treatment of periodontitis: Immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and regenerative strategies.","date":"2019-12-31","abs":"Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease, in which the host immuno-inflammatory response against the dysbiotic subgingival biofilm leads to the breakdown of periodontal tissues.

Clinical oral examinations of dental caries status and visible plaque index were carried out at three follow-up time points. Pooled supragingival plaque biofilm samples were also collected at ages 12, 18, and 24 months. Plaque biofilm DNA was extracted and analyzed by MiSeq sequencing.

At ages 18 and 24 months, one and two toddlers showed two and three teeth with carious white spots, respectively. Depth, Good's coverage, and sample size of sequencing were reasonable. The dominant bacterial genera in the oral cavity of 12-month-old toddlers were Capnocytophaga, Neisseria, Streptococcus, Kingella, and Leptotrichia; the oral microflora composition was relatively stable by 18 months of age and included unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, Selenomonas, Prevotella, Leptotrichia, and Veillonella as the dominant genera; unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus, Neisseria, Leptotrichia, and Selenomonas were the dominant genera by 24 months.

When a prolonged incubation period (48 h) was applied for those 8 MRSA strains, an increased biofilm biomass accumulation was observed during the time course, whereas the number of viable cells within the biofilms decreased as the biomass increased. The capacity of biofilm production correlated pretty well between the experiments using polystyrene microtiter plates and stainless steel micro-well plates, and significant higher values were observed in stainless steel when glucose was added to TSB during the enrichment. Biofilms were further characterized by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), confirming that proteins and α-polysaccharides were the predominant components inside the extracellular polymeric matrix of biofilms formed by MRSA strains. In conclusion, our results confirm that MRSA isolates from foods of animal origin have significant capacity for forming biofilms with a high protein content, which can play a key role for the successful dissemination of MRSA lineages via food.

However, mechanisms how multiple stressors act on aquatic community structure and functioning are poorly understood. This is especially true for two important stressors types, hydrodynamic alterations and toxicants. Here we perform a mesocosm experiment in hydraulic flumes connected as a bypass to a natural stream to test the interactive effects of both factors on natural (inoculated from streams water) biofilms. Biofilms, i.e., the community of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms and their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in association with substratum, are key players in stream functioning. We hypothesized (i) that the tolerance of biofilms toward toxicants (the herbicide Prometryn) decreases with increasing hydraulic stress. As EPS is known as an absorber of chemicals, we hypothesize (ii) that the EPS to cell ratio correlates with both hydraulic stress and herbicide tolerance. Tolerance values were derived from concentration-response assays. Both, the herbicide tolerance and the biovolume of the EPS significantly correlated with the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), while the diversity of diatoms (the dominant group within the stream biofilms) increased with flow velocity. This indicates that the positive effect of TKE on community tolerance was mediated by turbulence-induced changes in the EPS biovolume. This conclusion was supported by a second experiment, showing decreasing effects of the herbicide to a diatom biofilm (Nitzschia palea) with increasing content of artificial EPS. We conclude that increasing hydrodynamic forces in streams result in an increasing tolerance of microbial communities toward chemical pollution by changes in EPS-mediated bioavailability of toxicants.","authors":[{"name":"Bastian H Polst"},{"name":"Christine Anlanger"},{"name":"Ute Risse-Buhl"},{"name":"Floriane Larras"},{"name":"Thomas Hein"},{"name":"Markus Weitere"},{"name":"Mechthild Schmitt-Jansen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PICT"},{"word":"autotrophic biofilm"},{"word":"microbial communities"},{"word":"multiple stressors"},{"word":"near-bed hydrodynamics"},{"word":"periphyton"}]},"article217":{"pmid":"30564204","title":"Multiple Strategies for Light-Harvesting, Photoprotection, and Carbon Flow in High Latitude Microbial Mats.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Microbial mats are ubiquitous in polar freshwater ecosystems and sustain high concentrations of biomass despite the extreme seasonal variations in light and temperature.

Other bacterial species have also been shown to respond to PQS, supporting a common biophysical mechanism. Here, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the specific interactions between PQS and a model P. aeruginosa OM at the atomistic scale.

The hydrogen bonds between PQS and the lipid A phosphates drove the PQS-membrane association. An analysis of PQS trajectory and molecular conformation revealed sequential events critical for spontaneous insertion, including probing, docking, folding, and insertion. Remarkably, PQS bent its hydrophobic side chain into a closed conformation to lower the energy barrier for penetration through the hydrophilic headgroup zone of the lipid A leaflet, which was confirmed by the potential of mean force (PMF) measurements. Attachment and insertion were simultaneously observed in the simulation with multiple PQS molecules.

The resistance to one or more than one conventional antifungal agents contributes greatly to the widespread propagation of Candida infections. The severity of fungal infection requires the discovery of novel antimycotics and the extensive application of combination strategy. In this study, a group of Candida standard and clinical strains including C. albicans as well as several NAC species were employed to evaluate the antifungal potentials of palmatine (PAL) alone and in combination with fluconazole (FLC)/itraconazole (ITR) by microdilution method, checkerboard assay, gram staining, spot assay, and rhodamine 6G efflux test. Subsequently, the expressions of transporter-related genes, namely CDR1, CDR2, MDR1, and FLU1 for C. albicans, CDR1 and MDR1 for Candida tropicalis and Candida parapsilosis, ABC1 and ABC2 for Candida krusei, CDR1, CDR2, and SNQ2 for Candida glabrata were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The susceptibility test showed that PAL presented strong synergism with FLC and ITR with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) in a range of 0.0049-0.75 for PAL+FLC and 0.0059-0.3125 for PAL+ITR in planktonic cells, 0.125-0.375 for PAL+FLC and 0.0938-0.3125 for PAL+ITR in biofilms. The susceptibility results were also confirmed by gram staining and spot assay. After combinations, a vast quantity of rhodamine 6G could not be pumped out as considerably intracellular red fluorescence was accumulated. Meanwhile, the expressions of efflux-associated genes were evaluated and presented varying degrees of inhibition. These results indicated that PAL was a decent antifungal synergist to promote the antifungal efficacy of azoles (such as FLC and ITR), and the underlying antifungal mechanism might be linked with the inhibition of efflux pumps and the elevation of intracellular drug content.","authors":[{"name":"Tianming Wang"},{"name":"Jing Shao"},{"name":"Wenyue Da"},{"name":"Qianqian Li"},{"name":"Gaoxiang Shi"},{"name":"Daqiang Wu"},{"name":"Changzhong Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida species"},{"word":"efflux"},{"word":"fluconazole"},{"word":"itraconazole"},{"word":"palmatine"},{"word":"resistance"}]},"article234":{"pmid":"30559713","title":"The Emerging Role of Microbial Biofilm in Lyme Neuroborreliosis.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi in North America and Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii in Europe and Asia, respectively.

Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is the most dangerous manifestation of Lyme disease, occurring in 10-15% of infected individuals.

The early treatment with oral antimicrobials is effective in the majority of patients with LNB. Nevertheless, persistent forms of LNB are relatively common, despite targeted antibiotic therapy. It has been observed that the antibiotic resistance and the reoccurrence of Lyme disease are associated with biofilm-like aggregates in B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii, both in vitro and in vivo, allowing Borrelia spp. to resist to adverse environmental conditions.

Upon biofilm dispersal, bacteria become more antibiotic susceptible but are also able to readily infect another host. Various studies have shown that low, nontoxic levels of nitric oxide (NO) may induce biofilm dispersal in many bacterial species. While the molecular details of this phenotype remain largely unknown, in several species, NO has been implicated in biofilm-to-planktonic cell transitions via ligation to 1 of 2 characterized NO sensors, NosP or H-NOX.

The current extraction and spectrophotometric characterization methods, often based on the principle not to compromise the integrity of the microbial cells, should be critically assessed, and more comprehensive methods for recovery and characterization of EPS need to be developed.","authors":[{"name":"Thomas Seviour"},{"name":"Nicolas Derlon"},{"name":"Morten Simonsen Dueholm"},{"name":"Hans-Curt Flemming"},{"name":"Elisabeth Girbal-Neuhauser"},{"name":"Harald Horn"},{"name":"Staffan Kjelleberg"},{"name":"Mark C M van Loosdrecht"},{"name":"Tommaso Lotti"},{"name":"M Francesca Malpei"},{"name":"Robert Nerenberg"},{"name":"Thomas R Neu"},{"name":"Etienne Paul"},{"name":"Hanqing Yu"},{"name":"Yuemei Lin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Analysis"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Biophysics"},{"word":"Extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"Function"},{"word":"Identity"}]},"article245":{"pmid":"30557752","title":"Nutrient removal from high ammonium swine wastewater in upflow microaerobic biofilm reactor suffered high hydraulic load.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"To understand the ability of an upflow microaerobic biofilm reactor (UMBR) to remove nutrient from manure-free swine wastewater rich in NH","authors":[{"name":"Jia Meng"},{"name":"Jiuling Li"},{"name":"Jiamin He"},{"name":"Jianzheng Li"},{"name":"Kaiwen Deng"},{"name":"Jun Nan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anammox"},{"word":"Hydraulic loading rate"},{"word":"Microaerobic process"},{"word":"Nitrogen removal"},{"word":"Swine wastewater"}]},"article246":{"pmid":"30557585","title":"Effective elimination of biofilm formed with waterborne pathogens using copper nanoparticles.","date":"2019-03-14","abs":"In this paper, the self assembling properties of taurolipids were used to prepare stable copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), and demonstrated the ability of CuNPs to eradicate the biofilms formed by waterborne pathogens.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been considered as promising therapeutic candidates against infection in the post-antibiotic era. In this paper, we dismissed the significance of Rana box in the natural nigrocin-HL identified from skin secretion of Hylarana latouchii by comparing its activity with nigrocin-HLD without the motif. By substituting the Rana box sequence with an amidated phenylalanine residue, the natural peptide was modified into a shorter AMP nigrocin-HLM. Activities and toxicities of these two peptides in vitro and in vivo were compared. As a result, nigrocin-HLM not only displayed significantly increased potency against several representative microbes, but also high activity against the antibiotic-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, NCTC 12493 and ATCC43300 and several clinical isolates) as evidenced by markedly reduced minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC). More strikingly, nigrocin-HLM exhibited prominent inhibition against MRSA infection in a pneumonia mice model. In addition, the substitution attenuated the toxicity of nigrocin-HLM as evidenced by precipitously decreased hemolytic and cytotoxic activities in vitro, and acute toxicity to mice in vivo. Taken these results into consideration, nigrocin-HLM should be a promising therapeutic candidate for anti-infection. And in addition to dismiss an indispensable role of Rana box in maintaining antimicrobial activity of nigrocin-HL, our data provided an inspired strategy for peptide optimization.","authors":[{"name":"Kaifan Bao"},{"name":"Weiyuan Yuan"},{"name":"Chengbang Ma"},{"name":"Xi Yu"},{"name":"Lei Wang"},{"name":"Min Hong"},{"name":"Xinping Xi"},{"name":"Mei Zhou"},{"name":"Tianbao Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"Rana box"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"modification"},{"word":"nigrocin"},{"word":"pneumonia"}]},"article254":{"pmid":"30554875","title":"A Host-Produced Quorum-Sensing Autoinducer Controls a Phage Lysis-Lysogeny Decision.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Vibrio cholerae uses a quorum-sensing (QS) system composed of the autoinducer 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol (DPO) and receptor VqmA (VqmA","authors":[{"name":"Justin E Silpe"},{"name":"Bonnie L Bassler"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DPO"},{"word":"Qtip"},{"word":"Vibrio"},{"word":"VqmA"},{"word":"antirepressor"},{"word":"autoinducer"},{"word":"kill switch"},{"word":"lysis-lysogeny"},{"word":"phage"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article255":{"pmid":"30554320","title":"Bacterial community activity and dynamics in the biofilm of an experimental hybrid wetland system treating greywater.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The objectives of this study were to determine the biofilm microbial activity and bacterial community structure and successions in greywater treatment filters and to relate the treatment efficiency to the bacterial community parameters.

Accelerated electrogenic biofilm formation and the better electrogenic bacterial colonization based on the superior material properties (preferable electrochemical characteristics, the film-like structure and the more activated sites) were observed with the in situ biofilm development monitoring. The acclimation time was 2.4 times shorter with graphene and polyaniline modified anode than the bare one when inoculated with wastewater.

The anode modified with graphene and polyaniline favors Geobacter colonization, accelerates electrogenic biofilm formation and improves omcZ expression level, eventually leading to the improved performance of microbial fuel cell.

They were represented by the reference strains of Corynebacterium striatum ATCC 6940 and C. amycolatum ATCC 700207. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the biofilm produced by the antibiotic-susceptible C. striatum strain was evaluated using three concentrations of the antimicrobial agent (2 ×, 4 ×, and 6 × the MIC - the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration). The basis for the interpretation of results was the statistical analysis of maximum points readings from the surface comprising a total of 245 areas of the biofilm image under the confocal microscope. It was observed that ciprofloxacin at a concentration equal to 4 × MIC paradoxically caused an enlargement of areas with live bacteria within the biofilm. Biofilm destruction required the application of ciprofloxacin at a concentration higher than 6 × MIC. This suggests that the use of relatively low doses of antimicrobial agents may increase the number of live bacteria within the biofilm, and further facilitate their detachment from the biofilm's structure thus leading to the spread of bacteria into the bloodstream or to the neighboring tissues. The method of biofilm analysis presented here provides the original and novel approach to the investigation of the diphtheroid biofilms and their interaction with antimicrobial agents.","authors":[{"name":"Alina Olender"},{"name":"Agnieszka Bogut"},{"name":"Agnieszka Magryś"},{"name":"Katarzyna Król-Turmińska"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Corynebacterium amycolatum"},{"word":"Corynebacterium striatum, biofilm"},{"word":"ciprofloxacin"},{"word":"confocal microscopy"}]},"article273":{"pmid":"30550129","title":"[Involvement of Th17/Treg imbalance in bacterial biofilm induced chronic rhinosinusitis].","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"H Li"},{"name":"X C Sun"},{"name":"Q Liu"},{"name":"Y Q Li"},{"name":"L Hu"},{"name":"H P Yu"},{"name":"D H Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":" laser confocal microscope"},{"word":"Th17/Treg cell"},{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"sinusitis"}]},"article274":{"pmid":"30549406","title":"Dual Therapy Coating on Micro/Nanoscale Porous Polyetheretherketone to Eradicate Biofilms and Accelerate Bone Tissue Repair.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"Defective osteogenesis and latent infections continue to be two major issues in the therapy of bone tissue regeneration.

Eradication of these infections is challenging due to the elevated tolerance of biofilm cells against antimicrobial agents. In this study, we developed an antibiofilm coating consisting of 5-(4-bromophenyl)-N-cyclopentyl-1-octyl-1H-imidazol-2-amine, designated as LC0024, covalently bound to a titanium implant surface (LC0024-Ti). We showed in vitro that the LC0024-Ti surface reduces biofilm formation of S. aureus in a specific manner without reducing the planktonic cells above the biofilm, as evaluated by plate counting and fluorescence microscopy. The advantage of compounds that only inhibit biofilm formation without affecting the viability of the planktonic cells, is that reduced development of bacterial resistance is expected. To determine the antibiofilm activity of LC0024-Ti surfaces in vivo, a biomaterial-associated murine infection model was used. The results indicated a significant reduction in S. aureus biofilm formation (up to 96%) on the LC0024-Ti substrates compared to pristine titanium controls. Additionally, we found that the LC0024-Ti substrates did not affect the attachment and proliferation of human cells involved in osseointegration and bone repair. In summary, our results emphasize the clinical potential of covalent coatings of LC0024 on titanium implant surfaces to reduce the risk of orthopedic implant infections. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the early stationary phase of planktonic cultures, CalY was located at the bacterial cell-surface, as shown by immunodetection. Deletion of calY revealed that this protein plays a major role in adhesion to HeLa epithelial cells, to the insect Galleria mellonella hemocytes and in the bacterial virulence against larvae of this insect, suggesting that CalY is a cell-surface adhesin. In mid-stationary phase and in biofilms, the location of CalY shifted from the cell surface to the extracellular medium, where it was found as fibers. The transcription study and the deletion of sipW suggested that CalY change of location is due to a delayed activity of the SipW signal peptidase. Using purified CalY, we found that the protein polymerization occurred only in the presence of cell-surface components. CalY is, therefore, a bifunctional protein, which switches from a cell-surface adhesin activity in early stationary phase, to the production of fibers in mid-stationary phase and in biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Thomas Candela"},{"name":"Annette Fagerlund"},{"name":"Christophe Buisson"},{"name":"Nathalie Gilois"},{"name":"Anne-Brit Kolstø"},{"name":"Ole Andreas Økstad"},{"name":"Stéphane Aymerich"},{"name":"Christina Nielsen-Leroux"},{"name":"Didier Lereclus"},{"name":"Michel Gohar"}],"keywords":[]},"article279":{"pmid":"30548171","title":"Proteomic Analysis of the Initial Oral Pellicle in Caries-Active and Caries-Free Individuals.","date":"2020-01-24","abs":"To 1) elucidate individual proteomic profiles of the 3-min biofilm of caries-active and caries-free individuals and 2) compare these proteomic profiles against the background of caries.","authors":[{"name":"Simone Trautmann"},{"name":"Ahmad Barghash"},{"name":"Claudia Fecher-Trost"},{"name":"Pascal Schalkowsky"},{"name":"Christian Hannig"},{"name":"Jasmin Kirsch"},{"name":"Stefan Rupf"},{"name":"Andreas Keller"},{"name":"Volkhard Helms"},{"name":"Matthias Hannig"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3-min pellicle"},{"word":"caries-related biomarkers"},{"word":"enriched molecular functions"},{"word":"individual proteomic profiles"},{"word":"ubiquitous base proteins"}]},"article280":{"pmid":"30548096","title":"Elucidation of the d-lysine biosynthetic pathway in the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima.","date":"2019-08-08","abs":"Various d-amino acids are involved in peptidoglycan and biofilm metabolism in bacteria, suggesting that these compounds are necessary for successful adaptation to environmental changes.

The functional relevance of proteins with emphasis on nutrient import and the response to hostile host conditions, showing evidence of neutrophil infiltration, was analyzed. Two putative subtilisin-like proteases and a heme/oligopeptide transporter were abundant in vivo and are likely important for survival and fitness in the biofilm. Proteins facilitating uptake of xylose/glucuronate and oligopeptides, also highly expressed in vivo, may feed metabolites into mixed acid fermentation and peptidolysis pathways, respectively, to generate energy. A polyketide synthase predicted to generate a secondary metabolite that interacts with either the human host or co-colonizing microbes was also identified. The product of the PKS enzyme may contribute to A. massiliense fitness and persistence in the CBs.","authors":[{"name":"Yanbao Yu"},{"name":"Tamara Tsitrin"},{"name":"Harinder Singh"},{"name":"Sebastian N Doerfert"},{"name":"Maria V Sizova"},{"name":"Slava S Epstein"},{"name":"Rembert Pieper"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CAUTI"},{"word":"Keywords: actinobaculum"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"catheter"},{"word":"host-pathogen interaction"},{"word":"metabolism"},{"word":"polymicrobial"},{"word":"proteome"},{"word":"urinary tract infection"},{"word":"uropathogen"}]},"article290":{"pmid":"30544765","title":"Chromatographic Analyses, In Vitro Biological Activities, and Cytotoxicity of Cannabis sativa L.

However, the inherent instability of such peptides often limits their efficacy in intended clinical applications. Covalent immobilization of AMPs to surfaces is one strategy to increase the long-term stability and minimize the toxicity. In this work, an antimicrobial peptide, RRPRPRPRPWWWW-NH2 (RRP9W4N), was used to modify elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) surface coatings containing cell-adhesive peptide domains (RGD) using covalent chemistry. The AMP retained its antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when covalently bonded to ELP surfaces. Simultaneously, the AMP functionalization had insignificant effect on the viability, function, and differentiation of human osteosarcoma MG63 cells and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Furthermore, stability of the immobilized AMP in human blood serum was investigated, and the results suggested that the AMP preserved its antibacterial activity up to 24 h. Combined, the results show that covalently attached AMPs onto RGD-containing ELP are an excellent candidate as an antimicrobial coating for medical devices. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Biomaterial associated infection, caused by adherent biofilm, is usually difficult to treat. There is a high demand for new materials and treatments to decrease the infection rates, especially with increasing threats concerning resistant bacteria. Formation of biofilms on medical devices lowers the bacteria susceptibility towards traditional antibiotics and also circumvent our immune system often resulting in revisional surgery and extensive use of antibiotics. One promising strategy is to develop surfaces having low bacterial attractiveness or bacterial killing properties, but still retaining the main function of the device.

Biofilms often create acidic pH microenvironments, providing opportunities to leverage responsive drug delivery systems to improve antibacterial efficacy. Here, the antibacterial efficacy of novel formulations containing pH-responsive polymer nanoparticle carriers (NPCs) and farnesol, a hydrophobic antibacterial drug, were investigated. Multiple farnesol-loaded NPCs, which varied in overall molecular weight and corona-to-core molecular weight ratios (CCRs), were tested using standard and saturated drug loading conditions. NPCs loaded at saturated conditions exhibited ∼300% greater drug loading capacity over standard conditions. Furthermore, saturated loading conditions sustained zero-ordered drug release over 48 hours, which was 3-fold longer than using standard farnesol loading. Anti-biofilm activity of saturated NPC loading was markedly amplified using Streptococcus mutans as a biofilm-forming model organism. Specifically, reductions of ∼2-4 log colony forming unit (CFU) were obtained using microplate and saliva-coated hydroxyapatite biofilm assays. Mechanistically, the new formulation reduced total biomass by disrupting insoluble glucan formation and increased NPC-cell membrane localization. Finally, thonzonium bromide, a highly potent, FDA-approved antibacterial drug with similar alkyl chain structure to farnesol, was also loaded into NPCs and used to treat S. mutans biofilms. Similar to farnesol-loaded NPCs, thonzonium bromide-loaded NPCs increased drug loading capacity ≥2.5-fold, demonstrated nearly zero-order release kinetics over 96 hours, and reduced biofilm cell viability by ∼6 log CFU.

However, an increased incidence of colistin-resistant isolates has been recently observed. In addition, in vitro evaluation of colistin susceptibility for this organism has been problematic. The aims of this study were to investigate the colistin-resistance phenotypes displayed by S. maltophilia and their potential association with the challenging determination of colistin susceptibilities for this organism by even the recommended method. Colistin-resistance phenotypes were inferred by use of the recommended broth microdilution method in different clinical isolates of S. maltophilia. Most of the strains showed non-interpretable minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for colistin due to an incomplete growth inhibition in wells of the microdilution plate. In addition, the subpopulation of bacteria resistant to colistin showed an increased ability to form biofilms on the plastic surface of MIC plates. The observed incomplete growth inhibition in the microdilution plates is compatible with a progressive adaptation to colistin or a heterogeneous susceptibility to this antibiotic. Therefore, to determine the existence of heteroresistance or adaptive resistance, four colistin-resistant clinical isolates were subjected to serial Etest assays, growth rate analyses, and the population analysis profile test. The experiments indicated that these S. maltophilia isolates display a colistin-resistant sub-population that survives and multiplies in the presence of the antibiotic. Interestingly, this phenomenon might not be explainable by the natural background mutation rate alone since the development of a resistant sub-population occurred upon the contact with the antibiotic and it was reversible. This complex colistin-resistance phenotype is exhibited differently by the different isolates and significantly affected colistin susceptibility testing. Furthermore, it can coexist with adaptive resistance to colistin as response to pre-incubation with sub-inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic. Overall, the combined action of heterogeneous colistin-resistance mechanisms in S. maltophilia isolates, including colistin-induced biofilm formation, may hamper the correct interpretation of colistin susceptibility tests, thus having potentially serious implications on antimicrobial-therapy decision making.","authors":[{"name":"Sònia Martínez-Servat"},{"name":"Daniel Yero"},{"name":"Pol Huedo"},{"name":"Roser Marquez"},{"name":"Gara Molina"},{"name":"Xavier Daura"},{"name":"Isidre Gibert"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adaptive resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"colistin"},{"word":"heteroresistance"},{"word":"susceptibility testing"}]},"article306":{"pmid":"30524390","title":"Evolutionary Evidence of Algal Polysaccharide Degradation Acquisition by Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora 9","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"About half of seaweed biomass is composed of polysaccharides.

Staphylococcal biofilms are associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and are generally less affected by host immune factors. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel agents that not only aim at multidrug-resistant pathogens, but also ones that will act as anti biofilms. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of the endocannabinoid (EC) anandamide (AEA) and the endocannabinoid-like (EC-like), arachidonoyl serine (AraS) against methicillin resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA). We observed a strong inhibition of biofilm formation of all tested MRSA strains as well as a notable reduction of metabolic activity of pre-formed MRSA biofilms by both agents. Moreover, staphylococcal biofilm-associated virulence determinants such as hydrophobicity, cell aggregation and spreading ability were altered by AEA and AraS. In addition, the agents were able to modify bacterial membrane potential. Importantly, both compounds prevent biofilm formation by altering the surface of the cell without killing the bacteria.

The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations of the methanol extracts of Cistus creticus ssp. creticus, Cistus monspeliensis, Origanum vulgare, Rosmarinus officinalis, Salvia sclarea and Thymus longicaulis against eight typical oral bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans were determined.

Overall, all tested extracts inhibited effectively the screened obligate anaerobic microorganisms and in concentrations ≥0.3 mg ml-1 had moderate to high antibiofilm activity comparable to that of chlorhexidine (CHX) against S. mutans. In particular, R. officinalis (MIC: 0.08-5.00 mg ml-1) and S. sclarea (MIC: 0.08-2.50 mg ml-1) showed the highest antibacterial activity, while Cistus spp., R. officinalis and S. sclarea significantly inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation at 0.60, 1.25 and 2.50 mg ml-1, respectively.

The results indicated that the TiCu/TiCuN multilayer film of M2 revealed the best comprehensive corrosion resistance with low electric current values, high pitting potential, and high polarization resistance due to the proper thickness of TiCu interlayers and larger number of TiCu/TiCuN bilayers. In addition, the TiCu/TiCuN multilayer film of M2 also possesses comparable mechanical properties, excellent antibacterial and antibiofilm abilities, as well as good biocompatibility.

We have focused our vaccine development efforts on the majority subunit of NTHI type IV pili, PilA. Antibodies against a recombinant, soluble form of PilA (rsPilA) both disrupt and prevent the formation of NTHI biofilms in vitro. Moreover, immunization with rsPilA prevents and resolves NTHI-induced experimental OM. Here, we show that antibodies against rsPilA also prevent and disrupt polymicrobial biofilms.

The difference of ARB concentration and ARB percentage between the samples obtained from a disinfected pipeline and a non-disinfected pipeline became smaller over time.

Compared with the biofilm samples without disinfectant, the disinfected biofilm had lower ICC and HPC/ICC percentage, lower AOC and AOC/TOC percentage, indicating that the disinfectant inhibited the bacteria growth in biofilm, and the disinfected biofilm had high proportion of non-culturable bacteria and low biodegradability, which affected BAR in biofilms. High throughput sequencing showed that in biofilms, the relative abundance of genera (uncultured_f_Rhodocyclaceae, Brevundimonas, and Brevibacillus in chlorinated systems, and Brevundimonas, Brevibacillus in chloraminated systems) with multiple antibiotic resistance and high abundance (up to 78.5%), were positively associated with disinfectant concentration and ARB percentage.

One of these mutants carries the Tn5 insertion in hupB, a gene encoding a bacterial histone-like protein, homologue to the β-subunit of the Heat-Unstable (HU) nucleoid protein of Escherichia coli. These types of protein are necessary to maintain the bacterial nucleoid organization and the global regulation of gene expression. Here, we characterized the influence of the mutation in hupB regarding Xcc biofilm formation and virulence. The mutant strain hupB was incapable of swimming in soft agar, whereas its complemented strain partially recovered this phenotype. Electron microscope imaging revealed that impaired motility of hupB was a consequence of the absence of the flagellum. Comparison of the expression of flagellar genes between the wild-type strain and hupB showed that the mutant exhibited decreased expression of fliC (encoding flagellin). The hupB mutant also displayed reduced virulence compared with the wild-type strain when they were used to infect Citrus lemon plants using different infection methods.

In this study, the effects of treatment steps on the removal of Legionella spp., Legionella pneumophila, nontuberculous mycobacteria, Mycobacterium avium, and two amoeba hosts (Vermamoeba vermiformis, Acanthamoeba) are evaluated in two parallel trains of DWTPs equipped with different pretreatment units. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrates significantly reduced numbers of total bacteria, Legionella, and mycobacteria during ozonation, followed by a rebound in granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration, whereas sand filtration exerts an overarching effect in removing microorganisms in both treatment trains. V. vermiformis is more prevalent in biofilm (34%) than water samples (7.7%), while Acanthamoeba is not found in the two trains of DWTPs. Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes reveals significant community shifts at different treatment steps, as well as distinct bacterial community structures in water and biofilm samples in parallel units (e.g., ozonation, GAC, sand filtration) between the two trains (analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), p < 0.05), implying the potential influence of different pretreatment steps in shaping the downstream microbiome.

These communities, which are composed of a number of functionally-distinct cell types, are an interesting example of division of labour in microbes, and as such have been used as a system to study the evolution of cooperation. The structured population of the biofilm also plays a critical role in the persistence of infections, and biofouling of medical and industrial devices. Biofilm formation involves several stages of differentiation, which are mediated by extracellular factors secreted by cells composing the biofilm. The developmental model of biofilm formation describes this process mechanistically: specific subpopulations of cells synthesize signals within the biofilm, and promote the differentiation of other subpopulations. The handicap principle suggests that signals function because they provide reliable information regarding the state of the signaller; here, we apply the handicap principle to signalling among cells composing Bacillus subtilis biofilms, emphasizing the perspective of secreted factors as sources of information rather than solely as mediators of development. Such information could facilitate competition among phenotypically-similar cells composing the biofilm, affecting local organizational patterns within defined subpopulations.","authors":[{"name":"Keith D Harris"},{"name":"Ilana Kolodkin-Gal"}],"keywords":[]},"article338":{"pmid":"30535928","title":"Biocalcification by Piezotolerant Bacillus sp.

Bacterial strains have been isolated from various sources and their ability to precipitate carbonate has been studied extensively. In spite of the fact that the deep-sea environment is a potential source for bioprospecting, meager reports exist on the isolation of biocalcifying bacterial strains from deep-sea. In this study, a deep-sea sediment sample obtained from off-Barren Island coast in the Andaman Sea was investigated for biocalcifying strains. Based on the urease activity and the ability to produce calcite crystals, the strain NIOTVJ5 was chosen for further investigations. The strain showed a similarity to Bacillus thuringiensis through 16S rRNA sequencing and was shown to possess positive urease, protease, amylase, catalase, and oxidase activities. The isolate was found to be piezotolerant as it was able to survive at 100 bar pressure with significant changes in the spore morphology. The strain was able to produce strong monoxenic biofilms as well. Maximum urease activity was 554.03 U/mL and it precipitated 1.80 g/L of carbonate crystals. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the presence of calcium carbonate. The carbonate polymorph was identified as calcite using X-ray powder diffraction. The impact of biocalcification by NIOTVJ5 on concrete specimens indicated an increase of 30.91% in their compressive strength. This is the first report of a biocalcifying strain from a deep-sea sediment around the Indian subcontinent region.

Most of the Candida species are proficient in biofilm formation on implanted medical devices as well as human tissues. Biofilm related Candida infections are very difficult to treat using common antifungal agents owing to their increased drug resistance. To address these issues, the present study investigated the antibiofilm and antivirulent properties of Syzygium cumini derived quinic acid in combination with known antifungal compound undecanoic acid. Initially, antibiofilm potential of S. cumini leaf extract was assessed and the active principles were identified through gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis. Among the compounds identified, quinic acid was one of the major compounds. The interaction between quinic acid and undecanoic acid was found to be synergistic in the Fractional inhibitory concentration index (≤0.5). Results of in vitro assays and gene expression analysis suggested that the synergistic combinations of quinic acid and undecanoic acid significantly inhibited virulence traits of Candida spp. such as the biofilm formation, yeast-to-hyphal transition, extracellular polymeric substances production, filamentation, secreted hydrolases production and ergosterol biosynthesis. In addition, result of in vivo studies using Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated the non-toxic nature of QA-UDA combination and antivirulence effect against Candida spp. For the first time, synergistic antivirulence ability of quinic acid and undecanoic acid was explored against Candida spp. Thus, results obtained from the present study suggest that combination of phytochemicals might be used an alternate therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of biofilm associated Candida infection.","authors":[{"name":"Subramanian Muthamil"},{"name":"Boopathi Balasubramaniam"},{"name":"Krishnaswamy Balamurugan"},{"name":"Shunmugiah Karutha Pandian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida spp."},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"drug resistance"},{"word":"ergosterol"},{"word":"filamentation"},{"word":"quinic acid"},{"word":"synergism"},{"word":"undecanoic acid"}]},"article343":{"pmid":"30533844","title":"Draft Genome Sequence of Aquitalea sp.

To determine the role of HTR regulators in the control of csgD and curli, specific regulators were plasmid-expressed in the wild-type and mutant strains of PA20 and its biofilm-forming derivative, 20R2R. At 30°C, plasmid over-expression of the O157:H7 group 3 perC homolog, pchE, strongly repressed PA20 csgD transcription (>7-fold) while the group 1 homologs, pchA and pchB, resulted in smaller reductions (<2.5-fold). However, SOS induction decreased rather than increased pchE expression (>6-fold) making group 1 pch, which are enhanced by the SOS response, the likely SOS-induced csgD repressors. Plasmid-based pchE over-expression also reduced 20R2R biofilm formation (>6-fold) and the curli-dependent, Congo red affinity of both PA20 and 20R2R. However, to properly appreciate the regulatory direction, expression patterns, and environmental consequences of these and other CsgD-controlled functions, a better understanding of natural pchE regulation will be required. The effects of HTR regulators on PA20 and 20R2R adhesion to HEp-2 cell at host temperature were also studied. Under conditions where prophage genes were not induced, curli, rather than espA, contributed to host cell adhesion in strain 20R2R. High levels of pchE expression in trans reduced curli-dependent cell adherence (>2-fold) to both 20R2R and the clinical isolate PA20, providing a host-adapting adhesion control mechanism. Expression of pchE was also repressed by induction of the SOS response at 37°C, providing a mechanism by which curli expression might complement EspA-dependent intimate adhesion initiated by the group1 pch homologs.

BAC susceptibility, planktonic growth rates, motility, and biofilm formation were assessed, and differentially expressed genes were determined via transcriptome sequencing. Planktonic growth rate and biofilm formation were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) following BAC adaptation, while BAC minimum bactericidal concentration increased 2-fold. Transcriptomic analysis identified 289 upregulated and 391 downregulated genes after long-term BAC adaptation compared with the respective control organism passaged in BAC-free medium. When the BAC-adapted bacterium was grown in BAC-free medium, 1,052 genes were upregulated and 753 were downregulated. Repeated passage solely in biocide-free medium resulted in 460 upregulated and 476 downregulated genes compared with unexposed bacteria. Long-term exposure to environmentally relevant BAC concentrations increased the expression of genes associated with efflux and reduced the expression of genes associated with outer-membrane porins, motility, and chemotaxis. This was manifested phenotypically through the loss of function (motility). Repeated passage in a BAC-free environment resulted in the upregulation of multiple respiration-associated genes, which was reflected by increased growth rate.

This new, layered QQ bead, which has dual functions of bioaugmentation and biostimulation, supports a highly efficient and sustainable anti-biofouling strategy.","authors":[{"name":"Huarong Yu"},{"name":"Kibaek Lee"},{"name":"Xiaolei Zhang"},{"name":"Kwang-Ho Choo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial quorum quenching"},{"word":"Biofouling control"},{"word":"Biostimulation"},{"word":"Layered media structure"},{"word":"Membrane bioreactor"}]},"article360":{"pmid":"30530005","title":"Quantitative evaluation of different fractions of extracellular polymeric substances derived from Paenibacillus mucilaginosus against the toxicity of gold ions.","date":"2019-06-13","abs":"The reductive detoxification of microbes is of significant importance as toxic high oxidation-state metals are ubiquitous in the environment.

Hence, the development of AMP-based coatings is a very promising strategy to prevent biomaterials-associated infections. This work aims to investigate if Dhvar-5-chitosan conjugates, previously synthesized by us via azide-alkyne click reaction, can be applied as antimicrobial coatings. Ultrathin coatings were prepared by spin coater after dissolving Dhvar-5-chitosan conjugate powder in aqueous acetic acid. Peptide orientation and exposure from the surface was confirmed by ellipsometry and contact angle measurements. Bactericidal activity was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most prevalent pathogens in implant-associated infections. Results showed that Dhvar-5-chitosan coatings displayed bactericidal effect. Moreover, since Dhvar-5 has head-to-tail amphipathicity, it was clear that the bactericidal potency was dependent on which domain of the peptide (cationic or hydrophobic) was exposed. In this context, Dhvar-5 immobilized through its C-terminus (exposing its hydrophobic end) presented higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and reduced adhesion of Gram-negative bacteria. This orientation-dependent antimicrobial activity was further corroborated by the anti-biofilm assay, as covalent immobilization of Dhvar-5 through its C-terminus provided anti-biofilm properties to the chitosan thin film. Immobilization of Dhvar-5 showed no cytotoxic effect against HFF-1 cells, as both metabolic activity and cell morphology were similar to control. In conclusion, Dhvar-5-chitosan coatings are promising antimicrobial surfaces without cytotoxic effects against human cells. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: AMP-tethering onto ground biomaterial is still a poorly explored strategy in research. In this work, AMP-tethered ground chitosan is used to produce highly antibacterial ultrathin films. Powdered AMP-tethered chitosan appears as an alternative solution for antimicrobial devices production, as it is suitable for large scale production, being easier to handle for fabrication of different coatings and materials with antimicrobial properties and without inducing toxicity.","authors":[{"name":"Mariana Barbosa"},{"name":"Fabíola Costa"},{"name":"Cláudia Monteiro"},{"name":"Filipa Duarte"},{"name":"M Cristina L Martins"},{"name":"Paula Gomes"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"Antimicrobial surfaces"},{"word":"Bacterial adhesion"},{"word":"Biomaterials"},{"word":"Chitosan functionalization"},{"word":"Click chemistry"}]},"article369":{"pmid":"30528295","title":"Titanium dioxide and modified titanium dioxide by silver nanoparticles as an anti biofilm filler content for composite resins.","date":"2019-10-22","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a composite resin modified by TiO","authors":[{"name":"Hércules Bezerra Dias"},{"name":"Maria Inês Basso Bernardi"},{"name":"Taís Maria Bauab"},{"name":"Antônio Carlos Hernandes"},{"name":"Alessandra Nara de Souza Rastelli"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Composite resin"},{"word":"Nanoparticles"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"Titanium dioxide"}]},"article370":{"pmid":"30528249","title":"Isonitrile-functionalized tyrosine modulates swarming motility and quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-03-14","abs":"Paerucumarin synthesized by pvc operon pvcABCD is an iron binding molecule which modulates biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa but its direct function in bacterial pathogenesis needs further investigation. pvcA synthesizes isonitrile functionalized tyrosine (IFT) which is converted to mature paerucumarin by the proteins encoded by pvcB, pvcC and pvcD genes. Interruption of pvcB in MPAO1 resulted in accumulation of IFT as it cannot be converted to mature molecule. The MPAO1 pvcB mutant (PW4832) showed enhanced swarming motility, while complementation with plasmid pLL2 carrying pvcB reduced swarming motility. Enhanced levels of rhlA expression and rhamnolipid production were observed in PW4832 compared to the parent strain. Overexpression of ptxR, the positive regulator of pvcABCD, in PW4832 caused accumulation of more IFT and further elevated the level of rhlA expression. Expression of the quorum sensing system transcriptional activators lasR and rhlR, as well as the synthase genes lasI and rhlI, was enhanced in PW4832 compared to MPAO1, as was PQS accumulation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential mechanism underlying dissemination of tet(31) by analysing the tet(31)-carrying fragments in A. caviae strains isolated from an aerobic biofilm reactor treating oxytetracycline bearing wastewater. Twenty-three A. caviae strains were screened for the tet(31) gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three strains (two harbouring tet(31), one not) were subjected to whole genome sequencing using the PacBio RSII platform. Seventeen A. caviae strains carried the tet(31) gene and exhibited high resistance levels to oxytetracycline with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 256 to 512 mg/L. tet(31) was comprised of the transposon Tn6432 on the chromosome of A. caviae, and Tn6432 was also found in 15 additional tet(31)-positive A. caviae isolates by PCR. More important, Tn6432 was located on an integrative conjugative element (ICE)-like element, which could mediate the dissemination of the tet(31)-carrying transposon Tn6432 between bacteria. Comparative analysis demonstrated that Tn6432 homologs with the structure ISCR2-∆phzF-tetR(31)-tet(31)-∆glmM-sul2 were also carried by A. salmonicida, G. anatis, and O. alkaliphila, suggesting that this transposon can be transferred between species and even genera.

More metallic elements in the influent were captured by suspended sludge and built up in the fouling layer at lower temperature. The concentration of metallic elements in the effluent was 5.60mg/L at 10°C operational temperature, far lower than that in the influent (51.35mg/L).

The method is based on the temporal analysis of the intensity of a light diffraction peak, which arises due to interference at a periodic pattern of gold nanostructures. The presence of bacteria disturbs the constructive interference, leading to an intensity decrease and thus allows the monitoring of bacterial growth in very low volumes. We demonstrate the direct correlation of the decrease in diffraction peak intensity with bacterial cell number starting from single cells and show the capability for rapid high-throughput AST measurements by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration for three different antimicrobials in less than 2-3 h as well as the susceptibility in less than 30-40 min. Furthermore, bacterial mobility is obtained from short-term fluctuations of the diffraction peak intensity and is shown to decrease by a factor of 3 during bacterial attachment to a surface.

It showed a S. epidermidis inhibition of biofilm formation >84% at a concentration of 256 μM (2 X MIC) and remained active even at a concentration of 4 μM with 32% of inhibition. The eradication of the established biofilm was observed at a concentration of 256 μM with 55.7% of biofilm eradication. The peptide was active against mature biofilm even at low concentration of 0.5 μM with approximately 22.9% of eradication. PEP-NJSM exhibited low hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that PEP-NJSM could have a potential role in the treatment of diseases related to Staphylococcus epidermidis infection.","authors":[{"name":"Sami Mnif"},{"name":"Marwa Jardak"},{"name":"Imen Graiet"},{"name":"Salwa Abid"},{"name":"Dorra Driss"},{"name":"Najla Kharrat"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-biofilm"},{"word":"Antibacterial"},{"word":"CPP/AMP"},{"word":"Fluorescence microscopy"},{"word":"SEM"}]},"article388":{"pmid":"30521647","title":"The promises and risks of probiotic Bacillus species.","date":"2019-03-25","abs":"Supplementing the human microbiome with probiotic microorganisms is a proposed solution for civilization syndromes such as dysbiosis and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders. Bimodal probiotic strains of the Bacillus genus constitute the microbiota of the human environment, and are typically found in soil, water, a number of non-dairy fermented foods, as well as in human and animal GIT. Probiotic Bacillus sp. are Gram positive rods, with the ability of sporulation to survive environmental stress and preparation conditions. In vitro models of the human stomach and human studies with probiotic Bacillus reveal the mechanisms of its life cycle and sporulation. The Bacillus sp. probiotic biofilm introduces biochemical effects such as antimicrobial and enzymatic activity, thus contributing to protection from GIT and other infections. Despite the beneficial activity of Bacillus strains belonging to the safety group 1, a number of strains can pose a substantial health risk, carrying genes for various toxins or antibiotic resistance. Commercially available Bacillus probiotic preparations include strains from the subtilis and other closely related phylogenetic clades. Those intended for oral administration in humans, often encapsulated with appropriate supporting materials, still tend to be mislabeled or poorly characterized. Bacillus sp. MALDI-TOF analysis, combined with sequencing of characteristic 16S rRNA or enzyme coding genes, may provide accurate identification. A promising future application of the probiotic Bacillus sp. might be the microflora biocontrol in the human body and the closest human environment. Environmental probiotic Bacillus species display the potential to support human microflora, however controversies regarding the safety of certain strains is a key factor in their still limited application.","authors":[{"name":"Joanna Jeżewska-Frąckowiak"},{"name":"Krystyna Seroczyńska"},{"name":"Justyna Banaszczyk"},{"name":"Gabriela Jedrzejczak"},{"name":"Agnieszka Żylicz-Stachula"},{"name":"Piotr Mariusz Skowron"}],"keywords":[]},"article389":{"pmid":"30521589","title":"Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) producing and oil degrading bacteria isolated from the northern Gulf of Mexico.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Sinking marine oil snow was found to be a major mechanism in the transport of spilled oil from the surface to the deep sea following the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) oil spill. Marine snow formation is primarily facilitated by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which are mainly composed of proteins and carbohydrates secreted by microorganisms. While numerous bacteria have been identified to degrade oil, there is a paucity of knowledge on bacteria that produce EPS in response to oil and Corexit exposure in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM). In this study, we isolated bacteria from surface water of the nGoM that grow on oil or Corexit dispersant. Among the 100 strains isolated, nine were identified to produce remarkable amounts of EPS. 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that six isolates (strains C1, C5, W10, W11, W14, W20) belong to the genus Alteromonas; the others were related to Thalassospira (C8), Aestuariibacter (C12), and Escherichia (W13a). The isolates preferably degraded alkanes (17-77%), over polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (0.90-23%). The EPS production was determined in the presence of a water accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil, a chemical enhanced WAF (CEWAF), Corexit, and control. The highest production of visible aggregates was found in Corexit followed by CEWAF, WAF, and control; indicating that Corexit generally enhanced EPS production. The addition of WAF and Corexit did not affect the carbohydrate content, but significantly increased the protein content of the EPS. On the average, WAF and CEWAF treatments had nine to ten times more proteins, and Corexit had five times higher than the control. Our results reveal that Alteromonas and Thalassospira, among the commonly reported bacteria following the DwH spill, produce protein rich EPS that could have crucial roles in oil degradation and marine snow formation. This study highlights the link between EPS production and bacterial oil-degrading capacity that should not be overlooked during spilled oil clearance.","authors":[{"name":"Hernando P Bacosa"},{"name":"Manoj Kamalanathan"},{"name":"Meng-Hsuen Chiu"},{"name":"Shih-Ming Tsai"},{"name":"Luni Sun"},{"name":"Jessica M Labonté"},{"name":"Kathleen A Schwehr"},{"name":"David Hala"},{"name":"Peter H Santschi"},{"name":"Wei-Chun Chin"},{"name":"Antonietta Quigg"}],"keywords":[]},"article390":{"pmid":"30520804","title":"Diagnosis and Management of Fungal Periprosthetic Joint Infections.","date":"2020-02-06","abs":"Fungal periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication because it can be difficult to diagnose, manage, and eradicate. Fungal PJI treatment requires a systematic approach. Increased awareness is essential when patients with painful arthroplasties present with immunosuppression, significant comorbidities, multiple surgeries, and history of drug use. Every suspected fungal PJI should be promptly diagnosed using readily available serum and synovial fluid markers. Surgical management involves débridement, antibiotics, and implant retention, one-stage exchange arthroplasty, prosthetic articulating spacers, and two-stage exchange arthroplasty. Because mycotic infections develop robust biofilms, the utility of débridement, antibiotics, and implant retention and one-stage revisions seem limited. A thorough irrigation and débridement is essential to decrease infection burden. Adjunctive local and systemic antifungal therapy is critical, although the agent choice and duration should be tailored appropriately. Future high-quality studies are needed to develop standardized guidelines for the management of fungal PJI.","authors":[{"name":"James Nace"},{"name":"Ahmed Siddiqi"},{"name":"Carl T Talmo"},{"name":"Antonia F Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article391":{"pmid":"30520711","title":"Social behaviour and making attachments: a report from the fifth 'Young Microbiologists Symposium on Microbe Signalling, Organisation and Pathogenesis'.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"The fifth Young Microbiologists Symposium was held in Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, in late August 2018.

They originate through many factors and are associated with biofilm formation, which consists of bacteria adhered to the teeth that form a structurally and functionally organized mass called dental plaque. Both the presence of Streptococcus mutans and the frequent consumption of sucrose correlate with a higher prevalence of caries in humans. In dogs, however, the incidence of this disease is low, due to factors such as differences in dental microbiota and/or their low consumption of sucrose. This work evaluated the antagonism of bacteria from dog's dental plaque against S. mutans, for the identification of producing strains of biotechnological products for use in preventing caries. This study used 95 bacterial isolates of canine dental plaque from the Veterinary Department at the Federal University of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. A spot-on-the-lawn method was performed using Brain Heart Infusion agar with catalase for an initial identification of the antagonistic activity. Additional tests were conducted on the isolates classified as antagonists for confirmation of the activity, using modified Mann-Rogosa-Sharpe medium containing low dextrose concentration. These isolates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours in anaerobiosis. The peptide nature of inhibition was evaluated using the following proteinases: proteinase K from Tritirachium album, bovine pancreatic trypsin, and type XII-A α-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis. In the initial identification of those strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity, 14 were classified as antagonists. One of the isolates (Bacillus sp.) indicated bacteriocinogenic activity, with a deformed inhibition halo on S. mutans by the addition of trypsin. These results suggest that this bacterial isolate may be applicable to biotechnological use to combat the main etiological agent of caries in humans. Further studies are needed to evaluate the bacteriocinogenic nature of the antimicrobial activities of the other 13 antagonistic bacterial isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Káthia Santana Martins"},{"name":"Lorena Tirza de Assis Magalhães"},{"name":"Jeferson Geison de Almeida"},{"name":"Fábio Alessandro Pieri"}],"keywords":[]},"article394":{"pmid":"30519367","title":"Bootstrapped Biocatalysis: Biofilm-Derived Materials as Reversibly Functionalizable Multienzyme Surfaces.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Cell-free biocatalysis systems offer many benefits for chemical manufacturing, but their widespread applicability is hindered by high costs associated with enzyme purification, modification, and immobilization on solid substrates, in addition to the cost of the material substrates themselves.

In a previous study, pleurocidin, derived from winter flounder, was identified as a 25-amino acid antimicrobial peptide with no cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells and low hemolytic activity. In the present study, pleurocidin was observed to exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially against drug resistant S. aureus. Pleurocidin retained its antibacterial activity against drug resistant S. aureus in the presence of a physiological salt concentration. Membrane depolarization assays and propidium iodide uptake indicated that pleurocidin kills bacteria by damaging the integrity of the bacterial membrane. DNA binding assays revealed that pleurocidin binds to DNA. Thus, pleurocidin targets not only the bacterial membrane, but also their DNA. S. aureus biofilms have become a serious problem because of increased resistance to antibiotics. Therefore, we investigated the effect of pleurocidin on biofilm inhibition and eradication using crystal violet staining and microscopic observation.

Furthermore, the active compounds were docked against the quorum sensing system, LasI. The compound 13Z-Octadecenal was found to bind to the conserved sites of substrate binding with a binding energy of -1.90 kcal/mol thus, affirming the inhibitory activity of the fatty acyl compound. These active compounds were previously reported to be a part of active extracts exhibiting relevant antagonistic activities, but this so far is the first time they are found possessing anti-biofilm activity.
