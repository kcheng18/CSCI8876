Recently, we have shown that distinct sets of residues in its periplasmic HmsP sensory domain are involved in the regulation of biofilm formation or antibiotic tolerance. Interestingly, the HmsP domain of the phosphodiesterase BifA shows great predicted structural similarity to that of SagS, despite moderate sequence conservation and only a number of residues involved in SagS signaling being conserved between both proteins. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that BifA and SagS may use similar mechanisms to sense and transduce signals perceived at their periplasmic HmsP domains and, therefore, may be interchangeable. To test this hypothesis, we constructed SagS hybrids in which the HmsP domain of SagS was replaced by that of BifA (and vice versa) or by the DISMED2 sensory domain of NicD. The SagS-BifA hybrid restored attachment and biofilm formation by the ΔbifA mutant. Likewise, while the NicD-SagS hybrid was nonfunctional, the BifA-SagS hybrid partially restored pathways leading to biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance in a ΔsagS mutant background. Furthermore, alanine substitution of key residues previously associated with the biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance pathways of SagS impaired signal transduction by the BifA-SagS hybrid in a similar way to SagS. In conclusion, our data indicate that the nature of the sensory domain is important for proper functionality of the cytoplasmic effector domains and that signal sensing and transduction are likely conserved in SagS and BifA.","authors":[{"name":"Jozef Dingemans"},{"name":"Rebecca E Al-Feghali"},{"name":"Holger Sondermann"},{"name":"Karin Sauer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BifA"},{"word":"HmsP"},{"word":"SagS"},{"word":"alanine substitution"},{"word":"biofilm drug tolerance"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"hybrid protein"},{"word":"signal transduction"}]},"article6":{"pmid":"31366707","title":"In Silico Modeling of Biofilm Formation by Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae In Vivo.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Biofilms formed by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) bacteria play an important role in multiple respiratory tract diseases.

Effects of DEET exposure were assessed in microbial communities using a wide variety of measures. Communities developed in rotating annular reactors with either 100 or 500 ng/L DEET, verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. Microscale analyses indicated that both DEET concentrations resulted in significant (p < 0.05) declines in photosynthetic biomass, whereas bacterial biomass was unaffected. There was no detectable effect of DEET on the levels of chlorophyll a. However, pigment analyses indicated substantial shifts in algal-cyanobacterial community structure, with reductions of green algae and some cyanobacterial groups at 500 ng/L DEET. Protozoan/micrometazoan grazers increased in communities exposed to 500 ng/L, but not 100 ng/L, DEET. Based on thymidine incorporation or utilization of carbon sources, DEET had no significant effects on metabolic activities. Fluorescent lectin-binding analyses showed significant (p < 0.05) changes in glycoconjugate composition at both DEET concentrations, consistent with altered community structure. Principal component cluster analyses of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that DEET exposure at either concentration significantly changed the bacterial community (p < 0.05). Analyses based on 16S ribosomal RNA of community composition confirmed changes with DEET exposure, increasing detectable beta-proteobacteria, whereas actinobacteria and acidimicrobia became undetectable.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of polyP3 against Porphyromonas gulae, Porphyromonas cansulci, and Porphyromonas cangingivalis were between 500 and 750 mg/L. PolyP3 significantly decreased viable planktonic cells as well as bacterial biofilm formation, even at sub-MIC concentrations. PolyP3 caused bacterial membrane disruption and this effect was most prominent in P. cangingivalis, which was demonstrated by measuring the amount of nucleotide leakage from the cells. To further investigate the mode of action of polyP3, high-throughput whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed using P. gulae. Approximately 30% of the total genes of P. gulae were differentially expressed by polyP3 (> 4-fold, adjusted p value < 0.01). PolyP3 influenced the expression of the P. gulae genes related to the biosynthesis of thiamine, ubiquinone, and peptidoglycan.

The low concentration of oxygen and nutrients in this environment leads to heterogeneous phenotypic changes in the bacteria, with antimicrobial tolerance being of paramount importance. As with other antibiotics, the activity of colistin is impaired by biofilm-embedded bacteria. Therefore, the recommendation for administering high doses in combination with a second drug, indicated for planktonic infections, remains valid in this setting. Notably, colistin has activity against metabolically inactive biofilm-embedded cells located in the inner layers of the biofilm structure. This is opposite and complementary to the activity of other antimicrobials that are able to kill metabolically active cells in the outer layers of the biofilm. Several experimental models have shown a higher activity of colistin when used in combination with other agents, and have reported that this can avoid the emergence of colistin-resistant subpopulations. Most experience of colistin in biofilm-associated infections comes from patients with cystic fibrosis, where the use of nebulized colistin allows high concentrations to reach the site of the infection. However, limited clinical experience is available in other scenarios, such as osteoarticular infections or device-related central nervous system infections caused by multi-drug resistant microorganisms. In the latter scenario, the use of intraventricular or intrathecal colistin also permits high local concentrations and good clinical results. Overall, the efficacy of intravenous colistin seems to be poor, but its association with a second antimicrobial significantly increases the response rate. Given its activity against inner bioflm-embedded cells, its possible role in combination with other antibiotics, beyond last-line therapy situations, should be further explored.","authors":[{"name":"Jaime Lora-Tamayo"},{"name":"Oscar Murillo"},{"name":"Javier Ariza"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"Implant-associated infection"},{"word":"Polymyxin"},{"word":"Prosthetic joint infection"}]},"article15":{"pmid":"31363941","title":"Mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptide P5 truncations against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Rates of microbial drug resistance are increasing worldwide; therefore, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising alternative therapeutic agents to antibiotics.

Treatment of S. aureus with the antiseptic chloroxylenol alone did not decrease biofilm cell viability; however, the combination of chloroxylenol and P. aeruginosa supernatant led to a 4-log reduction in S. aureus biofilm viability compared to exposure to chloroxylenol alone. We found that the P. aeruginosa-produced small molecule 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) is responsible for the observed heightened sensitivity of S. aureus to chloroxylenol. Similarly, HQNO increased the susceptibility of S. aureus biofilms to other compounds, including both traditional and nontraditional antibiotics, which permeabilize bacterial membranes. Genetic and phenotypic studies support a model whereby HQNO causes an increase in S. aureus membrane fluidity, thereby improving the efficacy of membrane-targeting antiseptics and antibiotics.

We found that a switch in pH can be used to drive base-catalyzed gelation or precipitation of a substance in the external solution. A critical density of cells was required for gelation that was essentially independent of the pH-driven feedback. However, the cell pH reached a higher maximum as a result of the appearance of pH oscillations with feedback.

Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the composite carriers showed significant promotion on the proliferation of ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and enrichment of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB), accounting for 19.14% and 41.65% on the surface, respectively. Moreover, the existence of relative higher abundance of ammonia on the composite carrier surface was validated by the metabolite biomarker of glutamate and especially spermidine. The metabolomics analysis and 16S rRNA function prediction showed that the protein synthesis pathway was obviously upregulated on the composite carriers surface compared with that on the ordinary carriers surface. The higher abundance of glutamate and putrescine indicated that the composite carrier could stimulate the metabolism and growth of bacteria. The present study provided a functional carrier to realize the transformation of activated sludge system into PN-A system treating low strength wastewater, which is significant to the application of the process in mainstream.","authors":[{"name":"Yufeng Lv"},{"name":"Juejun Pan"},{"name":"Tangran Huo"},{"name":"Yunpeng Zhao"},{"name":"Sitong Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacterial distribution"},{"word":"Low strength wastewater"},{"word":"Metabolic discrepancies"},{"word":"Novel composite carrier"},{"word":"Partial nitritation-anammox"}]},"article23":{"pmid":"31362161","title":"The preservative propionic acid differentially affects survival of conidia and germ tubes of feed spoilage fungi.","date":"2019-10-30","abs":"Propionic acid is widely used as a preservative in (poultry) feed. In this study we have isolated and identified fungal strains from nine samples poultry feed originating from different countries.

These and three other species were selected and tested for their sensitivity towards the feed preservative propionic acid, among them Penicillium lanosocoeruleum. The determined MIC values of 6.1-31 mM of these poultry feed specific fungi were well in the range as described in literature. Propionic acid (at 31 mM) damages conidia (spores) in a species dependent fashion after a 24-hour-treatment. The majority of the conidia (over 70%) of P. lanosocoeruleum germinated within 60 h on agar medium, while 50 and 80% of the A. chevalieri and A. proliferans conidia did not, respectively. Dependent on the species, cell damage was visible after incubation with propionic acid. Germ tubes of P. lanosocoeruleum in a biofilm showed extensive (85%) cell death after a 30 min treatment with propionic acid and slightly lower sensitivity was observed with A. proliferans (62% cell death). Microscopic analysis of these fungal biofilms revealed extensive damage to the cell membrane and showed distorted intracellular structures. Fluorescent life-dead staining of the germ tubes showed a clear dose response of propionic acid indicating a fungicidal effect on these growing cells. These results show that conidia can be inactivated by propionic acid, but that germ tubes show a much higher sensitivity.

Here, we investigated the correlation between salivary β-glucosidase activity and dental plaque occurrence.

PMMA acrylic resin discs (N= 108) were fabricated. For the susceptibility tests, biofilms of C. albicans and C. glabrata were developed on discs for 48 h and immersed in phosphate-saline buffer solution (PBS), 1% sodium hypochlorite (SH 1%), or FBuTC at MIC, 5xMIC, or 10xMIC. For the color and roughness change tests, the discs were immersed in distilled water, SH 1%, or FBuTC in the concentrations of 0.25 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, or 25.0 mg/mL. After 28 days of incubation, color change was evaluated by spectrophotometry and roughness, by using a profilometer. The biofilms were investigated by one-way ANOVA and, the color and roughness changes (two-way ANOVA and the Tukey test; α=0.05). For both MIC and MFC the value of 0.25 mg/mL of FBuTC was observed for the planktonic cells of C. albicans and C. glabrata. Exposure to FBuTC at 10xMIC had a significant effect on the biofilm of C. albicans, showing a reduction in cell counts when compared with PBS, (p=0.001). For the biofilm of C. glabrata, the MIC was sufficient for significantly reducing the cell count (p<0.001).

In these social environments, microbes compete and cooperate for resources, such as living space and nutrients. The metabolic activities of bacteria can transform their microenvironment and dynamically influence the fitness and growth of cohabitating organisms. Biofilm communities are temporally and spatially organized largely due to cell-to-cell communication, which promotes synergistic interactions. Metabolic interactions maintain biofilm homeostasis through mutualistic cross-feeding, metabolic syntrophy, and cross-respiration. These interactions include reciprocal metabolite exchanges that promote the growth of physiologically compatible bacteria, processive catabolism of complex substrates, and unidirectional interactions that are globally important for the polymicrobial community. Additionally, oral bacterial interactions can lead to detoxification of oxidative compounds, which will provide protection to the community at large. It has also been established that specific organisms provide terminal electron acceptors to partner species that result in a shift from fermentation to respiration, thus increasing ATP yields and improving fitness. Indeed, many interspecies relationships are multidimensional, and the net outcome can be spatially and temporally dependent. Cross-kingdom interactions also occur as oral yeast are antagonistic to some oral bacteria, while numerous mutualistic interactions contribute to yeast-bacterial colonization, fitness in the oral community, and the pathogenesis of caries. Consideration of this social environment reveals behaviors and phenotypes that are not apparent through the study of microbes in isolation.

A potential method to treat such chronic infections is to combine agents which interfere with bacterial biofilm development together with an antibiotic in a single formulation. Here, we explore the use of a new bioresponsive polymer formulation derived from specifically modified alginate nanoparticles (NPs) in order to deliver ciprofloxacin (CIP) in combination with the quorum sensing inhibitor (QSI) 3-amino-7-chloro-2-nonylquinazolin-4(3H)-one (ACNQ) to mature Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The alginate NPs were engineered to incorporate a pH-responsive linker between the polysaccharide backbone and the QSI, and to encapsulate CIP via charge-charge interactions of the positively-charged drug with the carboxyl residues of the alginate matrix. In this way, a dual-action release of antibiotic and QSI was designed for the low-pH regions of a biofilm, involving cleavage of the QSI-linker to the alginate matrix and reduced charge-charge interactions between CIP and the polysaccharide as the alginate carboxyl side-chains protonated. When tested in a biofilm model the concomitant release of CIP + QSI from the pH-responsive nanoparticles significantly reduced the viability of the biofilm compared with CIP treatment alone. In addition, the alginate NPs were shown to penetrate deeply into P. aeruginosa biofilms, which we attribute in part to the charges of the NPs and the release of the QSI agent. Finally, we tested the formulation in both a 2D keratinocyte and a 3D ex vivo skin infection model. The dual-action bio-responsive QSI and CIP release nanoparticles effectively cleared the infection in the latter, suggesting considerable promise for combination therapeutics which prevent biofilm formation as well as effectively killing mature P. aeruginosa biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Nishant Singh"},{"name":"Manuel Romero"},{"name":"Alessandra Travanut"},{"name":"Patricia F Monteiro"},{"name":"Elena Jordana-Lluch"},{"name":"Kim R Hardie"},{"name":"Paul Williams"},{"name":"Morgan R Alexander"},{"name":"Cameron Alexander"}],"keywords":[]},"article59":{"pmid":"31355394","title":"Highly branched poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) functionalized with an inducer molecule suppresses quorum sensing in Chromobacterium violaceum.","date":"2019-08-26","abs":"Bacterial quorum sensing has been implicated in a number of pathogenic bacterial processes, such as biofilm formation, making it a crucial target for developing materials with a novel antibiotic mode of action.

Many studies have revealed the virulence traits of L. pneumophila using clinical strains and a number of studies for characterizing environmental strains are also reported. However, the association between the virulence and survivability in the environment is unclear. In the present study, L. pneumophila was isolated from environmental water sites (Ashiyu foot spa, water fountain, and public bath), and the serogroups of isolated strains were determined by serological tests. Isolated strains were found to belong to serogroups SG1, SG2, SG3, SG4, SG5, SG8, SG9, and SG13. Untypeable strains were also obtained. Isolated strains were used for intracellular growth assay in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1. Among these strains, only an untypeable strain, named AY3, failed to replicate in THP-1. In addition, AY3 was maintained for a long period in an environmental water site, Ashiyu foot spa 2. Further, we compared the characteristics of several strains isolated from Ashiyu foot spa 2 and a clinical strain, Togus-1. AY3 failed to replicate in THP-1 cells but replicated in an amoeba model, Dictyostelium discoideum. Compared with Togus-1, the culturable cell number of environmental strains under stress conditions was higher. Moreover, biofilm formation was assessed, and AY3 showed the same degree of biofilm formation as Togus-1. Biofilm formation, replication in amoebae, and resistance against stress factors would explain the predominance of AY3 at one environmental site. Although the mechanism underlying the difference in the ability of AY3 to replicate in THP-1 cells or amoebae is still unclear, AY3 may abandon the ability to replicate in THP-1 cells to survive in one environment for a long period. Understanding the mechanisms of L. pneumophila in replication within different hosts should help in the control of Legionnaires' disease, but further study is necessary.","authors":[{"name":"Takashi Nishida"},{"name":"Natsuko Nakagawa"},{"name":"Kenta Watanabe"},{"name":"Takashi Shimizu"},{"name":"Masahisa Watarai"}],"keywords":[]},"article61":{"pmid":"31355200","title":"Acne and Stress: Impact of Catecholamines on Cutibacterium acnes.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Cutibacterium acnes (former Propionibacterium acnes), is a bacterium characterized by high genomic variability, consisting of four subtypes and six major ribotypes.

We previously isolated and characterized two P. gingivalis strains, one from a patient exhibiting severe chronic periodontitis (CP3) and another from a periodontally healthy individual (H3). We previously showed that CP3 and H3 exhibit differences in virulence since H3 showed a lower resistance to cationic peptides compared with CP3, and a lower ability to induce proliferation in gingival epithelial cells. Here, we aimed to determine whether differences in virulence between these two strains are associated with the presence or absence of specific genes encoding virulence factors. We sequenced the whole genomes of both P. gingivalis CP3 and H3 and conducted a comparative analysis regarding P. gingivalis virulence genetic determinants. To do so, we performed a homology search of predicted protein sequences in CP3 and H3 genomes against the most characterized virulence genes for P. gingivalis available in the literature. In addition, we performed a genomic comparison of CP3 and H3 with all the 62 genomes of P. gingivalis found in NCBI's RefSeq database. This approach allowed us to determine the evolutionary relationships of CP3 and H3 with other virulent and avirulent strains; and additionally, to detect variability in presence/absence of virulence genes among P. gingivalis genomes. Our results show genetic variability in the hemagglutinin genes. While CP3 possesses one copy of hagA and two of hagC, H3 has no hagA and only one copy of hagC. Experimentally, this finding is related to lower in vitro hemmaglutination ability of H3 compared to CP3. Moreover, while CP3 encodes a gene for a major fimbrium subunit FimA type 4 (CP3_00160), H3 possess a FimA type 1 (H3_01400). Such genetic differences are in agreement with both lower biofilm formation ability and less intracellular invasion to oral epithelial cells exhibited by H3, compared with the virulent strain CP3. Therefore, here we provide new results on the genome sequences, comparative genomics analyses, and phenotypic analyses of two P. gingivalis strains. The genomics comparison of these two strains with the other 62 genomes included in the analysis provided relevant results regarding genetic determinants and their association with P. gingivalis virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Katterinne N Mendez"},{"name":"Anilei Hoare"},{"name":"Cristopher Soto"},{"name":"Isaac Bugueño"},{"name":"Marcela Olivera"},{"name":"Claudio Meneses"},{"name":"Jose Manuel Pérez-Donoso"},{"name":"Eduardo Castro-Nallar"},{"name":"Denisse Bravo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Porphyromonas gingivalis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"comparative genomics"},{"word":"fimbrium"},{"word":"hemagglutination"},{"word":"periodontitis"}]},"article63":{"pmid":"31354823","title":"Effects of Active Oxygen Toothpaste in Supragingival Biofilm Reduction: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Gingivitis is still considered a major risk factor for the occurrence and progression of periodontal disease.

However, periodic outbreaks of bacterial diseases in the fish farms represent a large problem, both economically and ethically. Therefore it is important to obtain a better understanding of how microbial communities develop in these production facilities. Knowledge on the characteristics of microbial communities associated with healthy fish could also enable detection of changes associated with disease outbreaks at an early stage. In this study we have monitored microbial communities in a fish farm for lumpfish during normal operational conditions with no disease outbreak by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The study involved weekly samplings of water and biofilms from fish tanks, and fish. The results revealed that the microbial communities in fish tank water were different from the intake water. The water and biofilm in fish tanks were highly similar in regards to microbial community members, but with large differences in relative abundances for some taxa. The sampled fish were associated with mostly the same taxa as in tank water and biofilm, but more variation in relative abundances of different taxonomic groups occurred. The microbial communities in the fish farm seemed stable over time, and were dominated by marine bacteria and archaea within Alphaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Thaumarchaeota, Planctomycetes, Sphingobacteriia, and Verrucomicrobiae (>10% relative abundance). Bacterial genera known to include fish-pathogenic strains were detected in all types of sample materials, but with low relative abundances (<5%). Exceptions were some samples of fish, biofilm and water with high relative abundance of Tenacibaculum (<85.8%) and Moritella (<82%). In addition, some of the eggs had a high relative abundance of Tenacibaculum (<89.5%). Overall, this study shows that a stable microbial community dominated by various genera of non-pathogenic bacteria is associated with a healthy environment for rearing lumpfish. Taxa with pathogenic members were also part of the microbial communities during healthy conditions, but the stable non-pathogenic bacteria may limit their growth and thereby prevent disease outbreaks.","authors":[{"name":"Irene Roalkvam"},{"name":"Karine Drønen"},{"name":"Håkon Dahle"},{"name":"Heidrun Inger Wergeland"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cyclopterus lumpus"},{"word":"amplicon"},{"word":"aquaculture"},{"word":"fish farm"},{"word":"fish pathogens"},{"word":"flow-thorough"},{"word":"lumpfish"},{"word":"microbial community"}]},"article66":{"pmid":"31354669","title":"Longitudinal Survey of Fungi in the Human Gut: ITS Profiling, Phenotyping, and Colonization.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The fungal component of the intestinal microbiota of eight healthy subjects was studied over 12 months using metagenome survey and culture-based approaches.

The biodiversity of fungal communities was lower and characterized by greater unevenness, when compared to bacterial microbiome. The dissimilarities both among subjects and over the time within the same subject suggested that most of the fungi passed through the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) without becoming stable colonizers.

Candida albicans isolates dominated among the cultivable mycobiota and longitudinally persisted, likely as commensals inhabiting the intestine or regularly reaching it from Candida-colonized districts, such as the oral cavity.

Phenotyping of fungal isolates indicated that C. albicans adhered to human epithelial cells more efficiently and produced greater amounts of biofilm in vitro than non-albicans Candida (NAC) and non-Candida fungi (NCF). The C. albicans isolates also induced the highest release of HBD-2 by human epithelial cells, further differing from NAC and NCF. Nine representative isolates were administered to mice to evaluate the ability to colonize the intestine. Only two out of three C. albicans strains persisted in stools of animals 2 weeks after the end of the oral administration, whereas NAC and NCF did not. These results confirm the allochthonous nature of most the intestinal fungi, while C. albicans appears to be commonly involved in stable colonization. A combination of specific genetic features in the microbe and in the host likely allow colonization from fungi normally present solely as passengers. It remains to be established if other species identified as potential colonizers, in addition to Candida, are true inhabitants of the GIT or rather reach the intestine spreading from other body districts.","authors":[{"name":"Stefano Raimondi"},{"name":"Alberto Amaretti"},{"name":"Caterina Gozzoli"},{"name":"Marta Simone"},{"name":"Lucia Righini"},{"name":"Francesco Candeliere"},{"name":"Paola Brun"},{"name":"Andrea Ardizzoni"},{"name":"Bruna Colombari"},{"name":"Simona Paulone"},{"name":"Ignazio Castagliuolo"},{"name":"Duccio Cavalieri"},{"name":"Elisabetta Blasi"},{"name":"Maddalena Rossi"},{"name":"Samuele Peppoloni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"colonization"},{"word":"fungi"},{"word":"gut microbiota"},{"word":"metagenomics"}]},"article67":{"pmid":"31354667","title":"A Novel Two-Component System, Encoded by the sco5282/sco5283 Genes, Affects Streptomyces coelicolor Morphology in Liquid Culture.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Streptomyces are mycelial bacteria adapted to grow in soil. They have become important producers of biomolecules with medical applications, but their growth in industrial fermenters is challenged by their peculiar morphology in liquid culture: the hyphae tend to clump and grow as large pellets, which are oxygen- and nutrient-limited, grow slowly and present diminished protein production. Here, by implementing an experimental evolution strategy, a S. coelicolor strain, 2L12, with dispersed morphology and reduced pellet size in liquid culture and no defects in either differentiation or secondary metabolism was selected. Genome sequencing revealed a single amino acid substitution in a sensor kinase, Sco5282, of unknown function to be responsible for the morphological changes. Moreover, genetic and biochemical scrutiny identified Sco5283 as the cognate response regulator and demonstrated that the acquired mutation activates this two-component system. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of the mutant strain revealed changes in expression of genes involved in central processes such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, stress-signaling pathways, proteins secretion and cell envelope metabolism. Thus a novel two-component system is proposed to play a key role in the control of Streptomyces extracellular metabolism.","authors":[{"name":"Erick Eligio Arroyo-Pérez"},{"name":"Gabriela González-Cerón"},{"name":"Gloria Soberón-Chávez"},{"name":"Dimitris Georgellis"},{"name":"Luis Servín-González"}],"keywords":[{"word":"HAMP domain"},{"word":"Streptomyces"},{"word":"aggregation"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"morphology"},{"word":"two-component systems"}]},"article68":{"pmid":"31354661","title":"EtcABC, a Putative EII Complex, Regulates Type 3 Fimbriae via CRP-cAMP Signaling in Klebsiella pneumoniae.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biofilm formation by Klebsiella pneumoniae on indwelling medical devices increases the risk of infection. Both type 1 and type 3 fimbriae are important factors in biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae. We found that a putative enzyme II (EII) complex of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS), etcA (EIIA)-etcB (EIIB)-etcC (EIIC), regulated biofilm and type 3 fimbriae formation by K. pneumoniae STU1. In this study, the regulatory mechanism of etcABC in K. pneumoniae type 3 fimbriae formation was investigated. We found via quantitative RT-PCR that overexpression of etcABC enhanced the transcription level of the mrk operon, which is involved in type 3 fimbriae synthesis, and reduced the transcription level of the fim operon, which is involved in type 1 fimbriae synthesis. To gain further insight into the role of etcABC in type 3 fimbriae synthesis, we analyzed the region upstream of the mrk operon and found the potential cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) binding site. After crp was deleted in K. pneumoniae STU1 and two clinical isolates, these three crp mutant strains could not express MrkA, the major subunit of the fimbrial shaft, indicating that CRP positively regulated type 3 fimbriae synthesis. Moreover, a crp mutant overexpressing etcABC could not express MrkA, indicating that the regulation of type 3 fimbriae by etcABC was dependent on CRP. In addition, deletion of cyaA, which encodes the adenylyl cyclase that synthesizes cAMP, and deletion of crr, which encodes the glucose-specific EIIA, led to a reduction in lac operon regulation and therefore bacterial lactose uptake in K. pneumoniae. Exogenous cAMP but not etcABC overexpression compensated for the role of cyaA in bacterial lactose uptake. However, either etcABC overexpression or exogenous cAMP compensated for the role of crr in bacterial lac operon regulation that would eventually restore lactose uptake. We also found via ELISA and the luxCDABE reporter system that overexpression of etcABC increased intracellular cAMP levels and the transcription level of crp, respectively, in K. pneumoniae. In conclusion, overexpression of etcABC positively regulated cAMP production and cAMP-CRP activity to activate the mrk operon, resulting in increased type 3 fimbriae synthesis in K. pneumoniae.","authors":[{"name":"Novaria Sari Dewi Panjaitan"},{"name":"Yu-Tze Horng"},{"name":"Shih-Wen Cheng"},{"name":"Wen-Ting Chung"},{"name":"Po-Chi Soo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CRP-cAMP"},{"word":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"carbohydrate phosphotransferase system"},{"word":"type 3 fimbriae"}]},"article69":{"pmid":"31354652","title":"Effects of Hardwood Biochar on Methane Production, Fermentation Characteristics, and the Rumen Microbiota Using Rumen Simulation.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biochar is a novel carbonized feed additive sourced from pyrolyzed biomass.

Xoo produces a range of virulence-related factors to facilitate its pathogenesis in rice, however, the regulatory mechanisms of Xoo virulence expression have been not fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed that virulence factor production is regulated via cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) signaling pathway that is well-conserved in Xoo and other Xanthomonas species. A set of GGDEF, EAL, HD-GYP, and PilZ domain proteins with diverse signal sensory domains for c-di-GMP synthesis, hydrolysis, and binding is encoded in the Xoo genome. Bioinformatic, genetic, and biochemical analysis has identified an array of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), as well as degenerate GGDEF/EAL, PilZ domain proteins along with a transcription regulator. These signaling components have been characterized to regulate various bacterial cellular processes, such as virulence, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, biofilm formation, motility, and adaptation at the transcriptional, post-translational, and protein-protein interaction levels. This review summarized the recent progress in understanding the importance and complexity of c-di-GMP signaling in regulating bacterial virulence expression, highlighting the identified key signal elements and orthologs found in Xanthomonads, discussing the diverse functions of GGDEF/EAL/HD-GYP domains, existence of a complicated multifactorial network between DGCs, PDEs, and effectors, and further exploration of the new c-di-GMP receptor domains.

This study demonstrates that biocompatible fluorescent silicon-containing nanodots can be a multifunctional platform for simultaneously imaging and eliminating MRB and their biofilms. Ultrasmall epoxy group (oxirane)-functionalized organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of ≈31% are synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal treatment of an epoxy group-containing silane molecule, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, and an organic dye, rose bengal. The resultant OSiNDs can be employed as a universal imaging reagent for visualizing various bacteria/biofilms, including MRB and their biofilms. Moreover, the epoxy group-terminated OSiNDs can be conjugated with amine-containing reagents only via the simple stirring of the mixtures at an elevated temperature (e.g., 60 °C) for several hours (e.g., 3 h) without the addition of activating reagents. The amine-containing antibiotic vancomycin (Van) can thus be easily conjugated with the OSiNDs, and the obtained OSiNDs-Van can successfully inhibit the growth of MRB and even eliminate their biofilms.

However, little information is available highlighting the responses of multi-species biofilms in terms of their physicochemical structure and bacterial community induced by phthalate esters. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a model phthalate eater, was selected to treat multi-species biofilm aggregates, including an attached biofilm from a moving bed bioreactor (MBBR), a periphytic biofilm from a natural source and activated sludge in short-term exposure experiments (120 h). The production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from the three biofilms initially decreased and then slightly increased after exposure to DEHP, consistent with the variation of the most dominant fluorescent compounds consisting of humic-acid-like organic substances. The MBBR and periphytic biofilms secreted more fluorescence compounds than the activated sludge during the exposure period. The organic matter in the EPS was converted into smaller molecules, while limited variation was observed in the functional groups and secondary protein structures. Acinetobacter and Bacillus demonstrated significant increases and were likely the key genera responsible for DEHP degradation. The combined use of spectral, chromatographic and sequencing analyses indicated that the periphytic biofilm was more resistant to DEHP, possibly owing to the presence of more mature assemblages, including cells with higher metabolic activity and a higher diversity within the bacterial community.

The effect observed does not depend on the type of antibiotic but is influenced by its concentration. Moreover, in dual-species biofilms it was necessary to increase gentamicin concentration to obtain a similar killing effect as occurs in mono-species.

Digestion of the sludge substrates generates heat, which is retained within the reactor resulting in elevation of the reactor temperature to 70-75 °C. During the process, deamination of proteinaceous materials also occurs resulting in liberation of ammonia and elevation of pH to typically pH 8.4. These conditions result in a unique microbial consortium, which undergoes considerable dynamic change during the heat-up and holding phases. The change in pH and substrate as digestion occurs also contributes to this dynamic change. Because the large reactors are not optimized for aeration, and because low oxygen solubility at elevated temperatures occurs, there are considerable numbers of anaerobes recovered which also contributes to the overall digestion. As the reactors are operated in a semi-continuous mode, the reactors are rarely washed, resulting in considerable biofilm formation. Equally, because of the fibrous nature of the sludge, fiber adhering organisms are frequently found which play a major role in the overall digestion process. Here, we review molecular tools needed to examine the ATAD sludge consortia, what has been determined through phylogenetic analysis of the consortia and the nature of the dynamics occurring within this unique fermentation environment.","authors":[{"name":"J Tony Pembroke"},{"name":"Michael P Ryan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ATAD"},{"word":"Class A biosolids"},{"word":"digestion"}]},"article89":{"pmid":"31349530","title":"Antibiotics drug release controlling and osteoblast adhesion from Titania nanotubes arrays using silk fibroin coating.","date":"2020-01-29","abs":"Bacterial infection, wide inflammation, and osteoporosis are the most common factors in the failure of orthopedic implants.

We used acid-killing assays, glycolytic rate assessments, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) formation tests to detect whether srtA deletion influenced S. mutans acid tolerance/production and glucan formation. Comparisons between RNA-sequencing data from both the exponential and stationary phases of UA159 and the srtA-deleted strain were made to determine the impact of srtA knockout on S. mutans genomic transcription. Results of our assays indicated that S. mutans aciduricity was enhanced in the srtA deleted strain when bacterial cells were directly subjected to pH 2.8, but the enhancement was repressed when the acid tolerance response was induced in advance. The srtA mutation strain exhibited reduced EPS formation in mature biofilms. SrtA deletion led to pleiotropic changes in the S. mutans transcriptome with a growth phase-dependent pattern. The affected genes mainly included those involved in aciduricity, carbohydrate transport, and EPS formation. It was concluded that S. mutans srtA exhibited multiple effects on the virulence traits of this pathogen, including acid tolerance and glucan formation, and that these alterations could be partially due to transcriptional changes upon loss of srtA.","authors":[{"name":"Xuan Chen"},{"name":"Chengcheng Liu"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Yuanli He"},{"name":"Haixia Liu"},{"name":"Ying Song"},{"name":"Kaixin Xiong"},{"name":"Ling Zou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"srtA"},{"word":"Sortase A"},{"word":"acid tolerance"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides production"},{"word":"transcriptome"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"31342619","title":"Biofilm formation as a microbial strategy to assimilate particulate substrates.","date":"2020-03-18","abs":"In most ecosystems, a large part of the organic carbon is not solubilized in the water phase.

Transcription analysis by RT-qPCR showed that cadmium exposure to planktonic and biofilm cells induced the expression of the urf2 gene and the mercuric reductase encoding merA gene, which belong to the Tn501/Tn21 mer operon. After exposure to cadmium, the cadA gene involved in cadmium resistance was equally upregulated in both lifestyles. Bioinformatic analysis and complementation assays indicated that the protein encoded by the urf2 gene is a functional phosphodiesterase (PDE) involved in the c-di-GMP metabolism. We propose to rename the urf2 gene as mrp gene for metal regulated PDE. An increase of the second messenger c-di-GMP content by the heterologous expression of the constitutively active diguanylate cyclase PleD correlated with an increase in biofilm formation and cadmium susceptibility. These results indicate that the response to cadmium in C. metallidurans CH34 inhibits the initiation of biofilm lifestyle and involves a decrease in c-di-GMP levels and a novel metal regulated PDE.","authors":[{"name":"Pablo Alviz-Gazitua"},{"name":"Sebastián Fuentes-Alburquenque"},{"name":"Luis A Rojas"},{"name":"Raymond J Turner"},{"name":"Nicolas Guiliani"},{"name":"Michael Seeger"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cupriavidus metallidurans"},{"word":"PleD"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"cadmium"},{"word":"mer gene"},{"word":"phosphodiesterase"},{"word":"urf2 gene"}]},"article137":{"pmid":"31338071","title":"Two FtsH Proteases Contribute to Fitness and Adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Clone C Strains.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmental bacterium and a nosocomial pathogen with clone C one of the most prevalent clonal groups.

In the aquatic isolate P. aeruginosa SG17M, the core genome copy ftsH1 significantly affects growth and dominantly mediates a broad range of phenotypes, such as secretion of secondary metabolites, swimming and twitching motility and resistance to aminoglycosides, while the PACGI-1 xenolog ftsH2 backs up the phenotypes in the ftsH1 mutant background. The two proteins, with conserved motifs for disaggregase and protease activity present in FtsH1 and FtsH2, have the ability to form homo- and hetero-oligomers with ftsH2 distinctively expressed in the late stationary phase of growth. However, mainly FtsH1 degrades a major substrate, the heat shock transcription factor RpoH. Pull-down experiments with substrate trap-variants inactive in proteolytic activity indicate both FtsH1 and FtsH2 to interact with the inhibitory protein HflC, while the phenazine biosynthesis protein PhzC was identified as a substrate of FtsH1.

The aim of this study is to develop a novel antibacterial root canal sealer by incorporating DMADDM into EndoREZ and investigate the properties of the resulting material. Different mass fractions (0, 1.25%, 2.5%, and 5%) of DMADDM were incorporated into EndoREZ and the cytotoxicity, apical sealing ability and solubility of the resulting material were evaluated. Furthermore, a direct contact test, determination of colony-forming units, a crystal violet assay, scanning electronic microscopy and live/dead bacteria staining were performed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the sealer to multispecies bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Lactobacillus acidophilus), in planktonic cells or biofilms. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were carried out to assess the composition of the multispecies biofilms. No difference on the cytotoxicity, apical sealing ability and solubility between sealers containing DMADDM (1.25%, 2.5%) and EndoREZ (0%) could be determined. However, when the mass fraction of DMADDM increased to 5%, significantly different properties were found compared to the 0% (p < 0.05) group. Moreover, incorporating DMADDM into the sealer could greatly improve the antibacterial properties of EndoREZ. In addition, the composition ratio of E. faecalis could be decreased in multispecies microecology in sealers containing DMADDM. Therefore, a EndoREZ sealer material containing DMADDM could be considered useful in clinical applications for preventing and treating persistent apical periodontitis.","authors":[{"name":"Dan Liu"},{"name":"Xian Peng"},{"name":"Suping Wang"},{"name":"Qi Han"},{"name":"Bolei Li"},{"name":"Xinxuan Zhou"},{"name":"Biao Ren"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Mingyun Li"},{"name":"Xuedong Zhou"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"}],"keywords":[]},"article139":{"pmid":"31336838","title":"Candida albicans-Cell Interactions Activate Innate Immune Defense in Human Palate Epithelial Primary Cells via Nitric Oxide (NO) and β-Defensin 2 (hBD-2).","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"The presence of Candida albicans in the biofilm underlying the dental prosthesis is related to denture stomatitis (DS), an inflammatory reaction of the oral mucosa.

We further determined whether or not these effects were correlated with fungal invasion of epithelial cells.

We found that the hyphae supernatants were sufficient to induce slight HPEC apoptosis, which occurred prior to the activation of the specific mechanisms of epithelial defense. The epithelial defense responses were found to occur via NO and antimicrobial peptide hBD-2 production only during direct contact between C. albicans and HPECs and coincided with the fungus's intraepithelial invasion. However, although the hBD-2 levels remained constant in the HPEC supernatants over time, the NO release and hBD-2 gene expression were reduced at a later time (10 h), indicating that the epithelial defense capacity against the fungal invasion was not maintained in later phases.

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to elucidate the effect of toxic metals on growth, the activities of ROS (reactive oxygen species)-scavenging enzymes, and gene expression of Medicago sativa grown under different metal and/or inoculation treatments. The results showed that, besides reducing biomass, heavy metals negatively affected physiological parameters such as chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange, while increasing ROS-scavenging enzyme activities. Inoculation of M. sativa with a bacterial consortium of heat- and metallo-resistant bacteria alleviated metal stress, as deduced from the improvement of growth, lower levels of antioxidant enzymes, and increased physiological parameters. The bacteria were able to effectively colonize and form biofilms onto the roots of plants cultivated in the presence of metals, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Results also evidenced the important role of glutathione reductase (GR), phytochelatin synthase (PCS), and metal transporter NRAMP1 genes as pathways for metal stress management, whereas the gene coding for cytochrome P450 (CP450) seemed to be regulated by the presence of the bacteria. These outcomes showed that the interaction of metal-resistant rhizobacteria/legumes can be used as an instrument to remediate metal-contaminated soils, while cultivation of inoculated legumes on these soils is still safe for animal grazing, since inoculation with bacteria diminished the concentrations of heavy metals accumulated in the aboveground parts of the plants to below toxic levels.","authors":[{"name":"Anas Raklami"},{"name":"Khalid Oufdou"},{"name":"Abdel-Ilah Tahiri"},{"name":"Enrique Mateos-Naranjo"},{"name":"Salvadora Navarro-Torre"},{"name":"Ignacio D Rodríguez-Llorente"},{"name":"Abdelilah Meddich"},{"name":"Susana Redondo-Gómez"},{"name":"Eloísa Pajuelo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"PGPR"},{"word":"ROS-scavenging enzymes"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"heavy metal stress"},{"word":"legumes"},{"word":"rhizobia"},{"word":"scanning electron microscopy"},{"word":"stress related genes"}]},"article142":{"pmid":"31336660","title":"Understanding Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Profiles of Salmonella Biofilm and Planktonic Bacteria Challenged with Disinfectants Commonly Used During Poultry Processing.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella that survive cleaning and disinfection during poultry processing are a public health concern because pathogens that survive disinfectants have greater potential to exhibit resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants after their initial disinfectant challenge.

Over a period of 636 days, chemical oxygen demand removal over 90% and complete nitrification were achieved for both the control and tigecycline-exposed reactors, and effluent tigecycline concentrations in the tigecycline-exposed system were always <0.051 mg/L.

The increase of resistome in the tigecycline system was mainly attributed to the enrichment of tetX, one cooperative tetracycline degrading gene. Partial canonical correspondence analysis showed that the change of resistome was mainly driven by bacterial community shift (vertical pathway). Network and genome binning analyses further suggested that the proliferation of Flavobacterium harboring tetX contributed to a relatively low community-wide resistance development in the aerobic biofilm microbiota under tigecycline selection by reducing the antibiotic concentration.

To identify DBP, chewable double-staining disclosing tablets were used. The results of the present study indicate the following: (1) Age and socioeconomic status seem to be associated with DBP development, particularly in the oral cavity. (2) Overweight schoolchildren show more DBP on the upper posterior occlusal and upper posterior buccal surfaces compared to normal-weight children. (3) Moderate caries disease is associated with DBP detection on almost all tooth surfaces and especially on the tongue and lower anterior labial surface. (4) Severe caries disease is most strongly associated with DBP in the upper posterior palatal, lower posterior buccal, and lower posterior lingual spaces, as well as on the tongue.

These infections have been epidemiologically connected to ingestion of contaminated reconstituted powder infant formula. Even at low water activity C. sakazakii can survive for a long time; it is capable of protective biofilm formation and occasionally shows high virulence and pathogenicity even following stressful environmental conditions. Hence it is a challenging task for the food industry to control contamination of food ingredients and products through the entire production chain, since an increasing number of severe food-related outbreaks of C. sakazakii infections has been observed. The seemingly great capability of C. sakazakii to survive even strict countermeasures combined with its prevalence in many food ingredients requires a greater in depth understanding of its virulence factors to master the food safety issues related to this organism. In this context, we present the whole genome sequence (WGS) of two different C. sakazakii isolated from skimmed milk powder (C7) and ready-to-eat salad mix (C8), respectively. These are compared to other, already sequenced, C. sakazakii genomes. Sequencing of the fusA allele revealed that both isolates were C. sakazakii. We investigated the molecular characteristics of both isolates relevant for genes associated with pathogenesis and virulence factors, resistance to stressful environmental conditions (e.g., osmotic and heat), survival in desiccation as well as conducted a comparative genomic analysis. By using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), the genetic type of both isolates is assessed and the number of unique genes is determined. DNA of C. sakazakii C8 is shown to hold a novel and unique sequence type; the number of unique genes identified in the genomic sequence of C. sakazakii C7 and C8 were 109 and 188, respectively. Some of the determined unique genes such as the rhs and VgrG genes are linked to the Type VI Secretion System cluster, which is associated with pathogenicity and virulence factors.

In the reactor with low residual ozone concentration (0.45 mg/L), the amount of loosely bound (LB)-extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the activated sludge decreased by 23.23%, while the amount of tightly bound (TB)-EPS increased by 129.16% compared to the none-ozone residual reactor.

Bacteria respond to daptomycin by altering their cell envelopes to either decrease antibiotic binding to the membrane or by diverting binding away from septal targets. In Enterococcus faecalis, daptomycin resistance is typically coordinated by the three-component cell envelope stress response system, LiaFSR. Here, studying a clinical strain of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium containing alleles associated with activation of the LiaFSR signaling pathway, we found that specific environments selected for different evolutionary trajectories, leading to high-level daptomycin resistance. Planktonic environments favored pathways that increased cell surface charge via yvcRS upregulation of dltABCD and mprF, causing a reduction in daptomycin binding. Alternatively, environments favoring complex structured communities, including biofilms, evolved both diversion and repulsion strategies via divIVA and oatA mutations, respectively. Both environments subsequently converged on cardiolipin synthase (cls) mutations, suggesting the importance of membrane modification across strategies. Our findings indicate that E. faecium can evolve diverse evolutionary trajectories to daptomycin resistance that are shaped by the environment to produce a combination of resistance strategies. The accessibility of multiple and different biochemical pathways simultaneously suggests that the outcome of daptomycin exposure results in a polymorphic population of resistant phenotypes, making E. faecium a recalcitrant nosocomial pathogen.","authors":[{"name":"Amy G Prater"},{"name":"Heer H Mehta"},{"name":"Abigael J Kosgei"},{"name":"William R Miller"},{"name":"Truc T Tran"},{"name":"Cesar A Arias"},{"name":"Yousif Shamoo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus"},{"word":"adaptive resistance"},{"word":"drug resistance evolution"}]},"article158":{"pmid":"31331957","title":"Peptidyl-Prolyl Isomerase ppiB Is Essential for Proteome Homeostasis and Virulence in Burkholderia pseudomallei.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a disease endemic to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Mortality rates in these areas are high even with antimicrobial treatment, and there are few options for effective therapy. Therefore, there is a need to identify antibacterial targets for the development of novel treatments. Cyclophilins are a family of highly conserved enzymes important in multiple cellular processes. Cyclophilins catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of xaa-proline bonds, a rate-limiting step in protein folding which has been shown to be important for bacterial virulence. B. pseudomallei carries a putative cyclophilin B gene, ppiB, the role of which was investigated. A B. pseudomalleiΔppiB (BpsΔppiB) mutant strain demonstrates impaired biofilm formation and reduced motility. Macrophage invasion and survival assays showed that although the BpsΔppiB strain retained the ability to infect macrophages, it had reduced survival and lacked the ability to spread cell to cell, indicating ppiB is essential for B. pseudomallei virulence. This is reflected in the BALB/c mouse infection model, demonstrating the requirement of ppiB for in vivo disease dissemination and progression. Proteomic analysis demonstrates that the loss of PpiB leads to pleiotropic effects, supporting the role of PpiB in maintaining proteome homeostasis. The loss of PpiB leads to decreased abundance of multiple virulence determinants, including flagellar machinery and alterations in type VI secretion system proteins. In addition, the loss of ppiB leads to increased sensitivity toward multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and doxycycline, highlighting ppiB inhibition as a promising antivirulence target to both treat B. pseudomallei infections and increase antibiotic efficacy.","authors":[{"name":"Nicole M Bzdyl"},{"name":"Nichollas E Scott"},{"name":"Isobel H Norville"},{"name":"Andrew E Scott"},{"name":"Timothy Atkins"},{"name":"Stanley Pang"},{"name":"Derek S Sarovich"},{"name":"Geoffrey Coombs"},{"name":"Timothy J J Inglis"},{"name":"Charlene M Kahler"},{"name":"Mitali Sarkar-Tyson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia pseudomallei"},{"word":"cyclophilins"},{"word":"virulence"}]},"article159":{"pmid":"31331920","title":"Antibiotics inhibit tumor and disease activity in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.","date":"2020-01-30","abs":"It has been proposed that CD4 T-cell responses to Staphylococcus aureus (SA) can inadvertently enhance neoplastic progression in models of skin cancer and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

In 6 of 8 patients, a malignant T-cell clone could be identified in lesional skin, and a significant decrease in the fraction of malignant T cells was observed following antibiotics but an otherwise unchanged treatment regimen.

Modulating the ratio between these three key players led to significant differences, not only in terms of ethanol and organic acid production, but also on the profile of volatile compounds, in comparison with natural communities. However, we observed that using an equal ratio of spores/cells of the three microbial strains during inoculation led to flavor profile and ethanol yield close to that obtained through the use of natural communities. Compartmentalization of metabolic tasks through the use of a biofilm cultivation device allows further improvement of the whole fermentation process, notably by increasing the amount of key components of the aroma profile of the fermented beverage (i.e., mainly phenylethyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, and 2-methyl-butanol) and reducing the amount of off-flavor compounds.

The ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB)-to-nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) activity ratios were determined for a series of granule sizes to understand the impact of mass diffusion limitation on the free ammonia (FA) inhibition of NOB. When dissolved oxygen (DO) limitation is the only mechanism for NOB suppression, the AOB:NOB ratio was usually found to increase with the granule size. However, the trend is reversed when FA has an inhibitory effect on NOB, as was observed in this study. The decrease in AOB:NOB ratio indicates that smaller granules, e.g. diameter <150 μm, are preferred for nitrite accumulation when high FA concentration is present, as in the partial nitritation process. The trend was further verified by observing the increase in the apparent inhibition coefficient as granule size increased. Indeed, this study for the first time quantified the effect of diffusion limitation on the apparent inhibition coefficient of NOB in aerobic granules. A mathematical model was then utilized to interpret the observed suppression of NOB and predicted that NOB suppression was only complete at the granule surface. The NOB that did survive in larger granules was forced to dwell within the granule interior, where the AOB growth declines due to DO diffusion limitation. This means FA inhibition can be taken advantage of as an effective means for NOB suppression in small granules or thin biofilms. Further, both FA inhibition and DO limitation were found to be required for the suppression of NOB in mainstream aerobic granules.","authors":[{"name":"Timothy R Kent"},{"name":"Yewei Sun"},{"name":"Zhaohui An"},{"name":"Charles B Bott"},{"name":"Zhi-Wu Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AOB:NOB"},{"word":"Continuous flow"},{"word":"Diffusion limitation"},{"word":"Free ammonia"},{"word":"Granule size"},{"word":"Partial nitritation"}]},"article165":{"pmid":"31330262","title":"Atractylodes lancea volatile oils attenuated helicobacter pylori NCTC11637 growth and biofilm.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"Atractylodes lancea is a traditional Chinese perennial herb, which has been used for treating gastrointestinal diseases in traditional medicine.

Firstly, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the volatile oils against H. pylori were determined using broth dilution method.

We have previously found that the highly conserved 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) has an indispensable role in paradoxically stabilizing Hfq-bound sRNAs and promoting their function in gene regulation in Escherichia coli. Here, we report that PNPase contributes to the degradation of specific short mRNA fragments, the majority of which bind Hfq and are derived from targets of sRNAs. Specifically, we found that these mRNA-derived fragments accumulate in the absence of PNPase or its exoribonuclease activity and interact with PNPase. Additionally, we show that mutations in hfq or in the seed pairing region of some sRNAs eliminated the requirement of PNPase for their stability. Altogether, our results are consistent with a model that PNPase degrades mRNA-derived fragments that could otherwise deplete cells of Hfq-binding sRNAs through pairing-mediated decay.","authors":[{"name":"Todd A Cameron"},{"name":"Lisa M Matz"},{"name":"Dhriti Sinha"},{"name":"Nicholas R De Lay"}],"keywords":[]},"article167":{"pmid":"31329623","title":"Risk factors for tooth loss in adults: A population-based prospective cohort study.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for tooth loss in an extended age group of adults over 4 years.

Impact of the drug and peptide co-administration on biofilm at different stages, i.e., during adhesion and 1-day old biofilm was compared to each of the agents used alone. Results revealed that the killing effects of all AMPs range from 13-100%. In contrast, MH and DOX at 1 and 5 μM showed no killing activity and instead stimulated growth of bacteria. DOX has better killing activity than MH. LFchimera displayed the strongest killing amongst the peptides. Checkerboard technique revealed that combining DOX and LFchimera yielded synergism. Confocal laser scanning microscopy further showed that the combination of DOX and LFchimera caused significant reduction of bacterial adhesion and reduction of biomass, average biofilm thickness and substratum biofilm coverage of 1-day old biofilm compared to DOX and LFchimera alone. In conclusion, LFchimera alone and in combination with DOX exhibited strong antibacterial and anti-biofilm property against A. actinomycetemcomitans.

The bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen which has been reported to cause nosocomial and chronic infections through biofilm formation and synthesis of several toxins and virulence factors. Furthermore, the formation of biofilm by P. aeruginosa is known as one of the resistance mechanisms against conventional antibiotics. Natural compounds from marine resources have become one of the simple, cost-effective, biocompatible and non-toxicity for treating P. aeruginosa biofilm-related infections. Furthermore, hybrid formulation with nanomaterials such as nanoparticles becomes an effective alternative strategy to minimize the drug toxicity problem and cytotoxicity properties. For this reason, the present study has employed chitosan oligosaccharide for the synthesis of chitosan oligosaccharide-capped gold nanoparticles (COS-AuNPs). The synthesized COS-AuNPs were then characterized by using UV-Visible spectroscopy, Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), and Energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX). The synthesized COS-AuNPs were applied for inhibiting P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Results have shown that COS-AuNPs exhibited inhibition to biofilm as well as eradication to pre-existing mature biofilm. Simultaneously, COS-AuNPs were also able to reduce bacterial hemolysis and different virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. Overall, the present study concluded that the hybrid nanoformulation such as COS-AuNPs could act as a potential agent to exhibit inhibitory properties against the P. aeruginosa pathogenesis arisen from biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Fazlurrahman Khan"},{"name":"Jang-Won Lee"},{"name":"Panchanathan Manivasagan"},{"name":"Dung Thuy Nguyen Pham"},{"name":"Junghwan Oh"},{"name":"Young-Mog Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiofilm"},{"word":"Chitosan oligosaccharide"},{"word":"Nanoparticles"},{"word":"P. aeruginosa"},{"word":"Pathogen"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article183":{"pmid":"31324782","title":"Active thrombin produced by the intestinal epithelium controls mucosal biofilms.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Proteolytic homeostasis is important at mucosal surfaces, but its actors and their precise role in physiology are poorly understood.

Specific inhibition of luminal thrombin activity causes macroscopic and microscopic damage as well as transcriptomic alterations of genes involved in host-microbiota interactions. Further, luminal thrombin inhibition impairs the spatial segregation of microbiota biofilms, allowing bacteria to invade the mucus layer and to translocate across the epithelium. Thrombin cleaves the biofilm matrix of reconstituted mucosa-associated human microbiota. Our results indicate that thrombin constrains biofilms at the intestinal mucosa.

Biofilms can establish themselves on virtually any accessible surface and lead to varying impacts ranging from infectious diseases to degradation of toxic chemicals. Biofilms exhibit high mechanical stiffness and are inherently tolerant to adverse conditions including the presence of antibiotics, pollutants, detergents, high temperature, changes in pH, etc. These features make biofilms resilient, which is beneficial for applications in dynamic environments such as bioleaching, bioremediation, materials production, and wastewater purification. We have recently described an easy and cost-effective method for 3D printing of bacteria and have extended this technology for 3D printing of genetically engineered Escherichia coli biofilms. Our 3D printing platform exploits simple alginate chemistry for printing of a bacteria-alginate bioink mixture onto calcium-containing agar surfaces, resulting in the formation of bacteria-encapsulating hydrogels with varying geometries. Bacteria in these hydrogels remain intact, spatially patterned, and viable for several days. Printing of engineered bacteria to produce inducible biofilms leads to formation of multilayered three-dimensional structures that can tolerate harsh chemical treatments. Synthetic biology and material science approaches provide the opportunity to append a wide range of useful functionalities to these 3D-printed biofilms.

To overcome these problems, in this study, a novel pilot-scale air-lift multilevel circulation membrane bioreactor (AMCMBR) was used to explore the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) while treating real ship sewage. Results indicated that the satisfactory removal efficiencies of COD and TN was achieved in the former stages (Re(COD) = 91.57% and 87.82%; Re(TN) = 77.17% and 81.19%). When HRT decreased to 4 h, the removal efficiencies of COD and TN was 86.93% and 70.49% respectively, which still met the strict IMO discharge standards. This mainly because the biofilm-assistant membrane filtration lead to the increase of physical removal rate. The high ratio of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)/mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) (i.e. 0.75) indicated a high biomass content in the attached sludge and resulted into perfect pollutants removal effort. The compliance rate of COD and TN was 100% and 89%, respectively, which indicated stable operation of the pilot-scale AMCMBR throughout the whole experiment. Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the abundance of β-Proteobacteria was a key microbial reason for TN removal. In addition, wavelet neural network (WNN) model was proved to be suitable to simulate and predict the COD and TN removal. These conclusions indicated that the pilot-scale AMCMBR technology is an effective way for real ship sewage treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Yuhang Cai"},{"name":"Xin Li"},{"name":"Asad A Zaidi"},{"name":"Yue Shi"},{"name":"Kun Zhang"},{"name":"Ruizhe Feng"},{"name":"Aqiang Lin"},{"name":"Chen Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)"},{"word":"Hydraulic retention time (HRT)"},{"word":"International maritime organization (IMO)"},{"word":"Marine domestic sewage"},{"word":"Pilot-scale air-lift multilevel circulation membrane bioreactor (AMCMBR)"},{"word":"Wavelet neural network (WNN)"}]},"article204":{"pmid":"31319164","title":"Comparison of different laser-based photochemical systems for periodontal treatment.","date":"2020-02-10","abs":"The main aim in periodontitis treatment is to remove supragingival and subgingival biofilm.

In this study, comparative genomic and phenotypic analysis were performed between X. citri subsp. citri (Xcc), one of the most studied pathogens within Xanthomonas, and X. arboricola pv. pruni (Xap), a pathogen which has aroused great interest in recent time. The work was aimed to find those elements that contribute to their host divergence despite the convergence in the symptoms that each species cause on Citrus spp. and Prunus spp., respectively.

Interestingly, deoxyribonuclease-I (DNase-I) has been empirically proved to be efficacious in improving the antibiotic susceptibility against biofilm-associated infections. DNase-I hydrolyzes the extracellular DNA, a key component of the biofilm responsible for the cell adhesion and strength. Moreover, silver sulfadiazine, a frontline therapy in burn wound infections, exhibits delayed wound healing due to fibroblast toxicity. In this study, a chitosan gel loaded with solid lipid nanoparticles of silver sulfadiazine (SSD-SLNs) and supplemented with DNase-I has been developed to reduce the fibroblast cytotoxicity and overcome the biofilm-imposed resistance. The extensive optimization using the Box-Behnken design (BBD) resulted in the formation of SSD-SLNs with a smooth surface as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and controlled release (83%) for up to 24 h. The compatibility between the SSD and other formulation excipients was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared, differential scanning calorimetry, and powder X-ray diffraction studies. Developed SSD-SLNs in combination with DNase-I inhibited around 96.8% of biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as compared to SSD with DNase-I (82.9%). In line with our hypothesis, SSD-SLNs were found to be less toxic (cell viability 90.3 ± 3.8% at 100 μg/mL) in comparison with SSD (Cell viability 76.9 ± 4.2%) against human dermal fibroblast cell line. Eventually, the results of the in vivo wound healing study showed complete wound healing after 21 days' treatment with SSD-SLNs along with DNase-I, whereas marketed formulations SSD and SSD-LSNs showed incomplete healing after 21 days. Data in hand suggest that the combination of SSD-SLNs with DNase-I is an effective treatment strategy against the biofilm-associated wound infections and accelerates wound healing.","authors":[{"name":"Krishna Kumar Patel"},{"name":"D Bhavya Surekha"},{"name":"Muktanand Tripathi"},{"name":"Md Meraj Anjum"},{"name":"M S Muthu"},{"name":"Ragini Tilak"},{"name":"Ashish Kumar Agrawal"},{"name":"Sanjay Singh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"DNase-I"},{"word":"SLNs"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"burn wounds"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"silver sulfadiazine"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"31318043","title":"Comparison of yeast species in the subgingival oral biofilm of individuals with type 2 diabetes and peri-implantitis and individuals with peri-implantitis without diabetes.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"There are no studies that have investigated the presence of yeasts in the subgingival oral biofilm (OB) of type-2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients with peri-implantitis.

The presence of biofilms and bacterial infection, as well as fungal infection, allergy, environmental pollutants, and smoking are considered as a possible environmental factors which are involved in etiology of CRS. Over the past few years, the presence of biofilms is indicated in more than 65% of chronic infections in humans. The most important goals of treatment in CRS include suppression of the infection, reduction of sinonasal inflammation, and maintenance of patent sinonasal passage drainage. CRS is generally treated with medical and surgical therapy. Antibiotics play a major role in the treatment of CRS and are often used to reduce the infectious component of CRS. Macrolide antibiotics are considered as a choice of treatment option as they have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in addition to usual antimicrobial effects. Clarithromycin is one of the macrolide which has shown beneficial effects for treating CRS.

Antibacterials at the peak plasmatic concentration of each drug were tested against biofilms grown on polystyrene surfaces. Biofilms were evaluated for biomass production, metabolic activity, carbohydrate and protein contents, proteolytic activity, ultrastructure, and tolerance to antifungals. CEF and AMOX enhanced biofilm production by C. albicans ATCC 10231, stimulating biomass production, metabolic activity, viable cell counts, and proteolytic activity, as well as increased biovolume and thickness of these structures. Nevertheless, AMOX induced more significant changes in C. albicans biofilms than CEF. In addition, it was shown that AMOX increased the amount of chitin in these biofilms, making them more tolerant to caspofungin. Finally, it was seen that, in response to AMOX, C. albicans biofilms produce Hsp70 - a protein with chaperone function related to stressful conditions.

Surprisingly, a knowledge deficit exists in regards to understanding the whole genome processes underway in plant transforming bacteria, irrespective of the species. To begin to address the issue, we undertook a temporal RNAseq-based profiling study of E. adhaerens OV14 in the presence/absence of Arabidopsis thaliana tissues. Following co-cultivation with root tissues, 2333 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were noted. Meta-analysis of the RNAseq data sets identified a clear shift from plasmid-derived gene expression to chromosomal-based transcription within the early stages of bacterium-plant co-cultivation. During this time, the number of differentially expressed prokaryotic genes increased steadily out to 7 days co-cultivation, a time at which optimum rates of transformation were observed. Gene ontology evaluations indicated a role for both chromosomal and plasmid-based gene families linked specifically with quorum sensing, flagellin production and biofilm formation in the process of EMT. Transcriptional evaluation of vir genes, housed on the pCAMBIA 5105 plasmid in E. adhaerens OV14 confirmed the ability of E. adhaerens OV14 to perceive and activate its transcriptome in response to the presence of 200 µM of acetosyringone.

When the surface-modified intramedullary Ti-pVAN pins are inserted into mouse femoral canals infected by bioluminescent Xen29 S. aureus, significantly reduced local bioluminescence along with mitigated blood markers for infection are detected compared to untreated Ti6Al4V pins over 21 days. Ti-pVAN pins retrieved after 21 days are confirmed with ∼20-fold reduction in adherent bacteria counts compared to untreated control, supporting the ability of surface-conjugated vancomycin in inhibiting periprosthetic S. aureus adhesion and colonization.","authors":[{"name":"Ben Zhang"},{"name":"Benjamin M Braun"},{"name":"Jordan D Skelly"},{"name":"David C Ayers"},{"name":"Jie Song"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"copper-catalyzed azide−alkyne cycloaddition"},{"word":"periprosthetic infection"},{"word":"surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization"},{"word":"vancomycin"}]},"article224":{"pmid":"31312915","title":"Quantification of microbial degradation activities in biological activated carbon filters by reverse stable isotope labelling.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biological activated carbon (BAC) filters are frequently used in drinking water production for removing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) via adsorption of organic compounds and microbial degradation.

The resistance of Candida albicans to traditional antifungal drugs has been increasing rapidly in recent years, and it brings a great challenge in clinical treatment. N-butylphthalide is originally extracted from the seed of Apium graveolens and is currently used for the treatment of ischemic stroke in the clinic. This study demonstrated that n-butylphthalide exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 128 μg/ml; moreover, n-butylphthalide combined with fluconazole showed synergistic antifungal effects against resistant Candida albicans, resulting in a decrease in the minimum inhibitory concentrations of fluconazole from >512 to 0.25-1 μg/ml. Time-killing curves verified the antifungal activity in dynamic. Besides, n-butylphthalide exhibited anti-biofilm activity against Candida albicans, biofilms preformed <12 h with sessile minimum inhibitory concentrations of 128-256 μg/ml and synergism was observed when n-butylphthalide combined with fluconazole against resistant Candida albicans biofilms preformed <12 h, resulting in a decrease in the sessile minimum inhibitory concentrations of fluconazole from >1,024 to 0.5-8 μg/ml. Furthermore, in vitro antifungal effects of n-butylphthalide were confirmed in vivo. N-butylphthalide prolonged survival rate of larvae infected by Candida albicans, reduced the fungal burden in larvae and caused less damage to larval tissues. Notably, n-butylphthalide inhibited hyphal growth and induced intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation and a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, which was a potential antifungal mechanism. Besides, the synergistic effects between n-butylphthalide and fluconazole potentially relied on the mechanism that n-butylphthalide significantly promoted drug uptake, and suppressed drug efflux via down-regulating the drug transporter encoding genes CDR1 and CDR2. These findings demonstrated the antifungal effects and mechanisms of n-butylphthalide against Candida albicans for the first time, which might provide broad prospects for the identification of new potential antifungal targets.","authors":[{"name":"Ying Gong"},{"name":"Weiguo Liu"},{"name":"Xin Huang"},{"name":"Lina Hao"},{"name":"Yiman Li"},{"name":"Shujuan Sun"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"antifungal activity"},{"word":"fluconazole"},{"word":"n-butylphthalide"},{"word":"potential mechanism"}]},"article230":{"pmid":"31311876","title":"Endophytic Fungus Drives Nodulation and N","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Endophytic fungi play important roles in the modification of ecosystem productivity; however, the underlying mechanisms are only partly understood.

It is imperative to develop an alternative, yet effective and non-conventional therapeutic approach, popularly known as anti-infective therapy seems to be interesting. In this regard, targeting microbial QS associated virulence and biofilm development proves to be quite astonishing approach in counteracting the paucity of traditional antibiotics. A number of synthetic and natural compounds are exploited for their efficacy in combating QS associated microbial infections but the bioavailability and biocompatibility limit their widespread applications. In this context, the nanotechnological intervention offers a new paradigm for widespread biomedical applications starting from targeted drug delivery to diagnostics for the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, particularly to fight against microbial infections and antibiotics resistant biofilms. A wide range of nanomaterials starting from metallic nanoparticles to polymeric nanoparticles and recent advances in the development of carbon-based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), grapheme oxide (GO) also immensely exhibited intrinsic anti-infective properties when targeted towards microbial infections and associated MDR phenomenon.

It has been shown that a degree of the biofilm development on the tested dental materials depended on microorganism genus and species. Streptococcus mutans has demonstrated the best adhesion to the tested materials in comparison with Candida albicans and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. However, the sintered materials such as IPS e.max® and the polished IPS e.max® have showed the best anti-adhesive properties in relation to S. mutans and L. rhamnosus that have not formed the biofilm on the polished IPS e.max® sample. Furthermore, S. mutans have not formed the biofilm on both surfaces. On the contrary to S. mutans and L. rhamnosus, C. albicans has demonstrated the adhesive properties in relation to the above-mentioned surfaces. Moreover, in contrast to S. mutans and C. albicans, L. rhamnosus has not formed the biofilm on the polished IPS Empress material.","authors":[{"name":"Maciej Dobrzynski"},{"name":"Magdalena Pajaczkowska"},{"name":"Joanna Nowicka"},{"name":"Aleksander Jaworski"},{"name":"Piotr Kosior"},{"name":"Maria Szymonowicz"},{"name":"Piotr Kuropka"},{"name":"Zbigniew Rybak"},{"name":"Zdzislaw A Bogucki"},{"name":"Jaroslaw Filipiak"},{"name":"Sara Targonska"},{"name":"Aneta Ciupa-Litwa"},{"name":"Anna Han"},{"name":"Rafal J Wiglusz"}],"keywords":[]},"article248":{"pmid":"31308707","title":"Genetic characterization of two vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Kerman, Iran.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The aim of this study was the genetic characterization of two clinical vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) isolates.","authors":[{"name":"Mahsa Ziasistani"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Shakibaie"},{"name":"Davood Kalantar-Neyestanaki"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MLST"},{"word":"SCCmec"},{"word":"VRSA"},{"word":"agr type"},{"word":"spa"},{"word":"van operon"}]},"article249":{"pmid":"31308652","title":"Anticandidal activity of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles: effect on growth, cell morphology, and key virulence attributes of Candida species.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Jalal"},{"name":"Mohammad Azam Ansari"},{"name":"Mohammad A Alzohairy"},{"name":"Syed Ghazanfar Ali"},{"name":"Haris M Khan"},{"name":"Ahmad Almatroudi"},{"name":"Mohammad Imran Siddiqui"}],"keywords":[{"word":"LIVE/DEAD staining."},{"word":"ScAgNPs"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"germ tubes"},{"word":"hydrolytic enzymes"},{"word":"virulence factors"}]},"article250":{"pmid":"31308651","title":"Selenium nanoparticles as anti-infective implant coatings for trauma orthopedics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis: in vitro and in vivo assessment.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Phong A Tran"},{"name":"Neil O'Brien-Simpson"},{"name":"Jason A Palmer"},{"name":"Nathalie Bock"},{"name":"Eric C Reynolds"},{"name":"Thomas J Webster"},{"name":"Anand Deva"},{"name":"Wayne A Morrison"},{"name":"Andrea J O'Connor"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"implants"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"orthopedic"},{"word":"selenium"}]},"article251":{"pmid":"31308567","title":"Susceptibility pattern of tracheal tube isolates from Intensive Care Unit of Fauji Foundation Hospital Rawalpindi.","date":"2020-01-24","abs":"To determine the prevalence of resistant pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in an intensive care unit.","authors":[{"name":"Asim Ali Shah"},{"name":"Bushra Jamil"},{"name":"Sarah Naseem"},{"name":"Abdul Wadood Khan"},{"name":"Yasir Ali"},{"name":"Khalid Hussain"},{"name":"Shahid Ahmad Abbasi"}],"keywords":[{"word":" Nosocomial infections, Tracheal tubes, Antimicrobial resistance."}]},"article252":{"pmid":"31308427","title":"Molecular community profiling of the bacterial microbiota associated with denture-related stomatitis.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Denture-associated stomatitis (DS) affects over two-thirds of denture-wearers.

As reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mutagenic, the evolution of resistance to ciprofloxacin (CIP) in biofilms under oxidative stress conditions was investigated. We experimentally evolved six replicate populations of P. aeruginosa lacking the major catalase KatA in colony biofilms and stationary-phase cultures for seven passages in the presence of subinhibitory levels (0.1 mg/liter) of CIP or without CIP (eight replicate lineages for controls) under aerobic conditions. In CIP-evolved biofilms, a larger CIP-resistant subpopulation was isolated in the ΔkatA strain than in the wild-type (WT) PAO1 population, suggesting oxidative stress as a promoter of the development of antibiotic resistance. A higher number of mutations identified by population sequencing were observed in evolved ΔkatA biofilm populations (CIP and control) than in WT PAO1 populations evolved under the same conditions. Genes involved in iron assimilation were found to be exclusively mutated in CIP-evolved ΔkatA biofilm populations, probably as a defense mechanism against ROS formation resulting from Fenton reactions. Furthermore, a hypermutable lineage due to mutL inactivation developed in one CIP-evolved ΔkatA biofilm lineage. In CIP-evolved biofilms of both the ΔkatA strain and WT PAO1, mutations in nfxB, the negative regulator of the MexCD-OprJ efflux pump, were observed while in CIP-evolved planktonic cultures of both the ΔkatA strain and WT PAO1, mutations in mexR and nalD, regulators of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, were repeatedly found.

During the persistent phase, bacterial pathogens deploy many regulatory strategies to compensate unfavorable host environmental conditions. The stringent response is one of such gene regulatory mechanisms which is stimulated by nutrient starvation. It is regulated by the synthesis of highly phosphorylated signaling nucleotides, (p)ppGpp or alarmone. (p)ppGpp is synthesized by ppGpp synthetases, and these proteins are classified as RelA/SpoT homolog (RSH) proteins. Subsequently, (p)ppGpp modulate several molecular and biochemical processes ranging from transcription to metabolism. Imperativeness of (p)ppGpp synthetases has been investigated by numerous approaches including microbiology and animal studies, thereby establishing that Rel enzyme deleted strains of pathogenic bacteria were unable to transform in persister form. In this review, we summarize recent findings to corroborate the rationality to consider (p)ppGpp synthetase as a potential target in discovering a novel class of antimicrobial agents to combat persistent infections. Moreover, inhibition studies on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (p)ppGpp synthetase shows that these inhibitors prevent dormant state transition and biofilm formation.

These dynamics are further complicated by continuous exchange between sand and water habitats. Models of FIB and pathogen fate and transport at beaches can help predict the risk of infectious disease from beach use, but knowledge gaps with respect to decay and growth rates of pathogens in beach habitats impede robust modeling. Climatic variability adds further complexity to predictive modeling because extreme weather events, warming water, and sea level change may increase human exposure to waterborne pathogens and alter relationships between FIB and pathogens.

Sizes of a few hundreds of micrometres allow penetration of the biofilm inside the structure, but its development is limited by internal acidification. Consequently, pore sizes of a millimetre or so appear to be the most suitable. In addition, a simple theoretical approach is described to establish basis for porous microbial anode design.","authors":[{"name":"Poehere Chong"},{"name":"Benjamin Erable"},{"name":"Alain Bergel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bioanode"},{"word":"Bioelectrochemical system"},{"word":"Electroactive biofilm"},{"word":"Microbial fuel cell"},{"word":"Porosity"}]},"article273":{"pmid":"31300301","title":"Frequency and expression of genes involved in adhesion and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from periodontal lesions.","date":"2019-07-13","abs":"The aim of this study was to characterize the Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from periodontal lesions of patients, to determine the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion upon their infection of human epithelial cells using an in vitro model, its biofilm formation, and its resistance to antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Alina Uribe-García"},{"name":"Gloria Luz Paniagua-Contreras"},{"name":"Eric Monroy-Pérez"},{"name":"Jaime Bustos-Martínez"},{"name":"Aída Hamdan-Partida"},{"name":"Javier Garzón"},{"name":"Jesica Alanís"},{"name":"Rosalía Quezada"},{"name":"Felipe Vaca-Paniagua"},{"name":"Sergio Vaca"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotic-resistance"},{"word":"Human"},{"word":"In vitro infection model"},{"word":"Oral microbiota"}]},"article274":{"pmid":"31300167","title":"Effects of vibration on anammox-enriched biofilm in a high-loaded upflow reactor.","date":"2019-08-19","abs":"An upflow biofilm reactor was operated for 211 days to investigate the effects of vibration on anammox treatment performance.

First, we screened a compound library of 1018 FDA-approved drugs against Cryptococcus neoformans. Of 52 drugs possessing anti-Cryptococcus activity, eltrombopag was chosen due to its novel activity. The susceptibility of Cryptococcus against eltrombopag was then studied by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), while the synergy of eltrombopag with other drugs was tested by fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). Eltrombopag had a limited spectrum of antifungal activity against C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex (MICs of 0.125 mg/l), Candida glabrata (MIC, 0.25 mg/l), and Trichophyton rubrum (MIC, 0.5 mg/l). Eltrombopag affected cryptococcal virulence factors, including capsule and biofilm formation, melanin production, and growth ability at 37°C. Further, RNA sequencing and deletion mutant library screening experiments revealed that genes involved in the calcineurin pathway, lipid biosynthesis, membrane component, and transporter genes were associated with eltrombopag. In addition, eltrombopag showed synergism with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (FICI < 0.5) against Cryptococcus species. In conclusion, eltrombopag exhibited excellent antifungal activity against Cryptococcus species potentially via a mode of action which interferes with virulence factors and the calcineurin pathway, indicating that eltrombopag might be usefully repurposed as an antifungal agent for treating cryptococcosis.","authors":[{"name":"Hao-Tai Ko"},{"name":"Li-Hang Hsu"},{"name":"Sheng-Yung Yang"},{"name":"Ying-Lien Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"          Cryptococcus        "},{"word":"Antifungal agent"},{"word":"Calcineurin"},{"word":"Eltrombopag"}]},"article280":{"pmid":"31297368","title":"Sustained Release of Phosphates From Hydrogel Nanoparticles Suppresses Bacterial Collagenase and Biofilm Formation in vitro.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Intestinal disease or surgical intervention results in local changes in tissue and host-derived factors triggering bacterial virulence. A key phenotype involved in impaired tissue healing is increased bacterial collagenase expression which degrades intestinal collagen. Antibiotic administration is ineffective in addressing this issue as it inadvertently eliminates normal flora while allowing pathogenic bacteria to bloom and acquire antibiotic resistance. Compounds that could attenuate collagenase production while allowing commensal bacteria to proliferate normally would offer major advantages without the risk of the emergence of resistance. We have previously shown that intestinal phosphate depletion in the surgically stressed host is a major cue that triggers P. aeruginosa virulence which is suppressed under phosphate abundant conditions. Recent findings indicate that orally administered polyphosphate, hexametaphosphate, (PPi) suppresses collagenase, and biofilm production of P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens in animal models of intestinal injury but does not attenuate E. faecalis induced collagenolytic activity (Hyoju et al., 2017). Systemic administration of phosphates, however, is susceptible to rapid clearance. Given the diversity of collagenase producing bacteria and the variation of phosphate metabolism among microbial species, a combination therapy involving different phosphate compounds may be required to attenuate pathogenic phenotypes. To address these barriers, we present a drug delivery approach for sustained release of phosphates from poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) hydrogel nanoparticles. The efficacy of monophosphate (Pi)- and PPi-loaded NPs (NP-Pi and NP-PPi, respectively) and a combination treatment (NP-Pi + NP-PPi) in mitigating collagenase and biofilm production of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens expressing high collagenolytic activity was investigated. NP-PPi was found to significantly decrease collagenase and biofilm production of S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Treatment with either NP-Pi or NP-Pi + NP-PPi resulted in more prominent decreases in E. faecalis collagenase compared to NP-PPi alone. The combination treatment was also found to significantly reduce P. aeruginosa collagenase production. Finally, significant attenuation in biofilm dispersal was observed with NP-PPi or NP-Pi + NP-PPi treatment across all test pathogens. These findings suggest that sustained release of different forms of phosphate confers protection against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, thereby providing a promising treatment to attenuate expression of tissue-disruptive bacterial phenotypes without eradicating protective flora over the course of intestinal healing.","authors":[{"name":"Dylan Nichols"},{"name":"Marja B Pimentel"},{"name":"Fernando T P Borges"},{"name":"Sanjiv K Hyoju"},{"name":"Fouad Teymour"},{"name":"Seok Hoon Hong"},{"name":"Olga Y Zaborina"},{"name":"John C Alverdy"},{"name":"Georgia Papavasiliou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"collagenase"},{"word":"hydrogel"},{"word":"intestinal epithelium"},{"word":"microbes"},{"word":"monophosphate"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"polyphosphate"}]},"article281":{"pmid":"31297098","title":"Preventing Biofilm Formation by Dairy-Associated Bacteria Using Peptide-Coated Surfaces.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biofilm-forming bacteria, which colonize the surfaces of equipment in the dairy industry, may adversely affect the safety and quality of the milk and its products.

Thus, due to its clinical relevance, studies aiming to understand host-pathogen interactions in C. albicans infection are necessary. Therefore, we performed proteomic analysis using a murine model of serial systemic infection by C. albicans to evaluate possible changes in the protein profile of the pathogen over time. Firstly, we observed a reduction in the median survival time of infected animals with increasing passage number, suggesting a higher pathogenicity acquired during repeated infections. By LC-MS/MS, it was possible to obtain protein profiles from the wild-type strain (WT) and compare them to proteins extracted from Candida cells recovered from infected tissues during passages one, three, and four (P1, P3, and P4). We obtained 56, 29, and 97 proteins in P1, P3, P4, respectively, all varying in abundance. Regarding biological processes, the majority of proteins were related to carbohydrate metabolism, stress responses and amino acid metabolism. The proteins were also categorized according to their potential role in virulence traits, such as biofilm production, yeast-to-hyphae transition, phenotypic switching, proteins related to stress responses, and uncharacterized proteins.

In this study we characterized biofilm formation of five selected strains isolated from raw fermented dry sausages, upon different growth conditions. Four strains exhibited a biofilm positive phenotype with strain-dependent intensities. Biofilm formation of S. xylosus was influenced by the addition of glucose, sodium chloride and lactate to the growth medium, respectively. It was further dependent on strain-specific cell surface properties. Three strains exhibited hydrophobic and two hydrophilic cell surface properties. The biofilm positive hydrophilic strain TMW 2.1523 adhered significantly better to hydrophilic than to hydrophobic supports, whereas the differences in adherence to hydrophobic versus hydrophilic supports were not as distinct for the hydrophobic strains TMW 2.1023, TMW 2.1323, and TMW 2.1521. Comparative genomics enabled prediction of functional biofilm-related genes and link these to phenotypic variations. While a wide range of biofilm associated factors/genes previously described for S. aureus and S. epidermidis were absent in the genomes of the five strains analyzed, they all possess the gene encoding biofilm associated protein Bap. The only biofilm negative strain TMW 2.1602 showed a mutation in the bap sequence.

For this purpose, seven separate gene-specific knockout mutants were generated by homologous recombination in ocular E. coli. The genes that were mutated included three transmembrane genes ytfR (ABC transporter ATP-binding protein), mdtO (multidrug efflux system) and tolA (inner membrane protein), ryfA coding for non-coding RNA and three metabolic genes mhpA (3-3-hydroxyphenylpropionate 1,2-dioxygenase), mhpB (2,3-di hydroxyphenylpropionate 1,2-dioxygenase), and bdcR (regulatory gene of bdcA). Mutants were validated by sequencing and Reverse transcription-PCR and monitored for biofilm formation by XTT method and confocal microscopy. The antibiotic susceptibility of the mutants was also ascertained. The results indicated that biofilm formation was inhibited in five mutants (ΔbdcR, ΔmhpA, ΔmhpB, ΔryfA, and ΔtolA) and the thickness of biofilm reduced from 17.2 μm in the wildtype to 1.5 to 4.8 μm in the mutants. Mutants ΔytfR and ΔmdtO retained the potential to form biofilm. Complementation of the mutants with the wild type gene restored biofilm formation potential in all mutants except in ΔmhpB. The 5 mutants which lost their ability to form biofilm (ΔbdcR, ΔmhpA, ΔmhpB, ΔtolA, and ΔryfA) did not exhibit any change in their susceptibility to Ceftazidime, Cefuroxime, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, Cefotaxime, Sulfamethoxazole, Imipenem, Erythromycin, and Streptomycin in the planktonic phase compared to wild type ocular E. coli. But ΔmdtO was the only mutant with altered MIC to Sulfamethoxazole, Imipenem, Erythromycin, and Streptomycin both in the planktonic and biofilm phase. This is the first report demonstrating the involvement of the metabolic genes mhpA and mhpB and bdcR (regulatory gene of bdcA) in biofilm formation in ocular E. coli. In addition we provide evidence that tolA and ryfA are required for biofilm formation while ytfR and mdtO are not required.

Acneic strains of C. acnes form biofilms inside skin-gland hollows, inducing inflammation and skin disorders. The essential exogenous products of C. acnes accumulate in the extracellular matrix of the biofilm, conferring essential bacterial functions to this structure. However, little is known about the actual composition of the biofilm matrix of C. acnes. Here, we developed a new technique for the extraction of the biofilm matrix of Gram-positive bacteria without the use of chemical or enzymatic digestion, known to be a source of artifacts. Our method is based on the physical separation of the cells and matrix of sonicated biofilms by ultracentrifugation through a CsCl gradient. Biofilms were grown on the surface of cellulose acetate filters, and the biomass was collected without contamination by the growth medium. The biofilm matrix of the acneic C. acnes RT5 strain appears to consist mainly of polysaccharides. The following is the ratio of the main matrix components: 62.6% polysaccharides, 9.6% proteins, 4.0% DNA, and 23.8% other compounds (porphyrins precursors and other). The chemical structure of the major polysaccharide was determined using a nuclear magnetic resonance technique, the formula being →6)-α-D-Galp-(1→4)-β-D-ManpNAc3NAcA-(1→6)-α-D-Glcp-(1→4)-β-D-ManpNAc3NAcA-(1→3)-β-GalpNAc-(1→. We detected 447 proteins in the matrix, of which the most abundant were the chaperonin GroL, the elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G, several enzymes of glycolysis, and proteins of unknown function. The matrix also contained more than 20 hydrolases of various substrata, pathogenicity factors, and many intracellular proteins and enzymes. We also performed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy analysis of the C. acnes RT5 matrix for the first time, providing the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) profiles of the C. acnes RT5 biofilm matrix and biofilm biomass. The difference between the matrix and biofilm biomass spectra showed successful matrix extraction rather than simply the presence of cell debris after sonication. These data show the complexity of the biofilm matrix composition and should be essential for the development of new anti-C. acnes biofilms and potential antibiofilm drugs.","authors":[{"name":"Andrei V Gannesen"},{"name":"Evelina L Zdorovenko"},{"name":"Ekaterina A Botchkova"},{"name":"Julie Hardouin"},{"name":"Sebastien Massier"},{"name":"Dmitry S Kopitsyn"},{"name":"Maxim V Gorbachevskii"},{"name":"Alexandra A Kadykova"},{"name":"Alexander S Shashkov"},{"name":"Marina V Zhurina"},{"name":"Alexander I Netrusov"},{"name":"Yuriy A Knirel"},{"name":"Vladimir K Plakunov"},{"name":"Marc G J Feuilloley"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Cutibacterium acnes"},{"word":"Orbitrap mass spectrometry"},{"word":"biofilm matrix"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"nuclear magnetic resonance"},{"word":"polysaccharides"},{"word":"proteins"},{"word":"surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy"}]},"article301":{"pmid":"31293420","title":"Prospects for the Use of New Technologies to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The increasing use of antibiotics is being driven by factors such as the aging of the population, increased occurrence of infections, and greater prevalence of chronic diseases that require antimicrobial treatment.

The effects of this contamination on stream biota may be intensified in Mediterranean climate regions, which comprise a drought period that leads to flow reduction, and ultimately to stagnant pools. To assess individual and combined effects of flow stagnation and sewage contamination, biofilm and gastropod grazers were used in a 5-week experiment with artificial channels to test two flow velocity treatments (stagnant flow/basal flow) and two levels of organic contamination using artificial sewage (no sewage input/sewage input). Stressors' effects were determined on biofilm total biomass and chlorophyll (Chl) content, on oxygen consumption and growth rate of the grazers (Theodoxus fluviatilis), and on the interaction grazer-biofilm given by grazer's feeding activity (i.e., biofilm consumption rate). The single effect of sewage induced an increase in biofilm biomass and Chl-a content, simultaneously increasing both grazers' oxygen consumption and their feeding activity. Diatoms showed a higher sensitivity to flow stagnation, resulting in a lower content of Chl-c. Combined stressors interacted antagonistically for biofilm total biomass, Chl-b contents, and grazers's feeding rate. The effect of sewage increasing biofilm biomass and grazing activity was reduced by the presence of flow stagnation (antagonist factor). Our findings suggest that sewage contamination has a direct effect on the functional response of primary producers and an indirect effect on primary consumers, and this effect is influenced by water flow stagnation.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Raquel Calapez"},{"name":"Carmen L Elias"},{"name":"Salomé F P Almeida"},{"name":"António G Brito"},{"name":"Maria João Feio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chlorophyll, Mesocosms"},{"word":"Flow velocity"},{"word":"Grazing"},{"word":"Multiple stressors"},{"word":"Nutrients"},{"word":"Organic load"},{"word":"Primary productivity"}]},"article304":{"pmid":"31292785","title":"Antimicrobial efficacy of copper-doped titanium surfaces for dental implants.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"The aim of this in vitro study was to quantify the antibacterial effect of a copper-deposited titanium surface as a model for dental implants on the peri-implantitis-associated strain Porphyromonas gingivalis (DSM 20709). A spark-assisted anodization method in a combined deposition-anodization process was applied to deposit copper on discs made of titanium. This method allows the deposition of different concentrations of copper on the surface by varying the process time. Conventional culturing was used to investigate the adhesion of P. gingivalis onto the discs over 2, 4, and 6 h as well as to study the antibacterial effect of copper released in solution. The viability of the bacterial cells is strongly inhibited on copper-deposited discs and reaches a CFU reduction of 3 log-units after 6 h in comparison to the reference. The copper released in solution causes a reduction of 4 log-units after a 6 h incubation time. With a 6 h incubation time, the CFU count decreases with increasing copper concentrations on the disc (by 2% for the 1.3 µg/disc; 32% for the 5.6 µg/disc; and 34% for the 9.5 µg/disc). However, at a higher copper concentration of 17.7 µg/disc, after 6 h, the decrease in the CFU count is less pronounced than that observed in solution, where a further decrease is observed. In conclusion, copper-functionalized titanium significantly reduces the survival of adhered bacteria and decreases the viable bacterial count in the environment surrounding the titanium. Thus, the area surrounding implants is being protected by copper released from the surface, forming a safe zone for improved implant healing.","authors":[{"name":"Monika Astasov-Frauenhoffer"},{"name":"Sally Koegel"},{"name":"Tuomas Waltimo"},{"name":"Andrea Zimmermann"},{"name":"Cyril Walker"},{"name":"Irmgard Hauser-Gerspach"},{"name":"Christiane Jung"}],"keywords":[]},"article305":{"pmid":"31291978","title":"Comparative efficacy of linezolid and vancomycin for endotracheal tube MRSA biofilms from ICU patients.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"To compare the efficacy of systemic treatment with linezolid (LNZ) versus vancomycin (VAN) on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) burden and eradication in endotracheal tube (ETT) biofilm and ETT cuff from orotracheally intubated patients with MRSA respiratory infection.","authors":[{"name":"Laia Fernández-Barat"},{"name":"Ana Motos"},{"name":"Mauro Panigada"},{"name":"Francisco Álvarez-Lerma"},{"name":"Lucía Viña"},{"name":"Ruben Lopez-Aladid"},{"name":"Adrian Ceccato"},{"name":"Gianluigi Li Bassi"},{"name":"David P Nicolau"},{"name":"Yuli Lopez"},{"name":"Laura Muñoz"},{"name":"Laura Guerrero"},{"name":"Dolors Soy"},{"name":"Trinidad Israel"},{"name":"Pedro Castro"},{"name":"Antoni Torres"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Endotracheal tube"},{"word":"Linezolid"},{"word":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Respiratory infection"},{"word":"Vancomycin"}]},"article306":{"pmid":"31291645","title":"Phages in a thermoreversible sustained-release formulation targeting E. faecalis in vitro and in vivo.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Enterococcus faecalis is a key pathogen recovered from root canals when conventional treatment fails.

The nonsteady-state model predicts conditions that evolve to a steady state that is within 0.02-1% of the solution of the steady-state model, depending on the number of grid points used, confirming the algorithms are valid. Multiple steady states occur if, (1) a biofilm is exposed to a constant gas-phase pollution concentration, which exceeds or undershoots a certain threshold, (2) in a narrow range of parameter values and (3) provided that the pollutant degradation follows Haldane kinetics. Such a biofilm displays half-saturation (i.e., Michaelis-Menten)-like apparent (falsified) kinetics from a concentration range starting at zero up to the occurrence of a second steady state. Multiple steady states and falsified kinetics can negatively affect a biofilter and the experimental determination of kinetic parameters, respectively. Implications: The occurrence of multiple steady states in a VOC treating biofilm, shows the significant impact of degradation kinetics and diffusion limitation on the biofilm behavior. Moreover, the implied possible sudden drop of removal efficiency of a biofilter, based on the occurrence of multiple steady states lead to possible bottle-necks in biofilter application and operation.","authors":[{"name":"Michael Süß"},{"name":"Alex De Visscher"}],"keywords":[]},"article310":{"pmid":"31290730","title":"The Role of a Host-Induced Arginase of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in Promoting Virulence on Rice.","date":"2019-11-05","abs":"The plant bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae causes bacterial blight of rice, which is one of the most destructive rice diseases prevalent in Asia and parts of Africa.

The mechanisms underlying C. difficile community formation and inter-bacterial interactions are nevertheless poorly understood. C. difficile produces AI-2, a quorum sensing molecule that modulates biofilm formation across many bacterial species. We found that a strain defective in LuxS, the enzyme that mediates AI-2 production, is defective in biofilm development in vitro. Transcriptomic analyses of biofilms formed by wild type (WT) and luxS mutant (luxS) strains revealed a downregulation of prophage loci in the luxS mutant biofilms compared to the WT. Detection of phages and eDNA within biofilms may suggest that DNA release by phage-mediated cell lysis contributes to C. difficile biofilm formation. In order to understand if LuxS mediates C. difficile crosstalk with other gut species, C. difficile interactions with a common gut bacterium, Bacteroides fragilis, were studied. We demonstrate that C. difficile growth is significantly reduced when co-cultured with B. fragilis in mixed biofilms. Interestingly, the absence of C. difficile LuxS alleviates the B. fragilis-mediated growth inhibition. Dual species RNA-sequencing analyses from single and mixed biofilms revealed differential modulation of distinct metabolic pathways for C. difficile WT, luxS and B. fragilis upon co-culture, indicating that AI-2 may be involved in induction of selective metabolic responses in B. fragilis. Overall, our data suggest that C. difficile LuxS/AI-2 utilises different mechanisms to mediate formation of single and mixed species communities.","authors":[{"name":"Ross T Slater"},{"name":"Lucy R Frost"},{"name":"Sian E Jossi"},{"name":"Andrew D Millard"},{"name":"Meera Unnikrishnan"}],"keywords":[]},"article315":{"pmid":"31288991","title":"An evaluation of buffered peracetic acid as an alternative to chlorine and hydrogen peroxide based disinfectants.","date":"2020-03-11","abs":"This short report documents an in-use evaluation of three disinfectant solutions that was conducted within the operating theatre of a South Australian hospital to address a high occurrence of Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI).

Many studies have characterized the response of genetically identical cells to nutrient switches in homogeneous cultures; however, in nature, microbes often live in spatially structured groups such as biofilms where cells can create metabolic gradients by consuming and releasing nutrients. Consequently, cells experience different local microenvironments and vary in their phenotype. How does this phenotypic variation affect the ability of cells to cope with nutrient switches? Here, we address this question by growing dense populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers and studying a switch from glucose to acetate at the single-cell level. Before the switch, cells vary in their metabolic activity: some grow on glucose, while others cross-feed on acetate. After the switch, only few cells can resume growth after a period of lag.

We suggest that the other anti-DNABII antibodies, while not necessarily curative, reflect an immune response at some point in the donor's history to these components of biofilms. Such an immune response could reflect exposure to bacterial reservoirs that have been previously described in chronic non-healing wounds, periodontal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, colorectal cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerotic artery explants. The detection of anti-DNABII antibodies in all twenty surveyed donors with no active infection suggests that bacterial biofilm reservoirs may be present periodically in most healthy individuals.

While several studies have reported gut microbiota composition differences associated with obesity in humans, there has been a lack of consistency in the nature of the reported changes; it has been difficult to determine whether methodological differences between studies, underlying differences in the populations studied, or other factors are responsible for this discordance. Here we use 16 S rRNA data from previously published studies to explore how the gut microbiota-obesity relationship varies across heterogeneous Western populations, focusing mainly on the relationship between (1) alpha diversity and (2) Prevotella relative abundance with BMI. We provide evidence that the relationship between lower alpha diversity and higher BMI may be most consistent in non-Hispanic white (NHW) populations and/or those with high socioeconomic status, while the relationship between higher Prevotella relative abundance and BMI may be stronger among black and Hispanic populations. We further examine how diet may impact these relationships. This work suggests that gut microbiota phenotypes of obesity may differ with race/ethnicity or its correlates, such as dietary components or socioeconomic status. However, microbiome cohorts are often too small to study complex interaction effects and non-white individuals are greatly underrepresented, creating substantial challenges to understanding population-level patterns in the microbiome-obesity relationship. Further study of how population heterogeneity influences the relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity is warranted.","authors":[{"name":"Maggie A Stanislawski"},{"name":"Dana Dabelea"},{"name":"Leslie A Lange"},{"name":"Brandie D Wagner"},{"name":"Catherine A Lozupone"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Microbial communities"},{"word":"Microbiota"}]},"article331":{"pmid":"31285520","title":"A ParDE-family toxin antitoxin system in major resistance plasmids of Enterobacteriaceae confers antibiotic and heat tolerance.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems were initially discovered as plasmid addiction systems on low-copy-number plasmids.

M. tuberculosis and other mycobacterial species, such as M. smegmatis, are known to generate an inadequate amount of energy by substrate-level phosphorylation and mandatorily require oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for their growth and metabolism. Hence, antibacterial drugs, such as bedaquiline, targeting the multisubunit ATP synthase complex, which is required for OXPHOS, have been developed with the aim of eliminating pathogenic mycobacteria. Here, we explored the influence of suboptimal OXPHOS on the physiology and metabolism of M. smegmatisM. smegmatis harbors two identical copies of atpD, which codes for the β subunit of ATP synthase. We show that upon deletion of one copy of atpD (M. smegmatis ΔatpD), M. smegmatis synthesizes smaller amounts of ATP and enters into an energy-compromised state. The mutant displays remarkable phenotypic and physiological differences from the wild type, such as respiratory slowdown, reduced biofilm formation, lesser amounts of cell envelope polar lipids, and increased antibiotic sensitivity compared to the wild type. Additionally, M. smegmatis ΔatpD overexpresses genes belonging to the dormancy operon, the β-oxidation pathway, and the glyoxylate shunt, suggesting that the mutant adapts to a low energy state by switching to alternative pathways to produce energy. Interestingly, M. smegmatis ΔatpD shows significant phenotypic, metabolic, and physiological similarities with bedaquiline-treated wild-type M. smegmatis We believe that the identification and characterization of key metabolic pathways functioning during an energy-compromised state will enhance our understanding of bacterial adaptation and survival and will open newer avenues in the form of drug targets that may be used in the treatment of mycobacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Varsha Patil"},{"name":"Vikas Jain"}],"keywords":[{"word":"ATP synthase"},{"word":"Mycobacterium smegmatis"},{"word":"atpD"},{"word":"bedaquiline"},{"word":"electron transport chain"},{"word":"energy metabolism"},{"word":"mycobacteria"},{"word":"oxidative phosphorylation"}]},"article333":{"pmid":"31284989","title":"None","date":"2019-07-09","abs":"The main goal of this work was to approach food industry conditions in the comparison of the susceptibility of biofilms of Listeria monocytogenes to the biocides benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and peracetic acid (PAA).

In addition, the effect of Lactobacillus kefiri strains 8321 and 83113 and Lactobacillus plantarum 83114 and their surface proteins on biofilm development of Salmonella Enteritidis 115 was studied. The relationship between surface properties of bacteria (hydrophobicity, autoaggregation and coaggregation with lactobacilli) and biofilm formation was also investigated. Most of Salmonella strains were hydrophilic and five strains were moderately hydrophobic. In general, Salmonella strains showed high aggregation abilities (27-54%). S. Enteritidis 106 and S. Typhimurium 102 and 108 showed the highest percentages of autoaggregation. All Salmonella strains tested showed aggregation abilities with the three lactobacilli studied, but the percentage of coaggregation proved to be strain-specific. When comparing stainless steel, glass and polystyrene surfaces, higher levels of biofilm formation occurred on polystyrene plate than on glass surfaces or stainless steel. S. Enteritidis 115 exhibited the greatest attachment to polyestyrene surface. The preincubation or coincubation with the three lactobacilli strains significantly reduced (about 1 log CFU/ml of reduction) the ability of S. Enteritidis 115 to form biofilm compared to the control without lactobacilli. These results were confirmed by confocal microscopy. In the same way, when surface proteins extracted from lactobacilli strains were preincubated or coincubated with S.

While granular aggregates are increasingly used for applications in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment, their underlying mechanical properties are poorly understood. The challenges of viscoelastic characterization for these structures are due to their spherical geometry, spatially heterogeneous properties, and their delicate nature. In this study, we report a model-based approach for nondestructive characterization of viscoelastic properties (shear modulus and shear viscosity) of alginate spheres with different concentrations, which was motivated by our measurements in granular biofilms. The characterization technique relies on experimental measurements of circumferential elastic wave speeds as a function of frequency in the samples using the Optical Coherence Elastography (OCE) technique. A theoretical model was developed to estimate the viscoelastic properties of the samples from OCE data through inverse analysis. This work represents the first attempt to explore elastic waves for mechanical characterization of granular biofilms. The combination of the OCE technique and the theoretical model presented in this paper provides a framework that can facilitate quantitative viscoelastic characterization of samples with curved geometries and the study of the relationships between morphology and mechanical properties in granular biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Hong-Cin Liou"},{"name":"Fabrizio Sabba"},{"name":"Aaron I Packman"},{"name":"Alex Rosenthal"},{"name":"George Wells"},{"name":"Oluwaseyi Balogun"}],"keywords":[]},"article348":{"pmid":"31282384","title":"The bovine acute phase protein α","date":"2019-09-19","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus biofilm-related infections are of clinical concern due to the capability of bacterial colonies to adapt to a hostile environment.

According to the results, the combined conditioning increased both dewatering extent and dewatering rate with the water content as low as 57.79%. It was mainly attributed to the destruction of microbial cell wall and EPS structure by enzymatic conditioning, beneficial for the release of protein (PN) and polysaccharide (PS), as well as the conversion of intracellular water and some bound water into free water. Additionally, Pearson's correlation and factor analysis confirmed the significant influence of EPS properties on sludge dewaterability and explored their detailed relationship. It was indicated the most crucial factors consisted of PNS (PN in S-EPS), PNL (PN in LB-EPS), PNT (PN in TB-EPS), and PST (PS in TB-EPS) accounted for 72.83% in all of the total variance for the contribution to the dewatered water content. Moreover, the high concentration of PNS and PNL led to the zeta potential rising to -9.74 mV, and the destruction of EPS structure was favorable for sludge to form smaller particle size and compact floc structure.

Among the approaches reported to deal with this problem, surfaces functionalization to render them with antimicrobial characteristics, comprises the most promising one. Most of these strategies, however, are designed to target bacterial biofilms, while fungal biofilms are much less taken into account. In real-life settings, fungi will be inevitably found in consortium with bacteria, especially in the field of biomaterials. The development of antifungal coating strategies to be combined with antibacterial approaches will be pivotal for the fight of biomaterial-associated infections. The main goal of the present study was, therefore, to engineer an effective strategy for the immobilization of liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces to prevent Candida albicans colonization. Immobilization was performed using a two-step mussel-inspired coating strategy, in which PDMS is first immersed in dopamine solution. Its polymerization results in the deposition of a thin adherent film, called polydopamine (pDA), which allowed the incorporation of LAmB, afterwards. Different concentrations of LAmB were screened in order to obtain a contact-killing surface with no release of LAmB. Surface characterization confirmed the polymerization of dopamine and further functionalization with LAmB yielded surfaces with less roughness and more hydrophilic features. The proposed coating strategy rendered the surfaces of PDMS with the ability to prevent the attachment of C. albicans and kill the adherent cells, without toxicity toward mammalian cells. Overall results showed that LAmB immobilization on a surface retained its antifungal activity and reduced toxicity, holding therefore a great potential to be applied for the design of urinary catheters. Since the sessile communities commonly found associated to these devices exhibit a polymicrobial nature, the next challenge will be to co-immobilize LAmB with antibacterial agents to prevent the establishment of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).","authors":[{"name":"Diana Alves"},{"name":"Ana Teresa Vaz"},{"name":"Tânia Grainha"},{"name":"Célia F Rodrigues"},{"name":"Maria Olívia Pereira"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"antifungal coating"},{"word":"catheter-associated urinary tract infections"},{"word":"dopamine chemistry"},{"word":"liposomal amphotericin B"}]},"article383":{"pmid":"31275921","title":"Pyro-Electrification of Freestanding Polymer Sheets: A New Tool for Cation-Free Manipulation of Cell Adhesion in vitro.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Localized electric fields have become, in recent years, a source of inspiration to researchers and laboratories thanks to a huge amount of applications derived from it, including positioning of microparticles as building blocks for electrical, optical, and magnetic devices.

In particular, the influence of surface charges is widely studied and is a critical issue especially when new materials and functional technologies are introduced. Here, we report a voltage-free pyro-electrification (PE) process able to induce a permanent dipole orientation into polymer sheets under both mono- and bipolar distribution. The technique makes use of the pyroelectric effect for generating electric potentials on the order of kilovolts by an easy-to-accomplish thermal treatment of ferroelectric lithium niobate (LN) crystals. The PE allows us to avoid the expensive and time-consuming fabrication of high-power electrical circuits, as occurs in traditional generator-based techniques. Since the technique is fully compatible with spin-coating-based procedures, the pyro-electrified polymer sheets are easily peeled off the surface of the LN crystal after PE completion, thus providing highly stable and freestanding charged sheets.

A major limitation of standard FISH protocols, however, is the small number of phylogenetically distinct target organisms that can be detected simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a multicolor FISH approach that uses eight fluorophores with distinct spectral properties, which can unambiguously be distinguished by confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with white light laser technology. Hybridization of rRNA-targeted DNA oligonucleotide probes, which were mono-labeled with these fluorophores, to Escherichia coli cultures confirmed that the fluorophores did not affect probe melting behavior. Application of the new multicolor FISH method enabled the differentiation of seven (potentially up to eight) phylogenetically distinct microbial populations in an artificial community of mixed pure cultures (five bacteria, one archaeon, and one yeast strain) and in activated sludge from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. In contrast to previously published multicolor FISH approaches, this method does not rely on combinatorial labeling of the same microorganisms with different fluorophores, which is prone to biases. Furthermore, images acquired by this method do not require elaborate post-processing prior to analysis. We also demonstrate that the newly developed multicolor FISH method is compatible with an improved cell fixation protocol for FISH targeting Gram-negative bacterial populations. This fixation approach uses agarose embedding during formaldehyde fixation to better preserve the three-dimensional structure of spatially complex samples such as biofilms and activated sludge flocs. The new multicolor FISH approach should be highly suitable for studying structural and functional aspects of microbial communities in virtually all types of samples that can be analyzed by conventional FISH methods.","authors":[{"name":"Michael Lukumbuzya"},{"name":"Markus Schmid"},{"name":"Petra Pjevac"},{"name":"Holger Daims"}],"keywords":[{"word":"activated sludge"},{"word":"confocal laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"fluorescence in situ hybridization"},{"word":"fluorophores"},{"word":"microorganisms"},{"word":"three-dimensional structure"},{"word":"white light laser"}]},"article387":{"pmid":"31275288","title":"Genetic and Phenotypic Features of a Novel Acinetobacter Species, Strain A47, Isolated From the Clinical Setting.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"In 2014, a novel species of Acinetobacter, strain A47, determined to be hospital-acquired was recovered from a single patient soft tissue sample following a traumatic accident.

A47 exhibited natural transformation with both genomic and plasmid DNA. It was able to form biofilms on different surfaces, to cause hemolysis of sheep and rabbit erythrocytes, and to kill competitor bacteria. Additionally, surface structures with non-uniform length were visualized with scanning electron microscopy and proposed as pili-like structures. Furthermore, the A47 genome revealed the presence of two putative BLUF type photoreceptors, and phenotypic assays confirmed the modulation by light of different virulence traits.

The mutant produced no AHL, and the relative expression of the luxR gene was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. In addition, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the relative expression of the luxR gene in ΔluxI was stimulated by the presence of exogenous AHLs (C4-HSL, C6-HSL, and 3-o-C8-HSL) added at concentrations ranging from of 50-250 μg/ml. Among the three AHLs, C6-HSL had the strongest effect. The ability of ΔluxI to form biofilm on 96-well plate, glass and stainless-steel surfaces was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) compared with the wild type (WT), but was increased when provided with 150 μg/ml C4-HSL, whereas C6-HSL and 3-o-C8-HSL had no effect.

These contaminants have widespread negative effects on human health and ecosystem functioning. Natural attenuation of long chain and polyaromatic hydrocarbons is slow and often incomplete. Bioaugmentation of polluted soils with indigenous bacteria that naturally consume petroleum hydrocarbons could speed up this process. However, the characterization of bacterial crude oil degradation efficiency - which often relies upon expensive, highly specialized gas-chromatography mass spectrometry analyses - can present a substantial bottleneck in developing and implementing these bioremediation strategies. Here, we develop a low-cost, rapid, high-throughput fluorescence-based assay for identifying wild-type bacteria that degrade crude oil using the dye Nile Red. We show that Nile Red fluoresces when in contact with crude oil and developed a robust linear model to calculate crude oil content in liquid cell cultures based on fluorescence intensity (FI). To test whether this assay could identify bacteria with enhanced metabolic capacities to break down crude oil, we screened bacteria isolated from a former Shell Oil refinery in Bay Point, CA, and identified one strain (Cupriavidus sp. OPK) with superior crude oil depletion efficiencies (up to 83%) in only 3 days. We further illustrate that this assay can be combined with fluorescence microscopy to study how bacteria interact with crude oil and the strategies they use to degrade this complex substance. We show for the first time that bacteria use three key strategies for degrading crude oil: biofilm formation, direct adherence to oil droplets, and vesicle encapsulation of oil. We propose that the quantitative and qualitative data from this assay can be used to develop new bioremediation strategies based on bioaugmentation and/or biomimetic materials that imitate the natural ability of bacteria to degrade crude oil.","authors":[{"name":"Katherine E French"},{"name":"Norman Terry"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bioaugmentation"},{"word":"biomimicry"},{"word":"bioremediation"},{"word":"fluorescence microscopy"},{"word":"petroleum hydrocarbons"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"31274401","title":"Umbilical catheters as vectors for generalized bacterial infection in premature infants regardless of antibiotic use.","date":"2019-09-17","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Alina Sobczak"},{"name":"Joanna Klepacka"},{"name":"Dalia Amrom"},{"name":"Iwona Żak"},{"name":"Piotr Kruczek"},{"name":"Przemko Kwinta"}],"keywords":[{"word":"catheter-related infections"},{"word":"central venous catheterization"},{"word":"cross infection"},{"word":"infant, newborn, low birth weight, extremely premature"},{"word":"intensive care units, neonatal"},{"word":"risk factors"},{"word":"umbilicus"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"31274149","title":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization for identification and visualization of microorganisms in infected heart valve tissue as addition to standard diagnostic tests improves diagnosis of endocarditis.","date":"2020-03-02","abs":"In infective endocarditis (IE), identification of the causative organism and consecutive treatment are crucial for patient survival.

Recent studies suggested the gut microbiome plays a role in T1D. We have used public longitudinal microbiome data from T1D patients to analyze amyloid-producing bacterial composition and found a significant association between initially high amyloid-producing Escherichia coli abundance, subsequent E. coli depletion prior to seroconversion, and T1D development. In children who presented seroconversion or developed T1D, we observed an increase in the E. coli phage/E. coli ratio prior to E. coli depletion, suggesting that the decrease in E. coli was due to prophage activation. Evaluation of the role of phages in amyloid release from E. coli biofilms in vitro suggested an indirect role of the bacterial phages in the modulation of host immunity. This study for the first time suggests that amyloid-producing E. coli, their phages, and bacteria-derived amyloid might be involved in pro-diabetic pathway activation in children at risk for T1D.","authors":[{"name":"George Tetz"},{"name":"Stuart M Brown"},{"name":"Yuhan Hao"},{"name":"Victor Tetz"}],"keywords":[]},"article395":{"pmid":"31272796","title":"Fluidic Force Microscopy Captures Amyloid Bonds between Microbial Cells.","date":"2019-08-16","abs":"Fluidic force microscopy (FluidFM) is a recent force-controlled pipette technology that enables manipulation of single cells.

HSC organs evaluated histologically included body wall (chitin, epidermis, dermis, and skeletal muscle), hepatopancreas, gut, gonads, book gills, eyes, heart, brain, and coxal gland. In descending order, lesions were most frequently identified in compound eye, body wall, book gills, hepatopancreas, chitinous gut, nonchitinous gut, heart, and brain; lesions were not observed in coxal gland or gonads. Hemocytes (also called amoebocytes) surrounded infectious agents and occluded ulcers. Large hemocyte aggregates had a central eosinophilic coagulum (ie, hemocyte coagulum). Cutaneous ulceration (34/60 cases), branchitis (29/48 cases), and ophthalmitis (17/20 cases) were common lesions and consistently associated with fungi, which were invasive into subjacent tissues, and/or bacteria, which were usually superficial. Fungal culture was performed in 3 cases and isolated Fusarium spp., although fungal morphology varied and multiple fungal species may have been present. Presumptive green algae were associated with ulceration in 1 case with minimal to no inflammation. Presumptive cyanobacteria were identified within a biofilm overlying the gills in 4 of 48 cases and were not invasive. Multifocal, random hepatopancreatitis was identified in 16 of 57 cases, 10 of which were associated with bacteria. Metacercarial cysts were identified in 25 of 61 cases and associated with minimal to no inflammation. Depleted eosinophilic globules in hepatopancreatic interstitial cells were interpreted as decreased nutritional status in 12 of 57 cases.","authors":[{"name":"Elise E B LaDouceur"},{"name":"Lisa Mangus"},{"name":"Michael M Garner"},{"name":"Andrew N Cartoceti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"American horseshoe crab"},{"word":"Limulus polyphemus"},{"word":"arthropod"},{"word":"hemocytes"},{"word":"invertebrate"},{"word":"pathology"}]},"article398":{"pmid":"31272033","title":"Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles using insulin-rich leaf extract: Anti-diabetic, antibiofilm and anti-oxidant properties.","date":"2019-08-02","abs":"Here, we report the novel fabrication of ZnO nanoparticles using the Costus igneus leaf extract.
