Although QS was first observed in a marine bacterium nearly four decades ago, only in the past decade has there been a rise in interest in the role that QS plays in the ocean. It has become clear that QS, regulated by signals such as acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) or furanosyl-borate diesters [autoinducer-2 (AI-2) molecules], is involved in important processes within the marine carbon cycle, in the health of coral reef ecosystems, and in trophic interactions between a range of eukaryotes and their bacterial associates. The most well-studied QS systems in the ocean occur in surface-attached (biofilm) communities and rely on AHL signaling. AHL-QS is highly sensitive to the chemical and biological makeup of the environment and may respond to anthropogenic change, including ocean acidification and rising sea surface temperatures.","authors":[{"name":"Laura R Hmelo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"marine bacteria"},{"word":"marine environment"},{"word":"quorum quenching"},{"word":"quorum sensing"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"27813824","title":"Enhanced production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) copolymer and antimicrobial yellow pigmentation from Cupriavidus sp.

Direct-fed microbials (DFM) are one of the multiple alternatives commonly evaluated as substitutes of AGP. Sporeformer bacteria from the genus Bacillus have been extensively investigated because of their extraordinary properties to form highly resistant endospores, produce antimicrobial compounds, and synthesize different exogenous enzymes. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and select Bacillus spp. from environmental and poultry sources as DFM candidates, considering their enzyme production profile, biofilm synthesis capacity, and pathogen-inhibition activity. Thirty-one Bacillus isolates were screened for in vitro relative enzyme activity of amylase, protease, lipase, and phytase using a selective media for each enzyme, with 3/31 strains selected as superior enzyme producers. These three isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis (1/3), and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (2/3), based on biochemical tests and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. For evaluation of biofilm synthesis, the generation of an adherent crystal violet-stained ring was determined in polypropylene tubes, resulting in 11/31 strains showing a strong biofilm formation. Moreover, all Bacillus strains were evaluated for growth inhibition activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (26/31), Escherichia coli (28/31), and Clostridioides difficile (29/31). Additionally, in previous in vitro and in vivo studies, these selected Bacillus strains have shown to be resistant to different biochemical conditions of the gastrointestinal tract of poultry.

In the in vitro study, 11 AMPs were tested against 100 B. pseudomallei isolates for planktonic cell susceptibility, where LL-37, and PG1, demonstrated 100.0% susceptibility and TP1 demonstrated 83% susceptibility. Since the B. pseudomallei activity was reported on LL-37 and PG1, TP1 was selected for further investigation. TP1 inhibited B. pseudomallei cells at 61.69 μM, and membrane blebbing was observed using scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, TP1 inhibited B. pseudomallei cell growth, reaching bactericidal endpoint within 2 h post exposure as compared to ceftazidime (CAZ) (8 h). Furthermore, TP1 was shown to suppress the growth of B. pseudomallei cells in biofilm state at concentrations above 221 μM. However, TP1 was cytotoxic to the mammalian cell lines tested. In the in silico study, molecular docking revealed that TP1 demonstrated a strong interaction to the common peptide or inhibitor binding targets for lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli, as well as autolysin, pneumolysin, and pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

VAP pathogenesis is closely linked to organisms colonizing the endotracheal tube (ETT) such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the former a common commensal with pathogenic potential and the latter a known VAP pathogen. However, recent gut microbiome studies show that pathogens rarely function alone. Hence, we determined the ETT microbial consortium co-colonizing with S. epidermidis or P. aeruginosa to understand its importance in the development of VAP and for patient prognosis. Using bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS-II sequencing on ETT biomass showing presence of P. aeruginosa and/or S. epidermidis on culture, we found that presence of P. aeruginosa correlated inversely with patient survival and with bacterial species diversity. A decision tree, using 16S rRNA and patient parameters, to predict patient survival was generated. Patients with a relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae <4.6% and of Staphylococcaceae <70.8% had the highest chance of survival. When Pseudomonadaceae were >4.6%, age of patient <66.5 years was the most important predictor of patient survival.

Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (SBMP) bonding agent was used. DMADDM and QADM were mixed into SBMP primer. Six primers were tested: SBMP control primer P, P+2.5% DMADDM, P+5% DMADDM, P+7.5% DMADDM, P+10% DMADDM, and P+10% QADM. S. mutans were impregnated into human dentin blocks, and each primer was applied to dentin to test its ability to kill bacteria in dentinal tubules. Bacteria in dentin were collected via a sonication method, and the colony-forming units (CFU) and inhibition zones were measured. The bacterial inhibition zone of P+10% DMADDM was 10 times that of control primer (P<0.05). CFU in dentin with P+10% DMADDM was reduced by three orders of magnitude, compared with control. DMADDM had a much stronger antibacterial effect than QADM, and antibacterial efficacy increased with increasing DMADDM concentration. Dentin shear bond strengths were similar among all groups (P>0.1). In conclusion, antibacterial DMADDM-containing primer was validated to kill bacteria inside dentin blocks, possessing a much stronger antibacterial potency than the previous QADM. DMADDM-containing bonding agent was effective in eradicating bacteria in dentin, and its efficacy was directly proportional to DMADDM mass fraction. Therefore, DMADDM may be promising for use in bonding agents as well as in other restorative and preventive materials to inhibit bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Nancy J Lin"},{"name":"Sheng Lin-Gibson"},{"name":"Xue-Dong Zhou"},{"name":"Hockin Hk Xu"}],"keywords":[]},"article12":{"pmid":"27811301","title":"Barnacle biology before, during and after settlement and metamorphosis: a study of the interface.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Mobile barnacle cypris larvae settle and metamorphose, transitioning to sessile juveniles with morphology and growth similar to that of adults.

The interface was characterized using confocal microscopy and fluorescent dyes to identify morphological and chemical changes to the interface and the status of bacteria present as a function of barnacle developmental stage. Staining revealed patchy material containing proteins and nucleic acids, reactive oxygen species amidst developing cuticle, and changes in bacteria viability at the developing interface.

It stained positive for proteins, including phosphoprotein, as well as nucleic acids. Regions of the developing cuticle and the patchy material itself stained for reactive oxygen species. Bacteria were absent until the cyprid was firmly attached, but populations died as barnacle development progressed.

Finally, we observed clear differences in alpha diversity (species richness and phylogenetic diversity), which were to a stronger extent determined by abiotic compared with biotic factors, but also by dispersal effects.

For intranasal administration a thermoreversible in situ gel was used to increase drug residence time in nasal cavity. Ciprofloxacin concentration time-profile in nasal mucosa of the studied anterior region (at naso- and maxilloturbinates level) was markedly higher after intranasal administration (0.24mg/kg) than that following intravenous administration (10mg/kg), while in nasal mucosa of the more posterior region (at ethmoidal turbinates level) ciprofloxacin concentrations were found to be higher after intranasal administration when the different dose administered by both routes is taken into account. A plateau in ciprofloxacin concentration was observed in nasal mucosa of both studied regions after intranasal administration, suggesting a slow delivery of the drug over a period of time using the nasal gel formulation. In plasma and olfactory bulb, concentration of ciprofloxacin was residual after intranasal administration, which demonstrates this is a safe administration route by preventing systemic and particularly central nervous system adverse effects. Dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters of ciprofloxacin exposure to nasal mucosa revealed higher values after intranasal delivery not only in the anterior region but also in the posterior nasal region. In conclusion, topical intranasal administration appears to be advantageous for delivering ciprofloxacin to the biophase, with negligible systemic and brain exposure using a 41.7-fold lower dose than intravenous administration.

However, the problem of sporulation during food processing is poorly addressed and sporulation niches are difficult to identify from the farm to the fork. Sporulation is a survival strategy. Some environmental factors are required to trigger this differentiation process and others act by modulating it.

In this study, a panel of 680 L. monocytogenes from nine Norwegian meat- and salmon processing plants were grouped into 36 MLVA profiles. The presence of qacH and bcrABC was determined in 101 isolates from the 26 most common MLVA profiles. Five MLVA profiles contained qacH and two contained bcrABC. Isolates with qacH and bcrABC showed increased tolerance to the QAC Benzalkonium chloride (BC), with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-12, 10-13 and <5ppm for strains with qacH (two allele variants observed), bcrABC, and neither gene, respectively. Isolates with qacH or bcrABC were not more tolerant to BC in bactericidal tests in suspension or in biofilms compared with isolates lacking the genes. Water residue samples collected from surfaces in meat processing plants after QAC disinfection had bactericidal effect against L. monocytogenes when the sample BC levels were high (>100ppm). A sample with lower BC concentrations (14ppm of chain length C-12 and 2.7ppm of chain length C-14) inhibited growth of L. monocytogenes not containing bcrABC or qacH, compared to strains with these genes.

The cariogenic pathogen Streptococcus mutans manages excess copper using the copYAZ operon that encodes a negative DNA-binding repressor (CopY), the P1-ATPase copper exporter (CopA), and the copper chaperone (CopZ).

A complete understanding of the biochemical nature of the matrix is integral to the understanding of the roles of matrix components. This knowledge is a first step toward the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostics to address persistent biofilm infections. Many of the assay methods needed for refined matrix composition analysis require milligram amounts of material that is separated from the cellular components of these complex communities. The protocol described here explains the large-scale production and isolation of the Candida biofilm extracellular matrix. To our knowledge, the proposed procedure is the only currently available approach in the field that yields milligram amounts of biofilm matrix. This procedure first requires biofilms to be seeded in large-surface-area roller bottles, followed by cell adhesion and biofilm maturation during continuous movement of the medium across the surface of the rotating bottle. The formed matrix is then separated from the entire biomass using sonication, which efficiently removes the matrix without perturbing the fungal cell wall. Subsequent filtration, dialysis and lyophilization steps result in a purified matrix product sufficient for biochemical, structural and functional assays. The overall protocol takes ∼11 d to complete. This protocol has been used for Candida species, but, using the troubleshooting guide provided, it could be adapted for other fungi or bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Robert Zarnowski"},{"name":"Hiram Sanchez"},{"name":"David R Andes"}],"keywords":[]},"article43":{"pmid":"27809278","title":"Assessment of Photodynamic Inactivation against Periodontal Bacteria Mediated by a Chitosan Hydrogel in a 3D Gingival Model.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Chitosan hydrogels containing hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and toluidine blue O were prepared and assessed for their mucoadhesive property and antimicrobial efficacy of photodynamic inactivation (PDI).

Much research has been done in recent years to investigate the mechanisms underlying bacterial persistence and phenotypic antibiotic resistance. The mechanisms of bacterial persistence are complex and the following pathways are involved in persister formation: toxin-antitoxin systems, reduced metabolism, energy production, protein and nucleic acid synthesis, DNA repair and protection, protein degradation, transporters/efflux systems, and transcriptional regulators etc. Although persistence mechanisms are conserved in terms of the gene function and pathways involved among different bacterial species, they may vary in gene homology and relative importance of a given pathway. For example, Escherichia coli toxin-antitoxin systems play an important role in persister formation, while Staphylococcus aureus persister formation does not appear to use toxin-antitoxin systems.

XccBphP possesses an N-terminal PAS2-GAF-PHY photosensory domain triad and a C-terminal PAS9 domain as its output module. Our results show that illumination of Xcc, prior to plant infection, attenuates its virulence in an XccBphP-dependent manner. Moreover, in response to light, XccBphP downregulates xanthan exopolysaccharide production and biofilm formation, two known Xcc virulence factors. Furthermore, the XccbphP null mutant shows enhanced virulence, similar to that of dark-adapted Xcc cultures. Stomatal aperture regulation and callose deposition, both well-established plant defense mechanisms against bacterial pathogens, are overridden by the XccbphP strain. Additionally, an RNA-Seq analysis reveals that far-red light or XccBphP overexpression produces genomewide transcriptional changes, including the inhibition of several Xcc virulence systems. Our findings indicate that Xcc senses light through XccBphP, eliciting bacterial virulence attenuation via downregulation of bacterial virulence factors. The capacity of XccBphP to respond to light both in vitro and in vivo was abolished by a mutation on the conserved Cys13 residue.

Pathogenic and spoilage bacterial species capable of forming biofilms are a significant problem for the healthcare and food industries, as their biofilm-forming ability protects them from common cleaning processes and allows them to remain in the environment post-sanitation. In the food industry, persistent bacteria colonize the inside of mixing tanks, vats and tubing, compromising food safety and quality. Strategies to overcome bacterial persistence through inhibition of biofilm formation or removal of mature biofilms are therefore necessary. Current biofilm control strategies employed in the food industry (cleaning and disinfection, material selection and surface preconditioning, plasma treatment, ultrasonication, etc.), although effective to a certain point, fall short of biofilm control. Efforts have been explored, mainly with a view to their application in pharmaceutical and healthcare settings, which focus on targeting molecular determinants regulating biofilm formation. Their application to the food industry would greatly aid efforts to eradicate undesirable bacteria from food processing environments and, ultimately, from food products. These approaches, in contrast to bactericidal approaches, exert less selective pressure which in turn would reduce the likelihood of resistance development. A particularly interesting strategy targets quorum sensing systems, which regulate gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density governing essential cellular processes including biofilm formation.

However, the clinical applications of such materials have been hindered due to factors such as NO donor leaching and thermal instability. In this study, a novel approach is demonstrated in which one lumen of commercial dual lumen catheters is dedicated to the NO release chemistry, allowing the other lumen to be available for clinical vascular access. A composite consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) is used to fill the NO-releasing lumen of commercial 7 French silicone catheters. Physiological levels of NO are released from the SNAP-PEG catheters for up to 14 d, as measured by chemiluminescence NO analyzer (in PBS buffer at 37 °C). PEG facilitates the NO release from SNAP within the lumen by increasing the water absorption and slowly dissolving the solid SNAP-PEG composite. In a CDC biofilm bioreactor, the SNAP-PEG catheters are found to reduce >97% bacterial adhesion as compared to the PEG controls for single bacterial species including E. coli and S. aureus.

This study highlighted the importance of finding the biological origin of a metabolite and assessing its metabolism and mechanism of action. This led to a better understanding of host and microbial interactions, thereby aiding therapeutic design for cancer.

Most antibacterial coatings to combat infections are either metal-based or nondegradable-polymer-based and hence limited by their nondegradability and unpredictable toxicity. Moreover, to combat infections effectively, the coatings are required to display simultaneous antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. Herein we report biocompatible and biodegradable coatings based on organo-soluble quaternary chitin polymers which were immobilized noncovalently onto surfaces as bactericidal paint. The polycationic paint was found to be active against both drug-sensitive and -resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), and β-lactam-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The cationic polymers were shown to interact with the negatively charged bacterial cell membrane and disrupt the membrane integrity, thereby causing leakage of intracellular constituents and cell death upon contact. Importantly, surfaces coated with the polymers inhibited formation of biofilms against both Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli, two of the most clinically important bacteria that form biofilms. Surfaces coated with the polymers displayed negligible toxicity against human erythrocytes and embryo kidney cells. Notably, the polymers were shown to be susceptible toward lysozyme. Furthermore, subcutaneous implantation of polymer discs in rats led to 15-20% degradation in 4 weeks thereby displaying their biodegradability. In a murine model of subcutaneous infection, polymer-coated medical-grade catheter reduced MRSA burden by 3.7 log compared to that of noncoated catheter. Furthermore, no biofilm development was observed on the coated catheters under in vivo conditions. The polycationic materials thus developed herein represent a novel class of safe and effective coating agents for the prevention of device-associated infections.","authors":[{"name":"Jiaul Hoque"},{"name":"Padma Akkapeddi"},{"name":"Chandradhish Ghosh"},{"name":"Divakara S S M Uppu"},{"name":"Jayanta Haldar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anti-infective biomaterials"},{"word":"biodegradable bactericidal paint"},{"word":"biofilm inhibition"},{"word":"drug-resistant bacteria"},{"word":"organo-soluble quaternary chitin derivatives"}]},"article66":{"pmid":"27682323","title":"Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to evaluate hydrogen peroxide as a biofouling control agent in membrane treatment systems.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Hydrogen peroxide (H","authors":[{"name":"Y Yang"},{"name":"M Kitajima"},{"name":"T P T Pham"},{"name":"L Yu"},{"name":"R Ling"},{"name":"K Y H Gin"},{"name":"M Reinhard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"biocides"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"disinfection"},{"word":"membrane"}]},"article67":{"pmid":"27644984","title":"Comparative Ploidy Proteomics of Candida albicans Biofilms Unraveled the Role of the AHP1 Gene in the Biofilm Persistence Against Amphotericin B.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Candida albicans is a major fungal pathogen causing lethal infections in immunocompromised patients. C. albicans forms antifungal tolerant biofilms contributing significantly to therapeutic failure. The recently established haploid C. albicans biofilm model provides a new toolbox to uncover the mechanism governing the higher antifungal tolerance of biofilms. Here, we comprehensively examined the proteomics and antifungal susceptibility of standard diploid (SC5314 and BWP17) and stable haploid (GZY792 and GZY803) strains of C. albicans biofilms. Subsequent downstream analyses identified alkyl hydroperoxide reductase 1 (AHP1) as a critical determinant of C. albicans biofilm's tolerance of amphotericin B. At 32 μg/ml of amphotericin B, GZY803 haploid biofilms showed 0.1% of persister population as compared with 1% of the diploid biofilms. AHP1 expression was found to be lower in GZY803 biofilms, and AHP1 overexpression in GZY803 restored the percentage of persister population. Consistently, deleting AHP1 in the diploid strain BWP17 caused a similar increase in amphotericin B susceptibility. AHP1 expression was also positively correlated with the antioxidant potential. Furthermore, C. albicans ira2Δ/Δ biofilms were susceptible to amphotericin B and had a diminished antioxidant capacity. Interestingly, AHP1 overexpression in the ira2Δ/Δ strain restored the antioxidant potential and enhanced the persister population against amphotericin B, and shutting down the AHP1 expression in ira2Δ/Δ biofilms reversed the effect. In conclusion, we provide evidence that the AHP1 gene critically determines the amphotericin B tolerance of C. albicans biofilms possibly by maintaining the persisters' antioxidant capacity. This finding will open up new avenues for developing therapies targeting the persister population of C. albicans biofilms.

Its ability to adapt to the human host and to produce a successful infection requires precise orchestration of gene expression. While DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) is generally well characterized, the roles of several small accessory subunits within the complex have yet to be fully explored. This is particularly true for the omega (ω or RpoZ) subunit, which has been extensively studied in Gram-negative bacteria but largely neglected in Gram-positive counterparts. In Escherichia coli, it has been shown that ppGpp binding, and thus control of the stringent response, is facilitated by ω. Interestingly, key residues that facilitate ppGpp binding by ω are not conserved in S. aureus, and consequently, survival under starvation conditions is unaffected by rpoZ deletion. Further to this, ω-lacking strains of S. aureus display structural changes in the RNAP complex, which result from increased degradation and misfolding of the β' subunit, alterations in δ and σ factor abundance, and a general dissociation of RNAP in the absence of ω. Through RNA sequencing analysis we detected a variety of transcriptional changes in the rpoZ-deficient strain, presumably as a response to the negative effects of ω depletion on the transcription machinery.

The median biofilm MICs of fluconazole-sensitive C. albicans isolates ranged between 4 -> 512 mg/L and 150-300 μM for fluconazole and farnesol, respectively. These values were 512 -> 512 mg/L and > 300 μM for fluconazole-resistant clinical isolates. Farnesol decreased the median MICs of fluconazole by 2-64-fold for biofilms.

Among these, the collagen (Cn)-binding protein Cna plays important roles in bacterium-host adherence and in immune evasion. While it is well established that the A region of Cna mediates ligand binding, whether the repetitive B region has a dedicated function is not known. Here, we report the direct measurement of the mechanical strength of Cna-Cn bonds on living bacteria, and we quantify the antiadhesion activity of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting this interaction. We demonstrate that the strength of Cna-Cn bonds in vivo is very strong (~1.2 nN), consistent with the high-affinity collagen hug mechanism. The B region is required for strong ligand binding and has been found to function as a spring capable of sustaining high forces. This previously undescribed mechanical response of the B region is of biological significance as it provides a means to project the A region away from the bacterial surface and to maintain bacterial adhesion under conditions of high forces. We further quantified the antiadhesion activity of MAbs raised against the A region of Cna directly on living bacteria without the need for labeling or purification. Some MAbs are more efficient in blocking single-cell adhesion, suggesting that they act as competitive inhibitors that bind Cna residues directly involved in ligand binding.

Previous work indicated that when in vivo Pf phage production was inhibited, P. aeruginosa was less virulent. However, it is not clear how the production of abundant quantities of Pf phage similar to those produced by biofilms under in vitro conditions affects pathogenesis. Here, using a murine pneumonia model, we show that the production of biofilm-relevant amounts of Pf phage prevents the dissemination of P. aeruginosa from the lung. Furthermore, filamentous phage promoted bacterial adhesion to mucin and inhibited bacterial invasion of airway epithelial cultures, suggesting that Pf phage traps P. aeruginosa within the lung. The in vivo production of Pf phage was also associated with reduced lung injury, reduced neutrophil recruitment, and lower cytokine levels. Additionally, when producing Pf phage, P. aeruginosa was less prone to phagocytosis by macrophages than bacteria not producing Pf phage. Collectively, these data suggest that filamentous Pf phage alters the progression of the inflammatory response and promotes phenotypes typically associated with chronic infection.","authors":[{"name":"Patrick R Secor"},{"name":"Lia A Michaels"},{"name":"Kate S Smigiel"},{"name":"Maryam G Rohani"},{"name":"Laura K Jennings"},{"name":"Katherine B Hisert"},{"name":"Allison Arrigoni"},{"name":"Kathleen R Braun"},{"name":"Timothy P Birkland"},{"name":"Ying Lai"},{"name":"Teal S Hallstrand"},{"name":"Paul L Bollyky"},{"name":"Pradeep K Singh"},{"name":"William C Parks"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacteriophages"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"dissemination"},{"word":"inflammation"},{"word":"lung infection"},{"word":"macrophages"},{"word":"neutrophils"}]},"article102":{"pmid":"27795240","title":"Draft Genome Sequence of a Novel Mucilaginibacter Member Isolated from Brazilian Amazon Soil.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Bacteria from the Mucilaginibacter genus are still poorly understood, although their importance has been shown by recent reports describing great quantities of biofilms produced in their colonies.

S. aureus biofilms actively skew the host immune response toward an anti-inflammatory state; however, the biofilm effector molecules and the mechanism(s) of action responsible for this phenomenon remain to be fully defined. The essential bacterial second messenger cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is an emerging pathogen-associated molecular pattern during intracellular bacterial infections, as c-di-AMP secretion into the infected host cytosol induces a robust type I interferon (IFN) response. Type I IFNs have the potential to exacerbate infectious outcomes by promoting anti-inflammatory effects; however, the type I IFN response to S. aureus biofilms is unknown. Additionally, while several intracellular proteins function as c-di-AMP receptors in S. aureus, it has yet to be determined if any extracellular role for c-di-AMP exists and its release during biofilm formation has not yet been demonstrated. This study examined the possibility that c-di-AMP released during S. aureus biofilm growth polarizes macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype via type I interferon signaling. DacA, the enzyme responsible for c-di-AMP synthesis in S. aureus, was highly expressed during biofilm growth, and 30 to 50% of total c-di-AMP produced from S. aureus biofilm was released extracellularly due to autolytic activity. S. aureus biofilm c-di-AMP release induced macrophage type I IFN expression via a STING-dependent pathway and promoted S. aureus intracellular survival in macrophages. These findings identify c-di-AMP as another mechanism for how S. aureus biofilms promote macrophage anti-inflammatory activity, which likely contributes to biofilm persistence.","authors":[{"name":"Casey M Gries"},{"name":"Eric L Bruger"},{"name":"Derek E Moormeier"},{"name":"Tyler D Scherr"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"},{"name":"Tammy Kielian"}],"keywords":[]},"article106":{"pmid":"27736755","title":"Antibiofilm Activities of a Novel Chimeolysin against Streptococcus mutans under Physiological and Cariogenic Conditions.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Streptococcus mutans often survives as a biofilm on the tooth surface and contributes to the development of dental caries.

In addition, it is difficult to obtain strong negative molecular ion signals when m/z>200. These two drawbacks have been the biggest obstacle towards practical use of this new analytical approach. In this study, we report that strong and reliable positive and negative molecular signals are achievable after optimizing the SIMS experimental conditions. Four model systems, including a 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU)-base switchable ionic liquid, a live Shewanella oneidensis biofilm, a hydrated mammalian epithelia cell, and an electrolyte popularly used in Li ion batteries were studied.

Herein we evaluated transcriptomic changes of wounds as they counter P. aeruginosa infection-first active infection, and then chronic biofilm infection. We used the dermal full-thickness, rabbit ear excisional wound model. We studied the wound response: towards acute infection at 2, 6, and 24 hrs after inoculating 106 bacteria into day-3 wounds; and, towards more chronic biofilm infection of wounds similarly infected for 24 hrs but then treated with topical antibiotic to coerce biofilm growth and evaluated at day 5 and 9 post-infection. The wounds were analyzed for bacterial counts, expression of P. aeruginosa virulence and biofilm-synthesis genes, biofilm morphology, infiltrating immune cells, re-epithelialization, and genome-wide gene expression (RNA-Seq transcriptome). This analysis revealed that 2 hrs after bacterial inoculation into day-3 wounds, the down-regulated genes (infected vs. non-infected) of the wound edge were nearly all non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), comprised of snoRNA, miRNA, and RNU6 pseudogenes, and their down-regulation preceded a general down-regulation of skin-enriched coding gene expression. As the active infection intensified, ncRNAs remained overrepresented among down-regulated genes; however, at 6 and 24 hrs they changed to a different set, which overlapped between these times, and excluded RNU6 pseudogenes but included snRNA components of the major and minor spliceosomes. Additionally, the raw counts of multiple types of differentially-expressed ncRNAs increased on post-wounding day 3 in control wounds, but infection suppressed this increase. After 5 and 9 days, these ncRNA counts in control wounds decreased, whereas they increased in the infected, healing-impaired wounds. These data suggest a sequential and coordinated change in the levels of transcripts of multiple major classes of ncRNAs in wound cells transitioning from inflammation to the proliferation phase of healing.","authors":[{"name":"S L Rajasekhar Karna"},{"name":"Peter D'Arpa"},{"name":"Tsute Chen"},{"name":"Li-Wu Qian"},{"name":"Andrea B Fourcaudot"},{"name":"Kazuyoshi Yamane"},{"name":"Ping Chen"},{"name":"Johnathan J Abercrombie"},{"name":"Tao You"},{"name":"Kai P Leung"}],"keywords":[]},"article121":{"pmid":"27792296","title":"Simple and Specific Grafting of Antibacterial Peptides on Silicone Catheters.","date":"2018-09-18","abs":"To fight against nosocomial infection initiated by colonization of medical devices, a strategy enabling the direct and fast functionalization of silicone surfaces is proposed.

The Brt family of RNAs is unique to the genus Bartonella and ranges from 194 to 203 nucleotides with high homology and stable predicted secondary structures. Immediately downstream of each of the nine RNA genes is a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding protein (transcriptional regulatory protein, Trp1-9) that is poorly transcribed under the growth conditions used for RNA-seq. Using knockdown or overexpressing strains, we show a role of both the Brt1 and Trp1 in the regulation of badA and also in biofilm formation.

These cell aggregates are enclosed in a self-produced polymeric extracellular matrix, which protects the cells, provides mechanical stability and mediates cellular cohesion and adhesion to surfaces. Although important advances were made in the identification of the genetic and extracellular factors required for biofilm formation, the mechanisms leading to biofilm matrix assembly, and the roles of extracellular proteins in these processes are still poorly understood. The symbiont Rhizobium leguminosarum requires the synthesis of the acidic exopolysaccharide and the PrsDE secretion system to develop a mature biofilm. PrsDE is responsible for the secretion of the Rap family of proteins that share one or two Ra/CHDL (cadherin-like-) domains. RapA2 is a calcium-dependent lectin with a cadherin-like β sheet structure that specifically recognizes the exopolysaccharide, either as a capsular polysaccharide (CPS) or in its released form [extracellular polysaccharide (EPS)]. In this study, using gain and loss of function approaches combined with phenotypic and microscopic studies we demonstrated that RapA lectins are involved in biofilm matrix development and cellular cohesion. While the absence of any RapA protein increased the compactness of bacterial aggregates, high levels of RapA1 expanded distances between cells and favored the production of a dense matrix network. Whereas endogenous RapA(s) are predominantly located at one bacterial pole, we found that under overproduction conditions, RapA1 surrounded the cell in a way that was reminiscent of the capsule. Accordingly, polysaccharide analyses showed that the RapA lectins promote CPS formation at the expense of lower EPS production. Besides, polysaccharide analysis suggests that RapA modulates the EPS size profile. Collectively, these results show that the interaction of RapA lectins with the polysaccharide is involved in rhizobial biofilm matrix assembly and remodeling.","authors":[{"name":"Nicolás F Vozza"},{"name":"Patricia L Abdian"},{"name":"Daniela M Russo"},{"name":"Elías J Mongiardini"},{"name":"Aníbal R Lodeiro"},{"name":"Søren Molin"},{"name":"Angeles Zorreguieta"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Rhizobium"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"lectins"}]},"article130":{"pmid":"27789913","title":"Dorsal Lingual Surface and Halitosis: a Morphological Point of View.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The interest in the study of the tongue papillary niches and the related biofilm has increased in recent years because they form a suitable source of periodontal microorganisms and are associated with development of halitosis.

Assessed by protein assay and surface coverage analyses, the presence of the mixed metal complexes in systems containing water industry-relevant nitrite-producing nitrifying biofilms was shown to result in a nontoxic mode of biofilm suppression, while confining the bacterial growth to the free-floating planktonic phase. Addition of an NO scavenger into the mixed metal system eliminated the antibiofilm effects, therefore validating first, the capability of the mixed metal complexes to catalytically generate NO from the endogenously produced nitrite and second, the antibiofilm effects of the generated NO.

SasG, a multidomain protein implicated in host colonization and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus, provides another example of how disorder can play an important role. Approximately one-half of the domains in the extracellular repetitive region of SasG are intrinsically unfolded in isolation, but these E domains fold in the context of their neighboring folded G5 domains. We have previously shown that the intrinsic disorder of the E domains mediates long-range cooperativity between nonneighboring G5 domains, allowing SasG to form a long, rod-like, mechanically strong structure. Here, we show that the disorder of the E domains coupled with the remarkable stability of the interdomain interface result in cooperative folding kinetics across long distances. Formation of a small structural nucleus at one end of the molecule results in rapid structure formation over a distance of 10 nm, which is likely to be important for the maintenance of the structural integrity of SasG. Moreover, if this normal folding nucleus is disrupted by mutation, the interdomain interface is sufficiently stable to drive the folding of adjacent E and G5 domains along a parallel folding pathway, thus maintaining cooperative folding.","authors":[{"name":"Dominika T Gruszka"},{"name":"Carolina A T F Mendonça"},{"name":"Emanuele Paci"},{"name":"Fiona Whelan"},{"name":"Judith Hawkhead"},{"name":"Jennifer R Potts"},{"name":"Jane Clarke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"IDP"},{"word":"cooperativity"},{"word":"parallel pathways"},{"word":"protein engineering"},{"word":"protein folding"}]},"article143":{"pmid":"27652612","title":"Bacteriophage for Mitigation of Multiple Drug Resistant Biofilm Forming Pathogens.","date":"2019-11-13","abs":"Microbial communities encased in exopolymeric substances (EPS) attached to suitable substrate as biofilms show heightened resistance to multiple drugs including antibiotics.

This nanohybrid and its individual nanomaterials (Ag and CD) were prepared by facile hydrothermal approaches and characterized by various instrumental techniques. The structural insight of the nanohybrid, as well as its nanocomposites was evaluated by TEM, XRD, FTIR, EDX and thermal studies. The significant improvement in the performance in terms of tensile strength (1.7 fold), toughness (1.5 fold) and thermal stability (20 °C) of the pristine HPU was observed by the formation of nanocomposite with 5 wt.% of nanohybrid. They also showed notable shape recovery (99.6%) and nearly complete self-expansion (>99%) just within 20s at (37 ± 1) °C. Biological assessment established in vitro cytocompatibility of the HPU nanocomposites. The fabricated nanocomposites not only assisted the growth and proliferation of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells that exhibited reduced platelet adhesion but also displayed in vitro hemocompatibility of mammalian RBCs.

It has antimicrobial properties and disrupts the ordered structure of amyloid fibrils involved in human disease. The antimicrobial effect of EGCG against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to involve disruption of quorum sensing (QS). Functional amyloid fibrils in P. aeruginosa (Fap) are able to bind and retain quorum-sensing molecules, suggesting that EGCG interferes with QS through structural remodeling of amyloid fibrils. Here we show that EGCG inhibits the ability of Fap to form fibrils; instead, EGCG stabilizes protein oligomers. Existing fibrils are remodeled by EGCG into non-amyloid aggregates. This fibril remodeling increases the binding of pyocyanin, demonstrating a mechanism by which EGCG can affect the QS function of functional amyloid. EGCG reduced the amyloid-specific fluorescent thioflavin T signal in P. aeruginosa biofilms at concentrations known to exert an antimicrobial effect. Nanoindentation studies showed that EGCG reduced the stiffness of biofilm containing Fap fibrils but not in biofilm with little Fap. In a combination treatment with EGCG and tobramycin, EGCG had a moderate effect on the minimum bactericidal eradication concentration against wild-type P. aeruginosa biofilms, whereas EGCG had a more pronounced effect when Fap was overexpressed. Our results provide a direct molecular explanation for the ability of EGCG to disrupt P. aeruginosa QS and modify its biofilm and strengthens the case for EGCG as a candidate in multidrug treatment of persistent biofilm infections.","authors":[{"name":"Marcel Stenvang"},{"name":"Morten S Dueholm"},{"name":"Brian S Vad"},{"name":"Thomas Seviour"},{"name":"Guanghong Zeng"},{"name":"Susana Geifman-Shochat"},{"name":"Mads T Søndergaard"},{"name":"Gunna Christiansen"},{"name":"Rikke Louise Meyer"},{"name":"Staffan Kjelleberg"},{"name":"Per Halkjær Nielsen"},{"name":"Daniel E Otzen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)"},{"word":"amyloid"},{"word":"bacterial fibrils"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)"},{"word":"fibril"},{"word":"fibrillation inhibition"},{"word":"nanoindentation"},{"word":"natural product"},{"word":"pyocyanin binding"}]},"article168":{"pmid":"27784450","title":"[Estradiol stimulates the growth and biofilm formation of clinical Staphylococcus epidermidis].","date":"2018-10-23","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"X Wang"},{"name":"Y C Zhou"},{"name":"Y C Huang"},{"name":"T N Zou"},{"name":"Z Y Lü"},{"name":"Y Chen"},{"name":"X Liu"},{"name":"W S Duan"}],"keywords":[]},"article169":{"pmid":"27744103","title":"Detection of AmpC β-lactamase and adherence factors in uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolated from aged patients.","date":"2017-10-08","abs":"Escherichia coli mediated urinary tract infection has been reported to be most prevalent among patients of different class, gender and ages.

We have developed novel anti-biofilm coatings that disrupt quorum sensing in surface-associated bacteria via the immobilization of acylase in polyurethane films. Specifically, acylase from Aspergillus melleus was covalently immobilized in biomedical grade polyurethane coatings via multipoint covalent immobilization. Coatings containing acylase were enzymatically active and catalyzed the hydrolysis of the quorum sensing (QS) molecules N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-LHL), N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C6-LHL), and N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-LHL). In biofilm inhibition assays, immobilization of acylase led to an approximately 60% reduction in biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and PAO1. Inhibition of biofilm formation was consistent with a reduction in the secretion of pyocyanin, indicating the disruption of quorum sensing as the mechanism of the coating activity. Scanning electron microscopy further showed that acylase-containing coatings contained far fewer bacterial cells than control coatings that lacked acylase. Moreover, acylase-containing coatings retained 90% activity when stored dry at 37°C for 7 days and were more stable than the free enzyme in physiological conditions, including artificial urine. Ultimately, such coatings hold considerable promise for the clinical management of catheter-related infections as well as the prevention of infections in orthopedic applications (i.e., on hip and knee prostheses) and on contact lenses.

Laboratory tests were carried out by inoculating mosaic tiles with single strains of Cyanobacteria or Chlorophyta to evaluate the roles of pioneer phototrophic microrganism on the resulting architecture of biofilms. The interaction between tesserae and strains was assessed at the whole substratum and micrometer scales, by image analysis and Confocal Laser Scanning (CLS) microscopy, respectively. The biofilm surface coverage on each tessera varied from 19% (Fischerella ambigua) to 97% (Microcoleus autumnalis). Cyanobacteria showed a better growth on calcareous tesserae, whereas the only green alga attaining a superficial coverage higher than 50% was Coelastrella rubescens. CLS microscopy evidenced two different types of spatial arrangement of the phototrophic organisms on the tesserae, that were defined as compact or porous, respectively. In the first one was measured a reduced number of empty spaces between cells or filaments, whereas in the second type, a reticulate texture allowed the presence of numerous empty volumes. The colonization processes observed are an intrinsic characteristic of each strain. We have proposed a colonization index IC as a sensible tool to describe, in a quantitative way, the pioneering attitude of each photosynthetic microorganism to colonize lithic substrates under laboratory conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Addolorata Marasco"},{"name":"Simona Nocerino"},{"name":"Gabriele Pinto"},{"name":"Antonino Pollio"},{"name":"Giorgio Trojsi"},{"name":"Antonino De Natale"}],"keywords":[]},"article183":{"pmid":"27783478","title":"Characterization and Significance of Sub-Visible Particles and Colloids in a Submerged Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (SAnMBR).","date":"2018-07-13","abs":"The distribution, composition and morphological structure of subvisible particles and colloids (0.01-10 μm) in the supernatant of a lab-scale submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAnMBR), and their role in membrane fouling, was investigated.

Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra and monosaccharide analysis showed that these particles and colloids were rich in fluorescent proteins, rhamnose, ribose and arabinose, all of which could be related to cellular and extracellular substances. Fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of bacterial cells in/on the subvisible particles and colloids.

As revealed by the environmental pmoA distribution analysis, type Ib methanotrophs tend to live very near the methane source, where oxygen is scarce.

Viruses are transmitted by polarized budding and by transfer of viral biofilms at the virological synapse (VS). Formation of the VS requires the viral Tax protein and polarization of the host cytoskeleton, however, molecular mechanisms of HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission remain incompletely understood. Recently, we could show Tax-dependent upregulation of the actin-bundling protein Fascin (FSCN-1) in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Here, we report that Fascin contributes to HTLV-1 transmission. Using single-cycle replication-dependent HTLV-1 reporter vectors, we found that repression of endogenous Fascin by short hairpin RNAs and by Fascin-specific nanobodies impaired gag p19 release and cell-to-cell transmission in 293T cells. In Jurkat T-cells, Tax-induced Fascin expression enhanced virus release and Fascin-dependently augmented cell-to-cell transmission to Raji/CD4+ B-cells. Repression of Fascin in HTLV-1-infected T-cells diminished virus release and gag p19 transfer to co-cultured T-cells. Spotting the mechanism, flow cytometry and automatic image analysis showed that Tax-induced T-cell conjugate formation occurred Fascin-independently. However, adhesion of HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cells in co-culture with Jurkat T-cells was reduced upon knockdown of Fascin, suggesting that Fascin contributes to dissemination of infected T-cells. Imaging of chronically infected MS-9 T-cells in co-culture with Jurkat T-cells revealed that Fascin's localization at tight cell-cell contacts is accompanied by gag polarization suggesting that Fascin directly affects the distribution of gag to budding sites, and therefore, indirectly viral transmission. In detail, we found gag clusters that are interspersed with Fascin clusters, suggesting that Fascin makes room for gag in viral biofilms. Moreover, we observed short, Fascin-containing membrane extensions surrounding gag clusters and clutching uninfected T-cells. Finally, we detected Fascin and gag in long-distance cellular protrusions. Taken together, we show for the first time that HTLV-1 usurps the host cell factor Fascin to foster virus release and cell-to-cell transmission.","authors":[{"name":"Christine Gross"},{"name":"Veit Wiesmann"},{"name":"Sebastian Millen"},{"name":"Martina Kalmer"},{"name":"Thomas Wittenberg"},{"name":"Jan Gettemans"},{"name":"Andrea K Thoma-Kress"}],"keywords":[]},"article220":{"pmid":"27775685","title":"LadS is a calcium-responsive kinase that induces acute-to-chronic virulence switch in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2018-01-26","abs":"Virulence of pathogenic bacteria is a tightly controlled process to facilitate invasion and survival in host tissues. Although pathways controlling virulence have been defined in detail, signals modulating these processes are poorly understood. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes acute and chronic infections in humans. Disease progression is typically associated with a loss of acute virulence and the emergence of biofilms and chronic behaviour. The acute-to-chronic switch is governed by the global Gac/Rsm pathway. Using a newly developed acute-chronic dual reporter system we show that calcium stimulates the Gac/Rsm pathway via the Gac-associated hybrid histidine kinase LadS. We show that calcium binds to the periplasmic DISMED2 sensor domain of LadS to activate its kinase activity. Activation of the Gac/Rsm pathway by calcium leads to a switch to the chronic program and confers drug tolerance by reducing P. aeruginosa growth rate. Clinical isolates from cystic fibrosis airways retain their calcium response during chronic infections. Our data imply that calcium sensing evolved as an adaptation to the opportunistic lifestyle of P. aeruginosa and that calcium serves as a host signal to balance acute-to-chronic behaviour during infections. Establishing calcium signalling in host-pathogen interaction adds to growing evidence indicating key roles for calcium in bacterial signalling.","authors":[{"name":"Ursula N Broder"},{"name":"Tina Jaeger"},{"name":"Urs Jenal"}],"keywords":[]},"article221":{"pmid":"27775575","title":"Extract from Maize (Zea mays L.): Antibacterial Activity of DIMBOA and Its Derivatives against Ralstonia solanacearum.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Many cereals accumulate hydroxamic acids involved in defense of plant against various fungi, bacteria, and insects. 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazine-3-one, commonly known as DIMBOA, is one of the principal cyclic hydroxamic acids in aqueous extracts of maize. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the isolated DIMBOA and its derivatives 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA), 6-chloro-2-benzoxazolinone (CDHB), and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) against Ralstonia solanacearum.

We investigated the suppressive effect of antibiotics on the growth of non-adherent, planktonic, and surface-related biofilm bacteria in vitro by using sonication and microcalorimetry methods. Patients and methods - Biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Propionibacterium acnes were formed on porous glass beads and exposed for 24 h to antibiotic concentrations from 1 to 1,024 times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin, daptomycin, rifampin, flucloxacillin, or ciprofloxacin. The beads were then sonicated to dislodge biofilm, followed by culture and measurement of growth-related heat flow by microcalorimetry of the resulting sonication fluid. Results - Vancomycin did not inhibit the heat flow of staphylococci and P. acnes at concentrations ≤1,024 μg/mL, whereas flucloxacillin at >128 μg/mL inhibited S. aureus. Daptomycin inhibited heat flow of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes at lower concentrations (32-128 times MIC, p < 0.001). Rifampin showed inconsistent results in staphylococci due to random emergence of resistance, which was observed at concentrations ≤1,024 times MIC (i.e. 8 μg/mL). Ciprofloxacin inhibited heat flow of E. coli at ≥4 times MIC (i.e. ≥ 0.06 μg/mL). Interpretation - Whereas time-dependent antibiotics (i.e. vancomycin and flucloxacillin) showed only weak growth suppression, concentration-dependent drugs (i.e. daptomycin and ciprofloxacin) had a strong suppressive effect on bacterial growth and reduced the ability to detect planktonic and biofilm bacteria. Exposure to rifampin rapidly caused emergence of resistance.

To better understand its pathogenesis, the expression of several adhesin genes was evaluated by semi-quantitative real-time PCR in A. suis grown in conditions that mimic the host environment, including different nutrient and oxygen levels, exponential and stationary phases of growth, and in the presence of the stress hormone epinephrine. Fifty micromolar epinephrine did not affect the growth rate or expression of A. suis adhesin genes, but there was a significant growth phase effect for many genes. Most adhesin genes were also differentially expressed during anoxic static growth or aerobic growth, and in this study, all genes were differentially expressed in either exponential or stationary phase. Based on the time*treatment interactions observed in the anoxic study, a model of persistence of A. suis in the host environment in biofilm and planktonic states is proposed. Biofilm dynamics were further studied using wild type and isogenic mutants of the type IVb pilin (Δ flp1), the OmpA outer membrane protein (ΔompA), and the fibronectin-binding (ΔcomE1) genes. Disruption of these adhesin genes affected the early stages of biofilm formation, but in most cases, biofilm formation of the mutant strains was similar to that of the wild type by 24h of incubation.

Biofilm is involved in almost every infectious disease compromising oral health, notably caries, periodontal disease, gingivitis, endodontic infections and peri-implantitis. Current therapies of biofilm-derived oral infections lack sensitivity; they are not species-specific and kill pathogenic species as well as commensal species, which are protective against the formation of pathogenic biofilms. Moreover, antibiotics have a limited effect on biofilm and are almost unused in oral diseases. A promising alternative approach is bacteriophage (phage) therapy. Phages play a key role in the natural balance in a predator-prey relationship with bacteria and thus have the potential to be efficient anti-bacterial agents. Phages are highly efficient against biofilm, strain specific and easy to isolate and manipulate. Thus, like in many other medicinal fields, phage therapy offers new horizons to dentistry, both therapeutics and research. The present review presents the etiology of common oral diseases, characterization of the infection and the treatment challenges of phage therapy in dentistry.

Therefore, new approaches for their control are urgently needed. One way to search for biofilm dispersing compounds is to look at defense strategies of organisms exposed to wet environments, which makes them prone to biofilm infections. It is reasonable to assume that mushrooms have developed mechanisms to control biofilms on their sporocarps (fruiting bodies). A preliminary screening for biofilms on sporocarps revealed several species with few or no bacteria on their sporocarps. From the edible mushroom Coprinus comatus where no bacteria on the sporocarp could be detected (3R,4S)-2-methylene-3,4-dihydroxypentanoic acid 1,4-lactone, named coprinuslactone, was isolated. Coprinuslactone interfered with quorum-sensing and dispersed biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where it also reduced the formation of the pathogenicity factors pyocyanin and rhamnolipid B. Coprinuslactone also damaged Staphylococcus aureus cells in biofilms at subtoxic concentrations. Furthermore, it inhibited UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA), essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis. These two modes of action ensure the inhibition of a broad spectrum of pathogens on the fruiting body but may also be useful for future clinical applications.","authors":[{"name":"Maira P de Carvalho"},{"name":"Giuseppe Gulotta"},{"name":"Matheus W do Amaral"},{"name":"Heinrich Lünsdorf"},{"name":"Florenz Sasse"},{"name":"Wolf-Rainer Abraham"}],"keywords":[]},"article236":{"pmid":"27696649","title":"Functional analysis of Escherichia coli Yad fimbriae reveals their potential role in environmental persistence.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Initial adhesion of bacterial cells to surfaces or host tissues is a key step in colonisation and biofilm formation processes, and is mediated by cell surface appendages. It was previously demonstrated that Escherichia coli K-12 possesses an arsenal of silenced chaperone-usher fimbriae that were functional when constitutively expressed. Among them, production of prevalent Yad fimbriae induces adhesion to abiotic surfaces. Functional characterisation of Yad fimbriae were undertook, and YadN was identified as the most abundant and potential major pilin, and YadC as the potential tip-protein of Yad fimbriae. It was showed that Yad production participates to binding of E. coli K-12 to human eukaryotic cells (Caco-2) and inhibits macrophage phagocytosis, but also enhances E. coli K-12 binding to xylose, a major component of the plant cell wall, through its tip-lectin YadC. Consistently, it was demonstrated that Yad production provides E. coli with a competitive advantage in colonising corn seed rhizospheres. The latter phenotype is correlated with induction of Yad expression at temperatures below 37°C, and under anaerobic conditions, through a complex regulatory network. Taken together, these results suggest that Yad fimbriae are versatile adhesins that beyond potential capacities to modulate host-pathogen interactions might contribute to E. coli environmental persistence.","authors":[{"name":"Fanny Larsonneur"},{"name":"Fernando A Martin"},{"name":"Adeline Mallet"},{"name":"Marta Martinez-Gil"},{"name":"Vincent Semetey"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Ghigo"},{"name":"Christophe Beloin"}],"keywords":[]},"article237":{"pmid":"27693709","title":"Can Sophorolipids prevent biofilm formation on silicone catheter tubes?","date":"2017-04-21","abs":"Given the impact of biofilms in health care environment and the increasing antibiotic resistance and/or tolerance, new strategies for preventing that occurrence in medical devices are obligatory.

To visualize eDNA in oral biofilms, approaches for fluorescently stained eDNA with either anti-DNA antibodies or an ultrasensitive cell-impermeant dye, YOYO-1, were first developed using Enterococcus faecalis, an organism that has previously been shown to produce extensive eDNA structures within biofilms. Oral biofilms were modelled as in vitro microcosms on glass coverslips inoculated with the natural microbial population of human saliva and cultured statically in artificial saliva medium. Using antibodies and YOYO-1, eDNA was found to be distributed throughout microcosm biofilms, and was particularly abundant in the immediate vicinity of cells. Similar arrangements of eDNA were detected in biofilms on crowns and overdenture abutments of dental implants that had been recovered from patients during the restorative phase of treatment, and in subgingival dental plaque of periodontitis patients, indicating that eDNA is a common component of natural oral biofilms. In model oral biofilms, treatment with a DNA-degrading enzyme, NucB from Bacillus licheniformis, strongly inhibited the accumulation of biofilms. The bacterial species diversity was significantly reduced by treatment with NucB and particularly strong reductions were observed in the abundance of anaerobic, proteolytic bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas and Prevotella. Preformed biofilms were not significantly reduced by NucB treatment, indicating that eDNA is more important or more exposed during the early stages of biofilm formation. Overall, these data demonstrate that dental plaque eDNA is potentially an important target for oral biofilm control.","authors":[{"name":"N Rostami"},{"name":"R C Shields"},{"name":"S A Yassin"},{"name":"A R Hawkins"},{"name":"L Bowen"},{"name":"T L Luo"},{"name":"A H Rickard"},{"name":"R Holliday"},{"name":"P M Preshaw"},{"name":"N S Jakubovics"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"dental implants"},{"word":"microbial ecology"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"microscopy"},{"word":"plaque biofilms"}]},"article250":{"pmid":"27769914","title":"The efficacy of photodynamic and photothermal therapy on biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans: An in vitro study.","date":"2017-10-23","abs":"The alternative antibacterial treatments of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) significantly affect microbiota inactivation.

Next, we focus on how inoculation conditions affect the sensitivity of multicellular, floating B. subtilis cultures to small molecule inhibitors. The results suggest that discrepancies in the reported effects of such inhibitors such as D-amino acids are due to inconsistent pre-culture conditions. Furthermore, a recently developed protocol is described for evaluating the contribution of small molecule treatments towards biofilm resistance to antibacterial substances.

With a dedicated computational approach we identified and validated a significantly differentially expressed subnetwork of genes associated with these biofilm phenotypes. Our analysis revealed amino acid metabolism, such as arginine, proline, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, were predominantly upregulated in the HBF phenotype. On the contrary, purine, starch and sucrose metabolism was generally upregulated in the LBF phenotype. The aspartate aminotransferase gene AAT1 was found to be a common member of these amino acid pathways and significantly upregulated in the HBF phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of AAT1 enzyme activity significantly reduced biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that biofilm phenotype is associated with differential regulation of metabolic pathways.

A total of 32 well-characterized MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates and 22 avirulent isolates from a healthy individual were subjected to multilocus sequence typing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a variety of biofilm-associated genes. Additionally, a number of in vitro tests were performed to determine virulence properties.

These isolates formed biofilms within 24h on stainless steel coupons (SSCs) immersed in Bennet's broth and tryptic soy broth at 25°C. Cells in these biofilms showed significantly (P≤0.05) enhanced resistance to a desiccation (43% relative humidity [RH]) compared to those attached to SSCs but not in biofilms. The antimicrobial activities of biofilms formed by these isolates on SSCs against S. aureus at 25°C and 43% RH were determined. Compared to SSCs lacking biofilms formed by CE microorganisms, populations of S. aureus on SSCs harboring CE biofilms were significantly lower (P≤0.05). Results indicate that persistent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus on stainless steel surfaces can be achieved by the presence of biofilms of CE microorganisms.

The results showed an influence of oxygen levels on biofilm production. Biofilm formation was significantly higher (P<0.05) in aerobiosis than in microaerobiosis and anaerobiosis. Cellulose production and RDAR (red, dry, and rough) were expressed only in aerobiosis. In microaerobiosis, the strains expressed the SAW (smooth and white) morphotype, while in anaerobiosis the colonies appeared small and red. The expression of genes involved in cellulose synthesis (csgD and adrA) and quorum sensing (sdiA and luxS) was reduced in microaerobiosis and anaerobiosis in all S. enterica strains tested. This gene expression levels were less reduced in S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis compared to the tested serotypes.

The corn (maize) landrace Chapalote has been grown continuously by subsistence farmers in the Americas since 1000 BC, without the use of fungicides, and the crop remains highly valued by farmers, in part for its natural tolerance to pests. We hypothesized that the pathogen tolerance of Chapalote may, in part, be due to assistance from its endophytes. We previously identified a bacterial endophyte from Chapalote seeds, Burkholderia gladioli strain 3A12, for its ability to combat a diversity of crop pathogens, including Sclerotinia homoeocarpa, the most important fungal disease of creeping bentgrass, a relative of maize used here as a model system. Strain 3A12 represents a unique opportunity to understand the anti-fungal activities of an endophyte associated with a crop variety grown by subsistence farmers since ancient times. Here, microscopy combined with Tn5-mutagenesis demonstrates that the anti-fungal mode of action of 3A12 involves flagella-dependent swarming toward its pathogen target, attachment and biofilm-mediated microcolony formation. The mutant screen revealed that YajQ, a receptor for the secondary messenger c-di-GMP, is a critical signaling system that mediates this endophytic mobility-based defense for its host. Microbes from the traditional seeds of farmers may represent a new frontier in elucidating host-microbe mutualistic interactions.","authors":[{"name":"Hanan R Shehata"},{"name":"Cassandra L Ettinger"},{"name":"Jonathan A Eisen"},{"name":"Manish N Raizada"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Burkholderia gladioli"},{"word":"Chapalote"},{"word":"Sclerotinia homoeocarpa"},{"word":"YajQ"},{"word":"Zea"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"endophyte"}]},"article295":{"pmid":"27756305","title":"BcsZ inhibits biofilm phenotypes and promotes virulence by blocking cellulose production in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Cellulose, a 1,4 beta-glucan polysaccharide, is produced by a variety of organisms including bacteria.

We study the functional role of glycosyltransferases modifying type B flagellin in the 023 and 027 hypervirulent C. difficile lineages by mutagenesis of five putative glycosyltransferases and biosynthetic genes. We reveal their roles in the biosynthesis of the flagellin glycan chain and demonstrate that flagellar post-translational modification affects motility and adhesion-related bacterial properties of these strains. We show that the glycosyltransferases 1 and 2 (GT1 and GT2) are responsible for the sequential addition of a GlcNAc and two rhamnoses, respectively, and that GT3 is associated with the incorporation of a novel sulfonated peptidyl-amido sugar moiety whose structure is reported in our accompanying paper (Bouché, L., Panico, M., Hitchen, P., Binet, D., Sastre, F., Faulds-Pain, A., Valiente, E., Vinogradov, E., Aubry, A., Fulton, K., Twine, S., Logan, S.

Whereas type B modification is not required for flagellar assembly, some mutations that result in truncation or abolition of the glycan reduce bacterial motility and promote autoaggregation and biofilm formation. The complete lack of flagellin modification also significantly reduces adhesion of C. difficile to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells but does not affect activation of human TLR5.

The striking and clinically relevant virulence trait of MTB is its ability to form biofilms and adhere to the host cells. The present study elucidated the effect of iron deprivation on biofilm formation and cell adherence of Mycobacterium smegmatis, a non-pathogenic surrogate of MTB. Firstly, we showed that iron deprivation leads to enhanced cell sedimentation rate and altered colony morphology depicting alterations in cell surface envelope properties. We explored that biofilm formation and cell adherence to polystyrene surface as well as human oral epithelial cells were considerably reduced under iron deprivation both in presence of 2,2 BP (iron chelator) and siderophore mutant Δ011-14 strain.

One of the major causes of biofouling in MBRs is bacterial quorum sensing (QS) via N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) and/or autoinducer-2 (AI-2), enabling intra- and interspecies communications, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate that farnesol can substantially mitigate membrane biofouling in a MBR due to its quorum quenching (QQ) activity. When Candida albicans (a farnesol producing fungus) entrapping polymer beads (AEBs) were placed in the MBR, the rate of transmembrane pressure (TMP) rise-up was substantially decreased, even for lower aeration intensities. This finding corresponds to a specific aeration energy savings of approximately 40% (25% through the physical washing effect and a further 15% through the biological QQ effect of AEBs) compared to conventional MBRs without AEBs. A real-time RT-qPCR analysis revealed that farnesol secreted from C. albicans mitigated the biofilm formation in MBRs via the suppression of AI-2 QS. Successful control of biofouling and energy savings through fungal-to-bacterial QQ could be expanded to the plant scale for MBRs in wastewater treatment with economic feasibility.","authors":[{"name":"Kibaek Lee"},{"name":"Seonki Lee"},{"name":"Sang Hyun Lee"},{"name":"Sang-Ryoung Kim"},{"name":"Hyun-Suk Oh"},{"name":"Pyung-Kyu Park"},{"name":"Kwang-Ho Choo"},{"name":"Yea-Won Kim"},{"name":"Jung-Kee Lee"},{"name":"Chung-Hak Lee"}],"keywords":[]},"article321":{"pmid":"27617484","title":"Periphyton Biofilms Influence Net Methylmercury Production in an Industrially Contaminated System.","date":"2018-06-19","abs":"Mercury (Hg) methylation and methylmercury (MMHg) demethylation activity of periphyton biofilms from the industrially contaminated East Fork Poplar Creek, Tennessee (EFPC) were measured during 2014-2016 using stable Hg isotopic rate assays.

In addition to the intracellular compounds of interest, microalgae can also excrete various extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) into their immediate living environment during their life cycle to form a hydrated biofilm matrix. These microalgal EPS mainly consist of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. Most notably, EPS retain their stable matrix structure and form a 3-D polymer network for cells to interact with each other, and mediate their adhesion to surfaces. EPS also play a role as extracellular energy and carbon sinks. They are also abundant source of structurally and compositionally diverse biopolymers which possess unique bioactivities for special high-value applications, specifically as antivirals, antitumor agents, antioxidants, anticoagulants and anti-inflammatories. Their superior rheological properties also make microalgal EPS particularly useful in mechanical engineering (e.g., biolubricants and drag reducers) and food science/engineering (e.g., thickener and preservatives) applications. The chemical composition and structure of EPS appear to correlate with their applications, but the fundamentals of such relationship are not well understood. This article summarizes previous research on microalgal EPS derived from green algae, diatoms and red algae, including compositions/functions/structure, production, and potential applications. The importance of exopolysaccharides and EPS proteins, with their particular metabolic characteristics, are also described because of their potential high-value applications.

In this study, sequential anaerobic-aerobic biodegradation of NTO was investigated in bioreactors using soil as inoculum. Batch bioassays confirmed microbial reduction of NTO under anaerobic conditions to 3-amino-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (ATO) using pyruvate as electron-donating cosubstrate. However, ATO biodegradation was only observed after the redox condition was switched to aerobic. This study also demonstrated that the high-rate removal of NTO in contaminated water can be attained in a continuous-flow aerated bioreactor. The reactor was first fed ATO as sole energy and nitrogen source prior to NTO addition. After few days, ATO was removed in a sustained fashion by 100%. When NTO was introduced together with electron-donor (pyruvate), NTO degradation increased progressively, reaching a removal efficiency of 93.5%. Mineralization of NTO was evidenced by the partial release of inorganic nitrogen species in the effluent, and lack of ATO accumulation. A plausible hypothesis for these findings is that NTO reduction occurred in anaerobic zones of the biofilm whereas ATO was mineralized in the bulk aerobic zones of the reactor.","authors":[{"name":"Camila L Madeira"},{"name":"Samuel A Speet"},{"name":"Cristina A Nieto"},{"name":"Leif Abrell"},{"name":"Jon Chorover"},{"name":"Reyes Sierra-Alvarez"},{"name":"Jim A Field"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3-Amino-1,2,4-triazol-5-one"},{"word":"3-Nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one"},{"word":"Biodegradation"},{"word":"Insensitive munitions"},{"word":"Soil"}]},"article330":{"pmid":"27750126","title":"Impact of cell cluster size on apparent half-saturation coefficients for oxygen in nitrifying sludge and biofilms.","date":"2017-09-04","abs":"A three-dimensional (3-D) diffusion-reaction model was used to assess the effects of nitrifiers growing in cell clusters on the apparent oxygen half-saturation coefficients in activated sludge flocs.

These cells often show strong interactions through exchanging chemicals, as evident in quorum sensing, to achieve mutualism and division of labor. Here, to achieve stable division of labor, three characteristics are required. First, isogenous cells differentiate into several types. Second, this aggregate of distinct cell types shows better growth than that of isolated cells without interaction and differentiation, by achieving division of labor. Third, this cell aggregate is robust with respect to the number distribution of differentiated cell types. Indeed, theoretical studies have thus far considered how such cooperation is achieved when the ability of cell differentiation is presumed. Here, we address how cells acquire the ability of cell differentiation and division of labor simultaneously, which is also connected with the robustness of a cell society. For this purpose, we developed a dynamical-systems model of cells consisting of chemical components with intracellular catalytic reaction dynamics. The reactions convert external nutrients into internal components for cellular growth, and the divided cells interact through chemical diffusion. We found that cells sharing an identical catalytic network spontaneously differentiate via induction from cell-cell interactions, and then achieve division of labor, enabling a higher growth rate than that in the unicellular case. This symbiotic differentiation emerged for a class of reaction networks under the condition of nutrient limitation and strong cell-cell interactions. Then, robustness in the cell type distribution was achieved, while instability of collective growth could emerge even among the cooperative cells when the internal reserves of products were dominant. The present mechanism is simple and general as a natural consequence of interacting cells with limited resources, and is consistent with the observed behaviors and forms of several aggregates of unicellular organisms.","authors":[{"name":"Jumpei F Yamagishi"},{"name":"Nen Saito"},{"name":"Kunihiko Kaneko"}],"keywords":[]},"article332":{"pmid":"27749085","title":"Polymerase Chain Reaction-Electrospray-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Versus Culture for Bacterial Detection in Septic Arthritis and Osteoarthritis.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Preliminary studies have identified known bacterial pathogens in the knees of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) before arthroplasty.","authors":[{"name":"Michael P Palmer"},{"name":"Rachael Melton-Kreft"},{"name":"Laura Nistico"},{"name":"N Louisa Hiller"},{"name":"Leon H J Kim"},{"name":"Gregory T Altman"},{"name":"Daniel T Altman"},{"name":"Nicholas G Sotereanos"},{"name":"Fen Z Hu"},{"name":"Patrick J De Meo"},{"name":"Garth D Ehrlich"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial infection"},{"word":"fluorescent in situ hybridization"},{"word":"molecular diagnostics"},{"word":"osteoarthritis"},{"word":"septic arthritis"}]},"article333":{"pmid":"27748511","title":"Optimizing carbon dioxide utilization for microalgae biofilm cultivation.","date":"2017-12-15","abs":"The loss of carbon dioxide (CO","authors":[{"name":"Ward Blanken"},{"name":"Stefan Schaap"},{"name":"Sophie Theobald"},{"name":"Arjen Rinzema"},{"name":"René H Wijffels"},{"name":"Marcel Janssen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CO2 utilization efficiency"},{"word":"biomass productivit"},{"word":"carbon dioxide"},{"word":"microalgal biofilm"},{"word":"microalgal growth model"}]},"article334":{"pmid":"27747298","title":"Versatility of Biofilm Matrix Molecules in Staphylococcus epidermidis Clinical Isolates and Importance of Polysaccharide Intercellular Adhesin Expression during High Shear Stress.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections, including those of intravascular catheters, cerebrospinal fluid shunts, and orthopedic implants. Multiple biofilm matrix molecules with heterogeneous characteristics have been identified, including proteinaceous, polysaccharide, and nucleic acid factors.

Clinically, biofilm-mediated infections occur in a variety of anatomical sites with diverse physiological properties. To test the hypothesis that matrix composition exhibits niche specificity, biofilm-related genetic and physical properties were compared between S. epidermidis strains isolated from high-shear and low-shear environments. Among a collection of 105 clinical strains, significantly more isolates from high-shear environments carried the icaADBC operon than did those from low-shear settings (43.9% versus 22.9%, P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in the presence of aap (77.2% versus 75.0%, P > 0.05).

Yet microbial studies at surface-air interfaces are largely survival-oriented, whilst microbial metabolism has overwhelmingly been investigated from the perspective of liquid saturation. This study explored microbial survival and metabolism under desiccation, particularly the influence of relative humidity (RH), surface hygroscopicity, and nutrient availability on the interchange between these two phenomena. The combination of a hygroscopic matrix (i.e., clay or 4,000 MW polyethylene glycol) and high RH resulted in persistent measurable microbial metabolism during desiccation. In contrast, no microbial metabolism was detected at (a) hygroscopic interfaces at low RH, and (b) less hygroscopic interfaces (i.e., sand and plastic/glass) at high or low RH. Cell survival was conversely inhibited at high RH and promoted at low RH, irrespective of surface hygroscopicity. Based on this demonstration of metabolic persistence and survival inhibition at high RH, it was proposed that biofilm metabolic rates might inversely influence whole-biofilm resilience, with 'resilience' defined in this study as a biofilm's capacity to recover from desiccation. The concept of whole-biofilm resilience being promoted by oligotrophy was supported in desiccation-tolerant Arthrobacter spp. biofilms, but not in desiccation-sensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The ability of microbes to interact with surfaces to harness water vapor during desiccation was demonstrated, and potentially to harness oligotrophy (the most ubiquitous natural condition facing microbes) for adaptation to desiccation.","authors":[{"name":"Wendy Stone"},{"name":"Otini Kroukamp"},{"name":"Darren R Korber"},{"name":"Jennifer McKelvie"},{"name":"Gideon M Wolfaardt"}],"keywords":[{"word":"carbon"},{"word":"desiccation"},{"word":"metabolism"},{"word":"relative humidity"},{"word":"surface"}]},"article338":{"pmid":"27746770","title":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Phenotypic and Genotypic Diversity during a 10-year Colonization in the Lungs of a Cystic Fibrosis Patient.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The present study was carried out to understand the adaptive strategies developed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia for chronic colonization of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung.

Sixty point eight percent of the quantified proteins (or 34.5% of the predicted proteome) exhibited significant abundance changes between planktonic and sessile states, demonstrating that haloarchaeal biofilm formation represents a profound lifestyle change on the molecular level. Our results and analysis constitute the first comprehensive study to track molecular changes from planktonic cultures to initial and mature archaeal biofilms on the proteome level. Data are available via ProteomeXchange, identifier PXD003667. Proteins exemplifying different protein expression level profiles were selected, and their corresponding gene transcripts targeted by qRT-PCR to test the feasibility of establishing rapid PCR-based assays for archaeal biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Gerald Losensky"},{"name":"Klaus Jung"},{"name":"Henning Urlaub"},{"name":"Felicitas Pfeifer"},{"name":"Sabrina Fröls"},{"name":"Christof Lenz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Archaea"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Haloarchaea"},{"word":"Microbiology"},{"word":"SWATH"}]},"article344":{"pmid":"27482628","title":"Colonization and Intrusive Invasion of Potato Psyllid by 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum'.","date":"2017-06-29","abs":"Previous studies have shown that the fastidious bacterial plant pathogen 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (CLso) is transmitted circulatively and propagatively by the potato psyllid (PoP) Bactericera cockerelli.

Here we present scenario studies on the fate and transport of nano-to millimetre sized spherical particles like microbeads (100 nm-10 mm) with a state of the art spatiotemporally resolved hydrological model. The model accounts for advective transport, homo- and heteroaggregation, sedimentation-resuspension, polymer degradation, presence of biofilm and burial. Literature data were used to parameterize the model and additionally the attachment efficiency for heteroaggregation was determined experimentally. The attachment efficiency ranged from 0.004 to 0.2 for 70 nm and 1050 nm polystyrene particles aggregating with kaolin or bentonite clays in natural freshwater. Modeled effects of polymer density (1-1.5 kg/L) and biofilm formation were not large, due to the fact that variations in polymer density are largely overwhelmed by excess mass of suspended solids that form heteroaggregates with microplastic. Particle size had a dramatic effect on the modeled fate and retention of microplastic and on the positioning of the accumulation hot spots in the sediment along the river. Remarkably, retention was lowest (18-25%) for intermediate sized particles of about 5 μm, which implies that the smaller submicron particles as well as larger micro- and millimetre sized plastic are preferentially retained. Our results suggest that river hydrodynamics affect microplastic size distributions with profound implications for emissions to marine systems.","authors":[{"name":"Ellen Besseling"},{"name":"Joris T K Quik"},{"name":"Muzhi Sun"},{"name":"Albert A Koelmans"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Fate modeling"},{"word":"Freshwater"},{"word":"Microplastic"},{"word":"Nanoplastic"},{"word":"Particle transport"},{"word":"Sedimentation"}]},"article349":{"pmid":"27742997","title":"Bacterial Contribution in Chronicity of Wounds.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"A wound is damage of a tissue usually caused by laceration of a membrane, generally the skin. Wound healing is accomplished in three stages in healthy individuals, including inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling stages. Healing of wounds normally starts from the inflammatory phase and ends up in the remodeling phase, but chronic wounds remain in an inflammatory stage and do not show progression due to some specific reasons. Chronic wounds are classified in different categories, such as diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), venous leg ulcers (VLU) and pressure ulcer (PU), surgical site infection (SSI), abscess, or trauma ulcers. Globally, the incidence rate of DFU is 1-4 % and prevalence rate is 5.3-10.5 %. However, colonization of pathogenic bacteria at the wound site is associated with wound chronicity. Most chronic wounds contain more than one bacterial species and produce a synergetic effect that results in previously non-virulent bacterial species becoming virulent and causing damage to the host. While investigating bacterial diversity in chronic wounds, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Peptoniphilus, Enterobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Finegoldia, and Serratia were found most frequently in chronic wounds. Recently, it has been observed that bacteria in chronic wounds develop biofilms that contribute to a delay in healing. In a mature biofilm, bacteria grow slowly due to deficiency of nutrients that results in the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. The present review reflects the reasons why acute wounds become chronic. Interesting findings include the bacterial load, which forms biofilms and shows high-level resistance toward antibiotics, which is a threat to human health in general and particularly to some patients who have acute wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Kashif Rahim"},{"name":"Shamim Saleha"},{"name":"Xudong Zhu"},{"name":"Liang Huo"},{"name":"Abdul Basit"},{"name":"Octavio Luiz Franco"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiotics"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Chronic wounds"},{"word":"Resistance"},{"word":"Wound"}]},"article350":{"pmid":"27742449","title":"16S rRNA gene profiling of planktonic and biofilm microbial populations in the Gulf of Guinea using Illumina NGS.","date":"2017-03-03","abs":"16S rRNA gene profiling using a pipeline involving the Greengenes database revealed that bacterial populations in innermost (proximal to the steel surface) and outer regions of biofilms on carbon steel exposed 3 m below the surface at an offshore site in the Gulf of Guinea differed from one another and from seawater.

For phage therapy and other biocontrol purposes it is desirable, especially, not to solely employ MOI to describe what phage quantities have been applied during dosing. Why? Bacterial densities can change between bacterial challenge and phage application, may not be easily determined immediately prior to phage dosing, and/or target bacterial populations may not be homogeneous with regard to phage access and thereby inconsistent in terms of what MOI individual bacteria experience. Toward experiment reproducibility and as practiced generally for antibacterial application, phage dosing instead should be described in terms of concentrations of formulations (phage titers) as well as volumes applied and, in many cases, absolute numbers of phages delivered.

Although a wide range of clinical manifestations from this organism are known, peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) has rarely been reported. ♦ PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peritoneal dialysis patients from all regions in Thailand were eligible for the study if they had peritonitis and either peritoneal fluid or effluent culture positive for B. pseudomallei. Patient data obtained included baseline characteristics, laboratory investigations, treatments, and clinical outcomes. When possible, PD fluid and removed Tenckhoff (TK) catheters were submitted for analyses of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and microbial biofilm, respectively. ♦ RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were identified who were positive for peritoneal B. pseudomallei infection. The recorded mean age was 50 ± 15 (24 - 75) years, and the majority (58%) were female. Most of the cases were farmers living in Northeastern and Northern Thailand. Almost half of the cases had diabetes. Infections were reported commonly during the monsoon season and winter. The clinical presentations of peritonitis were similar to the manifestations from other microorganisms. Nine patients (41%) died (7 from sepsis), 6 fully recovered, and 7 switched to permanent hemodialysis. The mortality was potentially associated with sepsis (p = 0.007), infection during the monsoon season (p = 0.017), high initial dialysate neutrophils (p = 0.045), and high hematocrit (p = 0.045). Although no antibiotic resistance to ceftazidime and carbapenems was detected, approximately 50% of patients died with this treatment. Microbial biofilms were identified on the luminal surface of 4 out of 5 TK catheters, but the removal of the catheter did not alter the outcomes. ♦ CONCLUSION: Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis due to melioidosis is uncommon but highly fatal.

A total of 211 clinical XDR and 38 susceptible clinical Pa isolates (nonXDR), as well as 47 environmental isolates (EI), were collected at the Heidelberg University Hospital. We used RAPD PCR to identify genetic clusters. Carriage of carbapenamases (CPM) and virulence genes were analyzed by PCR, biofilm formation capacity was assessed, in vitro fitness was evaluated using competitive growth assays, and interaction with the host's immune system was analyzed using serum killing and neutrophil killing assays. XDR isolates showed significantly elevated biofilm formation (p < 0.05) and higher competitive fitness compared to nonXDR and EI isolates. Thirty percent (62/205) of the XDR isolates carried a CPM. Similarities in distribution of virulence factors, as well as biofilm formation properties, between CPM+ Pa isolates and EI and between CPM- and nonXDR isolates were detected. Molecular typing revealed two distinct genetic clusters within the XDR population, which were characterized by even higher biofilm formation. In contrast, XDR isolates were more susceptible to the immune response than nonXDR isolates.

Isolation of fungi from speleothem biofilm covering bare granite walls in the Kungsträdgården metro station in Stockholm yielded axenic cultures of two distinct black yeast morphotypes. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from six nuclear loci, ITS, nuc18S and nuc28S rDNA, rpb1, rpb2 and β-tubulin, support their placement in the Chaetothyriales (Ascomycota). They are described as a new genus Bacillicladium with the type species B. lobatum, and a new species Bradymyces graniticola. Bacillicladium is distantly related to the known five chaetothyrialean families and is unique in the Chaetothyriales by variable morphology showing hyphal, meristematic and yeast-like growth in vitro. The nearest relatives of Bacillicladium are recruited among fungi isolated from cardboard-like construction material produced by arboricolous non-attine ants. Their sister relationship is weakly supported by the Maximum likelihood analysis, but strongly supported by Bayesian inference. The genus Bradymyces is placed amidst members of the Trichomeriaceae and is ecologically undefined; it includes an opportunistic animal pathogen while two other species inhabit rock surfaces. ITS rDNA sequences of three species accepted in Bradymyces and other undescribed species and environmental samples were subjected to phylogenetic analysis and in-depth comparative analysis of ITS1 and ITS2 secondary structures in order to study their intraspecific variability. Compensatory base change criterion in the ITS2 secondary structure supported delimitation of species in Bradymyces, which manifest a limited number of phenotypic features useful for species recognition.

This phenotype is the consequence of a general downregulation of all the genes involved in the biosynthesis of flagella, suggesting that zinc is the cofactor of proteins involved in the initiation of the transcriptional regulatory cascade leading to flagella assembly. Competition experiments in mice demonstrated that aflagellated (fliBfljC) and znuABC strains are outcompeted by the wild type strain in the gastrointestinal tract. The fliBfljC strain overgrows a fliCfljBznuABC mutant strain, but the difference in gut colonization between these two strains is less striking than that between the wild type and the znuABC strains, suggesting that the downregulation of flagella contributes to the loss of virulence of Salmonella znuABC. The absence of either flagella or ZnuABC also impairs the ability of S. Typhimurium to produce biofilms. Zinc suppresses this defect in the znuABC mutant but not in the aflagellated strains, highlighting the role of flagella in biofilm organization.

In this work, we have further evaluated in detail the eradication of Sau biofilms and investigated ultrastructural interactions of the biofilmicidal effect. Spn strain D39, which produces the competence stimulating peptide 1 (CSP1), reduced Sau biofilms within 8 h of inoculation, while TIGR4, producing CSP2, eradicated Sau biofilms and planktonic cells within 4 h. Differences were not attributed to pherotypes as other Spn strains producing different pheromones eradicated Sau within 4 h. Experiments using Transwell devices, which physically separated both species growing in the same well, demonstrated that direct contact between Spn and Sau was required to efficiently eradicate Sau biofilms and biofilm-released planktonic cells. Physical contact-mediated killing of Sau was not related to production of hydrogen peroxide as an isogenic TIGR4ΔspxB mutant eradicated Sau bacteria within 4 h. Confocal micrographs confirmed eradication of Sau biofilms by TIGR4 and allowed us to visualize ultrastructural point of contacts between Sau and Spn. A time-course study further demonstrated spatial colocalization of Spn chains and Sau tetrads as early as 30 min post-inoculation (Pearson's coefficient >0.72).

The present article reports that the extracellular matrix of an oleolytic biofilm formed by Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus at n-hexadecane-water interfaces is largely composed of proteins typically cytoplasmic such as translation factors and chaperones, and a lesser amount of proteins of unknown function that are predicted extra-cytoplasmic. Matrix proteins appear to form a structured film on hydrophobic interfaces and were found mandatory for the development of biofilms on lipids, alkanes and polystyrene. Exo-proteins secreted through the type-2 secretion system (T2SS) were shown to be essential for the formation of oleolytic biofilms on both alkanes and triglycerides. The T2SS effector involved in biofilm formation on triglycerides was identified as a lipase. In the case of biofilm formation on n-hexadecane, the T2SS effector is likely involved in the mass transfer, capture or transport of alkanes. We propose that M. hydrocarbonoclasticus uses cytoplasmic proteins released by cell lysis to form a proteinaceous matrix and dedicated proteins secreted through the T2SS to act specifically in the assimilation pathways of hydrophobic substrates.","authors":[{"name":"Habiba Ennouri"},{"name":"Paul d'Abzac"},{"name":"Florence Hakil"},{"name":"Priscilla Branchu"},{"name":"Murielle Naïtali"},{"name":"Anne-Marie Lomenech"},{"name":"Ridha Oueslati"},{"name":"Jacques Desbrières"},{"name":"Pierre Sivadon"},{"name":"Régis Grimaud"}],"keywords":[]},"article391":{"pmid":"27727499","title":"Lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibits Candida albicans virulence factors in vitro and modulates immune system in Galleria mellonella.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential anti-Candida effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 9595 on Candida albicans ATCC 18804 using in vitro and in vivo models.","authors":[{"name":"F C Ribeiro"},{"name":"P P de Barros"},{"name":"R D Rossoni"},{"name":"J C Junqueira"},{"name":"A O C Jorge"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Lactobacillus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"gene expression"},{"word":"probiotics"},{"word":"yeasts"}]},"article392":{"pmid":"27726768","title":"Prosthetic Device Infections.","date":"2020-01-08","abs":"The immunocompromised host is a particularly vulnerable population in whom routine and unusual infections can easily and frequently occur. Prosthetic devices are commonly used in these patients and the infections associated with those devices present a number of challenges for both the microbiologist and the clinician. Biofilms play a major role in device-related infections, which may contribute to failed attempts to recover organisms from routine culture methods. Moreover, device-related microorganisms can be difficult to eradicate by antibiotic therapy alone. Changes in clinical practice and advances in laboratory diagnostics have provided significant improvements in the detection and accurate diagnosis of device-related infections. Disruption of the bacterial biofilm plays an essential role in recovering the causative agent in culture. Various culture and nucleic acid amplification techniques are more accurate to guide directed treatment regimens.

It is a versatile facultative intracellular pathogen capable of growth within the host's cytosolic compartment. Following entry into the host cell, L. monocytogenes escapes from vacuolar compartments to the cytosol, where the bacterium begins a remarkable journey within the host cytoplasm, culminating in bacterial spread from cell to cell, to deeper tissues and organs. This dissemination process depends on the ability of the bacterium to harness central components of the host cell actin cytoskeleton using the surface bound bacterial factor ActA (actin assembly inducing protein). Hence ActA plays a major role in listerial virulence, and its absence renders bacteria intracellularly immotile and essentially non-infectious. As the bacterium, moving by building a network of filamentous actin behind itself that is often referred to as its actin tail, encounters cell-cell contacts it forms double-vacuolar protrusions that allow it to enter the neighboring cell where the cycle then continues. Recent studies have now implicated ActA in other stages of the life cycle of L. monocytogenes. These include extracellular properties of aggregation and biofilm formation to mediate colonization of the gut lumen, promotion and enhancement of bacterial host cell entry, evasion of autophagy, vacuolar exit, as well as nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NF-κB) activation. These novel properties provide a new view of ActA and help explain its role as an essential virulence factor of L. monocytogenes.","authors":[{"name":"Helena Pillich"},{"name":"Madhu Puri"},{"name":"Trinad Chakraborty"}],"keywords":[]},"article395":{"pmid":"27725325","title":"Ureteral stent encrustation. Pathophysiology.","date":"2017-02-14","abs":"Ureteral stents are the most commonly used urological implants. They are used for temporary as well as for long-term ureteral stenting. Amongst others, complications of ureteral stenting are encrustation and cellular adherence which, in turn, promotes urinary tract infection and can induce impaired healing in case of ureteral damage. Biofilm formation on urological implants leads to the protection of persisting bacteria from local defense mechanisms, thereby rendering persistent urinary tract infections more common. It seems clear that antibiotics cannot penetrate into biofilms adequately. Also, bacteria persist in biofilms in a state of reduced metabolism which further reduces antibiotic efficacy. Furthermore, bacteria develop resistance more quickly in biofilms. This paper tries to give an overview of the complex pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie stent encrustation as far as we know to date.","authors":[{"name":"W Kram"},{"name":"N Buchholz"},{"name":"O W Hakenberg"}],"keywords":[]},"article396":{"pmid":"27725324","title":"Urinary tract infections associated with ureteral stents: A Review.","date":"2017-02-14","abs":"We review the literature on infections associated with ureteral stents and new technologies aimed at preventing them.

Y. pestis is evolved into a deadly pathogen and transmitted to mammals and/or human beings by infected flea biting or directly contacting with the infected animals. Various kinds of environmental changes are implicated into its complex life cycle and pathogenesis. Dynamic regulation of gene expression is critical for environmental adaptation or survival, primarily reflected by genetic regulation mediated by transcriptional factors and small regulatory RNAs at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level, respectively. The effects of genetic regulation have been shown to profoundly influence Y. pestis physiology and pathogenesis such as stress resistance, biofilm formation, intracellular survival, and replication. In this chapter, we mainly summarize the progresses on popular methods of genetic regulation and on regulatory patterns and consequences of many key transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators, with a particular emphasis on how genetic regulation influences the biofilm and virulence of Y. pestis.","authors":[{"name":"Yanping Han"},{"name":"Haihong Fang"},{"name":"Lei Liu"},{"name":"Dongsheng Zhou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Gene expression"},{"word":"Regulation"},{"word":"Virulence"},{"word":"Yersinia pestis"}]},"article399":{"pmid":"27722864","title":"Pathology and Pathogenesis of Yersinia pestis.","date":"2017-10-04","abs":"Various types of animal models of plague have been developed, including mice, rats, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates.

In this section, the pathological changes caused by Y. pestis in different animal models are described. The bacterium Y. pestis causes deadly plague, whereas the other two closely related enteropathogenic Yersinia species merely cause limited gastrointestinal manifestations. Y. pestis has unique virulence mechanisms that enable it to be a successful flea-borne and highly virulent pathogen. Massive gene losses and inactivation play important roles, as well as the gene acquisitions, in the evolution process of this pathogen. Here, we summarized several newly acquired features of Y. pestis, including the unique lipid A modification, biofilm formation ability, and loss of adhesions for enteric colonization that are realized by gene inactivation and plasminogen activator and F1 capsular that are realized by gene acquisition, which contribute to the unique transmission and pathogenesis of Y. pestis.","authors":[{"name":"Zongmin Du"},{"name":"Xiaoyi Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Molecular mechanism"},{"word":"Pathogenesis"},{"word":"Pathology"},{"word":"Y. pestis"}]}}
