The ratio of suspension-cells/biofilm-cells was employed to indicate the diatom biofilm formation abilities. The soluble EPS from the supernatant of whole culture, tightly bound EPS from floating cells, loosely and tightly bound EPS from biofilm cells were fractionated as SL-EPS, F-TB-EPS, BF-LB-EPS and BF-TB-EPS, respectively. The analysis for productions and monosaccharide compositions indicated that EPS from two diatoms were different in terms of the productions, distributions, and monomer compositions. Amphora sp. produced more (1.5-fold) total exopolysaccharides, but less (<0.4-fold) BF-TB-EPS than Stauroneis sp. The monosaccharides of the EPS from Amphora sp. were more diverse than those of Stauroneis sp., with 13 and 10 monomers, respectively. Neutral sugars, Glc, Xyl and Man, were abundant in Stauroneis sp., while Gal, Glc and Xyl were rich in Amphora sp. Uronic acid and hexosamine were present in all fractions of two diatoms, especially Glc-A being the most abundant monomer in SL-EPS of Amphora sp. It was proposed that the high content of uronic acid (especially Glc-A) might be crucial for the strong biofilm formation abilities of Amphora sp.","authors":[{"name":"Cuili Jin"},{"name":"Zhaowei Yu"},{"name":"Shuya Peng"},{"name":"K E Feng"},{"name":"Likui Zhang"},{"name":"Xiaojian Zhou"}],"keywords":[]},"article1":{"pmid":"29898057","title":"Glass Ionomer Cements can be used for Bonding Orthodontic Brackets After Cancer Radiation Treatment?","date":"2018-12-11","abs":"Patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment present more susceptibility to dental caries and the use of an orthodontic device increases this risk factor due to biofilm accumulation around the brackets.

After the radiotherapy, the brackets were bonded on the specimens with Transbond XT, Fuji Ortho LC and Ketac Cem Easymix. After 24 h, the specimens were subjected to shear bond strength test. The image of enamel surface (classified by Adhesive Remnant Index - ARI) was also evaluated and its frequency was checked among groups/subgroups. The shear bond strength variable was evaluated with ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test. GIC group showed the lowest adhesion values among the groups (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference among non-irradiated and irradiated groups (p>0.05). As for the ARI, the CR-I group showed the highest material retention on enamel surface among the irradiated groups.

While competent pneumococci are able to scavenge DNA added to laboratory cultures, large-scale transfers of multiple kb are rare under these conditions. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to map transfers in recombinants arising from contact of competent cells with non-competent 'target' cells, using strains with known genomes, distinguished by a total of ~16,000 SNPs. Experiments designed to explore the effect of environment on large scale recombination events used saturating purified donor DNA, short-term cell assemblages on Millipore filters, and mature biofilm mixed cultures. WGS of 22 recombinants for each environment mapped all SNPs that were identical between the recombinant and the donor but not the recipient. The mean recombination event size was found to be significantly larger in cell-to-cell contact cultures (4051 bp in filter assemblage and 3938 bp in biofilm co-culture versus 1815 bp with saturating DNA). Up to 5.8% of the genome was transferred, through 20 recombination events, to a single recipient, with the largest single event incorporating 29,971 bp. We also found that some recombination events are clustered, that these clusters are more likely to occur in cell-to-cell contact environments, and that they cause significantly increased linkage of genes as far apart as 60,000 bp.

However, the mechanism of biofilm formation of S. sanguinis is still unclear. Here, we showed that deletion of a transcription factor, brpL, promotes cell aggregation and biofilm formation in S. sanguinis SK36. Glucan, a polysaccharide synthesized from sucrose, was over-produced and aggregated in the biofilm of ΔbrpL, which was necessary for better biofilm formation ability of ΔbrpL. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that gtfP was significantly up-regulated in ΔbrpL, which increased the productions of water-insoluble and water-soluble glucans. The ΔbrpLΔgtfP double mutant decreased biofilm formation ability of ΔbrpL to a level similar like that of ΔgtfP. Interestingly, the biofilm of ΔbrpL had an increased tolerance to ampicillin treatment, which might be due to better biofilm formation ability through the mechanisms of cellular and glucan aggregation. RNA sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR revealed the modulation of a group of genes in ΔbrpL was mediated by activating the expression of ciaR, another gtfP-related biofilm formation regulator. Double deletion of brpL and ciaR decreased biofilm formation ability to the phenotype of a ΔciaR mutant. Additionally, RNA sequencing elucidated a broad range of genes, related to carbohydrate metabolism and uptake, were activated in ΔbrpL. SSA_0222, a gene involved in the phosphotransferase system, was dramatically up-regulated in ΔbrpL and essential for S. sanguinis survival under our experimental conditions.

In order to establish an infection, this pathogen supports effective stress responses to counter host defenses and adapts to changes in the availability of important nutrients, such as alternative carbon sources. These stress responses have clear implications on the composition and structure of Candida cell wall. Therefore, we studied the impact of lactate, a physiologically relevant carbon source, on the activity of C. albicans RLM1 transcriptional factor. RLM1 is involved in the cell wall integrity pathway and plays an important role in regulating the flow of carbohydrates into cell wall biosynthesis pathways. The role of C. albicans RLM1 in response to lactate adaptation was assessed in respect to several virulence factors, such as the ability to grow under cell wall damaging agents, filament, adhere or form biofilm, as well as to immune recognition. The data showed that growth of C. albicans cells in the presence of lactate induces the secretion of tartaric acid, which has the potential to modulate the TCA cycle on both the yeast and the host cells. In addition, we found that adaptation of C. albicans cells to lactate reduces their internalization by immune cells and consequent % of killing, which could be correlated with a lower exposure of the cell wall β-glucans. In addition, absence of RLM1 has a minor impact on internalization, compared with the wild-type and complemented strains, but it reduces the higher efficiency of lactate grown cells at damaging phagocytic cells and induces a high amount of IL-10, rendering these cells more tolerable to the immune system. The data suggests that RLM1 mediates cell wall remodeling during carbon adaptation, impacting their interaction with immune cells.","authors":[{"name":"João Oliveira-Pacheco"},{"name":"Rosana Alves"},{"name":"Augusto Costa-Barbosa"},{"name":"Bruno Cerqueira-Rodrigues"},{"name":"Patricia Pereira-Silva"},{"name":"Sandra Paiva"},{"name":"Sónia Silva"},{"name":"Mariana Henriques"},{"name":"Célia Pais"},{"name":"Paula Sampaio"}],"keywords":[{"word":"C. albicans"},{"word":"RLM1"},{"word":"alternative carbon sources"},{"word":"candidiasis"},{"word":"carbon adaptation"},{"word":"cell wall remodeling"},{"word":"lactate"}]},"article10":{"pmid":"29895757","title":"Self-Assembled Nanoporous Biofilms from Functionalized Nanofibrous M13 Bacteriophage.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"Highly periodic and uniform nanostructures, based on a genetically engineered M13 bacteriophage, displayed unique properties at the nanoscale that have the potential for a variety of applications.

In culture, Symbiodinium spp. and naturally associated bacteria are known to form calcifying biofilms that produce so-called symbiolites, i.e., aragonitic microbialites that incorporate Symbiodinium as endolithic cells. In this study, we investigated (i) how algal growth and the combined physiological activity of these bacterial-algal associations affect the physicochemical macroenvironment in culture and the microenvironment within bacterial-algal biofilms, and (ii) how these interactions induce the formation of symbiolites.

In 1952, Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator-inhibitor birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with no severe requirement on the ratio of activator-inhibitor diffusion coefficients. To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules form a stochastic activator-inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity, can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.","authors":[{"name":"David Karig"},{"name":"K Michael Martini"},{"name":"Ting Lu"},{"name":"Nicholas A DeLateur"},{"name":"Nigel Goldenfeld"},{"name":"Ron Weiss"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Turing patterns"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"signaling molecules"},{"word":"stochastic gene expression"},{"word":"synthetic biology"}]},"article26":{"pmid":"29891547","title":"A Light-Regulated Type I Pilus Contributes to Acinetobacter baumannii Biofilm, Motility, and Virulence Functions.","date":"2019-03-05","abs":"Transcriptional analyses of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 showed that the expression of A1S_2091 was enhanced in cells cultured in darkness at 24°C through a process that depended on the BlsA photoreceptor.

They can also include authigenic mineral precipitates that may preserve signs of biological activity on Earth and possibly other planets. The abiogenic or biogenic origins of such precipitates can be difficult to discern, therefore a better understanding of mineral formation processes is critical for the accurate interpretation of biosignatures from hot springs. Little Hot Creek (LHC) is a hot spring complex located in the Long Valley Caldera, California, that contains mineral precipitates composed of a carbonate base (largely submerged) topped by amorphous silica (largely emergent). The precipitates occur in close association with microbial mats and biofilms. Geological, geochemical, and microbiological data are consistent with mineral formation via degassing and evaporation rather than direct microbial involvement. However, the microfabric of the silica portion is stromatolitic in nature (i.e., wavy and finely laminated), suggesting that abiogenic mineralization has the potential to preserve textural biosignatures. Although geochemical and petrographic evidence suggests the calcite base was precipitated via abiogenic processes, endolithic microbial communities modified the structure of the calcite crystals, producing a textural biosignature. Our results reveal that even when mineral precipitation is largely abiogenic, the potential to preserve biosignatures in hot spring settings is high.

Here, we combine experimental and computational approaches to investigate potential benefits arising from division of labor during biofilm matrix production. We show that both phenotypic and genetic strategies for a division of labor can promote collective biofilm formation in the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In this species, biofilm matrix consists of two major components, exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and TasA. We observed that clonal groups of B. subtilis phenotypically segregate into three subpopulations composed of matrix non-producers, EPS producers, and generalists, which produce both EPSs and TasA. This incomplete phenotypic specialization was outperformed by a genetic division of labor, where two mutants, engineered as specialists, complemented each other by exchanging EPSs and TasA. The relative fitness of the two mutants displayed a negative frequency dependence both in vitro and on plant roots, with strain frequency reaching a stable equilibrium at 30% TasA producers, corresponding exactly to the population composition where group productivity is maximized. Using individual-based modeling, we show that asymmetries in strain ratio can arise due to differences in the relative benefits that matrix compounds generate for the collective and that genetic division of labor can be favored when it breaks metabolic constraints associated with the simultaneous production of two matrix components.","authors":[{"name":"Anna Dragoš"},{"name":"Heiko Kiesewalter"},{"name":"Marivic Martin"},{"name":"Chih-Yu Hsu"},{"name":"Raimo Hartmann"},{"name":"Tobias Wechsler"},{"name":"Carsten Eriksen"},{"name":"Susanne Brix"},{"name":"Knut Drescher"},{"name":"Nicola Stanley-Wall"},{"name":"Rolf Kümmerli"},{"name":"Ákos T Kovács"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bacillus subtilis"},{"word":"EPS"},{"word":"TasA"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"competition"},{"word":"cooperation"},{"word":"division of labor"},{"word":"pellicle"},{"word":"phenotypic heterogeneity"},{"word":"plant colonization"}]},"article40":{"pmid":"29886982","title":"Multiple stressors and benthic harmful algal blooms (BHABs): Potential effects of temperature rise and nutrient enrichment.","date":"2018-10-31","abs":"Blooms of Ostreopsis cf. ovata, causing health incidence and mass human intoxications in the Mediterranean, gained special attention over the past decades.

If these were bioinfluenced constructions, they could be priority targets in the search for early and extraterrestrial microbial life. However, there are questions over whether such chimneys are built on a geobiological framework or are solely abiotic geomorphological features produced by mixing of lake and spring waters. Here, we use correlative microscopy to show that microbes were living around Pleistocene Mono Lake carbonate chimneys during their growth. A plausible interpretation, in line with some recent works by others on other lacustrine carbonates, is that benthic cyanobacteria and their associated extracellular organic material (EOM) formed tubular biofilms around rising sublacustrine spring vent waters, binding calcium ions and trapping and binding detrital silicate sediment. Decay of these biofilms would locally have increased calcium and carbonate ion activity, inducing calcite precipitation on and around the biofilms. Early manganese carbonate mineralisation was directly associated with cell walls, potentially related to microbial activity though the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. Much of the calcite crystal growth was likely abiotic, and no strong evidence for either authigenic silicate growth or a clay mineral precursor framework was observed. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the biofilms provided initial sites for calcite nucleation and encouraged the primary organised crystal growth. We suggest that the nano-, micro- and macroscale fabrics of these Pleistocene Mono Lake chimneys were affected by the presence of centimetre-thick tubular and vertically stacked calcifying microbial mats. Such carbonate chimneys represent a promising macroscale target in the exploration for ancient or extraterrestrial life.","authors":[{"name":"Alexander Brasier"},{"name":"David Wacey"},{"name":"Mike Rogerson"},{"name":"Paul Guagliardo"},{"name":"Martin Saunders"},{"name":"Siri Kellner"},{"name":"Ramon Mercedes-Martin"},{"name":"Tim Prior"},{"name":"Colin Taylor"},{"name":"Anna Matthews"},{"name":"John Reijmer"}],"keywords":[]},"article57":{"pmid":"29885070","title":"Expression and regulation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa hibernation promoting factor.","date":"2019-07-09","abs":"Bacterial biofilms contain subpopulations of cells that are dormant and highly tolerant to antibiotics.

Bacterial biofilms are clinically relevant, as they are responsible for up to two-thirds of hospital acquired infections and contribute to chronic infections. Troublingly, the bacteria within a biofilm are adaptively resistant to antibiotic treatment and it can take up to 1000 times more antibiotic to kill cells within a biofilm when compared to planktonic bacterial cells. Identifying and optimizing compounds that specifically target bacteria growing in biofilms is required to address this growing concern and the reported antibiofilm activity of natural and synthetic host defence peptides has garnered significant interest. However, a standardized assay to assess the activity of antibiofilm agents has not been established. In the present work, we describe two simple assays that can assess the inhibitory and eradication capacities of peptides towards biofilms that are formed by both Gram-positive and negative bacteria. These assays are suitable for high-throughput workflows in 96-well microplates and they use crystal violet staining to quantify adhered biofilm biomass as well as tetrazolium chloride dye to evaluate the metabolic activity of the biofilms. The effect of media composition on the readouts of these biofilm detection methods was assessed against two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1 and PA14), as well as a methicillin resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Our results demonstrate that media composition dramatically alters the staining patterns that were obtained with these dye-based methods, highlighting the importance of establishing appropriate biofilm growth conditions for each bacterial species to be evaluated. Confocal microscopy imaging of P. aeruginosa biofilms grown in flow cells revealed that this is likely due to altered biofilm architecture under specific growth conditions. The antibiofilm activity of several antibiotics and synthetic peptides were then evaluated under both inhibition and eradication conditions to illustrate the type of data that can be obtained using this experimental setup.","authors":[{"name":"Evan F Haney"},{"name":"Michael J Trimble"},{"name":"John T Cheng"},{"name":"Quentin Vallé"},{"name":"Robert E W Hancock"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofilm peptides"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"high-throughput assay"}]},"article64":{"pmid":"29883284","title":"Non-antibiotic antimicrobial interventions and antimicrobial stewardship in wound care.","date":"2019-09-30","abs":"Control of wound infection today relies largely on antibiotics, but the continual emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms threatens a return to the pre-antibiotic era when physicians used antiseptics to prevent and manage infection.

The biological mechanisms by which immersion in mineral-medicinal water and the application of mud alleviate symptoms of several pathologies are still not completely understood, but it is known that neuroendocrine and immunological responses—including both humoral and cell-mediated immunity—to balneotherapy are involved in these mechanisms of effectiveness; leading to anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, chondroprotective, and anabolic effects together with neuroendocrine-immune regulation in different conditions. Hormesis can play a critical role in all these biological effects and mechanisms of effectiveness. The hormetic effects of balneotherapy can be related to non-specific factors such as heat—which induces the heat shock response, and therefore the synthesis and release of heat shock proteins—and also to specific biochemical components such as hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in sulfurous water and radon in radioactive water. Results from several investigations suggest that the beneficial effects of balneotherapy and hydrotherapy are consistent with the concept of hormesis, and thus support a role for hormesis in hydrothermal treatments.","authors":[{"name":"Barbara Bellich"},{"name":"Cristina Lagatolla"},{"name":"Alessandro Tossi"},{"name":"Monica Benincasa"},{"name":"Paola Cescutti"},{"name":"Roberto Rizzo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"bacterial biofilm"},{"word":"bacterial protection"},{"word":"exopolysaccharides biological activity"},{"word":"matrix exopolysaccharides"}]},"article69":{"pmid":"29882414","title":"Streptococcus sanguinis biofilm formation & interaction with oral pathogens.","date":"2018-12-14","abs":"Caries and periodontitis are the two most common human dental diseases and are caused by dysbiosis of oral flora.

Skin and soft tissue infections have been observed to be caused by many coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms: Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus simulans. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus skin infections predominantly present as abscesses and paronychia.

This study investigated the efficacy of selenium for inhibiting and inactivating UPEC biofilms on urinary catheters. Urinary catheters were inoculated with UPEC and treated with 0 and 35 mM selenium at 37 °C for 5 days for the biofilm inhibition assay. In addition, catheters with preformed UPEC biofilms were treated with 0, 45, 60, and 85 mM selenium and incubated at 37 °C.

Additionally, the effect of selenium on exopolysacchride (EPS) production and expression of UPEC biofilm-associated genes was evaluated. Selenium at 35 mM concentration was effective in preventing UPEC biofilm formation on catheters compared to controls (p < 0.05). Further, this inhibitory effect was associated with a reduction in EPS production and UPEC gene expression. Moreover, at higher concentrations, selenium was effective in inactivating preformed UPEC biofilms on catheters as early as day 3 of incubation.

Several layers of regulation like subtelomeric silencing, cis-acting regulatory regions, activators, nutritional signaling, and stress conditions tightly regulate the expression of many adhesin-encoding genes in C. glabrata, while many others are not expressed. Importantly, there is a connection between acquired resistance to xenobiotics and increased adherence; (3) Other subfamilies of adhesins mediate adherence to Candida albicans, allowing C. glabrata to efficiently invade the oral epithelium and form robust biofilms.

These types of wounds also present challenges such as infection and potentially house antimicrobial-tolerant biofilms. The use of wound cleansers to aid cleaning and debridement of the wound is essential. A large proportion of skin and wound cleansers contain surfactants but there is only a small amount of data that shows the effectiveness of them in the enhancement of wound closure. This review paper aims to explore the available literature surrounding the use and mode of action of surfactants in wound healing, in particular Poloxamer 188 (Pluronic F-68) and Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F-127), and also uncover the potential mechanisms behind the enhancement of wound healing and comparison to other surfactants used in wound care.

The population groups at high risk of death from bacterial pneumonia are infants, elderly and immunosuppressed people. These groups are more vulnerable because they have immature or impaired immune systems, the efficacy of their response to vaccines is lower, and antibiotic treatment often does not take place until the inflammatory response triggered is already overwhelming. The immune response to bacterial lung infections involves dynamic interactions between several types of cells whose activation is driven by intracellular molecular networks. A feasible approach to the integration of knowledge and data linking tissue, cellular and intracellular events and the construction of hypotheses in this area is the use of mathematical modeling. For this paper, we used a multi-level computational model to analyse the role of cellular and molecular interactions during the first 10 h after alveolar invasion of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. By multi-level we mean that we simulated the interplay between different temporal and spatial scales in a single computational model. In this instance, we included the intracellular scale of processes driving lung epithelial cell activation together with the scale of cell-to-cell interactions at the alveolar tissue. In our analysis, we combined systematic model simulations with logistic regression analysis and decision trees to find genotypic-phenotypic signatures that explain differences in bacteria strain infectivity. According to our simulations, pneumococci benefit from a high dwelling probability and a high proliferation rate during the first stages of infection. In addition to this, the model predicts that during the very early phases of infection the bacterial capsule could be an impediment to the establishment of the alveolar infection because it impairs bacterial colonization.","authors":[{"name":"Guido Santos"},{"name":"Xin Lai"},{"name":"Martin Eberhardt"},{"name":"Julio Vera"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus pneumoniae"},{"word":"alveolar infection"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"mathematical modeling"},{"word":"pneumonia"}]},"article116":{"pmid":"29868500","title":"Anti-quorum Sensing Activities of Selected Coral Symbiotic Bacterial Extracts From the South China Sea.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"The worldwide increase in antibiotic-resistant pathogens means that identification of alternative antibacterial drug targets and the subsequent development of new treatment strategies are urgently required. One such new target is the quorum sensing (QS) system. Coral microbial consortia harbor an enormous diversity of microbes, and are thus rich sources for isolating novel bioactive and pharmacologically valuable natural products. However, to date, the versatility of their bioactive compounds has not been broadly explored. In this study, about two hundred bacterial colonies were isolated from a coral species (Pocillopora damicornis) and screened for their ability to inhibit QS using the bioreporter strain Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472. Approximately 15% (30 isolates) exhibited anti-QS activity, against the indicator strain. Among them, a typical Gram-positive bacterium, D11 (Staphylococcus hominis) was identified and its anti-QS activity was investigated. Confocal microscopy observations showed that the bacterial extract inhibited the biofilm formation of clinical isolates of wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 in a dose-dependent pattern. Chromatographic separation led to the isolation of a potent QS inhibitor that was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as DL-homocysteine thiolactone. Gene expression analyses using RT-PCR showed that strain D11 led to a significant down-regulation of QS regulatory genes (lasI, lasR, rhlI, and rhlR), as well as a virulence-related gene (lasB). From the chemical structure, the target compound (DL-homocysteine thiolactone) is an analog of the acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), and we presume that DL-homocysteine thiolactone outcompetes AHL in occupying the receptor and thereby inhibiting QS. Whole-genome sequence analysis of S. hominis D11 revealed the presence of predicted genes involved in the biosynthesis of homocysteine thiolactone. This study indicates that coral microbes are a resource bank for developing QS inhibitors and they will facilitate the discovery of new biotechnologically relevant compounds that could be used instead of traditional antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Ping Ma"},{"name":"Yu Song"},{"name":"Zhong-Hua Cai"},{"name":"Zhi-Jun Lin"},{"name":"Guang-Hui Lin"},{"name":"Yan Wang"},{"name":"Jin Zhou"}],"keywords":[{"word":"HPLC-MS-NMR"},{"word":"S. hominis"},{"word":"anti-quorum sensing"},{"word":"coral microbes"},{"word":"marine drug"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"29868495","title":"In-Group Communication in Marine Vibrio: A Review of N-Acyl Homoserine Lactones-Driven Quorum Sensing.","date":"2019-02-15","abs":"N-Acyl Homoserine Lactones (N-AHLs) are an important group of small quorum-sensing molecules generated and released into the surroundings by Gram-negative bacteria.

Interactions among the Mfa proteins and the polymerization mechanism for Mfa1 are poorly understood. Here we show that Mfa3 can bind to Mfa1, 2, 4, and 5 in vitro, and may function as an adaptor protein interlinking other fimbrial subunits. Polymerization of Mfa1 is independent of Mfa3-5 and requires proteolytic processing mediated by the RgpA/B arginine gingipains of P. gingivalis. Both the N- and C- terminal regions of Mfa1 are necessary for polymerization; however, potential β-strand disrupting amino acid substitutions in these regions do not impair Mfa1 polymerization. In contrast, substitution of hydrophobic amino acids with charged residues in either the N- or C- terminal domains yielded Mfa1 proteins that failed to polymerize. Collectively, these results indicate that Mfa3 serves as an adaptor protein between Mfa1 and other accessory fimbrial proteins. Mfa1 fimbrial polymerization is dependent on hydrophobicity in both the N- and C-terminal regions, indicative of an assembly mechanism involving the terminal regions forming a hydrophobic binding interface between Mfa1 subunits.","authors":[{"name":"Jae Y Lee"},{"name":"Daniel P Miller"},{"name":"Leng Wu"},{"name":"Carolyn R Casella"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Hasegawa"},{"name":"Richard J Lamont"}],"keywords":[{"word":"accessory fimbrial proteins"},{"word":"donor strand exchange"},{"word":"hydrophobicity"},{"word":"periodontal disease"},{"word":"polymerization"}]},"article119":{"pmid":"29868242","title":"Comparison of antibacterial activity of alexidine alone or as a final irrigant with sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"To compare the antibacterial activity of alexidine (ALX) alone or as a final irrigant in combination with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), with the most common canal irrigants, NaOCl and chlorhexidine (CHX).","authors":[{"name":"Thaís M da Silva"},{"name":"Flávio Rf Alves"},{"name":"Márcia Ts Lutterbach"},{"name":"Maurício M Paiva"},{"name":"Dennis de Carvalho Ferreira"}],"keywords":[]},"article120":{"pmid":"29868163","title":"Antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens DD2 against oral pathogens.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Dana Jeong"},{"name":"Dong-Hyeon Kim"},{"name":"Kwang-Young Song"},{"name":"Kun-Ho Seo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Kefir"},{"word":"Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"Streptococcus sobrinus"},{"word":"artificial oral model system"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"oral biofilm"},{"word":"oral probiotics"}]},"article121":{"pmid":"29867902","title":"Dual Role of Mechanisms Involved in Resistance to Predation by Protozoa and Virulence to Humans.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Most opportunistic pathogens transit in the environment between hosts and the environment plays a significant role in the evolution of protective traits.

In response to protozoan predation, bacteria have evolved various defensive mechanisms which may also function as virulence factors. In this review, we summarize the dual role of factors involved in both grazing resistance and human pathogenesis, and compare the traits using model intracellular and extracellular pathogens. Intracellular pathogens rely on active invasion, blocking of the phagosome and lysosome fusion and resistance to phagocytic digestion to successfully invade host cells.

Control of SRB-mediated souring in oil-containing bioreactors was inhibited by 4 mM (340 ppm) of sodium nitrate, but required only 0.05 mM (15 ppm) of SNP. Interestingly, nitrate and SNP were found to be highly synergistic with 0.003 mM (1 ppm) of SNP and 1 mM (85 ppm) of sodium nitrate being sufficient in inhibiting souring.

SNP analysis versus available genomes of wine and flor strains revealed 2,270 genetic variants in 1,337 loci specific to flor strains. Gene ontology analysis in combination with gene content evaluation revealed a complex landscape of possibly adaptive genetic changes in flor yeast, related to genes associated with cell morphology, mitotic cell cycle, ion homeostasis, DNA repair, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cell wall biogenesis. Pangenomic analysis discovered the presence of several well-known non-reference loci of potential industrial importance.

However, the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs used for CD treatment on AIEC virulence have not yet been investigated. In this report, we show that exposure of AIEC LF82 strain to amino-6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) riboside, one of the most widely used anti-inflammatory drugs in CD, impairs its ability to adhere to, and consequently to invade, human epithelial cells. Notably, phagocytosis of LF82 treated with 6-MP by human macrophages is also reduced, suggesting that 6-MP affects AIEC cell surface determinants involved both in interaction with epithelial cells and in uptake by macrophages. Since a main target of 6-MP in bacterial cells is the inhibition of the important signal molecule c-di-GMP, we also tested whether perturbations in cAMP, another major signaling pathway in E. coli, might have similar effects on interactions with human cells. To this aim, we grew LF82 in the presence of glucose, which leads to inhibition of cAMP synthesis. Growth in glucose-supplemented medium resulted in a reduction in AIEC adhesion to epithelial cells and uptake by macrophages. Consistent with these results, both 6-MP and glucose can affect expression of cell adhesion-related genes, such as the csg genes, encoding thin aggregative fimbriae (curli). In addition, glucose strongly inhibits expression of the fim operon, encoding type 1 pili, a known AIEC determinant for adhesion to human cells. To further investigate whether 6-MP can indeed inhibit c-di-GMP signaling in AIEC, we performed biofilm and motility assays and determination of extracellular polysaccharides. 6-MP clearly affected biofilm formation and cellulose production, but also, unexpectedly, reduced cell motility, itself an important virulence factor for AIEC. Our results provide strong evidence that 6-MP can affect AIEC-host cell interaction by acting on the bacterial cell, thus strengthening the hypothesis that mercaptopurines might promote CD remission also by affecting gut microbiota composition and/or physiology, and suggesting that novel drugs targeting bacterial virulence and signaling might be effective in preventing chronic inflammation in CD.","authors":[{"name":"Federica Migliore"},{"name":"Raffaella Macchi"},{"name":"Paolo Landini"},{"name":"Moira Paroni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"6-mercaptopurines"},{"word":"Crohn’s disease"},{"word":"adherent-invasive E. coli"},{"word":"azathioprine"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"dysbiosis"},{"word":"virulence factors"}]},"article127":{"pmid":"29867851","title":"Dynamics of Pellet Fragmentation and Aggregation in Liquid-Grown Cultures of Streptomyces lividans.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Streptomycetes are extensively used for the production of valuable products, including various antibiotics and industrial enzymes.

While the process of pellet formation is well characterized, little is known about their disintegration. Here, we use a qualitative and quantitative approach to show that pellet fragmentation in Streptomyces lividans is initiated when cultures enter the stationary phase, which coincides with a remarkable change in pellet architecture. Unlike young pellets, aging pellets have a less dense appearance and are characterized by the appearance of filaments protruding from their outer edges. These morphological changes are accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of mycelial fragments in the culture broth. In the presence of fresh nutrients, these fragments are able to aggregate with other small fragments, but not with disintegrating pellets, to form new mycelial particles.

Delivering antibiotics to the sites of these infections is a major hurdle of therapy because pulmonary NTM infections can persist in biofilms or as intracellular infections within macrophages. Inhaled treatments can improve antibiotic delivery into the lungs, but efficient nebulization delivery, distribution throughout the lungs, and penetration into biofilms and macrophages are considerable challenges for this approach. Therefore, we developed amikacin liposome inhalation suspension (ALIS) to overcome these challenges. Nebulization of ALIS has been shown to provide particles within the respirable size range that distribute to both central and peripheral lung compartments in humans. The in vitro and in vivo efficacy of ALIS against NTM has been demonstrated previously. The key mechanistic questions are whether ALIS penetrates NTM biofilms and enhances amikacin uptake into macrophages. We found that ALIS effectively penetrated throughout NTM biofilms and concentration-dependently reduced the number of viable mycobacteria. Additionally, we found that ALIS improved amikacin uptake by ∼4-fold into cultured macrophages compared with free amikacin. In rats, inhaled ALIS increased amikacin concentrations in pulmonary macrophages by 5- to 8-fold at 2, 6, and 24 h post-dose and retained more amikacin at 24 h in airways and lung tissue relative to inhaled free amikacin. Compared to intravenous free amikacin, a standard-of-care therapy for refractory and severe NTM lung disease, ALIS increased the mean area under the concentration-time curve in lung tissue, airways, and macrophages by 42-, 69-, and 274-fold. These data demonstrate that ALIS effectively penetrates NTM biofilms, enhances amikacin uptake into macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo, and retains amikacin within airways and lung tissue.

This study sought to investigate if biofilm formation by ExPEC likely contributes to these losses since biofilms are associated with recurrent urinary tract infections, antibiotic resistance, and bacterial exchange of genetic material. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine differences in biofilm formation among a collection of ExPEC and to ascertain if there is a relationship between their ability to produce biofilms and their assignment to phylogenetic groups in three media types - M63, diluted TSB, and BHI. Our results suggest that ExPEC produce relatively different levels of biofilm formation in the media tested as APEC (70.4%, p = 0.0064) and NMEC (84.4%, p = 0.0093) isolates were poor biofilm formers in minimal medium M63 while UPEC isolates produced significantly higher ODs under nutrient-limited conditions with 25% of strains producing strong biofilms in diluted TSB (p = 0.0204). Additionally, E. coli phylogenetic assignment using Clermont's original and revised typing scheme demonstrated significant differences among the phylogenetic groups in the different media. When the original phylogenetic group isolates previously typed as group D were phylogenetically typed under the revised scheme and examined, they showed substantial variation in their ability to form biofilms, which may explain the significant values of revised phylogenetic groups E and F in M63 (p = 0.0291, p = 0.0024).

Preexposure of C. albicans to subinhibitory MFG concentrations significantly enhanced neutrophil-mediated biofilm damage, an effect that appears to be species specific since a comparable effect was not observed with drug-pretreated C. parapsilosis biofilms. Human THP-1 cells responded to both Candida biofilms through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 upregulation, modest TLR6 involvement, and enhanced NLRP3 activation, whereas the signal was relayed to the nucleus via NF-κB p65 activation. MFG caused 2- to 3-fold lower TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA levels than those caused by either organism. C. albicans biofilms induced a robust proinflammatory response, whereas C. parapsilosis biofilms either alone or in the presence of MFG caused increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production, but small amounts of IL-8, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In conclusion, MFG may condition THP-1 cells toward an inflammatory response through TLR2/TLR4 recruitment. Inflammatory signals observed with C. albicans biofilms are considerably reduced upon exposure of THP-1 cells to C. parapsilosis biofilms, possibly enhancing fungal survival and increasing biofilm pathogenicity.","authors":[{"name":"Maria Simitsopoulou"},{"name":"Katerina Chlichlia"},{"name":"Daniela Kyrpitzi"},{"name":"Thomas J Walsh"},{"name":"Emmanuel Roilides"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida biofilms"},{"word":"antibiofilm activity"},{"word":"immunomodulation"},{"word":"micafungin"}]},"article136":{"pmid":"29866870","title":"In Vitro and In Vivo Activity of a Novel Catheter Lock Solution against Bacterial and Fungal Biofilms.","date":"2019-09-23","abs":"Central-line-associated bloodstream infections are increasingly recognized to be associated with intraluminal microbial biofilms, and effective measures for the prevention and treatment of bloodstream infections remain lacking.

Of these, the type 1 secretion system (T1SS) is known to secrete an array of biologically diverse proteins-from small, <10-kDa bacteriocins to gigantic adhesins with a mass >1 MDa. For the last several decades, T1SSs have been characterized as a one-step translocation strategy whereby the secreted substrate is transported directly into the extracellular environment from the cytoplasm with no periplasmic intermediate. Recent phylogenetic, biochemical, and genetic evidences point to a distinct subgroup of T1SS machinery linked with a bacterial transglutaminase-like cysteine proteinase (BTLCP), which uses a two-step secretion mechanism. BTLCP-linked T1SSs transport a class of repeats-in-toxin (RTX) adhesins that are critical for biofilm formation. The prototype of this RTX adhesin group, LapA of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, uses a novel N-terminal retention module to anchor the adhesin at the cell surface as a secretion intermediate threaded through the outer membrane-localized TolC-like protein LapE. This secretion intermediate is posttranslationally cleaved by the BTLCP family LapG protein to release LapA from its cognate T1SS pore. Thus, the secretion of LapA and related RTX adhesins into the extracellular environment appears to be a T1SS-mediated two-step process that involves a periplasmic intermediate. In this review, we contrast the T1SS machinery and substrates of the BLTCP-linked two-step secretion process with those of the classical one-step T1SS to better understand the newly recognized and expanded role of this secretion machinery.","authors":[{"name":"T Jarrod Smith"},{"name":"Holger Sondermann"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"}],"keywords":[{"word":"LapA"},{"word":"T1SS"},{"word":"adhesin"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"retention module"}]},"article138":{"pmid":"29866805","title":"RsmV, a Small Noncoding Regulatory RNA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa That Sequesters RsmA and RsmF from Target mRNAs.","date":"2019-09-16","abs":"The Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has distinct genetic programs that favor either acute or chronic virulence gene expression. Acute virulence is associated with twitching and swimming motility, expression of a type III secretion system (T3SS), and the absence of alginate, Psl, or Pel polysaccharide production. Traits associated with chronic infection include growth as a biofilm, reduced motility, and expression of a type VI secretion system (T6SS). The Rsm posttranscriptional regulatory system plays important roles in the inverse control of phenotypes associated with acute and chronic virulence. RsmA and RsmF are RNA-binding proteins that interact with target mRNAs to control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Previous work found that RsmA activity is controlled by at least three small, noncoding regulatory RNAs (RsmW, RsmY, and RsmZ). In this study, we took an in silico approach to identify additional small RNAs (sRNAs) that might function in the sequestration of RsmA and/or RsmF (RsmA/RsmF) and identified RsmV, a 192-nucleotide (nt) transcript with four predicted RsmA/RsmF consensus binding sites. RsmV is capable of sequestering RsmA and RsmF in vivo to activate translation of tssA1, a component of the T6SS, and to inhibit T3SS gene expression. Each of the predicted RsmA/RsmF consensus binding sites contributes to RsmV activity. Electrophoretic mobility shifts assays show that RsmF binds RsmV with >10-fold higher affinity than RsmY and RsmZ. Gene expression studies revealed that the temporal expression pattern of RsmV differs from those of RsmW, RsmY, and RsmZ.

This Review pays attention to the increasing number of photolabile linkers developed for solid-phase synthesis and release and covers: (i) o-nitrobenzyloxy linkers, (ii) o-nitrobenzylamino linkers, (iii) α-substituted o-nitrobenzyl linkers, (iv) o-nitroveratryl linkers, (v) phenacyl linkers, (vi) p-alkoxyphenacyl linkers, (vii) benzoin linkers, (viii) pivaloyl linkers, and (ix) other photolabile linkers.","authors":[{"name":"Remi J T Mikkelsen"},{"name":"Katja E Grier"},{"name":"Kim T Mortensen"},{"name":"Thomas E Nielsen"},{"name":"Katrine Qvortrup"}],"keywords":[{"word":"chemical biology"},{"word":"combinatorial chemistry"},{"word":"photolabile linker"},{"word":"solid-phase synthesis"}]},"article149":{"pmid":"29863794","title":"Role of anaerobes in polymicrobial communities and biofilms complicating diabetic foot ulcers.","date":"2019-01-28","abs":"Infected tissues in the feet of people with diabetes in the form of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) present a complex pathology for clinicians to manage. This is partly attributed to the multi-factorial nature of the disease, which may include; altered foot architecture leading to excessive plantar pressures and frictional forces peripheral arterial disease and loss of protective sensation. In addition, to the above co-morbid variables, it is understood that a delayed wound healing state may be perpetuated by the presence of microorganisms residing in the wound tissue. The microbiology of chronic DFUs has often been reported as being polymicrobial. Of growing interest is the presence and potential role of anaerobic microorganisms in the pathology of DFUs and how they may contribute to the infective process or delayed healing. The presence of anaerobes in DFUs has been greatly underestimated, largely due to the limitations of conventional culture methods in identifying them from samples. Advancements in molecular and microscopy techniques have extended our view of the wound microbiome in addition to observing the growth and behaviour (planktonic or biofilm) of microorganisms in situ. This review paper will reflect on the evidence for the role and significance of anaerobes in DFUs and infection. A focus of this review will be to explore recent advancements in molecular genomics and microscopy techniques in order to better assess the roles of anaerobic bacteria in chronic DFUs and in biofilm-based wound care.","authors":[{"name":"Steven L Percival"},{"name":"Matthew Malone"},{"name":"Dieter Mayer"},{"name":"Anne-Marie Salisbury"},{"name":"Gregory Schultz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"anaerobes"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"diabetic foot ulcers"},{"word":"wounds"}]},"article150":{"pmid":"29862449","title":"Diverse roles of Hcp family proteins in the environmental fitness and pathogenicity of Aeromonas hydrophila Chinese epidemic strain NJ-35.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) has been considered as a crucial factor in bacterial competition and virulence.

In this study, three copies of the hcp gene were identified in the genome of strain NJ-35. We targeted these Hcp family proteins for generating deletion mutants. These mutants showed varying levels in Hcp production, the interaction with other bacteria or eukaryotic cells, and bacterial virulence. Hcp1 was necessary for T6SS assembly and played a predominant role in the bacterial competition; Hcp2 negatively functioned in the biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion and was more involved in the A. hydrophila virulence in zebrafish and survival against the predation of Tetrahymena, and Hcp3 positively influenced the biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion. These findings illustrate that the T6SS of A. hydrophila NJ-35 is active, and the three Hcp family proteins take part in different processes in environmental adaptation and virulence of this bacterium.

Sulfathiazole was used as antimicrobial agent because it showed the highest activity out of 22 biofilm inhibitors tested. Our analysis reveals that competitive interactions dominate among species within brewery biofilms. We show that antimicrobial treatment can reduce the level of competition and therefore cause a subset of species to bloom. The result is a 1.2-42.7-fold lower percentage inhibition of these species and increased overall tolerance. In addition, we show that the presence of Raoultella can also directly enhance the inherent tolerance of Pseudomonas to antimicrobial treatment, either because the species protect each other or because they induce specific tolerance phenotypes as a response to competitors. Overall, our study emphasizes that the dominance of competitive interactions is central to the enhanced antimicrobial tolerance of the multispecies biofilms, and that the activity of antimicrobials against multispecies biofilms cannot be predicted based on their effect against monocultures.","authors":[{"name":"Ilse Parijs"},{"name":"Hans P Steenackers"}],"keywords":[]},"article174":{"pmid":"29858205","title":"Functional Determinants of Extracellular Polymeric Substances in Membrane Biofouling: Experimental Evidence from Pure-Cultured Sludge Bacteria.","date":"2019-09-25","abs":"The aim of this work was to better understand the roles of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in membrane biofouling at the single-strain level.

A small fraction of transiently antibiotic-tolerant phenotypical variants, called persister cells, is capable of surviving treatment with high doses of antibiotics. When antibiotic pressure drops, persisters that switch back to a normal phenotype can resume growth, ensuring survival of the bacterial population. Persister cells have been identified in every major pathogen, contribute to the antibiotic tolerance observed in biofilms, and are responsible for the recalcitrant nature of chronic infections. Also, evidence is accumulating that persister cells can contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Consequently, effective treatment of persister cells could greatly improve patient outcome. The small number of persisters and the redundancy in mechanisms of persister formation impede target-based development of anti-persister therapies.

Nanosystems may be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of viral and fungal infections. Commercial diagnostic tests based on nanosystems are currently available. Different methodologies based on nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed to detect specific agents or to distinguish between Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. Also, biosensors based on nanoparticles have been applied in viral detection to improve available analytical techniques. Several point-of-care (POC) assays have been proposed that can offer results faster, easier and at lower cost than conventional techniques and can even be used in remote regions for viral diagnosis. Nanoparticles functionalized with specific molecules may modulate pharmacokinetic targeting recognition and increase anti-infective efficacy. Quorum sensing is a stimuli-response chemical communication process correlated with population density that bacteria use to regulate biofilm formation. Disabling it is an emerging approach for combating its pathogenicity. Natural or synthetic inhibitors may act as antibiofilm agents and be useful for treating multi-drug resistant bacteria.

Biofilm infections, which contribute to up to 80% of human microbial infections, are associated with common human disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and poor dental hygiene, but also with medical implants. The associated chronic infections such as wound infections, dental caries and periodontitis significantly enhance morbidity, affect quality of life and can aid development of follow-up diseases such as cancer. Biofilm infections remain challenging to treat and antibiotic monotherapy is often insufficient, although some rediscovered traditional compounds have shown surprising efficiency. Innovative anti-biofilm strategies include application of anti-biofilm small molecules, intrinsic or external stimulation of production of reactive molecules, utilization of materials with antimicrobial properties and dispersion of biofilms by digestion of the extracellular matrix, also in combination with physical biofilm breakdown. Although basic principles of biofilm formation have been deciphered, the molecular understanding of the formation and structural organization of various types of biofilms has just begun to emerge. Basic studies of biofilm physiology have also resulted in an unexpected discovery of cyclic dinucleotide second messengers that are involved in interkingdom crosstalk via specific mammalian receptors.

Presently, S. agalactiae isolates of bovine subclinical mastitis, from Brazilian Northeastern region, were submitted to capsular and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)-typing, antimicrobial susceptibility and assays of biofilm formation at different time incubation and pH levels. Sixteen bovine isolates were characterized by polymerase chain reaction assay as S. agalactiae capsular type II (CTII) and classified by PFGE in A1/A2 (n = 06), B1/B2 (n = 06), C (n = 03) and D (n = 01) patterns.

Profound application of antibiotics in order to treat infections due to microbial biofilm has led to the emergence of several drug-resistant microbial strains. In this context, a novel type of 3,6-di(pyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (pytz)-capped silver nanoparticles (TzAgNPs) was synthesized, and efforts were given to test its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a widely used biofilm-forming pathogenic organism. The synthesized TzAgNPs showed considerable antimicrobial activity wherein the MIC value of TzAgNPs was found at 40 μg/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiofilm activity of TzAgNPs was also tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by carrying out an array of experiments like microscopic observation, crystal violet assay, and protein count using the sub-MIC doses of TzAgNPs. Since TzAgNPs showed efficient antibiofilm activity, thus, in the present study, efforts were put together to investigate the underlying cause of biofilm attenuation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using TzAgNPs. To this end, we discerned that the sub-MIC doses of TzAgNPs increased ROS level considerably in the bacterial cell. The result showed that the ROS level and microbial biofilm formation are inversely proportional. Thus, the attenuation in microbial biofilm could be attributed to the accumulation of ROS level. Furthermore, it was also duly noted that microorganisms upon treatment with TzAgNPs exhibited considerable diminution in virulence factors (protease and pyocyanin) in contrast to the control where the organisms were not treated with TzAgNPs. Thus, the results indicated that TzAgNPs exhibit considerable reduction in the development of biofilms and spreading of virulence factors. Taken together, all the results indicated that TzAgNPs could be deemed to be a promising agent for the prevention of microbial biofilm development that might assist to fight against infections linked to biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Poulomi Chakraborty"},{"name":"Sutapa Joardar"},{"name":"Shounak Ray"},{"name":"Papu Biswas"},{"name":"Debasish Maiti"},{"name":"Prosun Tribedi"}],"keywords":[]},"article187":{"pmid":"29855532","title":"Inhibitory effects of Myricetin derivatives on curli-dependent biofilm formation in Escherichia coli.","date":"2019-10-14","abs":"Biofilms are well-organised communities of microbes embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix (e.g., curli amyloid fibers) and are associated with chronic infections.

Even though Candida spp. is a member of the oral microbiota in symbiosis, in some circumstances, it can cause microbial imbalance leading to dysbiosis, resulting in oral diseases. Alternative therapies are urgently needed to treat oral candidiasis (usually associated to biofilms), as several antifungal drugs' activity has been compromised. This has occurred especially due to an increasing occurrence of drugresistant in Candida spp. strains. The overuse of antifungal medications, systemic toxicity, cross-reactivity with other drugs and a presently low number of drug molecules with antifungal activity, have contributed to important clinical limitations. We undertook a structured search of bibliographic databases (PubMed Central, Elsevier's ScienceDirect, SCOPUS and Springer's SpringerLink) for peer-reviewed research literature using a focused review in the areas of alternatives to manage oral candidiasis. The keywords used were candidiasis, oral candidiasis, biofilm + candida, alternative treatment, combination therapy + candida and the reports from the last 10 to 15 years were considered for this review. This review identified several promising new approaches in the treatment of oral candidiasis: combination anti-Candida therapies, denture cleansers, mouth rinses as alternatives for disrupting candidal biofilms, natural compounds (e.g. honey, probiotics, plant extracts and essential oils) and photodynamic therapy. The findings of this review confirm the importance and the urgency of the development of efficacious therapies for oral candidal infections.","authors":[{"name":"Célia F Rodrigues"},{"name":"Maria E Rodrigues"},{"name":"Mariana C R Henriques"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida"},{"word":"antifungal treatment"},{"word":"honey"},{"word":"oral candidiasis"},{"word":"photodynamictherapy"},{"word":"plants"},{"word":"probiotics"},{"word":"resistance."}]},"article199":{"pmid":"29852465","title":"Increased salinity triggers significant changes in the functional proteins of ANAMMOX bacteria within a biofilm community.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) processes can potentially be influenced by salinity related to variable salinity in water environment.

One possible approach is to mutate bacteria to enhance their binding to cancer cells. In the present study, Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis were randomly mutated, and then were positively and negatively selected for binding cancer vs normal cells. With repetitive mutation and selection both bacteria successfully evolved to increase affinity to the pancreatic cancer cell line (Mia PaCa-2) but not normal cells (HPDE: immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells). The mutant E. coli and B. subtilis strains bound to Mia PaCa-2 cells about 10 and 25 times more than to HPDE cells. The selected E. coli strain had mutations in biofilm-related genes and the regulatory region for a type I pilus gene. Consistent with type I pili involvement, mannose could inhibit the binding to cells. The results suggest that weak but specific binding is involved in the initial step of adhesion. To test their ability to kill Mia PaCa-2 cells, hemolysin was expressed in the mutant strain. The hemolysin released from the mutant strain was active and could kill Mia PaCa-2 cells. In the case of B. subtilis, the initial binding to the cells was a weak interaction of the leading pole of the motile bacteria. The frequency of this interaction to Mia PaCa-2 cells dramatically increased in the evolved mutant strain. This mutant strain could also specifically invade beneath Mia PaCa-2 cells and settle there. This type of mutation/selection strategy may be applicable to other combinations of cancer cells and bacterial species.","authors":[{"name":"Masaki Osawa"}],"keywords":[]},"article201":{"pmid":"29851365","title":"Molecular Characterization of Escherichia coli Isolated from Chickens with Colibacillosis in Senegal.","date":"2019-05-28","abs":"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), a subset of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), are the etiologic agent of avian colibacillosis, one of the main causes of economic losses in the poultry industry.

Research strategies to prevent peri-implantitis have focused on modifying dental implants to incorporate different antimicrobial agents. An alternative strategy consists of barring the expansion of the biofilm subgingivally by forming a long-lasting permucosal seal between the soft tissue and the implant surface. Here, we innovatively biofunctionalized titanium with bioinspired peptide coatings to strengthen biological interactions between epithelial cells and the titanium surface. We selected laminin 332- and ameloblastin-derived peptides (Lam, Ambn). Laminin 332 participates in the formation of hemidesmosomes by keratinocytes and promotes epithelial attachment around teeth; and ameloblastin, an enamel derived protein, is involved in tissue regeneration events following disruption of the periodontium. Lam, Ambn or combinations of both peptides were covalently immobilized on titanium discs. Successful immobilization of the peptides was confirmed by contact angle goniometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and fluorescent labelling of the peptides. Additionally, we confirmed the mechanical and thermochemical stability of the peptides on Ti substrates. Proliferation and hemidesmosome formation of human keratinocytes (TERT-2/OKF-6) were assessed by immunofluorescence labelling. The peptide-coated surfaces increased cell proliferation for up to 48 h in culture compared to control surfaces. Most importantly, formation of hemidesmosomes by keratinocytes was significantly increased on surfaces coated with Ambn + Lam peptides compared to control (p < 0.01) and monopeptide coatings (p < 0.005). Together, these results support the Ambn + Lam multipeptide coating as a promising candidate for inducing a permucosal seal around dental implants.","authors":[{"name":"Vasiliki P Koidou"},{"name":"Prokopios P Argyris"},{"name":"Erik P Skoe"},{"name":"Juliana Mota Siqueira"},{"name":"Xi Chen"},{"name":"Lei Zhang"},{"name":"James E Hinrichs"},{"name":"Massimo Costalonga"},{"name":"Conrado Aparicio"}],"keywords":[]},"article205":{"pmid":"29850740","title":"Superhydrophobic polypyrene films to prevent Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm adhesion on surfaces: high efficiency deciphered by fluorescence microscopy.","date":"2018-08-29","abs":"A blue luminescent and superhydrophobic coating based on an electropolymerized fluorinated-pyrene monomer and its planktonic bacteria and biofilm repellent properties are reported.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the susceptibilities of DUWL isolates in planktonic and biofilm states to cetylpyridinium chloride, as well as to the four chemical agents currently used for DUWL management. A total of 56 isolates, including 12 genera, were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing, and one strain of each genus was selected for susceptibility testing. A total of 12 isolates were used for the susceptibility tests. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for the planktonic state and the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) for the biofilm state using microtiter plates. MIC, MBC, MBIC, and MBEC of the 12 isolates for ethanol were the highest, followed by sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and chlorhexidine. Similar to chlorhexidine, the lowest MIC, MBC, MBIC, and MBEC were found in cetylpyridinium chloride. The susceptibilities of the isolates for sodium hypochlorite and ethanol were similar in the planktonic and biofilm states. For hydrogen peroxide and chlorhexidine, the MBIC and MIC were similar, but MBEC was 256 times higher than MBC.

As far as we know, this was the first study reporting the susceptibility of DUWL isolates to cetylpyridinium chloride and chemical agents used for disinfecting DUWLs.

These organisms still belong to the genera of the skin coryneform group, and the most-studied species remains Cutibacterium acnes. Cutibacterium avidum is also a known skin commensal. This underrecognized microorganism can, however, act as a pathogen after bacterial seeding and can be considered opportunistic, causing either superficial or deep/invasive infections. It can cause numerous infections, including but not limited to breast infections, skin abscesses, infective endocarditis, and device-related infections. The ecological niche of C. avidum is clearly different from that of other members of the genus: it is found in the axillary region or at wet sites rather than in dry, exposed areas, and the number of microorganisms increases during puberty. Historically, it has been used for its ability to modulate the immune response and for its antitumor properties. Conventional microbial culture methods and identification processes allow for its accurate identification and characterization. Thanks to the modern omics tools used for phylogenomic approaches, understanding C. avidum pathogenesis (including host-bacterium interactions and virulence factor characterization) is becoming easier, allowing for more thorough molecular characterization. These analyses have revealed that C. avidum causes diverse diseases mediated by multiple virulence factors. The recent genome approach has revealed specific genomic regions within this species that are involved in adherence and biofilm formation as well as fitness, survival, and defense functions. Numerous regions show the presence of phages and horizontal gene transfer. C. avidum remains highly sensitive to a broad spectrum of antibiotics, such as β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and rifampin, although erythromycin and clindamycin resistance has been described.

We thus asked whether specific amino acid residues present in the HmsP domain contribute to the switch function of SagS. HmsP domain residues were therefore subjected to alanine replacement mutagenesis to identify substitutions that block the sensory function(s) of SagS, which is apparent by attached cells being unable to develop mature biofilms and/or prevent transition to an antimicrobial-resistant state. Mutant analyses revealed 32 residues that only contribute to blocking one sensory function. Moreover, amino acid residues affecting attachment and subsequent biofilm formation but not biofilm tolerance also impaired histidine kinase signaling via BfiS. In contrast, residues affecting biofilm drug tolerance but not attachment and subsequent biofilm formation negatively impacted BrlR transcription factor levels.

We previously showed that the effectiveness of Lactobacillus reuteri ( Lr) in preventing NEC is enhanced when Lr is grown as a biofilm on the surface of dextranomer microspheres (DM). Here we sought to test the efficacy of Lr administration by manipulating the Lr biofilm state with the addition of biofilm-promoting substances (sucrose and maltose) to DM or by mutating the Lr gtfW gene (encoding an enzyme central to biofilm production). Using an animal model of NEC, we determined that Lr adhered to sucrose- or maltose-loaded DM significantly reduced histologic injury, improved host survival, decreased intestinal permeability, reduced intestinal inflammation, and altered the gut microbiome compared with Lr adhered to unloaded DM. These effects were abolished when DM or GtfW were absent from the Lr inoculum. This demonstrates that a single dose of Lr in its biofilm state decreases NEC incidence. Importantly, preloading DM with sucrose or maltose further enhances Lr protection against NEC in a GtfW-dependent fashion, demonstrating the tunability of the approach and the potential to use other cargos to enhance future probiotic formulations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous clinical trials of probiotics to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis have had variable results. In these studies, probiotics were delivered in their planktonic, free-living form. We have developed a novel probiotic delivery system in which Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr) is delivered in its biofilm state.

In this paper, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was investigated in S. aureus grown either in biofilm or suspension cultures, achieved using DNase I. A significant increase of ALP activity was observed in S. aureus biofilm culture compared to its suspension counterpart. Treatment of sodium orthovanadate, an ALP inhibitor, significantly decreased biofilm formation. Its inhibition was on par with DNase I treatment at specific doses. Thus, ALP may play an important role in the biofilm formation.

Out of a total of 100 clinical isolates of Candida spp. obtained from patients diagnosed with VVC, 84 were identified as C. albicans, while the remaining isolates were identified as non--albicans Candida strains. Phospholipases and proteinases were produced by a majority of the C. albicans strains and esterases and hemolysins a minority of these strains. Among the non-C. albicans strains, only a few of the strains produced these proteins. Nearly all of the isolates formed biofilms. Our results showed that the butoconazole, clotrimazole, and fluconazole were active against C. albicans and less so against the non-albicans Candida strains. The MIC90 of amphotericin B and nystatins were 2 and 4 μg/ml, respectively, against either C. albicans or non-albicans Candida spp. Representative ceragenins (CSA-13, CSA-131, and CSA-138), developed as mimics of endogenous antimicrobial peptides, were active against fluconazole-resistant strains, both alone and in combination with fluconazole.

An important virulence property of A. actinomycetemcomitans is its ability to form tenacious biofilms that can attach to abiotic as well as biotic surfaces. The histone-like (H-NS) family of nucleoid-structuring proteins act as transcriptional silencers in many Gram-negative bacteria. To evaluate the role of H-NS in A. actinomycetemcomitans, hns mutant derivatives of serotype a strain D7S were generated. Characteristics of the hns mutant phenotype included shorter and fewer pili, and substantially lower monospecies biofilm formation relative to the wild type. Furthermore, the D7S hns mutant exhibited significantly reduced growth within a seven-species oral biofilm model. However, no apparent difference was observed regarding the numbers and proportions of the remaining six species regardless of being co-cultivated with D7S hns or its parental strain. Proteomics analysis of the strains grown in monocultures confirmed the role of H-NS as a repressor of gene expression in A. actinomycetemcomitans. Interestingly, proteomics analysis of the multispecies biofilms indicated that the A. actinomycetemcomitans wild type and hns mutant imposed different regulatory effects on the pattern of protein expression in the other species, i.e., mainly Streptococcus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Veillonella dispar. Gene ontology analysis revealed that a large portion of the differentially regulated proteins was related to translational activity. Taken together, our data suggest that, apart from being a negative regulator of protein expression in A. actinomycetemcomitans, H-NS promotes biofilm formation and may be an important factor for survival of this species within a multispecies biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Kai Bao"},{"name":"Nagihan Bostanci"},{"name":"Thomas Thurnheer"},{"name":"Jonas Grossmann"},{"name":"Witold E Wolski"},{"name":"Bernard Thay"},{"name":"Georgios N Belibasakis"},{"name":"Jan Oscarsson"}],"keywords":[]},"article229":{"pmid":"29844614","title":"Cell behavior of the highly sticky bacterium Acinetobacter sp.

In this study, the adhesion and behavior of Tol 5 cells in laminar flows were investigated using flow cell systems. Tol 5 cells autoagglutinated through AtaA and formed cell clumps during flowing. The cell clumps rather than single cells went downward due to gravity and adhered to the bottom surface. Under appropriate shear stress, a twin vortex was caused by a separated flow generated at the rear of the pre-immobilized cell clumps and carried the small cell clumps to this location, resulting in their stacking there. The rearward immobilized cell clumps developed into a large, stable aggregate with a streamlined shape, independent of cell growth. Cell clumps hardly ever developed under weak shear stress that could not generate a twin vortex and were broken up under excessively strong shear stress. These cell behaviors including the importance of clumping are interesting features in the bacterial adhesion processes.","authors":[{"name":"Yoshihide Furuichi"},{"name":"Keita Iwasaki"},{"name":"Katsutoshi Hori"}],"keywords":[]},"article230":{"pmid":"29844504","title":"Influence of Household Water Filters on Bacteria Growth and Trace Metals in Tap Water of Doha, Qatar.","date":"2019-11-22","abs":"Deteriorating water quality from aging infrastructure, growing threat of pollution from industrialization and urbanization, and increasing awareness about waterborne diseases are among the factors driving the surge in worldwide use of point-of-entry (POE) and point-of-use (POU) filters.

With changes in water pressure and physical or chemical disturbance of the plumbing system, the microorganisms and contaminants may be flushed into the tap water.

Here, we examined the effects of MFS on C. neoformans and C. gattii yeasts (planktonic and biofilm lifestyles) to clarify its mechanism of action. MFS presented inhibitory and fungicidal effects against planktonic Cryptococcus cells, with similar activities against dispersion biofilm cells, while sessile biofilm cells were less sensitive to MFS. Interestingly, MFS had postantifungal effect on Cryptococcus, with a proliferation delay of up to 8.15 h after a short exposure to fungicidal doses. MFS at fungicidal concentrations increased the plasma membrane permeability, likely due to a direct interaction with ergosterol, as suggested by competition assays with exogenous ergosterol. Moreover, MFS reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and induced DNA fragmentation and condensation, all of which are hallmarks of apoptosis. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that MFS-treated yeasts had a reduced mucopolysaccharide capsule (confirmed by morphometry with light microscopy), plasma membrane irregularities, mitochondrial swelling, and a less conspicuous cell wall. Our results suggest that MFS increases the plasma membrane permeability in Cryptococcus via an interaction with ergosterol and also affects the mitochondrial membrane, eventually leading to apoptosis, in line with its fungicidal activity.

Herein we review the structure and function of the proteins involved in the production of the Gram-negative synthase-dependent exopolysaccharides: alginate, poly-β(1,6)-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG), cellulose, and the Pel polysaccharide. We highlight the similarities and differences that exist at the molecular level in these synthase systems.","authors":[{"name":"Kristin E Low"},{"name":"P Lynne Howell"}],"keywords":[]},"article241":{"pmid":"29842923","title":"Antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer activities and structural bioinformatics analysis of six naturally occurring temporins.","date":"2019-08-02","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides are a special class of natural products with potential applications as novel therapeutics. This study focuses on six temporins (four with no activity data and two as positive controls). Using synthetic peptides, we report antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities of temporins-CPa, CPb, 1Ga, 1Oc, 1Ola, and 1SPa. While temporin-1Ga and temporin-1OLa showed higher antifungal and anticancer activity, most of these peptides were active primarily against Gram-positive bacteria. Temporin-1OLa, with the highest cell selectivity index, could preferentially kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), consistent with a reduced hemolysis in the presence of bacteria. Mechanistically, temporin-1OLa rapidly killed MRSA by damaging bacterial membranes. Using micelles as a membrane-mimetic model, we determined the three-dimensional structure of temporin-1OLa by NMR spectroscopy. The peptide adopted a two-domain structure where a hydrophobic patch is followed by a classic amphipathic helix covering residues P3-I12. Such a structure is responsible for anti-biofilm ability in vitro and in vivo protection of wax moths Galleria mellonella from staphylococcal infection. Finally, our bioinformatic analysis leads to a classification of temporins into six types and confers significance to this NMR structure since temporin-1OLa shares a sequence model with 62% of temporins. Collectively, our results indicate the potential of temporin-1OLa as a new anti-MRSA compound, which shows an even better anti-biofilm capability in combination with linezolid.","authors":[{"name":"Biswajit Mishra"},{"name":"Xiuqing Wang"},{"name":"Tamara Lushnikova"},{"name":"Yingxia Zhang"},{"name":"Radha M Golla"},{"name":"Jayaram Lakshmaiah Narayana"},{"name":"Chunfeng Wang"},{"name":"Timothy R McGuire"},{"name":"Guangshun Wang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"Database"},{"word":"Galleria mellonella"},{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"NMR"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"Temporin"}]},"article242":{"pmid":"29842898","title":"Novel murine model for delayed wound healing using a biological wound dressing with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.","date":"2018-11-06","abs":"Bacterial biofilms impair healing in 60% of chronic skin wounds.

Microbial biofilm has been linked to both wound chronicity and infection. Close to 1 in 2 diabetics with a DFU are predicted to go on to develop a diabetic foot infection (DFI). The majority of these DFIs have been found to evolve even before the diabetic individual has received an initial referral for expert DFU management. Of these infected DFUs, less than half have been shown to heal over the next year; many of these individuals will require costly hospitalisation, and current data show that far too many DFIs will require extremity amputation to achieve infection resolution. The development of an infection in a DFU is critical at least in part because paradigms of infection prevention and management are evolving. The effectiveness of our current practice standards is being challenged by a growing body of research related to the prevalence and recalcitrance of the microbes in biofilm to topical and systemic antimicrobials. This article will review the magnitude of current challenges related to DFI prevention and management along with what is currently considered to be standard of care.

We found that: (1) division of labour is usually-but not always-favoured by high efficiency benefits to specialization and low within-group conflict; and (2) natural selection favours extreme specialization, where some individuals are completely dependent on the helping behaviour of others. We make a number of predictions, several of which are supported by the existing empirical data, from microbes and animals, while others suggest novel directions for empirical work.

Current antimicrobial strategies typically are much more effective for prevention of biofilm formation than for eradication of established biofilms; these strategies also leave dead bacteria and endotoxin in the infection site, which impairs healing. We report a novel hydrogel that eradicates biofilm bacteria by non-leaching-based debridement followed by ex situ contact-killing (DESCK) away from the infection site. The debridement effect is likely due to the high water swellability and microporosity of the cross-linked network which is made from polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate tethered with a dangling polyethylenimine (PEI) star copolymer. The large pore size of the hydrogel makes the cationic pore walls highly accessible to bacteria. The hydrogel also degrades in the presence of infection cells, releasing star cationic PEI into the infection site to contact-kill bacteria remaining there. DESCK hydrogel effectively kills (>99.9% reduction) biofilms of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CR-PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in a murine excisional wound infection model. Silver-based wound dressings (controls) showed almost no killing of CR-PA and MRSA biofilms. This DESCK hydrogel greatly reduces the bioburden and inflammation and promotes wound healing.

In addition, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms themselves can exist in different states: as nonculturable forms, as 'persisters', as rapidly growing bacteria and a biofilm-forming cording phenotype. The 'omics' approaches of transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics can help reveal the mechanisms underlying these different infection states in the host, and identify biosignatures with diagnostic potential, that can predict the development of disease, in 'progressors' as early as 12-18 months before it can be detected clinically, or that can monitor the success of anti-TB therapy. Further insights can be obtained from studies of BCG vaccination and new TB vaccines. For example, epigenetic changes associated with trained immunity and a stronger immune responses following BCG vaccination can be identified. These omics approaches may be particularly valuable when linked to studies of mycobacterial growth inhibition, as a direct read-out of the ability to control mycobacterial growth. The second generation of omics studies is identifying much smaller signatures based on as few as 3 or 4 genes. Thus, narrowing down omics-derived biosignatures to a manageable set of markers now opens the way to field-friendly point of care assays.","authors":[{"name":"M Lerm"},{"name":"H M Dockrell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biomarker"},{"word":"immunity"},{"word":"tuberculosis"}]},"article265":{"pmid":"29804274","title":"Are zoonotic Staphylococcus pseudintermedius strains a growing threat for humans?","date":"2019-01-10","abs":"Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a species often isolated from animals, as a common element of their microbiota or an agent of infection, and from people associated with an animal habitat, including owners of home pets-dogs and cats.

Recently, the use of vegetated drainage ditches (VDDs) has been employed in treatment of domestic sewage and agricultural runoff, but information on the performance of VDDs for treating these pollutants with various new management practices is still not sufficiently summarized. This paper aims to outline and review current knowledge related to the use of VDDs in mitigating these pollutants from domestic sewage and agricultural runoff.

Firstly, the reported major ditch characteristics with the most effect on pollutant removal processes (e.g., plant species, weirs, biofilms, and substrates selection) were summarized. The second focus concerns the function of ditch characteristics in VDDs for pollutant removal and identification of possible removal mechanisms involved.

Biofilm transmission is different from bacterial adhesion, because it involves biofilm compression in between two surfaces, followed by a separation force leading to the detachment of the biofilm from the donor surface and subsequent adhesion to the receiver surface. Therewith, the transmission depends on a balance between donor and receiver surface properties and the cohesiveness of the biofilm itself. Here, we compare bacterial transmission from biofilms of an extracellular-polymeric-substance (EPS)-producing and a non-EPS-producing staphylococcal strain and a dual-species oral biofilm from smooth silicon (Si) donor surfaces to smooth and nanopillared Si receiver surfaces. Biofilms were fully covering the donor surface before transmission. However, after transmission, the biofilms only partly covered the donor and receiver surfaces regardless of nanopillaring, indicating bacterial transmission through adhesive failure at the interface between biofilms and donor surfaces as well as through cohesive failure in the biofilms. The numbers of bacteria per unit volume in EPS-producing staphylococcal biofilms before transmission were 2-fold smaller than in biofilms of the non-EPS-producing strain and of dual species. This difference increased after transmission in the biofilm left behind on the donor surfaces due to an increased bacterial density for the non-EPS-producing strain and a dual-species biofilm. This suggests that biofilms of the non-EPS-producing strain and dual species remained compressed after transmission, while biofilms of the EPS-producing strain were induced to produce more EPS during transmission and relaxed toward their initial state after transmission due to the viscoelasticity conferred to the biofilm by its EPS.","authors":[{"name":" Gusnaniar"},{"name":"Ferdi Hizal"},{"name":"Chang-Hwan Choi"},{"name":"Jelmer Sjollema"},{"name":"Titik Nuryastuti"},{"name":"Minie Rustema-Abbing"},{"name":"Rene T Rozenbaum"},{"name":"Henny C van der Mei"},{"name":"Henk J Busscher"},{"name":"Stefan W Wessel"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"antimicrobials"},{"word":"cohesive failure"},{"word":"detachment"},{"word":"dual-species biofilm"},{"word":"structure of a biofilm"}]},"article277":{"pmid":"29800910","title":"Carbon-dependent chromate toxicity mechanism in an environmental Arthrobacter isolate.","date":"2019-10-22","abs":"Arthrobacter spp. are widespread in soil systems and well-known for their Cr(VI) reduction capabilities making them attractive candidates for in situ bioremediation efforts.

Laboratory culture-based studies suggest there is a carbon-dependent Cr(VI) toxicity mechanism that affects subsequent Cr(VI) reduction by strain LLW01. Strain LLW01 could only grow in the presence of, and reduce, 50 μM Cr(VI) when glucose or lactate were provided. Compared to lactate, Cr(VI) was at least 30-fold and 10-fold more toxic when ethanol or butyrate was the sole carbon source, respectively. The addition of sulfate mitigated toxicity somewhat, but had no effect on the extent of Cr(VI) reduction. Cell viability studies indicated that a small fraction of cells were viable after 8 days suggesting cell growth and subsequent Cr(VI) reduction may resume.

Accordingly, bacterial cells were found to preferably adhere to the square corners and convex walls of recessed surface features rather than the flat or concave walls of equal protruding features. This finding reveals, for the first time, that the particular shape of the surfaces features employed potentially determined the initial location of the adhering cells on textured surfaces.

In order to anticipate the specific requirements to optimize their metabolism and growth during a day-and-night cycle, Cyanobacteria possess a unique molecular timing mechanism known as the circadian clock that is well-studied under laboratory conditions but little is known about its function in a natural complex community. Here, we investigated daily rhythmicity of gene expression in a coastal microbial mat community sampled at 6 time points during a 24-h period. In order to identify diel expressed genes, meta-transcriptome data was fitted to periodic functions. Out of 24,035 conserved gene transcript clusters, approximately 7% revealed a significant rhythmic expression pattern. These rhythmic genes were assigned to phototrophic micro-eukaryotes, Cyanobacteria but also to Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Analysis of MG-RAST annotated genes and mRNA recruitment analysis of two cyanobacterial and three proteobacterial microbial mat members confirmed that homologs of the cyanobacterial circadian clock genes were also found in other bacterial members of the microbial mat community. These results suggest that various microbial mat members other than Cyanobacteria have their own molecular clock, which can be entrained by a cocktail of Zeitgebers such as light, temperature or metabolites from neighboring species. Hence, microbial mats can be compared to a complex organism consisting of multiple sub-systems that have to be entrained in a cooperative way such that the corpus functions optimally.","authors":[{"name":"Christine Hörnlein"},{"name":"Veronique Confurius-Guns"},{"name":"Lucas J Stal"},{"name":"Henk Bolhuis"}],"keywords":[]},"article297":{"pmid":"29796251","title":"How long is enough?

We show here that a highly conserved sensory-transduction system, BfmRS, mediates the coordinate development of both enhanced virulence and resistance in this microorganism. Hyperactive alleles of BfmRS conferred increased protection from serum complement killing and allowed lethal systemic disease in mice. BfmRS also augmented resistance and tolerance against an expansive set of antibiotics, including dramatic protection from β-lactam toxicity. Through transcriptome profiling, we showed that BfmRS governs these phenotypes through global transcriptional regulation of a post-exponential-phase-like program of gene expression, a key feature of which is modulation of envelope biogenesis and defense pathways. BfmRS activity defended against cell-wall lesions through both β-lactamase-dependent and -independent mechanisms, with the latter being connected to control of lytic transglycosylase production and proper coordination of morphogenesis and division. In addition, hypersensitivity of bfmRS knockouts could be suppressed by unlinked mutations restoring a short, rod cell morphology, indicating that regulation of drug resistance, pathogenicity, and envelope morphogenesis are intimately linked by this central regulatory system in A. baumannii. This work demonstrates that BfmRS controls a global regulatory network coupling cellular physiology to the ability to cause invasive, drug-resistant infections.","authors":[{"name":"Edward Geisinger"},{"name":"Nadav J Mortman"},{"name":"Germán Vargas-Cuebas"},{"name":"Albert K Tai"},{"name":"Ralph R Isberg"}],"keywords":[]},"article300":{"pmid":"29795121","title":"Extraction and quantification of biofilm bacteria: Method optimized for urinary catheters.","date":"2019-11-25","abs":"Bacterial biofilms are responsible for the failure of many medical devices such as urinary catheters and are associated with many infectious and non-infectious complications.

However, the lack of clarity over what to do, and when, is complicated by different teaching, research, and policy documents containing different terms and definitions for carious lesions and management strategies. Lack of clear messages and communication over recommendations hampers moving evidence into practice. The International Caries Consensus Collaboration (ICCC) recommendations on terminology are one part of improving communication for discussing the diagnosis and management of dental caries and dental carious lesions. The term dental caries is the name of the disease, its use being limited to situations involving control of the disease using preventive and noninvasive measures at the patient level. Carious lesion management should be used where management is directly related to disease symptoms at the tooth level. As terminology cannot be used to directly relate the visual appearance of the carious lesion to the histopathology, the terms have been based around the clinical consequences of the disease: soft, leathery, firm and hard dentine. The 3 main carious tissue removal options are described as: (1) selective removal of carious tissue (to both soft and firm dentine), (2) stepwise removal, and (3) non-selective removal to hard dentine (previously known as complete removal and no longer recommended).

A tight seal to isolate the biofilm and arrest the lesion can be successfully achieved using a sealant material such as resin or glass-ionomer for non-cavitated lesions, a restorative material for cavitated lesions, or, for primary teeth, preformed stainless-steel crowns. This chapter focuses on sealants and restorative materials. Sealant materials are a viable treatment option for controlling non-cavitated lesions in occlusal and proximal surfaces where there is no significant breach in the surface integrity of the tooth, even if the lesion extends into dentine. Resin infiltration can also be used to manage proximal non-cavitated lesions. Even when the exact depth of lesion that can be sealed has not been established, evidence supports sealing shallow and moderate deep lesions into dentine. For cavitated lesions, sealing lesions without carious tissue removal might be an option when removal of tooth tissue is not required to provide a hard periphery around the lesion/cavity margin (to enhance bonding or to increase cavity depth for enough restorative material to be placed to last). There is little evidence for placing a restorative material over cavitated carious lesions without tissue removal or preparation. However, where there is a significant breach in the surface integrity of the tooth but there is still enough sound tooth tissue to provide bonding for an adhesive restoration, sealing in carious tissue might still be an option.","authors":[{"name":"Margherita Fontana"},{"name":"Nicola Innes"}],"keywords":[]},"article305":{"pmid":"29793964","title":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Lung Transplant Recipients with Respiratory Isolation of Corynebacterium spp.","date":"2019-04-18","abs":"Although chronic respiratory disease and immunosuppression are risk factors for Corynebacterium species respiratory infection, data are scarce regarding this disease in lung transplantation.

In addition to the emergence of widespread antibiotic resistance, of equal concern are implantable device-associated infections, which result from bacterial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation at the site of implantation. The ineffectiveness of conventional antibiotics against these biofilms often leads to revision surgery, which is both debilitating to the patient and expensive.

In this study, various concentrations of sucrose were provided to Streptococcus mutans biofilms for 1 h per exposure (three times per day) to imitate a human meal pattern. And then the relationship between sucrose concentration and changes in the treated biofilms was determined. The results indicated that the components and acid production of the treated biofilms changed in a second-order polynomial curve pattern with sucrose concentration increase, which were confirmed by CLSM and SEM analyses. However, gene expression related to extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) formation, acid production and tolerance was up-regulated with sucrose concentration increase, which might have been due to compensation for the decrease in EPS formation and acid production by the biofilms at higher concentrations of sucrose. These findings suggest that sucrose in the range of 1%-5% can support the highest acid production and accumulation of S. mutans biofilms, which may further increase its cariogenic potential.

It is widely accepted that iron is a key nutrient for pathogenic bacteria, but little is known about its impact on microbiota associated with IBD. We used a model device to grow human mucosa-associated microbiota in its physiological anaerobic biofilm phenotype. Compared to microbiota from healthy donors, microbiota from IBD patients generate biofilms ex vivo that were larger in size and cell numbers, contained higher intracellular iron concentrations, and exhibited heightened virulence in a model of human intestinal epithelia in vitro and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We also describe an unexpected iron-scavenging property for an experimental hydrogen sulfide-releasing derivative of mesalamine. The findings demonstrate that this new drug reduces the virulence of IBD microbiota biofilms through a direct reduction of microbial iron intake and without affecting bacteria survival or species composition within the microbiota. Metabolomic analyses indicate that this drug reduces the intake of purine nucleosides (guanosine), increases the secretion of metabolite markers of purine catabolism (urate and hypoxanthine), and reduces the secretion of uracil (a pyrimidine nucleobase) in complex multispecies human biofilms. These findings demonstrate a new pathogenic mechanism for dysbiotic microbiota in IBD and characterize a novel mode of action for a class of mesalamine derivatives. Together, these observations pave the way towards a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of patients with IBD.","authors":[{"name":"Jean-Paul Motta"},{"name":"Thibault Allain"},{"name":"Luke E Green-Harrison"},{"name":"Ryan A Groves"},{"name":"Troy Feener"},{"name":"Hena Ramay"},{"name":"Paul L Beck"},{"name":"Ian A Lewis"},{"name":"John L Wallace"},{"name":"Andre G Buret"}],"keywords":[]},"article327":{"pmid":"29788056","title":"Bacterial biofilm formation on the hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi: a widespread ability under controls?","date":"2019-05-01","abs":"Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi establish symbiosis with roots of most trees of boreal and temperate ecosystems and are major drivers of nutrient fluxes between trees and the soil.

Here we investigated the ability of bacteria to form biofilm on the hyphae of the ECM fungus Laccaria bicolor. We showed that the ability to form biofilms on the hyphae of the ECM fungus is widely shared among soil bacteria. Conversely, some fungi, belonging to the Ascomycete class, did not allow for the formation of bacterial biofilms on their surfaces. The formation of biofilms was also modulated by the presence of tree roots and ectomycorrhizae, suggesting that biofilm formation does not occur randomly in soil but that it is regulated by several biotic factors.

Thermostable direct hemolysin gene (tdh) was negatively regulated by luxM and positively regulated by luxS. The biofilm formation was negatively regulated by both luxS and luxM. This study provides an insight into some aspects of V. parahaemolyticus virulence regulation by luxM/luxS-dependent quorum-sensing system.","authors":[{"name":"Muhan Guo"},{"name":"Zhijia Fang"},{"name":"Lijun Sun"},{"name":"Dongfang Sun"},{"name":"Yaling Wang"},{"name":"Can Li"},{"name":"Rundong Wang"},{"name":"Yang Liu"},{"name":"Hanqiao Hu"},{"name":"Ying Liu"},{"name":"Defeng Xu"},{"name":"Ravi Gooneratne"}],"keywords":[]},"article338":{"pmid":"29785600","title":"Performance and microbial community of CIC anaerobic reactor treating food waste under different grease contents and inner circulation ratio.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"High concentrations of grease easily inhibit anaerobic digestion.

An important virulence factor of C. glabrata is its capacity to strongly adhere to many different substrates.

Furthermore, biofilm dispersion assessment is presented to mimic the analysis of events triggering release of bacteria during the infection process.

Locally applied antibiotics, commonly embedded in polymethylmethacrylate, deliver high doses of drug directly to the fracture site. Direct application of antibiotic powder, which is being applied prophylactically in spine surgery, is a recent interest in the trauma sector, where bacterial biofilms are more prevalent. Traditional antibiotics, such as vancomycin, are poor performers against bacterial biofilms thus are ineffective in delayed treatment. Rifampin is an effective eradicator of Staphylococcal biofilms. Here, a rat model of musculoskeletal trauma was used to evaluate the utility of locally applied rifampin powder for reducing established orthopedic Staphylococcal infections in a delayed treatment scenario that previously indicated the limited use of local vancomycin. By applying rifampin powder directly to the contaminated segmental defect, the number of bacteria, as well as clinical indications of infection, were significantly reduced compared to vancomycin and daptomycin. Considering the Infectious Disease Society of America's recommendation to use rifampin in combination with another antibiotic to reduce the onset of rifampin resistance, rifampin powder was also applied in combination with vancomycin or daptomycin with insignificant changes in eradication performance. No indications of rifampin resistance were identified. Clinical Significance: The use of locally applied rifampin is a promising therapy for mature and tolerant musculoskeletal infections.

This article gives an overview on these activities and links them to other relevant research. Results from the NCA springs and comparable sites revealed that spring water harbors abundant natural microbial communities even in aquifers with high water residence times and the absence of immediate surface influence. Apparently, hydrogeology has a strong impact on the concentration and size of the observed microbes, and total cell counts (TCC) were suggested as a useful means for spring type classification. Measurement of microbial activities at the NCA springs revealed extremely low microbial growth rates in the base flow component of the studied spring waters and indicated the importance of biofilm-associated microbial activities in sediments and on rock surfaces. Based on genetic analysis, the autochthonous microbial endokarst community (AMEC) versus transient microbial endokarst community (TMEC) concept was proposed for the NCA springs, and further details within this overview article are given to prompt its future evaluation. In this regard, it is well known that during high-discharge situations, surface-associated microbes and nutrients such as from soil habitats or human settlements-potentially containing fecal-associated pathogens as the most critical water-quality hazard-may be rapidly flushed into vulnerable karst aquifers. In this context, a framework for the comprehensive analysis of microbial pollution has been proposed for the NCA springs to support the sustainable management of drinking water safety in accordance with recent World Health Organization guidelines. Near-real-time online water quality monitoring, microbial source tracking (MST) and MST-guided quantitative microbial-risk assessment (QMRA) are examples of the proposed analytical tools. In this context, this overview article also provides a short introduction to recently emerging methodologies in microbiological diagnostics to support reading for the practitioner.

Over the years extensive use and misuse of antimicrobial agents has led to emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensive drug resistant (XDR) pathogens. This drastic escalation in resistant phenotype has limited the efficacy of available therapeutic options. Thus, the need of the hour is to look for alternative therapeutic approaches to mitigate healthcare concerns caused due to MDR bacterial infections. Nanoparticles have gathered much attention as potential candidates for antibacterial therapy. Equipped with advantages of, wide spectrum bactericidal activity at very low dosage, inhibitor of biofilm formation and ease of permeability, nanoparticles have been considered as leading therapeutic candidates to curtail infections resulting from MDR bacteria. However, substrate non-specificity of efflux pumps, particularly those belonging to resistance nodulation division super family, have been reported to reduce efficacy of many potent antibacterial therapeutic drugs. Previously, we had reported antibacterial activity of polysaccharide-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) toward MDR bacteria. We showed that AgNPs inhibits biofilm formation and alters expression of cytoskeletal proteins FtsZ and FtsA, with minimal cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. In the present study, we report no reduction in antibacterial efficacy of silver nanoparticles in presence of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump proteins. Antibacterial tests were performed according to CLSI macrobroth dilution method, which revealed that both silver nanoparticles exhibited bactericidal activity at very low concentrations. Further, immunoblotting results indicated that both the nanoparticles modulate the transporter AcrB protein expression. However, expression of the membrane fusion protein AcrA did show a significant increase after exposure to AgNPs. Our results indicate that both silver nanoparticles are effective in eliminating MDR Enterobacter cloacae isolates and their action was not inhibited by AcrAB-TolC efflux protein expression. As such, the above nanoparticles have strong potential to be used as effective and alternate therapeutic candidates to combat MDR gram-negative Enterobacterial pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Mitali Mishra"},{"name":"Satish Kumar"},{"name":"Rakesh K Majhi"},{"name":"Luna Goswami"},{"name":"Chandan Goswami"},{"name":"Harapriya Mohapatra"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AcrAB-TolC"},{"word":"Enterobacter cloacae"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"efflux pump"},{"word":"nanoparticles"}]},"article364":{"pmid":"29780361","title":"Challenges and Promises for Planning Future Clinical Research Into Bacteriophage Therapy Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic Fibrosis. An Argumentative Review.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Although early aggressive and prolonged treatment with specific antibiotics can extend survival in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) colonized by opportunistic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), antibiotics fail to eradicate the infecting multidrug-resistant (MDR) PA strains in CF. Century-long research has suggested treating patients with bacteriophages (phages, prokaryotic viruses) naturally hosted by bacteria. Although the only phage types used in therapy, lytic phages, lyse PA aggregated in biofilm matrix by depolymerase degrading enzymes, how they can effectively, safely, and persistently do so in patients with CF is unclear. Even though advanced techniques for formulating phage cocktails, training phages and collecting phage libraries have improved efficacy in vitro, whether personalized or ready-to-use therapeutic approaches or phages and antibiotics combined are effective and safe in vivo, and can reduce PA biofilms, remains debatable. Hence, to advance clinical research on phage therapy in clinical trials, also involving mucoid and non-mucoid multidrug-resistant PA in CF, and overcome problems in Western international regulations, we need reliable and repeatable information from experiments in vitro and in vivo on phage characterization, cocktail selection, personalized approaches, and phages combined with antibiotics. These findings, challenges, and promises prompted us to undertake this argumentative review to seek up-to-date information from papers describing lytic phage activity tested in vitro on PA laboratory strains, and PA strains from chronic infections including CF. We also reviewed in vivo studies on phage activity on pulmonary and non-pulmonary animal host models infected by laboratory or CF PA strains. Our argumentative review provides essential information showing that future phage clinical research in CF should use well-characterized and selected phages isolated against CF PA, tested in vitro under dynamic conditions in cocktails or combined with antibiotics, and in vivo on non-pulmonary and pulmonary host models infected with mucoid and non-mucoid CF MDR PA. Our findings should encourage pharmaceutical industries to conduct clinical trials in vitro and in vivo testing patented genomic engineered phages from phage libraries combined with antibiotics to treat or even prevent multidrug-resistant PA in CF, thus helping international regulatory agencies to plan future clinical research on phage therapy in CF.","authors":[{"name":"Martina Rossitto"},{"name":"Ersilia V Fiscarelli"},{"name":"Paola Rosati"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteriophage therapy"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"efficiency of plating"},{"word":"lytic phages"},{"word":"multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"phage cocktails"},{"word":"phages and antibiotics combined"}]},"article365":{"pmid":"29780184","title":"Pore-Scale Hydrodynamics in a Progressively Bioclogged Three-Dimensional Porous Medium: 3-D Particle Tracking Experiments and Stochastic Transport Modeling.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilms are ubiquitous bacterial communities that grow in various porous media including soils, trickling, and sand filters. In these environments, they play a central role in services ranging from degradation of pollutants to water purification. Biofilms dynamically change the pore structure of the medium through selective clogging of pores, a process known as bioclogging. This affects how solutes are transported and spread through the porous matrix, but the temporal changes to transport behavior during bioclogging are not well understood. To address this uncertainty, we experimentally study the hydrodynamic changes of a transparent 3-D porous medium as it experiences progressive bioclogging. Statistical analyses of the system's hydrodynamics at four time points of bioclogging (0, 24, 36, and 48 h in the exponential growth phase) reveal exponential increases in both average and variance of the flow velocity, as well as its correlation length. Measurements for spreading, as mean-squared displacements, are found to be non-Fickian and more intensely superdiffusive with progressive bioclogging, indicating the formation of preferential flow pathways and stagnation zones. A gamma distribution describes well the Lagrangian velocity distributions and provides parameters that quantify changes to the flow, which evolves from a parallel pore arrangement under unclogged conditions, toward a more serial arrangement with increasing clogging. Exponentially evolving hydrodynamic metrics agree with an exponential bacterial growth phase and are used to parameterize a correlated continuous time random walk model with a stochastic velocity relaxation. The model accurately reproduces transport observations and can be used to resolve transport behavior at intermediate time points within the exponential growth phase considered.","authors":[{"name":"M Carrel"},{"name":"V L Morales"},{"name":"M Dentz"},{"name":"N Derlon"},{"name":"E Morgenroth"},{"name":"M Holzner"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3‐D porous medium"},{"word":"3‐D‐PTV"},{"word":"anomalous transport"},{"word":"bioclogging"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"correlated CTRW"}]},"article366":{"pmid":"29778938","title":"Effects of short- and long-term exposure of silver nanoparticles and silver ions to Nitrosomonas europaea biofilms and planktonic cells.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The increasing use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in consumer products, and their resulting influx into wastewater, may pose a threat to biological nutrient removal in wastewater treatment plants.

Here, we describe a set of tools that can be used to rapidly engineer deletions and insertions in the V. fischeri chromosome without cloning. We developed a uniform approach for generating deletions using PCR splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) with antibiotic cassettes flanked by standardized linker sequences. PCR SOEing of the cassettes to sequences up- and downstream of the target gene generates a DNA product that can be directly introduced by natural transformation. Selection for the introduced antibiotic resistance marker yields the deletion of interest in a single step. Because these cassettes also contain FRT (FLP recognition target) sequences flanking the resistance marker, Flp recombinase can be used to generate an unmarked, in-frame deletion. We developed a similar methodology and tools for the rapid insertion of specific genes at a benign site in the chromosome for purposes such as complementation. Finally, we generated derivatives of these tools to facilitate different applications, such as inducible gene expression and assessing protein production.

In this study, we demonstrated that iron uptake systems in P. denitrificans were directly regulated by a newly identified QS system.

In contrast, genes coding for the Fbp system, which is TonB independent and transports unchelated ferric iron, were downregulated in the mutants. In brief, QS in P. denitrificans triggers a switch in iron uptake from TonB-dependent to TonB-independent transport during biofilm formation as higher concentrations of iron accumulate in the exopolysaccharide (EPS). Switching from TonB-dependent iron uptake systems to TonB-independent systems not only prevents cells from absorbing excess iron but also conserves energy.

The analysis of the trajectories taken by the bacterial cells shows that the temporal characteristics of their intermittent motion depend on the instantaneous fraction of visited sites during diffusion. This describes quantitatively the time dependence of D, related to the progressive surface coverage by the polysaccharides. The observed slowdown of the surface diffusion may constitute a basic precursor mechanism for microcolony formation and provides clues for controlling biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"T Vourc'h"},{"name":"H Peerhossaini"},{"name":"J Léopoldès"},{"name":"A Méjean"},{"name":"F Chauvat"},{"name":"C Cassier-Chauvat"}],"keywords":[]},"article380":{"pmid":"29775686","title":"The comparative efficacy of antiseptics against Candida auris biofilms.","date":"2019-03-20","abs":"Candida auris has emerged as a significant clinical entity as it can cause outbreaks within the healthcare setting.

These flexible fibres mediate twitching motility, biofilm maturation, surface adhesion, and virulence. The pilus is composed mainly of major pilin subunits while the low abundance minor pilins FimU-PilVWXE and the putative adhesin PilY1 prime pilus assembly and are proposed to form the pilus tip. The minor pilins and PilY1 are encoded in an operon that is positively regulated by the FimS-AlgR two-component system. Independent of pilus assembly, PilY1 was proposed to be a mechanosensory component that-in conjunction with minor pilins-triggers up-regulation of acute virulence phenotypes upon surface attachment. Here, we investigated the link between the minor pilins/PilY1 and virulence. pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants had reduced virulence towards Caenorhabditis elegans relative to wild type or a major pilin mutant, implying a role in pathogenicity that is independent of pilus assembly. We hypothesized that loss of specific minor pilins relieves feedback inhibition on FimS-AlgR, increasing transcription of the AlgR regulon and delaying C. elegans killing. Reporter assays confirmed that FimS-AlgR were required for increased expression of the minor pilin operon upon loss of select minor pilins. Overexpression of AlgR or its hyperactivation via a phosphomimetic mutation reduced virulence, and the virulence defects of pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants required FimS-AlgR expression and activation. We propose that PilY1 and the minor pilins inhibit their own expression, and that loss of these proteins leads to FimS-mediated activation of AlgR that suppresses expression of acute-phase virulence factors and delays killing. This mechanism could contribute to adaptation of P. aeruginosa in chronic lung infections, as mutations in the minor pilin operon result in the loss of piliation and increased expression of AlgR-dependent virulence factors-such as alginate-that are characteristic of such infections.","authors":[{"name":"Victoria A Marko"},{"name":"Sara L N Kilmury"},{"name":"Lesley T MacNeil"},{"name":"Lori L Burrows"}],"keywords":[]},"article383":{"pmid":"29775462","title":"Analytical scaling relations to evaluate leakage and intrusion in intermittent water supply systems.","date":"2018-11-14","abs":"Intermittent water supplies (IWS) deliver piped water to one billion people; this water is often microbially contaminated. Contaminants that accumulate while IWS are depressurized are flushed into customers' homes when these systems become pressurized. In addition, during the steady-state phase of IWS, contaminants from higher-pressure sources (e.g., sewers) may continue to intrude where pipe pressure is low. To guide the operation and improvement of IWS, this paper proposes an analytic model relating supply pressure, supply duration, leakage, and the volume of intruded, potentially-contaminated, fluids present during flushing and steady-state. The proposed model suggests that increasing the supply duration may improve water quality during the flushing phase, but decrease the subsequent steady-state water quality. As such, regulators and academics should take more care in reporting if water quality samples are taken during flushing or steady-state operational conditions. Pipe leakage increases with increased supply pressure and/or duration. We propose using an equivalent orifice area (EOA) to quantify pipe quality. This provides a more stable metric for regulators and utilities tracking pipe repairs. Finally, we show that the volume of intruded fluid decreases in proportion to reductions in EOA. The proposed relationships are applied to self-reported performance indicators for IWS serving 108 million people described in the IBNET database and in the Benchmarking and Data Book of Water Utilities in India. This application shows that current high-pressure, continuous water supply targets will require extensive EOA reductions.

To verify that P. aeruginosa faces zinc shortage when colonizing the lungs of human patients, we analyzed the expression of three genes that are highly induced under conditions of zinc deficiency (zrmA, dksA2 and rpmE2), in bacteria in the sputum of patients with inflammatory lung disease. All three genes were expressed in all the analyzed sputum samples to a level much higher than that of bacteria grown in zinc-containing laboratory medium, supporting the hypothesis that P. aeruginosa is under zinc starvation during lung infections. We also found that the expression of several virulence traits that play a central role in the ability of P. aeruginosa to colonize the lung is affected by disruption of the most important zinc importing systems. Virulence features dependent on zinc intake include swarming and swimming motility and the ability to form biofilms. Furthermore, alterations in zinc assimilation interfere with the synthesis of the siderophore pyoverdine, suggesting that zinc recruitment could modulate iron uptake and affect siderophore-mediated cell signaling. Our results reveal that zinc uptake is likely to play a key role in the ability of P. aeruginosa to cause chronic lung infections and strongly modulates critical virulence traits of the pathogen.

Simultaneously, the spectral composition of nocturnal illumination is changing, following the current shift in outdoor lighting technologies from traditional light sources to light emitting diodes (LED). LEDs emit broad-spectrum white light, with a significant amount of photosynthetically active radiation, and typically a high content of blue light that regulates circadian rhythms in many organisms. While effects of the shift to LED have been investigated in nocturnal animals, its impact on primary producers is unknown. We performed three field experiments in a lowland agricultural drainage ditch to assess the impacts of a transition from high-pressure sodium (HPS) to white LED illumination (color temperature 4000 K) on primary producers in periphyton. In all experiments, we compared biomass and pigment composition of periphyton grown under a natural light regime to that of periphyton exposed to nocturnal HPS or, consecutively, LED light of intensities commonly found in urban waters (approximately 20 lux). Periphyton was collected in time series (1-13 weeks). We found no effect of HPS light on periphyton biomass; however, following a shift to LED the biomass decreased up to 62%. Neither light source had a substantial effect on pigment composition. The contrasting effects of the two light sources on biomass may be explained by differences in their spectral composition, and in particular the blue content. Our results suggest that spectral composition of the light source plays a role in determining the impacts of ALAN on periphyton and that the ongoing transition to LED may increase the ecological impacts of artificial lighting on aquatic primary producers.
