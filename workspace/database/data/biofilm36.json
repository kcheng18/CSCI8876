The acetone extract of Q. infectoria showed the highest anti-quorum sensing activity and reduced the pyocyanin, protease, and elastase production and biofilm formation by 89.1%, 78%, 73.3%, and 70.1%, respectively. The corresponding values were 88.2%, 72.1%, 69%, and 61.1% for the methanol extract of Z. multiflora and 70.6%, 63.42%, 60.1%, and 59.1% for the methanol extract of T. copticum.

Such changes could affect microbial antibiotic sensitivity and possibly pathogenicity. To evaluate this possibility, Escherichia coli (lac plus) cells were grown for over 1000 generations on Luria Broth medium under low-shear modeled microgravity conditions in a high aspect rotating vessel. This is the first study of its kind to grow bacteria for multiple generations over an extended period under low-shear modeled microgravity. Comparisons were made to a non-adaptive control strain using growth competitions. After 1000 generations, the final low-shear modeled microgravity-adapted strain readily outcompeted the unadapted lac minus strain. A portion of this advantage was maintained when the low-shear modeled microgravity strain was first grown in a shake flask environment for 10, 20, or 30 generations of growth. Genomic sequencing of the 1000 generation strain revealed 16 mutations. Of the five changes affecting codons, none were neutral. It is not clear how significant these mutations are as individual changes or as a group. It is concluded that part of the long-term adaptation to low-shear modeled microgravity is likely genomic.

The estimated prevalence of PCD is 1:10,000 to 1:20,000 live-born children, but true prevalence could be even higher. PCD is characterized by chronic upper and lower respiratory tract disease, infertility/ectopic pregnancy, and situs anomalies, that occur in ≈50% of PCD patients (Kartagener syndrome), and these may be associated with congenital heart abnormalities. Most patients report a daily year-round wet cough or nose congestion starting in the first year of life. Daily wet cough, associated with recurrent infections exacerbations, results in the development of chronic suppurative lung disease, with localized-to-diffuse bronchiectasis. No diagnostic test is perfect for confirming PCD. Diagnosis can be challenging and relies on a combination of clinical data, nasal nitric oxide levels plus cilia ultrastructure and function analysis. Adjunctive tests include genetic analysis and repeated tests in ciliary culture specimens. There are currently 33 known genes associated with PCD and correlations between genotype and ultrastructural defects have been increasingly demonstrated. Comprehensive genetic testing may hopefully screen young infants before symptoms occur, thus improving survival. Recent surprising advances in PCD genetic designed a novel approach called gene editing to restore gene function and normalize ciliary motility, opening up new avenues for treating PCD. Currently, there are no data from randomized clinical trials to support any specific treatment, thus, management strategies are usually extrapolated from cystic fibrosis. The goal of treatment is to prevent exacerbations, slowing the progression of lung disease. The therapeutic mainstay includes airway clearance maneuvers mainly with nebulized hypertonic saline and chest physiotherapy, and prompt and aggressive administration of antibiotics. Standardized care at specialized centers using a multidisciplinary approach that imposes surveillance of lung function and of airway biofilm composition likely improves patients' outcome. Pediatricians, neonatologists, pulmonologists, and ENT surgeons should maintain high awareness of PCD and refer patients to the specialized center before sustained irreversible lung damage develops. The recent creation of a network of PCD clinical centers, focusing on improving diagnosis and treatment, will hopefully help to improve care and knowledge of PCD patients.","authors":[{"name":"Virginia Mirra"},{"name":"Claudius Werner"},{"name":"Francesca Santamaria"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Kartagener’s syndrome"},{"word":"bronchiectasis"},{"word":"ciliopathy"},{"word":"mucociliary clearance"},{"word":"primary ciliary dyskinesia"}]},"article6":{"pmid":"28649561","title":"Psd1 Effects on Candida albicans Planktonic Cells and Biofilms.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Candida albicans is an important human pathogen, causing opportunistic infections.

Fouled seawater reverse osmosis membrane biofilm communities from an array of autopsied membrane samples, following a 7-year operational life-span in a full-scale desalination plant in Western Australia, were characterised by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding using the bacterial primers 515F and 806R.

We have identified a histone H1-derived peptide from the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), called VK25. Using this peptide as inspiration, we designed a synthetic peptide called DRGN-1. We evaluated the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of both peptides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. DRGN-1, more than VK25, exhibited potent antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity, and permeabilized bacterial membranes. Wound healing was significantly enhanced by DRGN-1 in both uninfected and mixed biofilm (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus)-infected murine wounds. In a scratch wound closure assay used to elucidate the wound healing mechanism, the peptide promoted the migration of HEKa keratinocyte cells, which was inhibited by mitomycin C (proliferation inhibitor) and AG1478 (epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor). DRGN-1 also activated the EGFR-STAT1/3 pathway. Thus, DRGN-1 is a candidate for use as a topical wound treatment. Wound infections are a major concern; made increasingly complicated by the emerging, rapid spread of bacterial resistance. The novel synthetic peptide DRGN-1 (inspired by a peptide identified from Komodo dragon) exhibits pathogen-directed and host-directed activities in promoting the clearance and healing of polymicrobial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa & Staphylococcus aureus) biofilm infected wounds. The effectiveness of this peptide cannot be attributed solely to its ability to act upon the bacteria and disrupt the biofilm, but also reflects the peptide's ability to promsote keratinocyte migration. When applied in a murine model, infected wounds treated with DRGN-1 healed significantly faster than did untreated wounds, or wounds treated with other peptides. The host-directed mechanism of action was determined to be via the EGFR-STAT1/3 pathway. The pathogen-directed mechanism of action was determined to be via anti-biofilm activity and antibacterial activity through membrane permeabilization. This novel peptide may have potential as a future therapeutic for treating infected wounds.","authors":[{"name":"Ezra M C Chung"},{"name":"Scott N Dean"},{"name":"Crystal N Propst"},{"name":"Barney M Bishop"},{"name":"Monique L van Hoek"}],"keywords":[]},"article13":{"pmid":"28649409","title":"Bacillus subtilis utilizes the DNA damage response to manage multicellular development.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Bacteria switch between free-living and a multicellular state, known as biofilms, in response to cellular and environmental cues.

Recently, it has been shown that biofilm formation initiates with the microscopically heterogeneous deposition of a skeleton of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by individual cells crawling on the surface, followed by growth of the biofilm into a surface-covering continuum. Here we report microfluidic experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms showing that their hidden heterogeneity can affect the later dynamics of their disruption. Using controlled air bubbles as a model for mechanical insult, we demonstrate that biofilm disruption is strongly dependent on biofilm age, and that disruption to early-stage biofilms can take the shape of a semi-regular pattern of ~15 µm diameter holes from which bacteria have been removed. We explain hole formation in terms of the rupture and retreat of the thin liquid layer created by the long bubble, which scrapes bacteria off the surface and rearranges their distribution. We find that the resulting pattern correlates with the spatial distribution of EPS: holes form where there is less EPS, whereas regions with more EPS act as strongholds against the scraping liquid front. These results show that heterogeneity in the microscale EPS skeleton of biofilms has profound consequences for later dynamics, including disruption. Because few attached cells suffice to regrow a biofilm, these results point to the importance of considering microscale heterogeneity when designing and assessing the effectiveness of biofilm removal strategies by mechanical forces.","authors":[{"name":"Hongchul Jang"},{"name":"Roberto Rusconi"},{"name":"Roman Stocker"}],"keywords":[]},"article16":{"pmid":"28649406","title":"Architecture, component, and microbiome of biofilm involved in the fouling of membrane bioreactors.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Biofilm formation on the filtration membrane and the subsequent clogging of membrane pores (called biofouling) is one of the most persistent problems in membrane bioreactors for wastewater treatment and reclamation.

However, despite its apparent role in bacterial vaginosis, little is known regarding the molecular determinants involved in biofilm formation by G. vaginalis. To gain insight into the role of G. vaginalis in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis, we carried out comparative transcriptomic analysis between planktonic and biofilm phenotypes, using RNA-sequencing.

Multiple types of extracellular polymeric substances can be produced by a single bacterial strain. The distinct polymer components of biofilms are known to provide chemical protection, but little is known about how distinct extracellular polysaccharides may also protect biofilms against mechanical stresses such as shear or phagocytic engulfment. Decades-long infections of Pseudomonas. aeruginosa biofilms in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients are natural models for studies of biofilm fitness under pressure from antibiotics and the immune system. In cystic fibrosis infections, production of the extracellular polysaccharide alginate has long been known to increase with time and to chemically protect biofilms. More recently, it is being recognized that chronic cystic fibrosis infections also evolve to increase production of another extracellular polysaccharide, Psl; much less is known about Psl's protective benefits to biofilms. We use oscillatory bulk rheology, on biofilms grown from longitudinal clinical isolates and from genetically-manipulated lab strains, to show that increased Psl stiffens biofilms and increases biofilm toughness, which is the energy cost to cause the biofilm to yield mechanically. Further, atomic force microscopy measurements reveal greater intercellular cohesion for higher Psl expression. Of the three types of extracellular polysaccharides produced by P. aeruginosa, only Psl increases the stiffness. Stiffening by Psl requires CdrA, a protein that binds to mannose groups on Psl and is a likely cross-linker for the Psl components of the biofilm matrix. We compare the elastic moduli of biofilms to the estimated stresses exerted by neutrophils during phagocytosis, and infer that increased Psl could confer a mechanical protection against phagocytic clearance.","authors":[{"name":"Kristin Kovach"},{"name":"Megan Davis-Fields"},{"name":"Yasuhiko Irie"},{"name":"Kanishk Jain"},{"name":"Shashvat Doorwar"},{"name":"Katherine Vuong"},{"name":"Numa Dhamani"},{"name":"Kishore Mohanty"},{"name":"Ahmed Touhami"},{"name":"Vernita D Gordon"}],"keywords":[]},"article21":{"pmid":"28649401","title":"Linkages between oral commensal bacteria and atherosclerotic plaques in coronary artery disease patients.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Coronary artery disease is an inflammatory disorder characterized by narrowing of coronary arteries due to atherosclerotic plaque formation. To date, the accumulated epidemiological evidence supports an association between oral bacterial diseases and coronary artery disease, but has failed to prove a causal link between the two. Due to the recent surge in microbial identification and analyses techniques, a number of bacteria have been independently found in atherosclerotic plaque samples from coronary artery disease patients. In this study, we present meta-analysis from published studies that have independently investigated the presence of bacteria within atherosclerotic plaque samples in coronary artery disease patients. Data were collated from 63 studies covering 1791 patients spread over a decade. Our analysis confirms the presence of 23 oral commensal bacteria, either individually or in co-existence, within atherosclerotic plaques in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, catheter-based atherectomy, or similar procedures. Of these 23 bacteria, 5 (Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens) are unique to coronary plaques, while the other 18 are additionally present in non-cardiac organs, and associate with over 30 non-cardiac disorders. We have cataloged the wide spectrum of proteins secreted by above atherosclerotic plaque-associated bacteria, and discuss their possible roles during microbial migration via the bloodstream. We also highlight the prevalence of specific poly-microbial communities within atherosclerotic plaques. This work provides a resource whose immediate implication is the necessity to systematically catalog landscapes of atherosclerotic plaque-associated oral commensal bacteria in human patient populations.","authors":[{"name":"Jyoti Chhibber-Goel"},{"name":"Varsha Singhal"},{"name":"Debaleena Bhowmik"},{"name":"Rahul Vivek"},{"name":"Neeraj Parakh"},{"name":"Balram Bhargava"},{"name":"Amit Sharma"}],"keywords":[]},"article22":{"pmid":"28649400","title":"Tracing back ancient oral microbiomes and oral pathogens using dental pulps from ancient teeth.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Ancient dental pulps are highly precious samples because they conserve DNA from humans and blood-borne pathogens for ages.

The presence of ecological interactions between microbes can change their physiology and response to treatment. For example, in the cystic fibrosis lung polymicrobial infection, antimicrobial susceptibility testing on clinical isolates is often not predictive of antibiotic efficacy. Novel approaches are needed to identify the interrelationships within the microbial community to better predict treatment outcomes. Here we used an ecological networking approach on the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics. This analysis showed that the community is separated into three interaction groups: Gram-positive anaerobes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The P. aeruginosa and S. aureus groups both anti-correlate with the anaerobic group, indicating a functional antagonism. When patients are clinically stable, these major groupings were also stable, however, during exacerbation, these communities fragment. Co-occurrence networking of functional modules annotated from metagenomics data supports that the underlying taxonomic structure is driven by differences in the core metabolism of the groups. Topological analysis of the functional network identified the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis as a keystone for the microbial community, which can be targeted with the antibiotic fosmidomycin. This study uses ecological theory to identify novel treatment approaches against a polymicrobial disease with more predictable outcomes.","authors":[{"name":"Robert A Quinn"},{"name":"Katrine Whiteson"},{"name":"Yan Wei Lim"},{"name":"Jiangchao Zhao"},{"name":"Douglas Conrad"},{"name":"John J LiPuma"},{"name":"Forest Rohwer"},{"name":"Stefanie Widder"}],"keywords":[]},"article25":{"pmid":"28649397","title":"Microbial biofilms and the human skin microbiome.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The human skin microbiome plays an important role in both health and disease.

A significant negative correlation was observed between cellulose expression and rates of diffusion through the extracellular polymeric substances.

We assessed host response and spontaneous wound closure in the relatively resistant C3H/HeN and the susceptible BALB/c mouse strain. Full-thickness burn wounds were inflicted in 108 mice. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm (106 colony forming units) was injected subcutaneously in 72 mice, euthanised day 4, 7 or 10 days post-infection. Wounds were analysed for neutrophil host response markers: S100A8/A9, keratinocyte-derived chemokine and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. Total peripheral blood leucocyte and polymorphonuclear count were assessed in parallel. Histopathology evaluated wound inflammatory burden. Photoplanimetry described macroscopical wound closure. Stable chronic wound infection was established in all challenged mice. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm suppressed neutrophil host response in wounds. C3H/HeN mice achieved earlier systemic inflammatory control and healed faster than BALB/c mice. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms perturb host defence thereby inducing a steady state of chronic infection which may impair wound healing.

Frequently, quorum sensing systems carry a positive feedback loop which produces a switch at a threshold size of the colony. This all-or-none switch can be beneficial to create a sudden attack, leaving a host little time to establish a defence. The reaction-diffusion system describing a basal quorum sensing loop involves production of signal molecules, diffusion of signal molecules, and detection of signal molecules. We study the ignition process in a numerical solution for a basal quorum sensor and demonstrate that even in a large colony the ignition travels through the whole colony in a less than a minute. The ignition of the positive feedback loop was examined in different approximations. As expected, in the exact calculation the ignition was found to be delayed compared to a calculation where the binding of signal molecules was quasistatic. The buffering of signal molecules is found to have little effect on the ignition process. Contrary to expectation, we find that the ignition does not start when the threshold is reached at the center-instead it allows for the threshold to be approached in the whole colony followed by an almost simultaneous ignition of the whole biofilm aggregate.","authors":[{"name":"Mikkel Lindstrøm Sørensen"},{"name":"Peter Dahl"},{"name":"Thomas Sams"}],"keywords":[]},"article49":{"pmid":"28644529","title":"Reciprocal cooperation of phytochemicals and micronutrients against typical and atypical forms of Borrelia sp.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Borrelia sp., a causative pathogenic factor of Lyme disease (LD), has become a major public health threat.

Secondary objectives were to correlate wound observations against microscopy results in ascertaining if clinical cues are useful in detecting wound biofilm. DFU tissue specimens were obtained from 65 subjects. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridisation (PNA-FISH) techniques with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to visualise biofilm structures. Next-generation DNA sequencing was performed to explore the microbial diversity. Clinical cues that included the presence of slough, excessive exudate, a gel material on the wound bed that reforms quickly following debridement, poor granulation and pyocyanin were correlated to microscopy results. Of the 65 DFU specimens evaluated by microscopy, all were characterised as containing biofilm (100%, P < 0·001). The presence of both mono-species and multi-species biofilms within the same tissue sections were detected, even when DNA sequencing analysis of DFU specimens revealed diverse polymicrobial communities. No clinical correlations were identified to aid clinicians in identifying wound biofilm. Microscopy visualisation, when combined with molecular approaches, confirms biofilms are ubiquitous in DFUs and form either mono- or multi-species biofilms. Clinical cues to aid clinicians in detecting wound biofilm are not accurate for use in DFUs.

On the contrary, the local application of antibiotics is useful in arthroplasty and necessary if implants are utilized. The reason for this is the prevention of a rapid biofilm formation on foreign implants and a resulting infection may remain undiscovered until it becomes chronic. Apart from exogenous material, necrotic tissue (e. g. bone sequestra) provides suitable retreat areas for pathogens in the body. Because of the characteristics of bone and joint infections and an exceptional infection recurrence rate, a combined approach is required. Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is able to reduce the number of pathogens acquired by perioperative contamination or hematogenic spread from another focus of infection; however, systemically applied antibiotics often fail to form an effective colonization barrier around the implant because their ability to penetrate the bone is relatively low. On the other hand, the high concentration of locally released antibiotics leads to an effective protection of the implant from bacteria in situ. Thus, for the treatment of implant-associated infections, systemic and local application of anti-infective agents is a reliable adjuvant measure that improves the therapeutic success. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is the most commonly used local drug carrier. Based on clinical and microbiological results, microbiologists and infectious disease experts together with the surgeon and pharmacist determine which anti-infective agents are indicated for systemic and local, PMMA cement-related application.

After invasion into intercellular spaces, R. solanacearum strain OE1-1 attaches to host cells and expression of the hrp genes encoding components of the type III secretion system (T3SS). OE1-1 then constructs T3SS and secrets effectors into host cells, inducing expression of the host gene encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase. This leads to suppressing plant innate immunity. Then, OE1-1 grows on host cells, inducing quorum sensing (QS). The QS contributes to regulation of OE1-1 colonization of intercellular spaces including mushroom-type biofilm formation on host cells, leading to its virulence. R. solanacearum strains AW1 and K60 produce methyl 3-hydroxypalmitate (3-OH PAME) as a QS signal. The methyltransferase PhcB synthesizes 3-OH PAME. When 3-OH PAME reaches a threshold level, it increases the ability of the histidine kinase PhcS to phosphorylate the response regulator PhcR. This results in elevated levels of functional PhcA, the global virulence regulator. On the other hand, strains OE1-1 and GMI1000 produce methyl 3-hydroxymyristate (3-OH MAME) as a QS signal. Among R. solanacearum strains, the deduced PhcB and PhcS amino acid sequences are related to the production of QS signals. R. solanacearum produces aryl-furanone secondary metabolites, ralfuranones, which are extracellularly secreted and required for its virulence, dependent on the QS.

Mutations in gacA or the two small RNAs rsmY/rsmZ, or overproduction of the RsmA protein essentially rescued the motility defect of the suhB mutant. Additionally, we identified a c-di-GMP mediated mechanism for SuhB regulation of motility and biofilm formation. We showed that the ΔsuhB mutant displayed elevated levels of c-di-GMP, and the ΔsuhB motility and biofilm phenotypes could be switched by artificially decreasing c-di-GMP levels. Further experiments led to the identification of the diguanylate cyclase GcbA responsible for regulating the c-di-GMP concentration in ΔsuhB and hence the switch between planktonic and surface-associated growth.

The presence of C. albicans dramatically altered gene expression in S. mutans in the dual-species biofilm, resulting in 393 genes differentially expressed, compared to mono-species biofilms of S. mutans. By Gene Ontology analysis, the majority of up-regulated genes were related to carbohydrate transport and metabolic/catabolic processes. KEGG pathway impact analysis showed elevated pyruvate and galactose metabolism, suggesting that co-cultivation with C. albicans influences carbohydrate utilization by S. mutans. Analysis of metabolites confirmed the increases in carbohydrate metabolism, with elevated amounts of formate in the culture medium of co-cultured biofilms. Moreover, co-cultivation with C. albicans altered transcription of S. mutans signal transduction (comC and ciaRH) genes associated with fitness and virulence.

The pathogenicity of Streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of human dental caries, relies on the bacterium's ability to form biofilms on tooth surface. However, the studies on efflux transporters in S. mutans are scare and the function of these transporters remained to be clarified. In this study, we identified an efflux transporter (LmrB) in S. mutans through cloning the lmrB gene into Escherichia coli. Introducing lmrB into E. coli conferred a multidrug-resistant phenotype and resulted in higher EtBr efflux activity which could be suppressed by efflux inhibitor. To explore whether LmrB was involved in S. mutans virulence properties regulation, we constructed the lmrB inactivation mutant and examined the phenotypes of the mutant. It was found that LmrB deficiency resulted in increased IPS storage and prolonged acid production. Enhanced biofilm formation characterized by increased extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) production and elevated resistance to hydrogen peroxide and antimicrobials were also observed in lmrB mutant. To gain a better understanding of the global role of LmrB, a transcriptome analysis was performed using lmrB mutant strain. The expression of 107 genes was up- or down-regulated in the lmrB mutant compared with the wild type. Notably, expression of genes in several genomic islands was differentially modulated, such as stress-related GroELS and scnRK, sugar metabolism associated glg operons and msmREFGK transporter.

The number of live/dead bacteria was also analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy. In addition, extracellular polysaccharide substances (EPS) extraction, carbohydrate analysis and scanning electron microscope observation were performed. A biofilm with heterogeneous structure formed on the polypropylene surface of the model water distribution system. Live/dead staining data indicated that biofilm matured in the first month. It was observed that especially AHB entered into a viable but not culturable state because of the temperature decrease. It was also noted that temperature is an important environmental factor especially for planktonic SRB.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the fluoride concentration in saliva and in biofilm fluid and biofilm solids across 6 intra-oral regions. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected from 42 participants and biofilm harvested from the buccal sites in the 4 molar and 2 anterior regions. Samples were collected at least 1 h after use of fluoride dentifrice. No attempt was made to control the participants' food consumption or use of other topical agents. Centrifuged saliva, biofilm fluid, and biofilm solids were analysed for fluoride using a fluoride ion-selective electrode, adapted for microanalysis. Fluoride in biofilm varied across intra-oral regions. The mean biofilm fluid fluoride concentrations across the oral cavity ranged from 11.6 to 16.8 µM, being statistically significantly higher in the upper anterior region than in any other region. In all regions the fluoride concentration in biofilm fluid was higher than in saliva. For biofilm solids the fluoride concentration was highest in the lower anterior region (2,461 μmol/kg) and lowest in the lower molar regions (388 and 406 μmol/kg, respectively). Within biofilm, the solids contained most of the fluoride (81 to >99%). The biofilm fluid fluoride concentration was significantly positively associated with salivary fluoride and only marginally associated with that of biofilm solids. In conclusion, this study has shown pronounced differences in fluoride distribution across intra-oral regions and compartments.

Carbon, nitrogen, and peptides tended to decrease the respiratory activity of all pathobionts, but not significantly. None of the evaluated compounds significantly increased activity of pathobionts at both 24 and 48 h. Additionally, metabolite requirements of pathobionts were dissimilar, suggesting that collective modulation of their respiratory activity may be challenging.

Much of the research on these strains has focused on the contributions of the polysaccharide alginate; however, it is becoming evident that the neutral polysaccharide Psl also contributes to biofilm formation and the maintenance of chronic infections. Here, we demonstrate that Psl produced by mucoid strains has significant roles in biofilm structure and evasion of immune effectors. Though mucoid strains produce less Psl than nonmucoid strains, the Psl that is produced is functional, since it mediates adhesion to human airway cells and epithelial cell death. Additionally, Psl protects mucoid bacteria from opsonization and killing by complement components in human serum. Psl production by mucoid strains stimulates a proinflammatory response in the murine lung, leading to reduced colonization. To determine the relevance of these data to clinical infections, we tested Psl production and biofilm formation of a panel of mucoid clinical isolates. We demonstrated three classes of mucoid isolates, those that produce Psl and form robust biofilms, those that did not produce Psl and have a poor biofilm phenotype, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) redundant strains. Collectively, these experimental results demonstrate that Psl contributes to the biofilm formation and immune evasion of many mucoid strains. This is a novel role for Psl in the establishment and maintenance of chronic pulmonary infections by mucoid strains.","authors":[{"name":"Christopher J Jones"},{"name":"Daniel J Wozniak"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"exopolysaccharide"},{"word":"immune evasion"},{"word":"lung infection"}]},"article102":{"pmid":"28634238","title":"Electron Transport Chain Is Biochemically Linked to Pilus Assembly Required for Polymicrobial Interactions and Biofilm Formation in the Gram-Positive Actinobacterium Actinomyces oris.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"The Gram-positive actinobacteria Actinomyces spp. are key colonizers in the development of oral biofilms due to the inherent ability of Actinomyces to adhere to receptor polysaccharides on the surface of oral streptococci and host cells. This receptor-dependent bacterial interaction, or coaggregation, requires a unique sortase-catalyzed pilus consisting of the pilus shaft FimA and the coaggregation factor CafA forming the pilus tip. While the essential role of the sortase machine SrtC2 in pilus assembly, biofilm formation, and coaggregation has been established, little is known about trans-acting factors contributing to these processes. We report here a large-scale Tn5 transposon screen for mutants defective in Actinomyces oris coaggregation with Streptococcus oralis We obtained 33 independent clones, 13 of which completely failed to aggregate with S. oralis, and the remainder of which exhibited a range of phenotypes from severely to weakly defective coaggregation. The former had Tn5 insertions in fimA, cafA, or srtC2, as expected; the latter were mapped to genes coding for uncharacterized proteins and various nuo genes encoding the NADH dehydrogenase subunits. Electron microscopy and biochemical analyses of mutants with nonpolar deletions of nuo genes and ubiE, a menaquinone C-methyltransferase-encoding gene downstream of the nuo locus, confirmed the pilus and coaggregation defects. Both nuoA and ubiE mutants were defective in oxidation of MdbA, the major oxidoreductase required for oxidative folding of pilus proteins. Furthermore, supplementation of the ubiE mutant with exogenous menaquinone-4 rescued the cell growth and pilus defects. Altogether, we propose that the A. oris electron transport chain is biochemically linked to pilus assembly via oxidative protein folding.","authors":[{"name":"Belkys C Sanchez"},{"name":"Chungyu Chang"},{"name":"Chenggang Wu"},{"name":"Bryan Tran"},{"name":"Hung Ton-That"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Actinomyces"},{"word":"Mycobacterium"},{"word":"actinobacteria"},{"word":"coaggregation"},{"word":"disulfide bond"},{"word":"oxidoreductases"},{"word":"pilus assembly"},{"word":"protein folding"},{"word":"sortase"}]},"article103":{"pmid":"28634237","title":"The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PSL Polysaccharide Is a Social but Noncheatable Trait in Biofilms.","date":"2019-12-27","abs":"Extracellular polysaccharides are compounds secreted by microorganisms into the surrounding environment, and they are important for surface attachment and maintaining structural integrity within biofilms.

Here, we empirically tested the cooperative nature of the PSL polysaccharide, which is crucial for the formation of biofilms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa We show that (i) PSL is not metabolically costly to produce; (ii) PSL provides population-level benefits in biofilms, for both growth and antibiotic tolerance; (iii) the benefits of PSL production are social and are shared with other cells; (iv) the benefits of PSL production appear to be preferentially directed toward cells which produce PSL; (v) cells which do not produce PSL are unable to successfully exploit cells which produce PSL.

DESIGN Diagnostic study. SETTING The endoscopy unit of an 1,100-bed university hospital performing ~13,000 endoscopic procedures annually. METHODS In total, 4 sampling techniques, combining flushing fluid with or without a commercial endoscope brush, were compared in an endoscope model. Based on these results, sterile physiological saline flushing with or without PULL THRU brush was selected for evaluation on 40 flexible endoscopes by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurement and bacterial culture. Acceptance criteria from the French National guideline (<25 colony-forming units [CFU] per endoscope and absence of indicator microorganisms) were used as part of the evaluation. RESULTS On biofilm-coated PTFE tubes, physiological saline in combination with a PULL THRU brush generated higher mean ATP values (2,579 relative light units [RLU]) compared with saline alone (1,436 RLU; P=.047). In the endoscope samples, culture yield using saline plus the PULL THRU (mean, 43 CFU; range, 1-400 CFU) was significantly higher than that of saline alone (mean, 17 CFU; range, 0-500 CFU; P<.001). In samples obtained using the saline+PULL THRU brush method, ATP values of samples classified as unacceptable were significantly higher than those of samples classified as acceptable (P=.001). CONCLUSION Physiological saline flushing combined with PULL THRU brush to sample endoscopes generated higher ATP values and increased the yield of microbial surveillance culture. Consequently, the acceptance rate of endoscopes based on a defined CFU limit was significantly lower when the saline+PULL THRU method was used instead of saline alone.

Here, Pseudomonas fluorescens has been introduced to the system to understand how bacteria interact with steel. Through electrochemical testing including open circuit potentials, potentiodynamic scans, anodic potential holds, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy it has been shown that P. fluorescens increases the rate of corrosion. Time for oxide and biofilms to develop was shown to not impact on the rate of corrosion but did alter the consistency of biofilm present and the viability of P. fluorescens following electrochemical testing. The proposed mechanism for increased corrosion rates of carbon steel involves the interactions of pyoverdine with the steel, preventing the formation of a cohesive passive layer, after initial cell attachment, followed by the formation of a metal concentration gradient on the steel surface.","authors":[{"name":"Amy J Spark"},{"name":"David W Law"},{"name":"Liam P Ward"},{"name":"Ivan S Cole"},{"name":"Adam S Best"}],"keywords":[]},"article107":{"pmid":"28633052","title":"Disinfection efficiencies of sage and spearmint essential oils against planktonic and biofilm Staphylococcus aureus cells in comparison with sodium hypochlorite.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus causes human infections and foodborne intoxications.

However, due to their hemolytic activity and cytotoxic effects on human cells, they may pose a health issue if produced in substantial amounts in the environment. In bacteria, lipopeptides can be synthesized via several well-evidenced mechanisms. In one of them, fatty acyl-AMP ligase (FAAL) initiates biosynthesis by activation of a fatty acyl residue. We have performed a bioinformatic survey of the cyanobacterial genomic information available in the public databases for the presence of FAAL-containing non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthetase (NRPS/PKS) biosynthetic clusters, as a genetic basis for lipopeptide biosynthesis. We have identified 79 FAAL genes associated with various NRPS/PKS clusters in 16% of 376 cyanobacterial genomic assemblies available, suggesting that FAAL is frequently incorporated in NRPS/PKS biosynthetases. FAAL was present either as a stand-alone protein or fused either to NRPS or PKS. Such clusters were more frequent in derived phylogenetic lineages with larger genome sizes, which is consistent with the general pattern of NRPS/PKS pathways distribution. The putative lipopeptide clusters were more frequently found in genomes of cyanobacteria that live attached to surfaces and are capable of forming microbial biofilms. While lipopeptides are known in other bacterial groups to play a role in biofilm formation, motility, and colony expansion, their functions in cyanobacterial biofilms need to be tested experimentally.

These mass drownings have been noted, but their frequency, size, and impact on aquatic ecosystems have not been quantified. Here, we estimate the frequency and size of mass drownings in the Mara River and model the fate of carcass nutrients through the river ecosystem. Mass drownings (>100 individuals) occurred in at least 13 of the past 15 y; on average, 6,250 carcasses and 1,100 tons of biomass enter the river each year. Half of a wildebeest carcass dry mass is bone, which takes 7 y to decompose, thus acting as a long-term source of nutrients to the Mara River. Carcass soft tissue decomposes in 2-10 wk, and these nutrients are mineralized by consumers, assimilated by biofilms, transported downstream, or moved back into the terrestrial ecosystem by scavengers. These inputs comprise 34-50% of the assimilated diet of fish when carcasses are present and 7-24% via biofilm on bones after soft tissue decomposition.

The studies employed clinical cystic fibrosis (CF) isolates (n = 3) and reference nonmucoid and mucoid multidrug-resistant (MDR) CF isolates (n = 7). Bacterial growth and biofilm development and disruption were studied using cell viability assays and image analysis with scanning electron and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Pseudomonal growth in AS medium was associated with increased ATP production (P < 0.05) and the formation (at 48 h) of discrete (>10-μm) microcolonies. In conventional growth medium, colistin retained an ability to inhibit growth of planktonic bacteria, although the MIC was increased (0.1 to 0.4 μg/ml) in AS medium compared to Mueller-Hinton (MH) medium. In contrast, in an established-biofilm model in AS medium, the efficacy of colistin was decreased. OligoG CF-5/20 (≥2%) treatment, however, induced dose-dependent biofilm disruption (P < 0.05) and led to colistin retaining its antimicrobial activity (P < 0.05). While circular dichroism indicated that OligoG CF-5/20 did not change the orientation of the alginate carboxyl groups, mass spectrometry demonstrated that the oligomers induced dose-dependent (>0.2%; P < 0.05) reductions in pseudomonal quorum-sensing signaling.

In this study, we investigated the ability of components of the wound environment to modulate interactions between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus We demonstrate that P. aeruginosa quorum sensing is inhibited by physiological levels of serum albumin, which appears to bind and sequester some homoserine lactone quorum signals, resulting in the inability of P. aeruginosa to produce virulence factors that kill S. aureus These data could provide important clues regarding the virulence of P. aeruginosa in albumin-depleted versus albumin-rich infection sites and an understanding of the nature of friendly versus antagonistic interactions between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.","authors":[{"name":"Allie Clinton Smith"},{"name":"Anne Rice"},{"name":"Bryan Sutton"},{"name":"Rebecca Gabrilska"},{"name":"Aimee K Wessel"},{"name":"Marvin Whiteley"},{"name":"Kendra P Rumbaugh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"albumin"},{"word":"polymicrobial infection"},{"word":"quorum sensing"},{"word":"wound"}]},"article116":{"pmid":"28629757","title":"Bacterial biofilm-based catheter-associated urinary tract infections: Causative pathogens and antibiotic resistance.","date":"2018-05-22","abs":"We sought to determine the incidence of bacterial biofilm-based catheter-associated urinary tract infections, identify variables affecting biofilm formation, and identify etiologic bacterial pathogens and antibiotic-resistance patterns associated with biofilm-based catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in our setup.","authors":[{"name":"Nargis Sabir"},{"name":"Aamer Ikram"},{"name":"Gohar Zaman"},{"name":"Luqman Satti"},{"name":"Adeel Gardezi"},{"name":"Abeera Ahmed"},{"name":"Parvez Ahmed"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm formation"},{"word":"Health care associated infection"},{"word":"Kirby bauer disc diffusion method"},{"word":"Tube adherence method"},{"word":"Urinalysis"}]},"article117":{"pmid":"28629318","title":"The effect of a daily application of a 0.05% chlorhexidine oral rinse solution on the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents: a multicenter study.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Dysphagia and potential respiratory pathogens in the oral biofilm are risk factors for aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents.

Here, we present an investigation of the urinary tract microbiome in catheterised SCI individuals, using T-RFLP and metagenomic sequencing of the microbial community. We monitored three neurogenic patients over a period of 12 months, who were part of a larger study investigating the efficacy of probiotics in controlling UTIs, to determine how their urinary tract microbial community composition changed over time and in relation to probiotic treatment regimens. Bacterial biofilms adherent to urinary catheters were examined as a proxy for bladder microbes. The microbial community composition of the urinary tract differed significantly between individuals. Probiotic therapy resulted in a significant change in the microbial community associated with the catheters. The community also changed as a consequence of UTI and this shift in community composition preceded the clinical diagnosis of infection. Changes in the microbiota due to probiotic treatment or infection were transient, resolving to microbial communities similar to their pre-treatment communities, suggesting that the native community was highly resilient. Based on these results, we propose that monitoring a patient's microbial community can be used to track the health of chronically catheterized patients and thus, can be used as part of a health-status monitoring program.","authors":[{"name":"Laetitia Bossa"},{"name":"Kimberly Kline"},{"name":"Diane McDougald"},{"name":"Bonsan Bonne Lee"},{"name":"Scott A Rice"}],"keywords":[]},"article122":{"pmid":"28628486","title":"Inactivation of bacterial biofilms using visible-light-activated unmodified ZnO nanorods.","date":"2018-07-23","abs":"Various zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures are widely used for photocatalytic antibacterial applications.

Microcosm and column experiments were conducted utilizing actual runoff, DOC from straw and compost, and a suite of TOrCs. Biodegradation of TOrCs in runoff was more enhanced by compost DOC than straw DOC (particularly for atrazine, prometon, benzotriazole, and fipronil). 16S rRNA gene quantification and sequencing revealed that growth-induced microbial community changes were, among replicates, most consistent for compost-augmented microcosms and least consistent for raw runoff microcosms. Compost DOC most robustly enhanced utilization of TOrCs as carbon substrates, possibly due to higher residual nutrient levels upon TOrC exposure. Sand columns containing just 0.5 wt % biochar maintained sorptive TOrC retention in the presence of compost-DOC-cultivated biofilms, and TOrC removal was further enhanced by biological activity.

Biofilm growth progresses through three genetically programmed stages: substratum attachment, intercellular aggregation and architecture maturation. Growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis biofilms requires multiple factors including a chaperonin (GroEL1) and a nucleoid-associated protein (Lsr2), although how their activities are linked remains unclear. Here it is shown that Lsr2 participates in intercellular aggregation, but substratum attachment of Lsr2 mutants is unaffected, thereby genetically distinguishing these developmental stages. Further, a suppressor mutation in a glycopeptidolipid synthesis gene (mps) that results in hyperaggregation of cells and fully restores the form and functions of Δlsr2 mutant biofilms was identified. Suppression by the mps mutation is specific to Δlsr2; it does not rescue the maturation-deficient biofilms of a ΔgroEL1 mutant, thereby differentiating the process of aggregation from maturation. Gene expression analysis supports a stepwise process of maturation, highlighted by temporally separated, transient inductions of iron and nitrogen import genes. Furthermore, GroEL1 activity is required for induction of nitrogen, but not iron, import genes. Together, the findings begin to define molecular checkpoints during development of mycobacterial biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Yong Yang"},{"name":"Joseph Thomas"},{"name":"Yunlong Li"},{"name":"Catherine Vilchèze"},{"name":"Keith M Derbyshire"},{"name":"William R Jacobs"},{"name":"Anil K Ojha"}],"keywords":[]},"article127":{"pmid":"28628237","title":"Wing phosphorylation is a major functional determinant of the Lrs14-type biofilm and motility regulator AbfR1 in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.","date":"2017-11-28","abs":"In response to a variety of environmental cues, prokaryotes can switch between a motile and a sessile, biofilm-forming mode of growth.

Here, we study the Lrs14 member AbfR1 of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. Small-angle X-ray scattering data are presented, which are consistent with a model of dimeric AbfR1 in which dimerization occurs via an antiparallel coiled coil as suggested by homology modeling. Furthermore, solution structure data of AbfR1-DNA complexes suggest that upon binding DNA, AbfR1 induces deformations in the DNA. The wing residues tyrosine 84 and serine 87, which are phosphorylated in vivo, are crucial to establish stable protein-DNA contacts and their substitution with a negatively charged glutamate or aspartate residue inhibits formation of a nucleoprotein complex. Furthermore, mutation abrogates the cellular abundance and transcription regulatory function of AbfR1 and thus affects the resulting biofilm and motility phenotype of S. acidocaldarius.

The complex biofouling resulted from EfOM closely related with significant retention of SMP on the non-porous NF membrane surface, where the Proteobacteria phylum dominated the biofouling formed by microbial community growth and accumulation that gave rise to serious irreversible membrane fouling.","authors":[{"name":"Wentao Shang"},{"name":"Feiyun Sun"},{"name":"Lichun Chen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"dissolved organic matter"},{"word":"effluent organic matters"},{"word":"nanofiltration"},{"word":"surface reservoir water"}]},"article136":{"pmid":"28625077","title":"Microbiome and Microbial Biofilm Profiles of Peri-Implantitis: A Systematic Review.","date":"2019-02-12","abs":"This systematic review assesses microbiologic profiles of peri-implantitis, periodontitis, and healthy implants based on studies that evaluated microbial biofilms and entire microbiomes to establish their similarities and differences.","authors":[{"name":"Gloria Inés Lafaurie"},{"name":"María Alejandra Sabogal"},{"name":"Diana Marcela Castillo"},{"name":"María Victoria Rincón"},{"name":"Luz Amparo Gómez"},{"name":"Yamil Augusto Lesmes"},{"name":"Leandro Chambrone"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chronic periodontitis"},{"word":"dental implants"},{"word":"genome, microbial"},{"word":"gram-positive rods"},{"word":"microbiota"},{"word":"peri-implantitis"}]},"article137":{"pmid":"28624996","title":"Exploring the Bioelectrochemical Characteristics of Activated Sludge Using Cyclic Voltammetry.","date":"2018-05-09","abs":"Due to the potential interest, bioelectrochemical responses of activated sludge using the three-electrode system are tested.

Changing the working electrode from glassy carbon to carbon paste led to the increase in the electrochemical signal from 0.3 to be 3.72 μA.

Based on these findings, the mixed microbial community of the activated sludge is exploited as a catalyst for the bio-oxidation of the degradable organic substrates, while DCIP is used as a mobile electron carrier from the intracellular matrix of the metabolically active cells to the carbon paste electrode which served as the final electron acceptor.

Measurements of heterotrophic activity were done under natural light levels at different times during a daily cycle and under an artificial extinction of natural light during the afternoon. We also measured Sargassum primary production under these light levels in the afternoon. Both measurements were done with and without photosynthesis inhibitor and antibiotics. Biofilm composition was mainly represented by bacteria but diatoms, cyanobacteria, and other organisms were also common. When a peak of diatom genera was recorded, the heterotrophic activity of the biofilm was higher. Heterotrophic activity was usually highest during the afternoon and the presence of a photosynthesis inhibitor caused an average reduction of 17% but there was no relationship with Sargassum primary production. These results indicate that autotrophic production in the biofilm was reduced by the inhibitor with consequences on bacterial activity. Heterotrophic activity was mainly bacterial and the antibiotics chloramphenicol and penicillin were more effective than streptomycin. We suggest primary producers in the biofilm are more important to increase bacterial activity than the macroalgae itself because of coherence of the peaks of heterotrophic and autotrophic activity in biofilm during the afternoon and the effects of autotrophic inhibitors on heterotrophic activity.","authors":[{"name":"Sergio A Coelho-Souza"},{"name":"Stuart R Jenkins"},{"name":"Antonio Casarin"},{"name":"Maria Helena Baeta-Neves"},{"name":"Leonardo T Salgado"},{"name":"Jean R D Guimaraes"},{"name":"Ricardo Coutinho"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Autotrophic-heterotrophic production"},{"word":"Brazilian upwelling"},{"word":"Leucine incorporation"},{"word":"Prokaryotic-eukaryotic interaction"},{"word":"Specific metabolic inhibitors"},{"word":"Sun light"}]},"article139":{"pmid":"28624738","title":"Accelerating anodic biofilms formation and electron transfer in microbial fuel cells: Role of anionic biosurfactants and mechanism.","date":"2017-08-15","abs":"Anodic electron transfer is the predominant electricity generation process of MFCs.

The energy recovery of MFCs increased from 20.5% ± 3.9% to 28.3% ± 4.1% with endogenous AHLs and further rose to 36.2% ± 5.1% with exogenous AHLs, and the start-up period of MFCs shortened from 13 days to 10 days with endogenous AHLs and further reduced to 4 days in the presence of exogenous AHLs.

Four of the CNS isolates with a weak-biofilm phenotype (Staphylococcus chromogenes C and E and Staphylococcus simulans F and H) significantly reduced biofilm formation in approximately 80% of the staphylococcal species tested, including coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The 4 Staph. chromogenes and Staph. simulans isolates were also able to disperse pre-established biofilms, but to a lesser extent.

CF airways can be colonized by a variety of microorganisms; the most frequently encountered bacterial and fungal pathogens are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus, respectively. Co-infection with P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus often results in a more rapid loss of lung function, indicating that interactions between these pathogens affect infection pathogenesis. There has been renewed interest in the use of viruses (bacteriophage, mycoviruses) as alternatives to antibiotics to treat these infections. In previous work, we found that filamentous Pf bacteriophage produced by P. aeruginosa directly inhibited the metabolic activity of A. fumigatus by binding to and sequestering iron. In the current study, we further examined how filamentous Pf bacteriophage affected interactions between P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus. Here, we report that the antifungal properties of supernatants collected from P. aeruginosa cultures infected with Pf bacteriophage were substantially less inhibitory towards A. fumigatus biofilms. In particular, we found that acute infection of P. aeruginosa by Pf bacteriophage inhibited the production of the virulence factor pyoverdine. Our results raise the possibility that the reduced production of antimicrobials by P. aeruginosa infected by Pf bacteriophage may promote conditions in CF airways that allow co-infection with A. fumigatus to occur, exacerbating disease severity. Our results also highlight the importance of considering how the use of bacteriophage as therapeutic agents could affect the behavior and composition of polymicrobial communities colonizing sites of chronic infection.","authors":[{"name":"Patrick R Secor"},{"name":"Gabriele Sass"},{"name":"Hasan Nazik"},{"name":"David A Stevens"}],"keywords":[]},"article148":{"pmid":"28621641","title":"Colistin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is not linked to arnB.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"It is known that the arnB (or pmrH) gene encoding uridine 5'-(beta-1-threo-pentapyranosyl-4-ulose diphosphate) aminotransferase plays a critical role in colistin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa through the addition of 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) to lipid A.

Transcription factor analysis of oral keratinocytes predicted S. mitis-mediated activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Activation and functionality of AhR was confirmed through nuclear translocation determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription analysis of CYP1A1, the hallmark gene for AhR activation. Addition of Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus gordonii did not induce CYP1A1 transcription in the keratinocyte cultures. Introduction of an AhR-specific inhibitor revealed that S. mitis-mediated transcription of CXCL2 and CXCL8 was regulated by AhR. Elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in supernatants from S. mitis-treated oral epithelial cells were also attenuated by inhibition of AhR activity. The observed AhR-regulated activities point to a contribution of S. mitis in the regulation of inflammatory responses and thereby to wound healing in the oral cavity. The concept that the oral commensal microbiota can induce AhR activation is important, also in view of the role that AhR has in modulation of T-cell differentiation and as an anti-inflammatory factor in macrophages.","authors":[{"name":"Stian A Engen"},{"name":"Gro H Rørvik"},{"name":"Olav Schreurs"},{"name":"Inger Js Blix"},{"name":"Karl Schenck"}],"keywords":[]},"article151":{"pmid":"28620784","title":"Inhibitory Effect of Taurine on Biofilm Formation During Alkane Degradation in Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Taurine, 2-aminoethanesulfonate, is known to function as an antioxidant or membrane stabilizer in eukaryotic cells, but its role in bacteria has been poorly characterized.

Structurally similar compounds harboring an amine group such as hypotaurine or ethylenediamine have a similar effect, which was not observed with sulfonate-containing chemicals such as ethanesulfonic acid, hexanesulfonic acid. Our biochemical assays and physiological tests demonstrate that taurine reduced cell surface hydrophobicity, which resulted in interruption of the interactions between cells and oily substrate surfaces, such that cells utilized alkanes less effectively.

Composition and biomass of extracellular polymeric saccharides were changed in taurine-amended conditions.

The other three species were crucially needed for the successful inclusion of M. oxydans in the four-species biofilm, where X. retroflexus was consistently positioned in the top layer of the mature four-species biofilm.

This cross-kingdom biofilm contains an extensive matrix of extracellular α-glucans that is produced by an exoenzyme (GtfB) secreted by S. mutans. Here, we report that mannans located on the outer surface of C. albicans cell-wall mediates GtfB binding, enhancing glucan-matrix production and modulating bacterial-fungal association within biofilms formed in vivo. Using single-molecule atomic force microscopy, we determined that GtfB binds with remarkable affinity to mannans and to the C. albicans surface, forming a highly stable and strong bond (1-2 nN). However, GtfB binding properties to C. albicans was compromised in strains defective in O-mannan (pmt4ΔΔ) or N-mannan outer chain (och1ΔΔ). In particular, the binding strength of GtfB on och1ΔΔ strain was severely disrupted (>3-fold reduction vs. parental strain). In turn, the GtfB amount on the fungal surface was significantly reduced, and the ability of C. albicans mutant strains to develop mixed-species biofilms with S. mutans was impaired. This phenotype was independent of hyphae or established fungal-biofilm regulators (EFG1, BCR1). Notably, the mechanical stability of the defective biofilms was weakened, resulting in near complete biomass removal by shear forces. In addition, these in vitro findings were confirmed in vivo using a rodent biofilm model. Specifically, we observed that C. albicans och1ΔΔ was unable to form cross-kingdom biofilms on the tooth surface of rats co-infected with S. mutans. Likewise, co-infection with S. mutans defective in GtfB was also incapable of forming mixed-species biofilms. Taken together, the data support a mechanism whereby S. mutans-secreted GtfB binds to the mannan layer of C. albicans to promote extracellular matrix formation and their co-existence within biofilms. Enhanced understanding of GtfB-Candida interactions may provide new perspectives for devising effective therapies to disrupt this cross-kingdom relationship associated with an important childhood oral disease.","authors":[{"name":"Geelsu Hwang"},{"name":"Yuan Liu"},{"name":"Dongyeop Kim"},{"name":"Yong Li"},{"name":"Damian J Krysan"},{"name":"Hyun Koo"}],"keywords":[]},"article162":{"pmid":"28617843","title":"Characterization of the regulation of a plant polysaccharide utilization operon and its role in biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis is often found in association with plants in the rhizosphere. Previously, plant polysaccharides have been shown to stimulate formation of root-associated multicellular communities, or biofilms, in this bacterium, yet the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. A five-gene gan operon (ganSPQAB) in B. subtilis has recently been shown to be involved in utilization of the plant-derived polysaccharide galactan. Despite these findings, molecular details about the regulation of the operon and the role of the operon in biofilm formation remain elusive. In this study, we performed comprehensive genetic analyses on the regulation of the gan operon. We show that this operon is regulated both by a LacI-like transcription repressor (GanR), which directly binds to pairs of inverted DNA repeats in the promoter region of the operon, and by the catabolite control protein A (CcpA). Derepression can be triggered by the presence of the inducer β-1,4-galactobiose, a hydrolysis product of galactan, or in situ when B. subtilis cells are associated with plant roots. In addition to the transcriptional regulation, the encoded ß-galactosidase GanA (by ganA), which hydrolyzes ß-1,4-galactobiose into galactose, is inhibited at the enzymatic level by the catalytic product galactose. Thus, the galactan utilization pathway is under complex regulation involving both positive and negative feedback mechanisms in B. subtilis. We discuss about the biological significance of such complex regulation as well as a hypothesis of biofilm induction by galactan via multiple mechanisms.","authors":[{"name":"Cameron Habib"},{"name":"Yiyang Yu"},{"name":"Kevin Gozzi"},{"name":"Carly Ching"},{"name":"Moshe Shemesh"},{"name":"Yunrong Chai"}],"keywords":[]},"article163":{"pmid":"28617616","title":"The Role of NrF2 in the Regulation of Periodontal Health and Disease.","date":"2017-09-18","abs":"Immune-related disease tolerance is an important defense strategy that facilitates the maintenance of health in organs and tissues that are commonly colonized by bacteria.

In periodontal health, neutrophils and macrophages respond to the formation of pathogenic bacterial biofilms by the production of bactericidal reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, when released in excess, ROS cause tissue damage and exacerbate inflammation. To counter these destructive responses, many cell types, including neutrophils and macrophages, launch a dedicated antioxidant system that limits the cell and tissue-damaging effects of ROS. The expression of antioxidants is primarily regulated by genetic response elements in their promoters. Here we consider the roles of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NrF2), a transcription factor, and other key regulators of antioxidants.

To achieve coordinated transcriptional and translational regulation at the genomic level, the CRISPRi and Hfq-dependent sRNA systems were incorporated into a single plasmid harbored in a recombinant S. oneidensis strain, which enabled an even higher efficiency of mtrA gene repression in the EET pathways than that achieved by the CRISPRi and Hfq-dependent sRNA system alone, as exhibited by the reduced electricity output. Overall, we developed a combined CRISPRi-sRNA method that enabled the synergistic transcriptional and translational regulation of target genes in S. oneidensis.

Most of the retrieved studies evaluated the wear and corrosion (tribocorrosion) of titanium-based materials used for implants and abutments in artificial saliva. Electrochemical and wear tests together with microscopic techniques were applied to validate the tribocorrosion behavior of the surfaces. A few studies inspected the wear on the inner surfaces of the implant connection as a result of fatigue or removal of abutments. The studies reported increased microgaps after fatigue tests. In addition, data suggest that micromovements occurring at the contacting surfaces can increase the wear of the inner surfaces of the connection.

Three strains displayed clonal distribution, one among patients from the CF group and two among non-CF patients. No significant differences in susceptibility to antimicrobials were observed between CF and non-CF patients. About one third of the isolates were classified as strong biofilm producers, and the proportion of CF and non-CF isolates with the ability to form biofilm was almost identical. CF isolates were less motile compared to the non-CF group and no correlation was found between swimming phenotype and biofilm formation. On the other hand, CF isolates exhibited higher affinity to bind mucin, collagen, and fibronectin.

A global transcriptome analysis was conducted using a gene chip microarray to identify the genes targeted by LAE.

Shuttle-mediated metabolism can support survival when substrates are available not locally but rather at a distance.

In the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, antibiotics called phenazines act as oxidants to balance the intracellular redox state of cells in anoxic biofilm subzones. PA14 colony biofilms show a profound morphogenic response to phenazines resulting from electron acceptor-dependent inhibition of ECM production. This effect is reminiscent of the developmental responses of some eukaryotic systems to redox control, but for bacterial systems its mechanistic basis has not been well defined. Here, we identify the regulatory protein RmcA and show that it links redox conditions to PA14 colony morphogenesis by modulating levels of bis-(3',5')-cyclic-dimeric-guanosine (c-di-GMP), a second messenger that stimulates matrix production, in response to phenazine availability. RmcA contains four Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains and domains with the potential to catalyze the synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP. Our results suggest that phenazine production modulates RmcA activity such that the protein degrades c-di-GMP and thereby inhibits matrix production during oxidizing conditions.

Clinical studies have shown that S. mutans is often detected with Candida albicans in early childhood caries. Although the C. albicans presence has been shown to enhance bacterial accumulation in biofilms, the influence of S. mutans on fungal biology in this mixed-species relationship remains largely uncharacterized. Therefore, we aimed to investigate how the presence of S. mutans influences C. albicans biofilm development and coexistence. Using a newly established haploid biofilm model of C. albicans, we found that S. mutans augmented haploid C. albicans accumulation in mixed-species biofilms. Similarly, diploid C. albicans also showed enhanced biofilm formation in the presence of S. mutans. Surprisingly, the presence of S. mutans restored the biofilm-forming ability of C. albicans bcr1Δ mutant and bcr1Δ/Δ mutant, which is known to be severely defective in biofilm formation when grown as single species. Moreover, C. albicans hyphal growth factor HWP1 as well as ALS1 and ALS3, which are also involved in fungal biofilm formation, were upregulated in the presence of S. mutans. Subsequently, we found that S. mutans-derived glucosyltransferase B (GtfB) itself can promote C. albicans biofilm development. Interestingly, GtfB was able to increase the expression of HWP1, ALS1, and ALS3 genes in the C. albicans diploid wild-type SC5314 and bcr1Δ/Δ, leading to enhanced fungal biofilms. Hence, the present study demonstrates that a bacterial exoenzyme (GtfB) augments the C. albicans counterpart in mixed-species biofilms through a BCR1-independent mechanism. This novel finding may explain the mutualistic role of S. mutans and C. albicans in cariogenic biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"K Ellepola"},{"name":"Y Liu"},{"name":"T Cao"},{"name":"H Koo"},{"name":"C J Seneviratne"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"candidiasis"},{"word":"dental caries"},{"word":"dental plaque"},{"word":"glucans"},{"word":"glucosyltransferase"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"28605563","title":"The contribution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factors and host factors in the establishment of urinary tract infections.","date":"2018-11-01","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause complicated urinary tract infections, particularly in people with catheters, which can lead to pyelonephritis.

Rev. Microbiol. 2010 , 8 , 623 ). Because biofilms are resistant to antibiotics, they are problematic in many aspects of human health and welfare, causing, for instance, persistent fouling of medical implants such as catheters and artificial joints ( Brunetto Chimia 2008 , 62 , 249 ). They are responsible for chronic infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and in open wounds, such as those associated with burns and diabetes. They are also a major contributor to hospital-acquired infections ( Sievert Infec. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2013 , 34 , 1 ; Tatterson Front. Biosci. 2001 , 6 , D890 ). It has been hypothesized that effective methods of biofilm control will have widespread application ( Landini Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010 , 86 , 813 ). A promising strategy is to target the mechanisms that drive biofilm dispersal, because dispersal results in biofilm removal and in the restoration of antibiotic sensitivity. First documented in Nitrosomonas europaea ( Schmidt J. Bacteriol. 2004 , 186 , 2781 ) and the cystic fibrosis-associated pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Barraud J. Bacteriol. 2006 , 188 , 7344 ; J. Bacteriol. 2009 , 191 , 7333 ), regulation of biofilm formation by nanomolar levels of the diatomic gas nitric oxide (NO) has now been documented in numerous bacteria ( Barraud Microb.

NO-mediated pathways are, therefore, promising candidates for biofilm regulation. Characterization of the NO sensors and NO-regulated signaling pathways should allow for rational manipulation of these pathways for therapeutic applications. Several laboratories, including our own, have shown that a class of NO sensors called H-NOX (heme-nitric oxide or oxygen binding domain) affects biofilm formation by regulating intracellular cyclic di-GMP concentrations and quorum sensing ( Arora Biochemistry 2015 , 54 , 3717 ; Plate Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013 , 38 , 566 ; Nisbett Biochemistry 2016 , 55 , 4873 ). Many bacteria that respond to NO do not encode an hnoX gene, however. My laboratory has now discovered an additional family of bacterial NO sensors, called NosP (nitric oxide sensing protein). Importantly, NosP domains are widely conserved in bacteria, especially Gram-negative bacteria, where they are encoded as fusions with or in close chromosomal proximity to histidine kinases or cyclic di-GMP synthesis or phosphodiesterase enzyme, consistent with signaling. In this Account, we briefly review NO and H-NOX signaling in bacterial biofilms, describe our discovery of the NosP family, and provide support for its role in biofilm regulation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Legionella pneumophila, and Shewanella oneidensis.","authors":[{"name":"Sajjad Hossain"},{"name":"Lisa-Marie Nisbett"},{"name":"Elizabeth M Boon"}],"keywords":[]},"article212":{"pmid":"28605112","title":"Candida albicans biofilms: comparative analysis of room-temperature and cryofixation for scanning electron microscopy.","date":"2019-06-27","abs":"Biofilms are frequently related to invasive fungal infections and are reported to be more resistant to antifungal drugs than planktonic cells.

Thus, in this work, we propose a comparative analysis of room-temperature and cryofixation/freeze substitution of Candida albicans biofilms for SEM observation. Our experiments showed that room-temperature fixative protocols using glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide prior to alcohol dehydration led to a complete extraction of the polymeric ECM of biofilms. ECM from fixative and alcohol solutions were recovered after all processing steps and these structures were characterised by biochemistry assays, transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry. Cryofixation techniques followed by freeze-substitution lead to a great preservation of both ECM structure and C. albicans biofilm cells, allowing the visualisation of a more reliable biofilm structure. These findings reinforce that cryofixation should be the indicated method for SEM sample preparation to study fungal biofilms as it allows the visualisation of the EMC and the exploration of the biofilm structure to its fullest, as its structural/functional role in interaction with host cells, other pathogens and for drug resistance assays.","authors":[{"name":"T Vila"},{"name":"B B Fonseca"},{"name":"M M L DA Cunha"},{"name":"G R C Dos Santos"},{"name":"K Ishida"},{"name":"E Barreto-Bergter"},{"name":"W DE Souza"},{"name":"S Rozental"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"extracellular matrix"},{"word":"freeze-substitution"},{"word":"high-pressure freezing"},{"word":"plunge freezing"}]},"article213":{"pmid":"28604577","title":"Pain After Cochlear Implantation: An Unusual Complication?","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"To analyze clinical signs and better define the underestimated long-term pain after implantation, to discuss etiological hypothesis, and to propose our department treatment algorithm and results.","authors":[{"name":"Charlotte Celerier"},{"name":"Isabelle Rouillon"},{"name":"Marion Blanchard"},{"name":"Marine Parodi"},{"name":"Françoise Denoyelle"},{"name":"Natalie Loundon"}],"keywords":[]},"article214":{"pmid":"28604268","title":"Mucosal immunization with a flagellin-adjuvanted Hgp44 vaccine enhances protective immune responses in a murine Porphyromonas gingivalis infection model.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Chronic periodontitis is caused by interactions between the oral polymicrobial community and host factors.

We previously reported that bacterial flagellin is an excellent mucosal adjuvant. In this study, we investigated whether mucosal immunization with a flagellin-adjuvanted polypeptide vaccine induces protective immune responses using a Porphyromonas gingivalis infection model. We used the Hgp44 domain polypeptide of Arg-gingipain A (RgpA) as a mucosal antigen. Intranasal (IN) immunization induced a significantly higher Hgp44-specific IgG titer in the serum of mice than sublingual (SL) administration. The co-administration of flagellin potentiated serum IgG responses for both the IN and SL vaccinations. On the other hand, the anti-Hgp44-specific IgA titer in the saliva was comparable between IN and SL vaccinations, suggesting SL administration as more compliant vaccination route for periodontal vaccines. The co-administration of flagellin significantly potentiated the secretory IgA response in saliva also. Furthermore, mice administered a mixture of Hgp44 and flagellin via the IN and SL routes exhibited significant reductions in alveolar bone loss induced by live P. gingivalis infections. An intranasally administered Hgp44-flagellin fusion protein induced a comparable level of Hgp44-specific antibody responses to the mixture of Hgp44 and flagellin.

These secretions facilitate attachment to surfaces that lead to the formation of structured 'biofilm' communities. In open-water environments, they also lead to formation of organic colloids, and larger aggregations of cells, called 'marine snow.' Secretion of EPS is now recognized as a fundamental microbial adaptation, occurring under many environmental conditions, and one that influences many ocean processes. This relatively recent realization has revolutionized our understanding of microbial impacts on ocean systems. EPS occur in a range of molecular sizes, conformations and physical/chemical properties, and polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and even nucleic acids are actively secreted components. Interestingly, however, the physical ultrastructure of how individual EPS interact with each other is poorly understood. Together, the EPS matrix molecules form a three-dimensional architecture from which cells may localize extracellular activities and conduct cooperative/antagonistic interactions that cannot be accomplished efficiently by free-living cells. EPS alter optical signatures of sediments and seawater, and are involved in biogeomineral precipitation and the construction of microbial macrostructures, and horizontal-transfers of genetic information. In the water-column, they contribute to the formation of marine snow, transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs), sea-surface microlayer biofilm, and marine oil snow. Excessive production of EPS occurs during later-stages of phytoplankton blooms as an excess metabolic by product and releases a carbon pool that transitions among dissolved-, colloidal-, and gel-states. Some EPS are highly labile carbon forms, while other forms appear quite refractory to degradation. Emerging studies suggest that EPS contribute to efficient trophic-transfer of environmental contaminants, and may provide a protective refugia for pathogenic cells within marine systems; one that enhances their survival/persistence. Finally, these secretions are prominent in 'extreme' environments ranging from sea-ice communities to hypersaline systems to the high-temperatures/pressures of hydrothermal-vent systems.

The immune system of the body interacts with the microbes as the plaque extends and propagates below the gingival sulcus. Once bacteria reach the gingival sulcus, it can enter the blood stream and affect various areas of the human body. The polymicrobial nature of periodontal disease, if left untreated, promotes chronic inflammation, not only within the oral cavity, but also throughout the human body. Alterations seen in the concentrations of healthy gut microbiota may lead to systemic alterations, such as gut motility disorders, high blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. Although gut microbiome has been shown to play a vital role in intestinal motility functions, the role of oral bacteria in this setting remains to be investigated. It is unclear whether oral microbial DNA is present in the large intestine and, if so, whether it alters the gut microbiome. In addition, polybacterial infection induced PD reduced nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and antioxidant enzymes in rodent colon.

Artificially intensified biofilm reactors represented by rotating biological contactors (RBCs) are widely applied and studied. Understanding the oxygen transfer process in biofilms is an important aspect of these studies, and describing this process in moving biofilms (such as biofilms in RBCs) is a particular challenge. Oxygen transfer in RBCs behaves differently than in other biological reactors due to the special oxygen supply mode that results from alternate exposure of the biofilm to wastewater and air. The study of oxygen transfer in biofilms is indispensable for understanding biodegradation in RBCs. However, the mechanisms are still not well known due to a lack of effective tools to dynamically analyze oxygen diffusion, reaction, and microdistribution in biofilms. A new experimental device, the Oxygen Transfer Modeling Device (OTMD), was designed and manufactured for this purpose, and a mathematical model was developed to model oxygen transfer in biofilm produced by an RBC. This device allowed the simulation of the local environment around the biofilm during normal RBC operation, and oxygen concentrations varying with time and depth in biofilm were measured using an oxygen microelectrode. The experimental data conformed well to the model description, indicating that the OTMD and the model were stable and reliable. Moreover, the OTMD offered a flexible approach to study the impact of a single-factor on oxygen transfer in moving biofilms.

To identify traits that favour or contribute to bacterial persistence, biofilm formation, heat resistance, motility and recovery from dry surfaces were compared between persistent and sporadic isolates. All isolates exhibited low biofilm formation at 20°C, however, at 30°C persistent isolates showed significantly higher biofilm formation after 48h using cell enumeration and near significant difference using the crystal violet assay. All 16 isolates were motile at 20°C and 30°C and motility was fractionally higher for sporadic isolates, but no significant difference was observed. We found persistent isolates tend to exhibit greater recovery after incubation on dry surfaces compared to sporadic isolates. Two of the three most heat-resistant isolates were persistent, while four of five isolates lacking heat resistance were sporadic isolates. Comparison of genome sequences of persistent and sporadic isolates showed that there was no overall clustering of persistent or sporadic isolates, and that differences in prophages and plasmids were not associated with persistence.

Furthermore, we have identified two different putative binding sites at the dimerization active site (the α4-β5-α5 face) with energetic hot-spot areas, which could be used to search for modulators of protein-protein interactions.

The present study evaluated the activity of colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) of different shapes against biofilms formed by Staphylococcus aureus (SA), methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Colloidal quasi-spherical, cubic, and star-shaped AgNPs were synthesized, and their cytotoxicity on macrophages (THP-1) and bronchial epithelial cells (Nuli-1) was analyzed by the lactate dehydrogenase assay. The antibiofilm activity was assessed in vitro by the resazurin assay and in an in vivo infection model in Caenorhabditis elegans. Cubic and star-shaped AgNPs induced cytotoxicity, while quasi-spherical AgNPs were not toxic. Quasi-spherical AgNPs showed substantial antibiofilm activity in vitro with 96% (±2%), 97% (±1%), and 98% (±1%) biofilm killing of SA, MRSA, and PA, respectively, while significantly reducing mortality of infected nematodes. The in vivo antibiofilm activity was linked to the accumulation of AgNPs in the intestinal tract of C. elegans as observed by 3D X-ray tomography. Quasi-spherical AgNPs were physically stable in suspension for over 6 months with no observed loss in antibiofilm activity. While toxicity and stability limited the utilization of cubic and star-shaped AgNPs, quasi-spherical AgNPs could be rapidly synthesized, were stable and nontoxic, and showed substantial in vitro and in vivo activity against clinically relevant biofilms. Quasi-spherical AgNPs hold potential as pharmacotherapy, for example, as topical treatment for biofilm-related infections.","authors":[{"name":"Katharina Richter"},{"name":"Paula Facal"},{"name":"Nicky Thomas"},{"name":"Ilse Vandecandelaere"},{"name":"Mahnaz Ramezanpour"},{"name":"Clare Cooksley"},{"name":"Clive A Prestidge"},{"name":"Tom Coenye"},{"name":"Peter-John Wormald"},{"name":"Sarah Vreugde"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MRSA"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"chemotherapy"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"silver"}]},"article250":{"pmid":"28597990","title":"Temporal dynamics of relative abundances and bacterial succession in chronic wound communities.","date":"2018-09-18","abs":"Polymicrobial bacterial infection is an important factor contributing to wound chronicity. Consequently, clinicians frequently adopt a biofilm-based wound care approach, in which wounds are treated utilizing DNA sequencing information about microbial communities. While more successful than treatment not using community information, there is little information about temporal dynamics of wound communities and optimal approaches over the course of treatment. To characterize these dynamics, temporal analysis over three sampling points was conducted for 167 chronic wounds. Across sampling intervals, wound communities from the same patients changed in composition, and most commonly shared less than 50% of observed species. There was a significant relationship between community similarity and time between sampling. Classifying wounds into state types, we found that communities frequently transitioned from Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus dominated, into a highly variable state type. Although low abundance microbial species are typically disregarded due to uncertainty of biological importance, we found that 80% of wound microbiomes included common or dominant species at subsequent time points that were in low abundance in earlier samples. Moreover, these species were often those known to frequently infect wounds. Results document compositional shifts through the course of treatment and suggest that routine consideration of low abundance species may improve biofilm-based wound care. Moreover, findings indicate that integrating ecological modeling to understand wound microbiome succession may lead to more informed therapy.","authors":[{"name":"Craig D Tipton"},{"name":"Marilyn E Mathew"},{"name":"Richard A Wolcott"},{"name":"Randall D Wolcott"},{"name":"Tigga Kingston"},{"name":"Caleb D Phillips"}],"keywords":[]},"article251":{"pmid":"28597824","title":"Mycobacterial Biofilms: Revisiting Tuberculosis Bacilli in Extracellular Necrotizing Lesions.","date":"2018-06-21","abs":"Under detergent-free in vitro conditions, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tuberculosis in humans, spontaneously forms organized multicellular structures called biofilms.

Due to its multiple resistances toward antibiotics, the development of new drugs is required. Interfering with Quorum Sensing (QS), a cell-to-cell communication system, has shown to be highly efficient in reducing P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. One of its QS systems employs Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) and 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ) as signal molecules. Both activate the transcriptional regulator MvfR (Multiple Virulence Factor Regulator), also called PqsR, driving the production of QS molecules as well as toxins and biofilm formation. The aim of this work was to elucidate the effects of QS inhibitors (QSIs), such as MvfR antagonists and PqsBC inhibitors, on the biosynthesis of the MvfR-regulated small molecules 2'-aminoacetophenone (2-AA), dihydroxyquinoline (DHQ), HHQ, PQS, and 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO). The employed synthetic MvfR antagonist fully inhibited pqs small molecule formation showing expected sigmoidal dose-response curves for 2-AA, HQNO, HHQ and PQS. Surprisingly, DHQ levels were enhanced at lower antagonist concentrations followed by a full suppression at higher QSI amounts. This particular bi-phasic profile hinted at the accumulation of a biosynthetic intermediate resulting in the observed overproduction of the shunt product DHQ. Additionally, investigations on PqsBC inhibitors showed a reduction of MvfR natural ligands, while increased 2-AA, DHQ and HQNO levels compared to the untreated cells were detected. Moreover, PqsBC inhibitors did not show any significant effect in PA14 pqsC mutant demonstrating their target selectivity. As 2-AA is important for antibacterial tolerance, the QSIs were evaluated in their capability to attenuate persistence. Indeed, persister cells were reduced along with 2-AA inhibition resulting from MvfR antagonism, but not from PqsBC inhibition. In conclusion, antagonizing MvfR using a dosage capable of fully suppressing this QS system will lead to a favorable therapeutic outcome as DHQ overproduction is avoided and bacterial persistence is reduced.","authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Allegretta"},{"name":"Christine K Maurer"},{"name":"Jens Eberhard"},{"name":"Damien Maura"},{"name":"Rolf W Hartmann"},{"name":"Laurence Rahme"},{"name":"Martin Empting"}],"keywords":[{"word":"2′-aminoacetophenone"},{"word":"MvfR"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Quorum Sensing Inhibitors"},{"word":"dihydroxyquinoline"},{"word":"persistence"},{"word":"quinolones"}]},"article254":{"pmid":"28596759","title":"BSocial: Deciphering Social Behaviors within Mixed Microbial Populations.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Ecosystem functionality depends on interactions among populations, of the same or different taxa, and these are not just the sum of pairwise interactions.

The challenge is to demonstrate penetration and transport through the biofilm and its exopolysaccharide matrix. The ideal functionalization for penetration into mature biofilms is unexplored. In this paper, we present a novel set of rhodamine labelled βCD-polymers, with different charge moieties, i.e., neutral, anionic, and cationic, and explore their potential delivery into mature Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms using multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPM). The S. epidermidis biofilms, being a medically relevant model organism, were stained with SYTO9. By using MPM, three-dimensional imaging and spectral investigation of the distribution of the βCD-polymers could be obtained. It was found that the cationic βCD-polymers showed significantly higher integration into the biofilms, compared to neutral and anionic functionalized βCDs. None of the carriers presented any inherent toxicity to the biofilms, meaning that the addition of rhodamine moiety does not affect the inertness of the delivery system. Taken together, this study demonstrates a novel approach by which delivery of fluorescently labelled CD nanoparticles to bacterial biofilms can be explored using MPM. Future studies should be undertaken investigating the potential in using cationic functionalization of CD based delivery systems for targeting anti-microbial effects in biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Hanna Thomsen"},{"name":"Gábor Benkovics"},{"name":"Éva Fenyvesi"},{"name":"Anne Farewell"},{"name":"Milo Malanga"},{"name":"Marica B Ericson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Charge functionalization"},{"word":"Cyclodextrin polymers"},{"word":"Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy"},{"word":"Rhodamine"},{"word":"Spectral analysis"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm"}]},"article256":{"pmid":"28596137","title":"Reshaping antibiotics through hydrophobic drug-bile acid ionic complexation enhances activity against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The antibiotic era is on the verge of a profound change and facing a ground shaking crisis.

Most of the samples used were classified as weak biofilm producers, with serovars Enteritidis and Heidelberg showing the highest frequency of biofilm formation. Glass and stainless steel surfaces significantly favored biofilm formation at 60 and 36 h of incubation respectively, but the polyvinyl chloride surface did not favor biofilm production, suggesting that the type of material may interfere with production. The bacteriophage pool action period focused on 3 h, but treatment of 9 h on glass surface biofilms was superior to other treatments because it affected the largest number of samples. These results suggests that some surface types and Salmonella serotypes may promote biofilm formation and indicate bacteriophages as an alternative to control biofilms.

The range comprises Mepilex Ag, Mepilex Border Ag and Mepilex Transfer Ag. Aims A literature review was undertaken to identify and summarise clinical data from the entire evidence hierarchy, as well as data from in vitro tests, which support the use of silver-containing foam dressings with Safetac. Method The MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, US) and EMBASE (Elsevier BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands) bibliographic databases were searched. In addition, abstract books and proceedings documents relating to national and international conferences were scanned in order to identify presentations (oral, e-poster and poster) of relevance to the review. Results In vitro test results showed that the silver-containing foam dressings with Safetac have both rapid and sustained activity against a range of wound pathogens, reducing planktonic and established biofilm cultures, and preventing biofilm formation. In numerous clinical studies, silvercontaining foam dressings with Safetac were used to manage wound bioburden effectively and resolve signs of localised infection in both acute wounds (such as surgical, traumatic and burn injuries) and chronic wounds (such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers (PUs), diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), and cancerous wounds).

Biocorrosion behavior of Bacillus thuringiensis EN2 on MS and its control by GIE was analyzed by electrochemical measurements. Polarization, electrochemical studies (ES), weight loss measurements (WL), and surface analysis (XRD, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and FTIR, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy) were performed under various incubation periods up to 4 weeks. We observed that EN2 forms a thick biofilm on the MS metal surface at the end of the incubation period and the WL significantly increased to 993 mg at fourth week when compared to the initial immersion period (194 ± 2 mg). In contrast, with addition of GIE, WL was reduced about 41 ± 2 mg over biotic system (993 ± 2 mg). GC-MS analysis confirmed the adsorption of active component of GIE (β-turmerone) on the metal surface as a protective layer to prevent the biofilm formation and thus leads to reduction of corrosion. The optimum 20 ppm of GIE was found to be effective corrosion inhibition efficiency which was about 80%. From the results of WL, ES, XRD, FTIR, and GC-MS, GIE was identified as biocide and thus inhibits the bacterial growth on MS metal surface and it leads to control MIC. XRD showed that the GIE with EN2 resulted in less formation of corrosion products over biotic and abiotic systems. Overall, this research first shed light on the antibacterial activity of GIE inhibiting biofilm formation, thus reducing the corrosion of MS in cooling water systems.","authors":[{"name":"Jayaraman Narenkumar"},{"name":"Punniyakotti Parthipan"},{"name":"Ayyakkannu Usha Raja Nanthini"},{"name":"Giovanni Benelli"},{"name":"Kadarkarai Murugan"},{"name":"Aruliah Rajasekar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"GC–MS"},{"word":"Ginger extract"},{"word":"Microbiological influenced corrosion"},{"word":"Mild steel"}]},"article268":{"pmid":"28593349","title":"Transcriptomic Analysis of the Swarm Motility Phenotype of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium Mutant Defective in Periplasmic Glucan Synthesis.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Movement of food-borne pathogens on moist surfaces enables them to migrate towards more favorable niches and facilitate their survival for extended periods of time.

In contrast to well-mixed cultures routinely used in microbial research, bacteria in a microcolony interact mechanically with one another and with the substrate to which they are attached. Here, we use a computer model of a microbial colony of rod-shaped cells to investigate how physical interactions between cells determine their motion in the colony and how this affects biological evolution. We show that the probability that a faster-growing mutant 'surfs' at the colony's frontier and creates a macroscopic sector depends on physical properties of cells (shape, elasticity and friction). Although all these factors contribute to the surfing probability in seemingly different ways, their effects can be summarized by two summary statistics that characterize the front roughness and cell alignment. Our predictions are confirmed by experiments in which we measure the surfing probability for colonies of different front roughness. Our results show that physical interactions between bacterial cells play an important role in biological evolution of new traits, and suggest that these interactions may be relevant to processes such as de novo evolution of antibiotic resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Fred D Farrell"},{"name":"Matti Gralka"},{"name":"Oskar Hallatschek"},{"name":"Bartlomiej Waclaw"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterial colony"},{"word":"biological evolution"},{"word":"interactions"},{"word":"roughness"},{"word":"surfing probability"}]},"article272":{"pmid":"28591948","title":"[The Role of HMGN2 in the Development of Periodontitis Dental Plaque].","date":"2018-10-22","abs":"To determine the role of high mobility group chromosomal protein N2 (HMGN2) in the development of periodontitis plaque biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Yang Luo"},{"name":"Qian Li"},{"name":"Ya-Ping Fan"},{"name":"Jiao Chen"},{"name":"Ping Zhang"},{"name":"Yun Feng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"High mobility group chromosomal protein N2"},{"word":"Periodontitis"},{"word":"Porphyromonas gingivalis"},{"word":"Salivary"}]},"article273":{"pmid":"28591665","title":"Inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing by subinhibitory concentrations of curcumin with gentamicin and azithromycin.","date":"2019-05-08","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing (QS) circuits regulate virulence factors and co-ordinate bacterial pathogenicity.

Pure cultures were established in a liquid medium with 2,4-D as a sole carbon source with or without sand grains for 10 days. Bacterial numbers and 2,4-D concentrations in solution were followed by spectrophotometry, the respiration rate by gas chromatography and the surface colonization by electron microscopy. In addition, isotopic techniques coupled with Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) profiling were used to determine possible metabolic changes. After only 3 days, approximately 80% of the cells were attached to the sand grains and microscopy images showed that the porous medium was totally clogged by the development of a biofilm. After 10 days, there was 25% less 2,4-D in the solution in samples with sand than in control samples. This difference was due to (1) a higher (+8%) mineralization of 2,4-D by sessile bacteria and (2) a retention (15%) of 2,4-D in the biofilm matrix. Besides, the amount of carbohydrates, presumably constituting the biofilm polysaccharides, increased by 63%. Compound-specific isotope analysis revealed that the FAME isotopic signature was less affected by the biofilm lifestyle than was the FAME composition.

Previous research has shown inactivation of the pot operon in encapsulated pneumococci alters protein expression and leads to a significant reduction in pneumococcal murine colonization, but the role of the pot operon in NESp is unknown. Here, we demonstrate deletion of potD from the NESp NCC1 strain MNZ67 does impact expression of the key proteins pneumolysin and PspK, but it does not inhibit murine colonization. Additionally, we show the absence of potD significantly increases biofilm production, both in vitro and in vivo. In a chinchilla model of otitis media (OM), the absence of potD does not significantly affect MNZ67 virulence, but it does significantly reduce the pathogenesis of the virulent encapsulated strain TIGR4 (serotype 4). Deletion of potD also significantly reduced persistence of TIGR4 in the lungs but increased persistence of PIP01 in the lungs. We conclude the pot operon is important for the regulation of protein expression and biofilm formation in both encapsulated and NCC1 nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, in contrast to encapsulated pneumococcal strains, polyamine acquisition via the pot operon is not required for MNZ67 murine colonization, persistence in the lungs, or full virulence in a model of OM. Therefore, NESp virulence regulation needs to be further established to identify potential NESp therapeutic targets.","authors":[{"name":"Haley R Pipkins"},{"name":"Jessica L Bradshaw"},{"name":"Lance E Keller"},{"name":"Edwin Swiatlo"},{"name":"Larry S McDaniel"}],"keywords":[]},"article292":{"pmid":"28586050","title":"Inhibitory capacity of Rhus coriaria L. extract and its major component methyl gallate on Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation by optical profilometry: Potential applications for oral health.","date":"2018-03-26","abs":"Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) bacterium is the most well recognized pathogen involved in pathogenesis of dental caries.

To the best of our knowledge, in all previous scientific reports, a colorimetric assay was applied to test the effect of sumac and methyl gallate (MG) on S. mutans adherence. Quantitative assessment of the developed biofilm should be further performed by applying an optical profilometry assay, and by testing the effect on both surface roughness and thickness parameters of the biofilm.

Testing antibacterial activity of the sumac extract and its fractions revealed that MG is the most bioactive component against S. mutans bacteria. It reduced S. mutans biofilm biomass on the polystyrene surface by 68‑93%, whereas 1 mg/ml MG was able to decrease the biofilm roughness and thickness on the glass surface by 99%.

In the current study, a multi-defense mechanism against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is demonstrated by combining a nitric oxide (NO) releasing agent with a quaternary ammonium antimicrobial that can be covalently grafted to medical devices. Antibacterial polymeric composites were fabricated by incorporating an NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) in CarboSil® polymer and top coated with surface immobilized benzophenone based quaternary ammonium antimicrobial (BPAM) small molecule. The results suggest that SNAP and BPAM individually have a different degree of toxicity towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, while the SNAP-BPAM combination is effective in reducing both types of adhered viable bacteria equally well. SNAP-BPAM combinations reduced the adhered viable Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 99.0% and Staphylococcus aureus by 99.98% as compared to the control CarboSil films. Agar diffusion tests demonstrate that the diffusive nature of NO kills bacteria beyond the direct point of contact which the non-leaching BPAM cannot achieve alone. This is important for potential application in biofilm eradication.

Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an innovative approach which combines caustic with oxygen, another commonly used method, as a dosing strategy for overcoming the drawbacks of caustic shock-loading. Six laboratory-scale rising main reactors were subjected to three dosing schemes over a period of three months, namely (i) simultaneous caustic and oxygen addition, (ii) caustic addition and (iii) no chemical addition. Our results showed that the combination of caustic and oxygen achieved efficient sulfide control, leading to a prolonged biofilm recovery period in between caustic shocks. In addition, methane emissions were reduced to a negligible level compared to caustic treatment only. To translate the findings to real-life application, the key parameters obtained during the long-term lab-scale experiments were subjected to extensive simulation studies using the SeweX model under a wide range of conditions commonly found in sewers.

Recent studies have demonstrated that ∼50% of colonized children carry at least two different serotypes (i.e., strains) in the nasopharynx; however, studies of how strains coexist are limited. In this work, we investigated the physiological, genetic, and ecological requirements for the relative distribution of densities, and spatial localization, of pneumococcal strains within biofilm consortia. Biofilm consortia were prepared with vaccine type strains (i.e., serotype 6B [S6B], S19F, or S23F) and strain TIGR4 (S4). Experiments first revealed that the relative densities of S6B and S23F were similar in biofilm consortia. The density of S19F strains, however, was reduced to ∼10% in biofilm consortia, including either S6B, S23F, or TIGR4, in comparison to S19F monostrain biofilms. Reduction of S19F density within biofilm consortia was also observed in a simulated nasopharyngeal environment. Reduction of relative density was not related to growth rates, since the Malthusian parameter demonstrated similar rates of change of density for most strains. To investigate whether quorum sensing (QS) regulates relative densities in biofilm consortia, two different mutants were prepared: a TIGR4ΔluxS mutant and a TIGR4ΔcomC mutant. The density of S19F strains, however, was similarly reduced when consortia included TIGR4, TIGR4ΔluxS, or TIGR4ΔcomC Moreover, production of a different competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), CSP1 or CSP2, was not a factor that affected dominance.

The favorable biocompatibility was demonstrated by cell study in vitro. In addition, cell adhesion results suggested that DNase I coating had the potential to facilitate MC3T3-E1 cell attachment.

According to the comparison results of the non-biofilm anode and biofilm-covered anode on current generation, phenazines concentration variation and anodic electrocatalysis, the biofilm on the anode not only provides plenty of bacterial cells for catalysis but also promotes the interfacial phenazine redox reaction through accumulating the self-generated mediators on anode for fast interfacial electron transfer.

However, closed-end MABRs are more sensitive to back-diffusion of inert gases, such as nitrogen. Back-diffusion reduces the average oxygen transfer rates (OTR), consequently decreasing the average contaminant removal fluxes (J). We hypothesized that venting the membrane lumen periodically would increase the OTR and J. Using an experimental flow cell and mathematical modeling, we showed that back-diffusion gas profiles developed over relatively long timescales. Thus, very short ventings could re-establish uniform gas profiles for relatively long time periods. Using modeling, we systematically explored the effect of the venting interval (time between ventings). At moderate venting intervals, opening the membrane for 20 s every 30 min, the venting significantly increased the average OTR and J without substantially impacting the OTEs. When the interval was short enough, in this case shorter than 20 min, the OTR was actually higher than for continuous open-end operation.

Some of these drugs have already been evaluated for their potential as antibacterial agents. In addition to inhibiting bacterial growth and survival, some also act synergistically with antibiotics, and as such can enhance the therapeutic spectrum of currently available antibiotics. Furthermore, nucleoside and nucleobase analogue drugs can inhibit bacterial virulence and biofilm formation. Biofilms are known to impart antibiotic tolerance and are associated with chronic infections. Targeting biofilm formation thus renders pathogens more susceptible to antibiotic treatment and host immune defences.

Despite this, the co-existence of LAB and yeasts in the fermentation vat and production of compounds such as organic acids and other extracellular metabolites result in reduction in the final yield of the bioethanol production process.

Interest has surrounded the occurrence and distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for many decades because they pose a serious threat to the health of humans and ecosystems. The importance of the need for sustainable abatement strategies to alleviate contamination therefore cannot be overemphasised, as daily human activities continue to create pollution from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and impact the natural environment. Globally, attempts have been made to design treatment schemes for the remediation and restoration of contaminated sites. Several techniques and technologies have been proposed and tested over time, the majority of which have significant limitations. This has necessitated research into environmentally friendly and cost-effective clean-up techniques. Bioremediation is an appealing option that has been extensively researched and adopted as it has been proven to be relatively cost-effective, environmentally friendly and is publicly accepted. In this review, the physicochemical properties of some priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as the pathways and mechanisms through which they enter the soil, river systems, drinking water, groundwater and food are succinctly examined. Their effects on human health, other living organisms, the aquatic ecosystem, as well as soil microbiota are also elucidated. The persistence and bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are discussed as well, as they are important factors that influence the rate, efficiency and overall success of remediation. Bioremediation (aerobic and anaerobic), use of biosurfactants and bioreactors, as well as the roles of biofilms in the biological treatment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also explored.","authors":[{"name":"Oluwadara Oluwaseun Alegbeleye"},{"name":"Beatrice Oluwatoyin Opeolu"},{"name":"Vanessa Angela Jackson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bioremediation"},{"word":"Environment"},{"word":"Microorganisms"},{"word":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)"}]},"article336":{"pmid":"28572797","title":"Electrochemical Potential Influences Phenazine Production, Electron Transfer and Consequently Electric Current Generation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has gained interest as a redox mediator (phenazines) producer in bioelectrochemical systems.

Among them, TIH3F exhibited the most potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. Fluorescence spectroscopy has demonstrated a quick induction of bacterial membrane permeability by TIH3F leading to the cell death, which also accounts for its fast anti-biofilm activity. Such mode of antimicrobial action was mainly attributed to peptides' amphiphilic and helical structures determined by CD and homology modeling.

Persistence of S. mutans biofilms in the oral cavity can lead to tooth decay. To date, no anticaries therapies that specifically target S. mutans biofilms but do not disturb the overall oral microbiome are available. We screened a library of 2-aminoimidazole antibiofilm compounds with a biofilm dispersion assay and identified a small molecule that specifically targets S. mutans biofilms.

C. albicans evolved mechanistically to regulate alternative carbon assimilation for the promotion of fungal growth and commensalism in mammalian hosts. However, this highly adaptive mechanism that C. albicans employs to cope with alternative carbon assimilation has yet to be clearly understood. Here we identified a novel role of C. albicans mitochondrial complex I (CI) in regulating assimilation of alternative carbon sources such as mannitol. Our data demonstrate that CI dysfunction by deleting the subunit Nuo2 decreases the level of NAD+, downregulates the NAD+-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase activity, and consequently inhibits hyphal growth and biofilm formation in conditions when the carbon source is mannitol, but not fermentative sugars like glucose. Mannitol-dependent morphogenesis is controlled by a ROS-induced signaling pathway involving Hog1 activation and Brg1 repression. In vivo studies show that nuo2Δ/Δ mutant cells are severely compromised in gastrointestinal colonization and the defect can be rescued by a glucose-rich diet. Thus, our findings unravel a mechanism by which C. albicans regulates carbon flexibility and commensalism. Alternative carbon assimilation might represent a fitness advantage for commensal fungi in successful colonization of host niches.","authors":[{"name":"Xinhua Huang"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Chen"},{"name":"Yongmin He"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Yu"},{"name":"Shanshan Li"},{"name":"Ning Gao"},{"name":"Lida Niu"},{"name":"Yinhe Mao"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Wang"},{"name":"Xianwei Wu"},{"name":"Wenjuan Wu"},{"name":"Jianhua Wu"},{"name":"Dongsheng Zhou"},{"name":"Xiangjiang Zhan"},{"name":"Changbin Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article346":{"pmid":"28570250","title":"Effect of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy With Instillation on Bioburden in Chronically Infected Wounds.","date":"2018-07-02","abs":"Standard negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been shown to help close wounds despite increasing planktonic bioburden.

Due to the lack of relevant in vivo biofilm models, the majority of the studies report host immune responses to free-living or planktonic bacteria, while bacteria in clinical situations live more frequently as biofilm communities than as single cells. The present study investigated host immune responses to biomaterial-associated P. aeruginosa biofilms in a clinically relevant mouse model. Previously, we reported metallic magnesium, a prospective biodegradable implant, to be permissive for bacterial biofilm in vivo even though it exhibits antibacterial properties in vitro. Therefore, magnesium was employed as biomaterial to investigate in vivo biofilm formation and associated host immune responses by using two P. aeruginosa strains and two mouse strains. P. aeruginosa formed biofilm on subcutaneously implanted magnesium disks. Non-invasive in vivo imaging indicated transient inflammatory responses at control sites, whereas robust prolonged interferon-β (IFN-β) expression was observed from biofilm in a transgenic animal reporter. Furthermore, immunohistology and electron microscopic results showed that bacterial biofilms were located in 2D immediately on the implant surface and at a short distance in the adjacent tissue. These biofilms were surrounded by inflammatory cells (mainly polymorphonuclear cells) compared to the controls. Interestingly, even though the number of live bacteria in various organs remained below detectable levels, splenomegaly indicated systemic inflammatory processes. Overall, these findings confirmed the resistance of biofilm infections in vivo to potentially antibacterial properties of magnesium degradation products. In vivo imaging and histology indicated the induction of both local and systemic host inflammatory responses to P. aeruginosa biofilms. Even though the innate host immune defenses could not eliminate the local infection for up to two weeks, there was no apparent systemic bacteremia and all the animals investigated survived the infection.","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Imran Rahim"},{"name":"Anshu Babbar"},{"name":"Stefan Lienenklaus"},{"name":"Marina C Pils"},{"name":"Manfred Rohde"}],"keywords":[]},"article351":{"pmid":"28569502","title":"Prevention of Bacterial Colonization on Catheters by a One-Step Coating Process Involving an Antibiofouling Polymer in Water.","date":"2018-12-19","abs":"As reports of multidrug resistant pathogens have increased, patients with implanted medical catheters increasingly need alternative solutions to antibiotic treatments. As most catheter-related infections are directly associated with biofilm formation on the catheter surface, which, once formed, is difficult to eliminate, a promising approach to biofilm prevention involves inhibiting the initial adhesion of bacteria to the surface. In this study, we report an amphiphilic, antifouling polymer, poly(DMA-mPEGMA-AA) that can facilely coat the surfaces of commercially available catheter materials in water and prevent bacterial adhesion to and subsequent colonization of the surface, giving rise to an antibiofilm surface. The antifouling coating layer was formed simply by dipping a model substrate (polystyrene, PET, PDMS, or silicon-based urinary catheter) in water containing poly(DMA-mPEGMA-AA), followed by characterization by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The antibacterial adhesion properties of the polymer-coated surface were assessed for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) growth under static (incubation in the presence of a bacterial suspension) and dynamic (bacteria suspended in a solution under flow) conditions. Regardless of the conditions, the polymer-coated surface displayed significantly reduced attachment of the bacteria (antiadhesion effect > ∼8-fold) compared to the bare noncoated substrates. Treatment of the implanted catheters with S. aureus in vivo further confirmed that the polymer-coated silicon urinary catheters could significantly reduce bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation in a bacterial infection animal model. Furthermore, the polymer-coated catheters did not induce hemolysis and were resistant to the adhesion of blood-circulating cells, indicative of high biocompatibility. Collectively, the present amphiphilic antifouling polymer is potentially useful as a coating platform that renders existing medical devices resistant to biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Hyeongseop Keum"},{"name":"Jin Yong Kim"},{"name":"Byeongjun Yu"},{"name":"Seung Jung Yu"},{"name":"Jinjoo Kim"},{"name":"Hyungsu Jeon"},{"name":"Dong Yun Lee"},{"name":"Sung Gap Im"},{"name":"Sangyong Jon"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiofouling polymer"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"catheters"},{"word":"healthcare related infection"},{"word":"medical devices"},{"word":"polymer films"}]},"article352":{"pmid":"28569068","title":"Genetic Characterization of Periphyton Communities Associated with Selenium Bioconcentration and Trophic Transfer in a Simple Food Chain.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"A major source of uncertainty in predicting selenium (Se) distribution in aquatic food webs lies in the enrichment factor (EF), the ratio of Se bioconcentration in primary producers and microorganisms relative to the concentration of Se in the surrounding water. It has been well demonstrated that EFs can vary dramatically among individual algal taxa, but data are lacking regarding the influence of periphyton community composition on EFs for a given geochemical form of Se. Therefore, the goals of this study were first to assess whether different periphyton communities could be established in aquaria with the same starting inoculum using different light and nutrient regimes, and second, to determine if the periphyton assemblage composition influences the uptake of waterborne Se (as selenite) and subsequent Se transfer to a model macroinvertebrate primary consumer. Periphyton biofilms were grown in aquaria containing filtered pond water (from Saskatoon, SK) spiked with approximately 20 μg Se/L (mean measured concentration 21.0 ± 1.2 μg Se/L), added as selenite. Five different light and nutrient regimes were applied to the aquaria (three replicates per treatment) to influence biofilm community development. After 6 weeks of biofilm maturation, 40 to 80 immature cultured snails (Stagnicola elodes) were added to each aquarium. The bacterial and algal members of the periphyton community were characterized by targeted metagenomic analyses before and after addition of snails to ensure the snails themselves did not significantly alter the biofilm community. Samples were collected for Se analysis of water, periphyton, and whole-body snail. The nutrient and light treatments resulted in substantially different compositions of the periphytic biofilms, with each being relatively consistent across replicates and throughout the study. Although the aqueous concentration of dissolved Se administered to treatments was constant, uptake by the different periphytic biofilms differed significantly. Both the low-light (61.8 ± 12.1 μg Se/g d.w.) and high-light (30.5 ± 4.7 μg Se/g d.w.) biofilms, which were found to have high proportions of cyanobacteria, contained statistically higher concentrations of Se relative to the other treatments. Furthermore, the concentration of Se in bulk periphyton was predictive of Se bioaccumulation in grazing snails but as an inverse relationship, opposite to expectations. The trophic transfer factor was inversely correlated with periphyton enrichment factor (r = -0.841). A number of different bacterial and algal taxa were correlated (either positively or negatively) with Se accumulation in periphyton biofilm and snails. Recent advancements in genetic methods make it possible to conduct detailed characterization of periphyton assemblages and begin to understand the influence that periphyton composition has on Se biodynamics in aquatic systems.","authors":[{"name":"Vanessa Friesen"},{"name":"Lorne E Doig"},{"name":"Blue E Markwart"},{"name":"Monique Haakensen"},{"name":"Emily Tissier"},{"name":"Karsten Liber"}],"keywords":[]},"article353":{"pmid":"28567421","title":"Effects of Diode Laser, Gaseous Ozone, and Medical Dressings on Enterococcus faecalis Biofilms in the Root Canal Ex Vivo.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The objective was to compare the antibacterial effects of adjunctive disinfection using diode laser and gaseous ozone compared to the medical dressings calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)","authors":[{"name":"Kerstin Bitter"},{"name":"Alexander Vlassakidis"},{"name":"Mediha Niepel"},{"name":"Daniela Hoedke"},{"name":"Julia Schulze"},{"name":"Konrad Neumann"},{"name":"Annette Moter"},{"name":"Jörn Noetzel"}],"keywords":[]},"article354":{"pmid":"28567419","title":"Shin'iseihaito (Xinyiqingfeitang) Suppresses the Biofilm Formation of Streptococcus pneumoniae In Vitro.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is the important pathogen that causes otolaryngeal diseases such as sinusitis.

Interestingly, biovolume of dead cells in biofilms formed under limited nutrient conditions (BHI/10) was significantly higher than in biofilms formed in the BHI medium. In the other hand, in static conditions, biofilm is organized in a multilayer cells and dispersed cells in a rich medium BHI and poor medium BHI/10 respectively. There was significantly more biomass in the rich medium compared to BHI/10 but no difference was noted in the dead/damaged subpopulation showing how L. monocytogenes biofilm could be affected by the growth conditions. This work demonstrated that nutrient concentration affects biofilm structure and the proportion of dead cells in biofilms under microfluidic condition. Our study also showed that limited nutrients play an important role in the structural stability of L. monocytogenes biofilm by enhancing cell death and liberating extracellular DNA.","authors":[{"name":"Tamazight Cherifi"},{"name":"Mario Jacques"},{"name":"Sylvain Quessy"},{"name":"Philippe Fravalo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Listeria monocytogenes"},{"word":"biofilm structure"},{"word":"extracellular DNA"},{"word":"limited nutrients"},{"word":"microfluidic system"}]},"article359":{"pmid":"28566845","title":"Prevention and Treatment of White Spot Lesions in Orthodontic Patients.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Decalcification of enamel, appearing as white spot lesions (WSLs), around fixed orthodontic appliances is a major challenge during and after fixed orthodontic treatment by considering the fact that the goal of orthodontic treatment is to enhance facial and dental esthetic appearance.

Among the meiofauna living in these environments, benthic foraminifera are often the most tolerant to low oxygen levels. Indeed, some species are able to survive complete anoxia for weeks to months. One known mechanism for this, observed in several species, is denitrification. For other species, a state of highly reduced metabolism, essentially a state of dormancy, has been proposed but never demonstrated. Here, we combined a 4 weeks feeding experiment, using 13C-enriched diatom biofilm, with correlated TEM and NanoSIMS imaging, plus bulk analysis of concentration and stable carbon isotopic composition of total organic matter and individual fatty acids, to study metabolic differences in the intertidal species Ammonia tepida exposed to oxic and anoxic conditions. Strongly contrasting cellular-level dynamics of ingestion and transfer of the ingested biofilm components were observed between the two conditions. Under oxic conditions, within a few days, intact diatoms were ingested, degraded, and their components assimilated, in part for biosynthesis of different cellular components: 13C-labeled lipid droplets formed after a few days and were subsequently lost (partially) through respiration. In contrast, in anoxia, fewer diatoms were initially ingested and these were not assimilated or metabolized further, but remained visible within the foraminiferal cytoplasm even after 4 weeks. Under oxic conditions, compound specific 13C analyses showed substantial de novo synthesis by the foraminifera of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as 20:4(n-6). Very limited PUFA synthesis was observed under anoxia. Together, our results show that anoxia induced a greatly reduced rate of heterotrophic metabolism in Ammonia tepida on a time scale of less than 24 hours, these observations are consistent with a state of dormancy.","authors":[{"name":"Charlotte LeKieffre"},{"name":"Jorge E Spangenberg"},{"name":"Guillaume Mabilleau"},{"name":"Stéphane Escrig"},{"name":"Anders Meibom"},{"name":"Emmanuelle Geslin"}],"keywords":[]},"article363":{"pmid":"28562631","title":"Synergistic antibiofilm efficacy of a gallotannin 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose from Terminalia chebula fruit in combination with gentamicin and trimethoprim against multidrug resistant uropathogenic Escherichia coli biofilms.","date":"2019-02-08","abs":"In recent years the emergence of multiple drug resistance microbes has become a global public health problem.

This study aimed to analyze antimicrobial, antibiofilm, cytotoxicity and antiproliferative potentials of the extract and fractions from leaves of Himatanthusdrasticus, a plant from the Apocynaceae family. After harvesting, H. drasticus leaves were macerated and a hydroalcoholic extract (HDHE) and fractions were prepared. Antimicrobial tests, such as agar-diffusion, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were carried out against several bacterial species. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by at least one extract or fraction in the agar-diffusion assay (inhibition halos from 12 mm to 30 mm). However, the lowest MIC value was found for HDHE against K. pneumoniae. In addition, HDHE and its fractions were able to inhibit biofilm formation at sub-inhibitory concentrations (780 µg/mL and 1.56 µg/mL). As the best activities were found for HDHE, we selected it for further assays. HDHE was able to increase ciprofloxacin (CIP) activity against K. pneumoniae, displaying synergistic (initial concentration CIP + HDHE: 2 µg/mL + 600 µg/mL and 2.5 µg/mL + 500 µg/mL) and additive effects (CIP + HDHE: 3 µg/mL + 400 µg/mL). This action seems to be associated with the alteration in bacterial membrane permeability induced by HDHE (as seen by propidium iodide labeling). This extract was non-toxic for red blood cell or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Additionally, it inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced proliferation of PBMCs. The following compounds were detected in HDHE using HPLC-ESI-MS analysis: plumieride, plumericin or isoplumericin, rutin, quercetin and derivatives, and chlorogenic acid.

Under simulated processing conditions (i.e., chiller tank and dipping stations), the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of each disinfectant were assessed against biofilm and planktonic cultures of each organism in a disinfectant challenge. Log reductions, planktonic MICs, and mean biofilm eradication concentrations were computed. The biofilms of each Salmonella isolate were more resistant to the disinfectants than were their planktonic counterparts. Although PAA was bacteriostatic and bactericidal against the biofilm and planktonic Salmonella isolates tested at concentrations up to 64 times the concentrations commonly used in a chiller tank during poultry processing, aCH was ineffective against the same isolates under identical conditions. At the simulated 8-s dipping station, CPC was bacteriostatic against all seven and bactericidal against six of the seven Salmonella isolates in their biofilm forms at concentrations within the regulatory range. These results indicate that at the current contact times and concentrations, aCH and PAA are not effective against these Salmonella isolates in their biofilm state. The use of CPC should be considered as a tool for controlling Salmonella biofilms in poultry processing environments.","authors":[{"name":"Tereza Chylkova"},{"name":"Myrna Cadena"},{"name":"Aura Ferreiro"},{"name":"Maurice Pitesky"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Disinfectant"},{"word":"Poultry processing"},{"word":"Salmonella"}]},"article369":{"pmid":"28561567","title":"Clathrin-Independent Killing of Intracellular Mycobacteria and Biofilm Disruptions Using Synthetic Antimicrobial Polymers.","date":"2018-04-02","abs":"Current membrane targeting antimicrobials fail to target mycobacteria due to their hydrophobic membrane structure, ability to form drug-resistant biofilms, and their natural intracellular habitat within the confines of macrophages. In this work, we describe engineering of synthetic antimicrobial polymers (SAMPs) derived from biocompatible polyamides that can target drug-sensitive and drug-resistant mycobacteria with high selectivity. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that reduced hydrophobicity of cationic pendants induces enhanced and selective permeabilization of mycobacterial membranes. The least hydrophobic SAMP (TAC1) was found to be the most active with maximum specificity toward mycobacteria over E. coli, S. aureus, and mammalian cells. Membrane perturbation studies, scanning electron microscopy, and colony PCR confirmed the ability of TAC1 to induce membrane lysis and to bind to the genomic material of mycobacteria, thereby inducing mycobacterial cell death. TAC1 was most effective in perfusing and disrupting the mycobacterial biofilms and was also able to kill the intracellular mycobacteria effectively without inducing any toxicity to mammalian cells. Cellular uptake studies revealed clathrin independent uptake of TAC1, thereby allowing it to escape hydrolytic lysosomal degradation and effectively kill the intracellular bacteria. Therefore, this manuscript presents the design and selective antimycobacterial nature of polyamide polymers with charged hydrophobic pendants that have ability to disrupt the biofilms and kill intracellular mycobacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Prabhu S Yavvari"},{"name":"Siddhi Gupta"},{"name":"Divya Arora"},{"name":"Vinay K Nandicoori"},{"name":"Aasheesh Srivastava"},{"name":"Avinash Bajaj"}],"keywords":[]},"article370":{"pmid":"28560581","title":"Antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties of polypropylene meshes coated with metal-containing DLC thin films.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"A promising strategy to reduce nosocomial infections related to prosthetic meshes is the prevention of microbial colonization.

Thus, we used in silico pattern searches to define a pneumococcal secretome and analyzed the transcriptome of the clinically important PMEN1 lineage to identify which peptide-encoding genes are highly expressed in vivo. In this study, we characterized virulence peptide 1 (vp1), a highly expressed Gly-Gly peptide-encoding gene in chinchilla middle ear effusions. The vp1 gene is widely distributed across pneumococcus as well as encoded in related species. Studies in the chinchilla model of middle ear infection demonstrated that VP1 is a virulence determinant. The vp1 gene is positively regulated by a transcription factor from the Rgg family and its cognate SHP (short hydrophobic peptide). In vitro data indicated that VP1 promotes increased thickness and biomass for biofilms grown on chinchilla middle ear epithelial cells. Furthermore, the wild-type biofilm is restored with the exogenous addition of synthetic VP1.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors stand as valuable tools not only for the detection of biological entities and the characterisation of biomaterials but also as a suitable means to monitor bacterial film formation. This article reports on a proof-of-concept study for the use of an angular-based SPR biosensor for the monitoring of bacterial cell growth and biofilm formation and removal under the effect of different cleaning agents. The benefit of this custom-made SPR instrument is that it records simultaneously both the critical and resonant angles. This provides unique information on the growth of bacterial cells which is otherwise not obtainable with commonly used intensity-based SPR systems. The results clearly showed that a multilayer biofilm can be formed in 48 hours and the steps involved can be monitored in real-time with the SPR instrument through the measurement of the refractive index change and following the evolution in the shape of the SPR curve. The number, the depth and the sharpness of the reflection ripples varied as the film became thicker. Simulation results confirmed that the number of layers of bacteria affected the number of ripples at the critical angle. Real-time monitoring of the film breakdown with three cleaning agents indicated that bleach solution at 4.5% was the most effective in disrupting the biofilm from the gold sensor. Our overall findings suggest that the SPR biosensor with angular modulation presented in this article can perform real-time monitoring of biofilm formation and has the potential to be used as a platform to test the efficiency of disinfectants.","authors":[{"name":"Sandrine Filion-Côté"},{"name":"Feriel Melaine"},{"name":"Andrew G Kirk"},{"name":"Maryam Tabrizian"}],"keywords":[]},"article388":{"pmid":"28555174","title":"The ATP-Dependent Protease ClpP Inhibits Biofilm Formation by Regulating Agr and Cell Wall Hydrolase Sle1 in Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Biofilm causes hospital-associated infections on indwelling medical devices. In Staphylococcus aureus, Biofilm formation is controlled by intricately coordinated network of regulating systems, of which the ATP-dependent protease ClpP shows an inhibitory effect. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of ClpP on biofilm formation is through Agr and the cell wall hydrolase Sle1. Biofilm formed by clpP mutant consists of proteins and extracellular DNA (eDNA). The increase of the protein was, at least in part, due to the reduced protease activity of the mutant, which was caused by the decreased activity of agr. On the other hand, the increase of eDNA was due to increased cell lysis caused by the higher level of Sle1. Indeed, as compared with wild type, the clpP mutant excreted an increased level of eDNA, and showed higher sensitivity to Triton-induced autolysis. The deletion of sle1 in the clpP mutant decreased the biofilm formation, the level of eDNA, and the Triton-induced autolysis to wild-type levels. Despite the increased biofilm formation capability, however, the clpP mutant showed significantly reduced virulence in a murine model of subcutaneous foreign body infection, indicating that the increased biofilm formation capability cannot compensate for the intrinsic functions of ClpP during infection.","authors":[{"name":"Qian Liu"},{"name":"Xing Wang"},{"name":"Juanxiu Qin"},{"name":"Sen Cheng"},{"name":"Won-Sik Yeo"},{"name":"Lei He"},{"name":"Xiaowei Ma"},{"name":"Xiaoyun Liu"},{"name":"Min Li"},{"name":"Taeok Bae"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Agr"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cell wall hydrolysis"},{"word":"proteolysis system"}]},"article389":{"pmid":"28555013","title":"Silver Nanoparticles in Orthopedic Applications: New Insights on Their Effects on Osteogenic Cells.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Infections of orthopedic implants are associated with high morbidity.

We show that positive feedback, mediated by the QS pathway, increases CqsS but not LuxQ levels during the transition into QS-mode, which amplifies the CAI-1 input into the pathway relative to the AI-2 input.
