The QS molecules can associate with host plant tissues and, at times, cause a change in its gene expression at the downstream level through inter-kingdom cross talking. Progress in controlling QS through fungicide/bactericide in pathogenic microscopic organisms has lead to a rise of antibiotic resistance pathogens. Here, we review the application of selective quorum quenching (QQ) endophytes to control phytopathogens that are shared by most, if not all, terrestrial plant species as well as aquatic plants. Allowing the plants to posses endophytic colonies through biotization will be an additional and a sustainable encompassing methodology resulting in attenuated virulence rather than killing the pathogens. Furthermore, the introduced endophytes could serve as a potential biofertilizer and bioprotection agent, which in turn increases the PAMP- triggered immunity and hormonal systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants through SA-JA-ET signaling systems.

In the present study a potential Streptomyces sp. ASK2 was isolated from rhizosphere soil of medicinal plant. The multistep HPLC purification identified the active principle exhibiting antagonistic activity against MDR K. pneumoniae.

The bioactive compound was further evaluated for drug induced toxicity and efficacy in adult zebrafish infection model. As this is the first study on K. pneumoniae - zebrafish model, the infectious doses to manifest sub-clinical and clinical infection were optimized. Furthermore, the virulence of K. pneumoniae in planktonic and biofilm state was studied in zebrafish.

Nevertheless, such a peptide possesses a preferential spectrum of action against Gram-positive bacteria. In order to improve the therapeutic potential of TB, the present study evaluated the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of two TB analogs against medically relevant bacterial species. Of the two analogs, TB_KKG6A has been previously described in the literature, while TB_L1FK is a new analog designed by us through statistical-based computational strategies. Both TB analogs displayed a faster and stronger bactericidal activity than the parental peptide, especially against Gram-negative bacteria in planktonic form. Differently from the parental peptide, TB_KKG6A and TB_L1FK were able to inhibit the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms by more than 50% at 12 μM, while only TB_KKG6A prevented the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms at 24 μM. A marked antibiofilm activity against preformed biofilms of both bacterial species was observed for the two TB analogs when used in combination with EDTA. Analysis of synergism at the cellular level suggested that the antibiofilm activity exerted by the peptide-EDTA combinations against mature biofilms might be due mainly to a disaggregating effect on the extracellular matrix in the case of S. aureus, and to a direct activity on biofilm-embedded cells in the case of P. aeruginosa. Both analogs displayed a low hemolytic effect at the active concentrations and, overall, TB_L1FK resulted less cytotoxic toward mammalian cells. Collectively, the results obtained demonstrated that subtle changes in the primary sequence of TB may provide TB analogs that, used alone or in combination with adjuvant molecules such as EDTA, exhibit promising features against both planktonic and biofilm cells of medically relevant bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Lucia Grassi"},{"name":"Giuseppantonio Maisetta"},{"name":"Giuseppe Maccari"},{"name":"Semih Esin"},{"name":"Giovanna Batoni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Temporin 1Tb"},{"word":"analogs"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"peptide design"}]},"article13":{"pmid":"28443084","title":"Gene Expression Profiling of Transcription Factors of Helicobacter pylori under Different Environmental Conditions.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human gastric mucosa and causes peptic ulcers and gastric carcinoma.

The pathogenic profile of P. aeruginosa is related to its ability to secrete a variety of virulence factors and to promote biofilm formation. Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism wherein P. aeruginosa secretes small diffusible molecules, specifically acyl homo serine lactones, such as N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3O-C12-HSL), that promote biofilm formation and virulence via interbacterial communication. Strategies that strengthen the host's ability to inhibit bacterial virulence would enhance host defenses and improve the treatment of resistant infections. We have recently shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists are potent immunostimulators that play a pivotal role in host response to virulent P. aeruginosa Here, we show that QS genes in P. aeruginosa (strain PAO1) and 3O-C12-HSL attenuate PPARγ expression in bronchial epithelial cells. PAO1 and 3O-C12-HSL induce barrier derangements in bronchial epithelial cells by lowering the expression of junctional proteins, such as zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-4. Expression of these proteins was restored in cells that were treated with pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, before infection with PAO1 and 3O-C12-HSL. Barrier function and bacterial permeation studies that have been performed in primary human epithelial cells showed that PPARγ agonists are able to restore barrier integrity and function that are disrupted by PAO1 and 3O-C12-HSL. Mechanistically, we show that these effects are dependent on the induction of paraoxonase-2, a QS hydrolyzing enzyme, that mitigates the effects of QS molecules. Importantly, our data show that pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, significantly inhibits biofilm formation on epithelial cells by a mechanism that is mediated via paraoxonase-2. These findings elucidate a novel role for PPARγ in host defense against P. aeruginosa Strategies that activate PPARγ can provide a therapeutic complement for treatment of resistant P. aeruginosa infections.-Bedi, B., Maurice, N.

In the case of C4, a dose-dependent inhibition of S. aureus biofilm growth was observed.

In our strategy, double bonds were firstly introduced onto the PES membrane surfaces to provide anchoring sites, and then the hydrogel layers were synthesized on the membrane surfaces via UV light-initiated crosslinking copolymerization. Then, Ag ions were adsorbed into the hydrogel layers and reduced to Ag nanoparticles by sodium borohydride. The amounts of the adsorbed Ag ions were controlled by the mole ratios of carboxylate groups in the hydrogel layers. After attaching the hydrogel layers, a typical 3D porous structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and the surface chemical composition variations were characterized by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The live/dead staining, inhibition zone, and the optical degree of co-culture solution demonstrated that the designed surfaces could not only effectively resist bacteria attachment but also kill the surrounding bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

Apart from the antibiotic effects, GS increases the rate of evaporation from the plant surface, reducing periods of surface wetness and thereby indirectly inhibiting spore germination. To elucidate the molecular basis of differential biocontrol abilities of Nagano and NCTC 7096, we compared GS production and biosurfactant secretion in addition to genome mining of the genomes. Our results proved that: (i) Using oil spreading, blood agar lysis, surface tension and tomato leaves wetness assays, Nagano showed increased biosurfactant secretion in comparison with NCTC 7096, (ii) Genome mining indicated the presence of GS genes in both Nagano and NCTC 7096 with two amino acid units difference between the strains: T342I and P419S.

In the Inverted Repeat-Lacking Clade (IRLC) of legumes, this differentiation is terminal due to irreversible loss of cell division ability and is associated with genome amplification and different morphologies of the bacteroids that can be swollen, elongated, spherical, and elongated-branched, depending on the host plant. In Medicago truncatula, this process is orchestrated by nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs) delivered into developing bacteroids. Here, we identified the predicted NCR proteins in 10 legumes representing different subclades of the IRLC with distinct bacteroid morphotypes. Analysis of their expression and predicted sequences establishes correlations between the composition of the NCR family and the morphotypes of bacteroids. Although NCRs have a single origin, their evolution has followed different routes in individual lineages, and enrichment and diversification of cationic peptides has resulted in the ability to impose major morphological changes on the endosymbionts. The wide range of effects provoked by NCRs such as cell enlargement, membrane alterations and permeabilization, and biofilm and vesicle formation is dependent on the amino acid composition and charge of the peptides. These effects are strongly influenced by the rhizobial surface polysaccharides that affect NCR-induced differentiation and survival of rhizobia in nodule cells.","authors":[{"name":"Jesús Montiel"},{"name":"J Allan Downie"},{"name":"Attila Farkas"},{"name":"Péter Bihari"},{"name":"Róbert Herczeg"},{"name":"Balázs Bálint"},{"name":"Peter Mergaert"},{"name":"Attila Kereszt"},{"name":"Éva Kondorosi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"legume"},{"word":"nitrogen-fixing bacteroids"},{"word":"nodule"},{"word":"nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides"},{"word":"symbiosis"}]},"article32":{"pmid":"28438972","title":"Position of O-Acetylation within the Capsular Repeat Unit Impacts the Biological Properties of Pneumococcal Serotypes 33A and 33F.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) produces many capsule types that differ in their abilities to evade host immune recognition. To explain these serotype-dependent protective capacities, many studies have investigated capsular thickness or the interaction of the capsule with complement proteins, but the effects of small chemical modifications of the capsule on its function have not been studied. One small chemical modification found frequently among pneumococcal capsules is O-acetylation. Pneumococcal serotype 33A has two membrane-bound O-acetyltransferase genes, wciG and wcjE A 33A wcjE-deficient variant, 33F, occurs naturally and is increasing in prevalence in the wake of widespread conjugate vaccine use, but no wciG-deficient variants have been reported. To study the biological consequence of the loss of O-acetylation, we created wciG-deficient variants in both serotypes 33A and 33F, which we named 33X1 (ΔwciG) and 33X2 (ΔwciG ΔwcjE). Serotypes 33X1 and 33X2 express novel capsule types based on serological and biochemical analyses. We found that loss of WcjE-mediated O-acetylation appears not to affect cell wall shielding, since serotypes 33A and 33F exhibit comparable nonspecific opsonophagocytic killing, biofilm production, and adhesion to nasopharyngeal cells, though serotype 33F survived short-term drying better than serotype 33A. Loss of WciG-mediated O-acetylation in serotypes 33X1 and 33X2, however, resulted in a phenotype resembling that of nonencapsulated strains: increased cell wall accessibility, increased nonspecific opsonophagocytic killing, enhanced biofilm formation, and increased adhesion to nasopharyngeal cells. We conclude that WciG-mediated, but not WcjE-mediated, O-acetylation is important for producing protective capsules in 33A and that small chemical changes to the capsule can drastically affect its biological properties.","authors":[{"name":"Brady L Spencer"},{"name":"Jamil S Saad"},{"name":"Anukul T Shenoy"},{"name":"Carlos J Orihuela"},{"name":"Moon H Nahm"}],"keywords":[{"word":"O-acetylation"},{"word":"O-acetyltransferase"},{"word":"capsular diversity"},{"word":"capsular polysaccharide"},{"word":"pneumococcal vaccine"},{"word":"serotype"}]},"article33":{"pmid":"28438938","title":"A Tick Antivirulence Protein Potentiates Antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"New strategies are needed to combat antibiotic resistance, especially against pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus A tick antifreeze glycoprotein, IAFGP, possesses potent antibiofilm properties against a variety of clinical pathogens, including S. aureus Synergy between IAFGP, or a peptide (P1) representative of a repeat region of the protein, with different antibiotics was assessed in vitro Antibiotics that synergized with either IAFPG or P1 were further evaluated in vivo using vertebrate and invertebrate infection models.

The mechanism of antibiotic tolerance in biofilm communities is multifactorial, and the genetic background underlying this antibiotic tolerance has not yet been fully elucidated. Using transposon mutagenesis, we isolated a mutant with reduced tolerance to biapenem (relative to that of the wild type) from adherent cells. Sequencing analysis revealed a mutation in the pslL gene, which is part of the polysaccharide biosynthesis operon. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1ΔpslBCD mutant demonstrated a 100-fold-lower survival rate during the exposure of planktonic and biofilm cells to biapenem; a similar phenotype was observed in a mouse infection model and in clinical strains. Transcriptional analysis of adherent cells revealed increased expression of both pslA and pelA, which are directly regulated by bis-(3',5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). Inactivation of wspF resulted in significantly increased tolerance to biapenem due to increased production of c-di-GMP. The loss of pslBCD in the ΔwspF mutant background abolished the biapenem-tolerant phenotype of the ΔwspF mutant, underscoring the importance of psl in biapenem tolerance. Overexpression of PA2133, which can catalyze the degradation of c-di-GMP, led to a significant reduction in biapenem tolerance in adherent cells, indicating that c-di-GMP is essential in mediating the tolerance effect. The effect of pslBCD on antibiotic tolerance was evident, with 50- and 200-fold-lower survival in the presence of ofloxacin and tobramycin, respectively. We speculate that the psl genes, which are activated by surface adherence through elevated intracellular c-di-GMP levels, confer tolerance to antimicrobials.","authors":[{"name":"Keiji Murakami"},{"name":"Tsuneko Ono"},{"name":"Darija Viducic"},{"name":"Yoko Somiya"},{"name":"Reiko Kariyama"},{"name":"Kenji Hori"},{"name":"Takashi Amoh"},{"name":"Katsuhiko Hirota"},{"name":"Hiromi Kumon"},{"name":"Matthew R Parsek"},{"name":"Yoichiro Miyake"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"adherent cells"},{"word":"antibiotic tolerance"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"psl"}]},"article36":{"pmid":"28438824","title":"Comparison of linezolid and vancomycin lock solutions with and without heparin against biofilm-producing bacteria.","date":"2019-06-06","abs":"The activity of linezolid and vancomycin lock solutions against biofilm-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis was studied.","authors":[{"name":"Megan K Luther"},{"name":"Leonard A Mermel"},{"name":"Kerry L LaPlante"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"catheter-related infections"},{"word":"central venous catheters"},{"word":"heparin"},{"word":"linezolid"},{"word":"vancomycin"}]},"article37":{"pmid":"28438636","title":"Identification of chemotaxis operon cheYZA and cheA gene expression under stressful conditions in Piscirickettsia salmonis.","date":"2017-11-28","abs":"Piscirickettsia salmonis is the etiological agent of piscirickettsiosis, which, as the main systemic disease in the Chilean salmon industry, causes significant economic losses.

In this study, the genome of a hyper-virulent MDR strain PKAB07 of A. baumannii isolated from an Indian patient was sequenced and analyzed to understand its mechanisms of virulence, resistance and evolution. Comparative genome analysis of PKAB07 revealed virulence and resistance related genes scattered throughout the genome, instead of being organized as an island, indicating the highly mosaic nature of the genome. Many intermittent horizontal gene transfer events, insertion sequence (IS) element insertions identified were augmenting resistance machinery and elevating the SNP densities in A. baumannii eventually aiding in their swift evolution. ISAba1, the most widely distributed insertion sequence in A. baumannii was found in multiple sites in PKAB07. Out of many ISAba1 insertions, we identified novel insertions in 9 different genes wherein insertional inactivation of adeN (tetR type regulator) was significant. To assess the significance of this disruption in A. baumannii, adeN mutant and complement strains were constructed in A. baumannii ATCC 17978 strain and studied. Biofilm levels were abrogated in the adeN knockout when compared with the wild type and complemented strain of adeN knockout. Virulence of the adeN knockout mutant strain was observed to be high, which was validated by in vitro experiments and Galleria mellonella infection model. The overexpression of adeJ, a major component of AdeIJK efflux pump observed in adeN knockout strain could be the possible reason for the elevated virulence in adeN mutant and PKB07 strain. Knocking out of adeN in ATCC strain led to increased resistance and virulence at par with the PKAB07.

We found that biofilm-proficient B. subtilis colonized the C. elegans gut and extended the worm lifespan significantly longer than did biofilm-deficient isogenic strains. In addition to biofilm proficiency, the quorum-sensing pentapeptide CSF and nitric oxide (NO) represent the entire B. subtilis repertoire responsible for the extended longevity of C. elegans. B. subtilis grown under biofilm-supporting conditions synthesized higher levels of NO and CSF than under planktonic growth conditions, emphasizing the key role of the biofilm in slowing host aging. Significantly, the prolongevity effect of B. subtilis was primarily due to a downregulation of the insulin-like signaling system that precisely is a key partaker in the healthy longevity of human centenarians.

We applied two genome-wide approaches, random transposon insertion mutagenesis to identify genes that are potentially important for biofilm formation, and transcriptome analyses by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize genes that are differentially expressed in B. cereus when cells were grown in a biofilm-inducing medium. For the first approach, we identified 23 genes whose disruption by transposon insertion led to altered biofilm phenotypes. Based on the predicted function, they included genes involved in processes such as nucleotide biosynthesis, iron salvage, and antibiotic production, as well as genes encoding an ATP-dependent protease and transcription regulators. Transcriptome analyses identified about 500 genes that were differentially expressed in cells grown under biofilm-inducing conditions. One particular set of those genes may contribute to major metabolic shifts, leading to elevated production of small volatile molecules.

The highly hydrated EPS matrix makes the application of many biofilm visualization techniques difficult. Hence, to better visualize how biofilms interact with their environment, there is a need for imaging techniques to monitor hydrated state biofilm dynamics. We employed an in situ dynamic approach to construct label-free images of biofilms. In situ imaging was conducted using a vacuum compatible microfluidic reactor, SALVI (System for Analysis at the Liquid Vacuum Interface), for biofilm growth; real-time confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis; and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) microimaging and spectroscopy. We integrated SALVI microchannel fluids and live biofilms to demonstrate in situ measurement capabilities, including velocity mapping, diffusion coefficient mapping, relaxometry, localized spectroscopy, relaxation times, porosity, and two- and three-dimensional imaging within the microchannel at high spatial resolution. We monitored organic acids adjacent to biofilms, suggesting that kinetic rate and substrate-product yield ratio studies are possible using the SALVI microfluidic reactor for growth characterizations. The integration of NMR microimaging studies into the SALVI platform demonstrates that a multimodal microfluidic platform can serve as an avenue to explore complex biological phenomena, such as biofilm attachment to surfaces, with detailed quantitative physical and chemical mapping. The further incorporation of other SALVI-compatible technologies, such as liquid time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging, with NMR microimaging will produce a powerful correlative approach to monitor in situ biofilm chemistry and dynamics at different spatial scales.","authors":[{"name":"R S Renslow"},{"name":"M J Marshall"},{"name":"A E Tucker"},{"name":"W B Chrisler"},{"name":"X-Y Yu"}],"keywords":[]},"article92":{"pmid":"28424689","title":"Antimicrobial and Attractant Roles for Chemerin in the Oral Cavity during Inflammatory Gum Disease.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Periodontal inflammation is one of the most common chronic inflammatory conditions in humans. Despite recent advances in identifying and characterizing oral microbiota dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of gum disease, just how host factors maintain a healthy homeostatic oral microbial community or prevent the development of a pathogenic oral microbiota remains poorly understood. An important determinant of microbiota fate is local antimicrobial proteins. Here, we report that chemoattractant protein chemerin, which we recently identified as a potent endogenous antimicrobial agent in body barriers such as the skin, is present in the oral cavity under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Chemerin and a chemerin-derived antimicrobial peptide are bactericidal against select bacteria strategically positioned in dental biofilm. Gingival crevicular samples from patients with gingivitis but not periodontitis contain abundant bioactive chemerin capable of inducing CMKLR1-dependent leukocyte migration. Gingipains secreted by the periodontopathogen P. gingivalis inactivate chemerin. Together, these data suggest that as an antimicrobial agent and leukocyte chemoattractant, chemerin likely contributes to antimicrobial immune defense in the oral cavity.","authors":[{"name":"Urszula Godlewska"},{"name":"Piotr Brzoza"},{"name":"Aneta Sroka"},{"name":"Pawel Majewski"},{"name":"Holger Jentsch"},{"name":"Martin Eckert"},{"name":"Sigrun Eick"},{"name":"Jan Potempa"},{"name":"Brian A Zabel"},{"name":"Joanna Cichy"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial peptides"},{"word":"chemerin"},{"word":"chemoattractant"},{"word":"inflammation mediators"},{"word":"microbiota"},{"word":"oral cavity"}]},"article93":{"pmid":"28424663","title":"Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy against Endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans Mono and Mixed Biofilms in the Presence of Photosensitizers: A Comparative Study with Classical Endodontic Irrigants.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Endodontic biofilms eradication from the infected root canal system remains as the primary focus in endodontic field.

It is probably one of the most species-rich, structurally complex and productive ecosystems in temperate waters and well-studied in terms of trophic ecology. However, still little is known about the microorganisms thriving in this habitat. A growing body of evidence suggests that bacteria associated with macro-algae represent a huge and largely untapped resource of natural products with chemical structures that have been optimized by evolution for biological and ecological purposes. Those microorganisms are most likely attracted by algae through secretion of specific carbohydrates and proteins that trigger them to attach to the algal surface and to form biofilms. The algae might then employ those bacteria as biofouling control, using their antimicrobial secondary metabolites to defeat other bacteria or eukaryotes. We here analyzed biofilm samples from the brown macro-algae Macrocystis pyrifera sampled in November 2014 in the kelp forest of Monterey Bay by a metagenomic shotgun and amplicon sequencing approach, focusing on Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia from the PVC superphylum. Although not very abundant, we were able to find novel Planctomycetal and Verrucomicrobial species by an innovative binning approach.

However, the impact of biocides in antibiofilm treatment is largely limited due to the lack of an effective delivery system that can ensure sustained release of biocides at the target site. Herein we report a biocide-encapsulated antibacterial and antibiofilm hydrogel that acts as an efficient delivery vehicle for the biocide and eradicates matured bacterial biofilm. The hydrogels are prepared using dextran methacrylate (Dex-MA), a biocompatible and photopolymerizable polymer, and a nontoxic cationic biocide with two cationic charges, two nonpeptidic amide bonds, and optimized amphiphilicity, which is capable of eradicating established bacterial biofilms. The gels, prepared via direct loading of the biocide and with highly controllable amounts, display 100% activity against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Importantly, the gels are shown to release the biocide and kill bacteria for an extended period of time (until day 5). When being treated with the established bacterial biofilms, the released biocide from the gel is shown to completely eradicate establishedS. aureus, Escherichia coli, and MRSA biofilms, the most common biofilm forming bacteria that cause severe infections (e.g., skin infections, urinary tract infections, etc.) in humans. Moreover, the gels were shown to annihilate preformed MRSA biofilm with >99.99% bacterial reduction under in vitro and in vivo conditions in a superficial MRSA infection model in mice. Notably, when tested, excellent skin compatibility is observed for these materials in various animal models such as a rat model of acute dermal toxicity, guinea pig model of skin sensitization, and rabbit model of skin irritation. The biocompatible antibacterial and antibiofilm hydrogels developed herein thus might be useful in treating bacterial biofilm associated infections, especially topical infections.","authors":[{"name":"Jiaul Hoque"},{"name":"Jayanta Haldar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibacterial activity"},{"word":"biofilm eradication"},{"word":"cationic small molecular biocide"},{"word":"controlled release of biocide"},{"word":"dextran-based hydrogels"}]},"article97":{"pmid":"28422463","title":"Gingival Health and Plaque Regrowth Response Following a Four-Week Interdental Hygiene Intervention.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"To compare the efficacy of three adjunct interproximal cleaning methods versus a manual toothbrush alone on gingivitis, and demonstrate that the Philips Sonicare AirflossPro™ interproximal (IP) cleaning device provides a similar reduction in gingivitis and plaque compared to string floss.","authors":[{"name":"Anthony Mwatha"},{"name":"Misty Olson"},{"name":"Sonia Souza"},{"name":"Marilyn Ward"},{"name":"Wendy Jenkins"},{"name":"Pejmon Amini"},{"name":"John Gallob"},{"name":"Theresa Fafard"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Airfloss"},{"word":"Sonicare"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"floss"},{"word":"gingivitis"},{"word":"interproximal cleaning"},{"word":"oral hygiene"},{"word":"plaque"}]},"article98":{"pmid":"28422332","title":"Biofilm dispersal: multiple elaborate strategies for dissemination of bacteria with unique properties.","date":"2017-11-28","abs":"In most environments, microorganisms evolve in a sessile mode of growth, designated as biofilm, which is characterized by cells embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix.

Recently, our group has shown that the A1S_0114 gene was involved in biofilm formation, a process related with pathogenesis. Confirming our previous results, microscopy images revealed that the ATCC 17978 Δ0114 derivative lacking this gene was unable to form a mature biofilm structure. Therefore, other bacterial phenotypes were analyzed to determine the role of this gene in the pathogenicity of A. baumannii ATCC 17978. The interaction of the ATCC 17978 parental strain and the Δ0114 mutant with A549 human alveolar epithelial cells was quantified revealing that the A1S_0114 gene was necessary for proper attachment to A549 cells. This dependency correlates with the negative effect of the A1S_0114 deletion on the expression of genes coding for surface proteins and pili-assembly systems, which are known to play a role in adhesion. Three different experimental animal models, including vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, confirmed the role of the A1S_0114 gene in virulence. All of the experimental infection assays indicated that the virulence of the ATCC 17978 was significantly reduced when this gene was inactivated.

We also highlight future research directions required in order to harness fully the capabilities of Pseudomonas sp. in bioremediation strategies towards eliminating plastic wastes.","authors":[{"name":"R A Wilkes"},{"name":"L Aristilde"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonads"},{"word":"biodegradation"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"bioremediation"},{"word":"environmental"}]},"article113":{"pmid":"28419339","title":"Effect of chlorine treatment on inhibition of E. coli serogroup O2 incorporation into 7-day-old biofilm on polyvinylchloride surface.","date":"2020-02-20","abs":"Poultry waterlines are constructed using polyvinylchloride (PVC) material on which bacterial biofilm can easily form.

Initially, biofilm growth was induced in PVC test coupons (15.16 cm2) for a 7-day period mimicking the waterline scenario in the first wk of poultry brooding; and then this biofilm was challenged with E. coli O2 seeded water in presence/absence of chlorine treatment. After rinsing, test coupons were sampled for bacterial (APC) and E. coli O2 enumeration at various occasions post seeding the pathogen and chlorine treatment. Day 7 APC recovered from coupons was 4.35 log10 cfu/cm2 in trial 1 and 3.66 log10 cfu/cm2 in trial 2.

Between November 2015 and February 2016, we enrolled 60 patients with hematologic malignancies who had peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) to receive the study lock solution. The study lock consisted of 15 or 30 μg/ml of nitroglycerin in combination with 4% sodium citrate and 22% ethanol. Each lumen was locked for at least 2 h once daily prior to being flushed. After enrollment of 10 patients at the lower nitroglycerin dose without evidence of toxicity, the dose was escalated to the higher dose (30 μg/ml). There were no serious related adverse events or episodes of hypotension with lock administration. Two patients experienced mild transient adverse events (one headache and one rash) possibly related to the lock and that resolved without residual effect. The CLABSI rate was 0 on lock days versus 1.6/1,000 catheter days (CD) off lock prophylaxis, compared with a rate of 1.9/1,000 CD at the institution in the same patient population.

However, little is known about how phage polyvalence (i.e., broad host range) affects bacterial suppression and interspecies competition in environments harboring enteric pathogens and soil bacteria. Here we compare the efficacy of polyvalent phage PEf1 versus coliphage T4 in suppressing a model enteric bacterium (E. coli K-12) in mixtures with soil bacteria (Pseudomonas putida F1 and Bacillus subtilis 168). Although T4 was more effective than PEf1 in infecting E. coli K-12 in pure cultures, PEf1 was 20-fold more effective in suppressing E. coli under simulated multispecies biofilm conditions because polyvalence enhanced PEf1 propagation in P. putida. In contrast, soil bacteria do not propagate coliphages and hindered T4 diffusion through the biofilm. Similar tests were also conducted under planktonic conditions to discern how interspecies competition contributes to E. coli suppression without the confounding effects of restricted phage diffusion. Significant synergistic suppression was observed by the combined effects of phages plus competing bacteria. T4 was slightly more effective in suppressing E. coli in these planktonic mixed cultures, even though PEf1 reached higher concentrations by reproducing also in P. putida (7.2 ± 0.4 vs 6.0 ± 1.0 log","authors":[{"name":"Pingfeng Yu"},{"name":"Jacques Mathieu"},{"name":"Yu Yang"},{"name":"Pedro J J Alvarez"}],"keywords":[]},"article138":{"pmid":"28414439","title":"Mitigation of Thin-Film Composite Membrane Biofouling via Immobilizing Nano-Sized Biocidal Reservoirs in the Membrane Active Layer.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This work investigates the use of a silver-based metal-organic framework (MOF) for mitigating biofouling in forward-osmosis thin-film composite (TFC) membranes.

Additionally, the MOF nanocrystals provided biocidal activity that lasted for 6 months. The immobilization improved biofouling resistance in the membranes, whose flux had a decline of 8% after 24 h of operation in biofouling experiments, while that of the control membranes had a greater decline of ∼21%. The better biofouling resistance is due to simultaneous improvement of antiadhesive and antimicrobial properties of the membranes.

AC was immobilized via three different approaches: covalent attachment (CA), enzyme coating (EC), and magnetically separable enzyme precipitate coating (Mag-EPC). The enzyme activity per unit weight of cPANFs with Mag-EPC was 75 and 300 times higher than that of those with CA and EC, respectively, representing improved enzyme loading in the form of Mag-EPC. After incubation under shaking at 200 rpm for 20 days, Mag-EPC maintained 55% of its initial activity, whereas CA and EC showed 3 and 16% of their initial activities, respectively. The antifouling of highly loaded and stable Mag-EPC against the biofouling/biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested under static- and continuous-flow conditions. Biofilm formation in the presence of 40 μg/mL Mag-EPC under static condition was 5 times lower than that under control condition with no addition of Mag-EPC. Under continuous membrane filtration, Mag-EPC delayed the increase of transmembrane pressure (TMP) more effectively as the concentration of added Mag-EPC increased. When separating Mag-EPC and membranes in two different vessels under internal circulation of the culture solution, Mag-EPC maintained a higher permeability than the control with no Mag-EPC addition. It was also confirmed that the addition of Mag-EPC reduced the generation of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducers. This result reveals that the inhibition of biofilm formation and biofouling in the presence of Mag-EPC is due to the hydrolysis of AHL autoinducers, catalyzed by the immobilized and stabilized AC in the form of Mag-EPC. Mag-EPC of AC with high enzyme loadings and improved stability has demonstrated its great potential as an antifouling agent by reducing biofilm formation and membrane biofouling based on enzymatic quorum quenching of autoinducers.","authors":[{"name":"Jeongjoon Lee"},{"name":"Inseon Lee"},{"name":"Jahyun Nam"},{"name":"Dong Soo Hwang"},{"name":"Kyung-Min Yeon"},{"name":"Jungbae Kim"}],"keywords":[{"word":"acylase"},{"word":"antifouling"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"magnetically separable enzyme precipitate coating"},{"word":"quorum quenching"}]},"article140":{"pmid":"28414173","title":"Affinity interactions drive post-implantation drug filling, even in the presence of bacterial biofilm.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Current post-operative standard of care for surgical procedures, including device implantations, dictates prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, but a percentage of patients still develop infections.

Recently, the prominence of cyclic dipeptides in interfering with biofilms and the associated virulence factors of pathogens has offered an alternative to eliminate difficult-to-treat infections. Therefore, we assessed the effect of a potent antibiofilm agent cyclic dipeptide, cyclo(l-leucyl-l-prolyl) (CLP), on the EPS modification of S. epidermidis. The non-bactericidal antibiofilm efficacy of CLP against S. epidermidis was affirmed through quantitative (crystal violet and XTT assays) and qualitative (confocal and scanning electron microscopes) analyses. Notably, CLP was potent enough to reduce all the EPS components viz. polysaccharides, proteins and eDNA to a significant level. Substantial difference in the atomic composition and functionality of CLP treated EPS was evident through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, CLP dehydrated the S. epidermidis-EPS and altered the acetylated sugars as well as α-glycosidic linkage in it. The results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) indicate the decrease of total negative charge of EPS upon CLP treatment, which goes well in accordance with the decrease of eDNA.

In multispecies communities, S. epidermidis is capable of growing a more confluent biofilm when the addition of S. aureus is delayed 4 to 6 h during 18 h of growth. Different vancomycin dosages generate various behaviors: S. epidermidis is more prevalent at a dose of 1.0 μg/ml vancomycin, but reduced growth of both species occurs at 1.9 μg/ml vancomycin. This variability is consistent with the different MICs of S. aureus and S. epidermidis Growth at higher temperature (45°C) results in an environment where S. aureus forms porous biofilms. This porosity allows S. epidermidis to colonize more of the surface, resulting in detectable S. epidermidis biomass.

The predominant protein expressed in enteric biofilms is the amyloid curli, which forms highly immunogenic complexes with DNA. Infection with curli-expressing bacteria or systemic exposure to purified curli-DNA complexes triggers autoimmunity via the generation of type I interferons (IFNs) and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. Here, we show that DNA complexed with amyloid curli powerfully stimulates Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) through a two-step mechanism. First, the cross beta-sheet structure of curli is bound by cell-surface Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), enabling internalization of the complex into endosomes. After internalization, the curli-DNA immune complex binds strongly to endosomal TLR9, inducing production of type I IFNs. Analysis of wild-type and TLR2-deficient macrophages showed that TLR2 is the major receptor that drives the internalization of curli-DNA complexes. Suppression of TLR2 internalization via endocytosis inhibitors led to a significant decrease in Ifnβ expression. Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that the TLR2-bound curli was required for shuttling of DNA to endosomal TLR9. Structural analysis using small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that incorporation of DNA into curli fibrils resulted in the formation of ordered curli-DNA immune complexes. Curli organizes parallel, double-stranded DNA rods at an inter-DNA spacing that matches up well with the steric size of TLR9. We also found that production of anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies in response to curli-DNA was attenuated in TLR2- and TLR9-deficient mice and in mice deficient in both TLR2 and TLR9 compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that both innate immune receptors are critical for shaping the autoimmune adaptive immune response. We also detected significantly lower levels of interferon-stimulated gene expression in response to purified curli-DNA in TLR2 and TLR9 deficient mice compared to wild-type mice, confirming that TLR2 and TLR9 are required for the induction of type I IFNs. Finally, we showed that curli-DNA complexes, but not cellulose, were responsible elicitation of the immune responses to bacterial biofilms. This study defines the series of events that lead to the severe pro-autoimmune effects of amyloid-expressing bacteria and suggest a mechanism by which amyloid curli acts as a carrier to break immune tolerance to DNA, leading to the activation of TLR9, production of type I IFNs, and subsequent production of autoantibodies.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah A Tursi"},{"name":"Ernest Y Lee"},{"name":"Nicole J Medeiros"},{"name":"Michael H Lee"},{"name":"Lauren K Nicastro"},{"name":"Bettina Buttaro"},{"name":"Stefania Gallucci"},{"name":"Ronald Paul Wilson"},{"name":"Gerard C L Wong"},{"name":"Çagla Tükel"}],"keywords":[]},"article151":{"pmid":"28410367","title":"Nitric oxide charged catheters as a potential strategy for prevention of hospital acquired infections.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Catheter-Associated Hospital-Acquired Infections (HAI's) are caused by biofilm-forming bacteria.

It is also plausible that truncated versions will display some of the biological activities of the parent peptide, with the benefit that they are less costly to synthesize using solid-phase chemistry. The host defense peptide, LL-37, and two truncated mimetics, KE-18 and KR-12, were tested for their inhibitory effects and antibiofilm properties against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, microorganisms commonly implicated in biofilm-related infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Using in silico prediction tools, the truncated peptides KE-18 and KR-12 were selected for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and antibiofilm testing on the basis of their favorable cationicity, hydrophobic ratio, and amphipathicity compared with the parent peptide. Two methods were analyzed for determining peptide efficacy against biofilms; a crystal violet assay and an XTT [2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] assay. The biocidal activities (measured by MIC) and antibiofilm activities (measured by a crystal violet assay) appeared to be independent. LL-37 had no biocidal action against C. albicans (MIC > 250 μg/ml) but significant effects in both biofilm-prevention and biofilm-inhibition assays. KE-18 and KR-12 yielded superior MIC values against all three microorganisms. Only KE-18 had a significant effect in the biofilm-prevention assay, which persisted even at sub-MICs. Neither of the truncated peptides were active in the biofilm-inhibition assay. KE-18 was shown to bind lipopolysaccharide as effectively as LL-37 and to bind lipoteichoic acid more effectively. None of the peptides showed hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes at the concentrations tested.

Biofilms in relation to UTIs have been shown both on catheters, on concrements or as intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). Due to the increased risk of acquiring recurrent or chronic UTIs and frequent antibiotic treatments, patients experience an increased risk of being infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria like extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp., but also bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa inherently resistant to several antibiotics. Diagnosing the UTI can also be challenging, especially distinguishing harmless colonization from pathogenic infection. Based on a previous study showing activation of humoral immune response toward UTI pathogens in patients with spinal cord lesions (SCL), the present mini review is an evaluation of using antibody response as an indicator of chronic biofilm UTI. In addition, we evaluated the effect of long-term treatment with antibiotics in patients with SCLs and chronic UTI, defined by culturing of a uropathogen in the urine and elevated specific precipitating antibodies against the same uropathogen in a blood sample. Elimination of chronic UTI, decrease in specific precipitating antibody values and avoiding selection of new multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogens were the primary markers for effect of treatment.

Microbial contamination of the catheter leads to the development of a microbial consortia associated with the CVC surface and embedded in an extracellular matrix, named biofilm. This biofilm provides bacterial cells the ability to survive antimicrobial agents and the host immune system and to disseminate to other sites of the body. The best preventive strategy is to avoid any unnecessary catheterization or to reduce indwelling duration when a CVC is required. Beside aseptic care and antibiotic-impregnated catheters (like minocycline/rifampin), preventive locks can be proposed in some cases, whereas non-biocidal approaches are under active research like anti-adhesive or competitive interactions strategies. When the diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is suspected on clinical symptoms, it requires a microbiological confirmation by paired blood cultures in order to avoid unnecessary catheter removal. The treatment of CRBSI relies on catheter removal and systemic antimicrobials.

Using B. thailandensis, we report here a novel redox-sensitive member of the multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) protein family, BifR, which represses biofilm formation. BifR is encoded as part of the emrB-bifR operon; emrB-bifR is divergent to ecsC, which encodes a putative LasA protease. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LasA has been implicated in virulence by contributing to cleavage of elastase. BifR repressed the expression of ecsC and emrB-bifR, and expression was further repressed under oxidizing conditions. BifR bound two sites in the intergenic region between ecsC and emrB-bifR with nanomolar affinity under both reducing and oxidizing conditions; however, oxidized BifR formed a disulfide-linked dimer-of-dimers, a covalent linkage that was absent in BifR-C104A in which the redox-active cysteine was replaced with alanine. BifR also repressed an operon encoding enzymes required for synthesis of phenazine antibiotics, which function as alternate respiratory electron receptors, and inactivation of bifR resulted in enhanced biofilm formation. Taken together, our data suggest that BifR functions to control LasA production and expression of genes involved in biofilm formation, in part by regulating synthesis of alternate electron acceptors that promote survival in the oxygen-limiting environment of a biofilm. The correlation between increased repression of emrB-bifR under oxidative conditions and the formation of a covalently linked BifR dimer-of-dimers suggests that BifR may modulate gene activity in response to cellular redox state.","authors":[{"name":"Ashish Gupta"},{"name":"Stanley M Fuentes"},{"name":"Anne Grove"}],"keywords":[]},"article177":{"pmid":"28406080","title":"Genome amplification and promoter mutation expand the range of csgD-dependent biofilm responses in an STEC population.","date":"2018-08-13","abs":"Expression of the major biofilm components of E. coli, curli fimbriae and cellulose, requires the CsgD transcription factor.

QS inhibition was confirmed using confocal scanning laser microscopy and growth curves, and it was shown to occur in a dose-dependent manner without affecting bacterial growth. Secondary metabolites of Rhizobium sp. NAO1 inhibited PAO1 pathogenicity by downregulating AHL-mediated virulence factors such as elastase activity and siderophore production.

Bacteria within biofilms are embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix that makes them more resistant to antibiotic treatment and responses of the host immune system. Microbial biofilms are very important in medicine since they are associated with several human diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis, otitis media, infective endocarditis, infectious kidney stones, osteomyelitis or prostatitis. In addition, biofilms formed on the surface of clinical devices such as pacemakers, implants and catheters are difficult to treat, which underlines the clinical relevance of biofilm formation. At the molecular level, the switch from the planktonic state to biofilm formation is regulated primarily by bis- (3'-5)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). C-di-GMP performs its function by binding to a wide variety of proteins, but also to riboswitches. C-di-GMP riboswitches are RNA regulatory elements located in the 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) of RNA messengers (mRNA) from genes involved in virulence, motility and biofilm formation, which are regulated by changes in the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP.

We designed a millifluidic setup allowing to control hydrodynamic conditions and to monitor biofilm development in real time using microscope imaging. We also conducted a transcriptomic analysis to detect a potential physiological response to hydrodynamics. We discovered that a threshold value of shear stress determined biofilm settlement, with sub-piconewton forces sufficient to prevent biofilm initiation. As a consequence, distinct hydrodynamic conditions, which set spatial distribution of shear stress, promoted distinct colonization patterns with consequences on the growth mode. However, no direct impact of mechanical forces on biofilm growth rate was observed. Consistently, no mechanosensing gene emerged from our differential transcriptomic analysis comparing distinct hydrodynamic conditions. Instead, we found that hydrodynamic molecular transport crucially impacts biofilm growth by controlling oxygen availability.

Thus, blocking QS may suppress QS-controlled phenotypes of these bacteria that are responsible for food spoilage. Biofilm formation is closely related to bacterial infection, and it is also a major mechanism responsible for the increased resistance of biofilm-associated bacteria to antimicrobial drugs. Food spoilage and biofilm formation caused by food-related bacteria have posed a significant problem for the food industry. Thus, adopting an antibiofilm approach would provide an alternative to an antibiotic strategy. Dihydrocoumarin is a compound that is derived from coumarin, a known natural QS inhibitor that has been used as an additive in food. Hafnia alvei is a spoilage bacterium; H. alvei H4 was isolated from ready-to-eat sea cucumber. Considering that QS and biofilm are often closely linked, this research aimed to detect the effect of dihydrocoumarin on the production of violacein by Chromobacterium violaceum 026 and to evaluate the inhibitory effect of dihydrocoumarin on the formation of biofilm by H. alvei H4 by using violacein and crystal violet assays. C. violaceum 026 treated with dihydrocoumarin showed as much as 70.1% reduction in QS-mediated production of violacein compared with untreated cells, while exhibiting no significant change in growth. H. alvei H4 treated with dihydrocoumarin displayed 75.8% reduction in swimming motility, and as much as 89.4% reduction in biofilm formation compared with the nontreated cells, with the reduction in both cases being dependent on the concentration of dihydrocoumarin. Scanning electron microscopy showed that dihydrocoumarin could effectively destroy the biofilm structure of H. alvei H4 and decrease biofilm density. These findings indicate that dihydrocoumarin can be developed into a new QS inhibitor or antibiofilm agent for controlling food spoilage and potentially investigated to increase food safety.","authors":[{"name":"Hong Man Hou"},{"name":"Feng Jiang"},{"name":"Gong Liang Zhang"},{"name":"Jia Y Wang"},{"name":"Ya H Zhu"},{"name":"Xin Y Liu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibiofilm"},{"word":"Dihydrocoumarin"},{"word":"Hafnia alvei H4"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"}]},"article193":{"pmid":"28402019","title":"Epigallocatechin gallate inhibits Streptococcus pneumoniae virulence by simultaneously targeting pneumolysin and sortase A.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), the causative agent of several human diseases, possesses numerous virulence factors associated with pneumococcal infection and pathogenesis.

We used laboratory biofilm reactors (inoculated with a diverse subsurface community) to explore the phylogenetic and taxonomic variability in microbial communities as a function of surface type (carbonate, silicate, aluminosilicate), media pH, and carbon and phosphate availability. Using high-throughput pyrosequencing, we found that surface type significantly controlled ~70-90% of the variance in phylogenetic diversity regardless of environmental pressures. Consistent patterns also emerged in the taxonomy of specific guilds (sulfur-oxidizers/reducers, Gram-positives, acidophiles) due to variations in media chemistry. Media phosphate availability was a key property associated with variation in phylogeny and taxonomy of whole reactors and was negatively correlated with biofilm accumulation and α-diversity (species richness and evenness). However, mineral-bound phosphate limitations were correlated with less biofilm. Carbon added to the media was correlated with a significant increase in biofilm accumulation and overall α-diversity. Additionally, planktonic communities were phylogenetically distant from those in biofilms. All treatments harbored structurally (taxonomically and phylogenetically) distinct microbial communities. Selective advantages within each treatment encouraged growth and revealed the presence of hundreds of additional operational taxonomix units (OTU), representing distinct consortiums of microorganisms.

Scanning electron microscopy images revealed the details of the surface morphology and non-contact mode laser scanning of the surface revealed the microtopography-associated quantitative parameters.

In contrast, biofilms treated with β-glucanase were able to regrow significantly after exposure. Moreover, short-term respirometry tests with planktonic cells were performed to understand the effects of enzymes and their combination with CTAB on P. fluorescens viability. Protease and lipase demonstrated antimicrobial action, while α-amylase increased bacterial metabolic activity. The combination of CTAB with either protease or α-amylase was antagonistic, decreasing the antimicrobial action of CTAB. The overall results demonstrate a modest effect of the selected enzymes in biofilm control, either when applied alone or each one in combination with CTAB. Total biofilm removal or CFU reduction was not achieved and, in some cases, the use of enzymes antagonized the effects of CTAB. The results also propose that complementary tests, to characterize biofilm integrity and microbial viability, are required when someone is trying to assess the role of novel biocide - enzyme mixtures for effective biofilm control.","authors":[{"name":"Paula A Araújo"},{"name":"Idalina Machado"},{"name":"Ana Meireles"},{"name":"TorOve Leiknes"},{"name":"Filipe Mergulhão"},{"name":"Luís F Melo"},{"name":"Manuel Simões"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial quenching"},{"word":"Biofilm control"},{"word":"Cleaning"},{"word":"Disinfection"},{"word":"Enzymes"},{"word":"Flow-generated biofilms"},{"word":"Pseudomonas fluorescens"}]},"article224":{"pmid":"28394940","title":"Streptococcal adhesin SspA/B analogue peptide inhibits adherence and impacts biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans.","date":"2019-02-08","abs":"Streptococcus mutans, the major causative agent of dental caries, adheres to tooth surfaces via the host salivary glycoprotein-340 (gp340). This adherence can be competitively inhibited by peptides derived from the SspA/B adhesins of Streptococcus gordonii, a human commensal microbe that competes for the same binding sites. Ssp(A4K-A11K), a double-lysine substituted SspA/B peptide analogue, has been shown to exhibit superior in vitro binding affinity for a gp340-derived peptide (SRCRP2), suggesting that Ssp(A4K-A11K) may be of clinical interest. In the present work, we tested the inhibitory effects of Ssp(A4K-A11K) on adherence and biofilm formation of S. mutans by reconstructing an artificial oral environment using saliva-coated polystyrene plates and hydroxyapatite disks. Bacterial adherence (adherence period: 1 h) was assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using biotinylated bacterial cells. Biofilm formation (periods: 8, 11, or 14 h) was assessed by staining and imaging of the sessile cells, or by recovering biofilm cells and plating for cell counts. The pH values of the culture media were measured as a biofilm acidogenicity indicator. Bactericidality was measured by loss of optical density during culturing in the presence of the peptide. We observed that 650 μM Ssp(A4K-A11K) significantly inhibited adherence of S. mutans to saliva-coated polystyrene; a similar effect was seen on bacterial affinity for SRCRP2. Ssp(A4K-A11K) had lesser effects on the adherence of commensal streptococci. Pretreatment of polystyrene and hydroxyapatite with 650 μM Ssp(A4K-A11K) significantly attenuated biofilm formation, whether tested with glucose- or sucrose-containing media. The SspA/B peptide's activity did not reflect bactericidality. Strikingly, pH in Ssp-treated 8-h (6.8 ± 0.06) and 11-h (5.5 ± 0.06) biofilms showed higher values than the critical pH. Thus, Ssp(A4K-A11K) acts by inhibiting bacterial adherence and cariogrnic biofilm formation. We further consider these results in the context of the safety, specificity, and stability properties of the Ssp(A4K-A11K) peptide.","authors":[{"name":"Tatsuro Ito"},{"name":"Takahiro Ichinosawa"},{"name":"Takehiko Shimizu"}],"keywords":[]},"article225":{"pmid":"28393523","title":"Nanotransformation of Vancomycin Overcomes the Intrinsic Resistance of Gram-Negative Bacteria.","date":"2019-01-09","abs":"The increased emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing public health concern, and although new drugs are constantly being sought, the pace of development is slow compared with the evolution and spread of multidrug-resistant species. In this study, we developed a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent by simply transforming vancomycin into nanoform using sonochemistry. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic largely used for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria but inefficient against Gram-negative species. The nanospherization extended its effect toward Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making these bacteria up to 10 and 100 times more sensitive to the antibiotic, respectively. The spheres were able to disrupt the outer membranes of these bacteria, overcoming their intrinsic resistance toward glycopeptides. The penetration of nanospheres into a Langmuir monolayer of bacterial membrane phospholipids confirmed the interaction of the nanoantibiotic with the membrane of E. coli cells, affecting their physical integrity, as further visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Such mechanism of antibacterial action is unlikely to induce mutations in the evolutionary conserved bacterial membrane, therefore reducing the possibility of acquiring resistance. Our results indicated that the nanotransformation of vancomycin could overcome the inherent resistance of Gram-negative bacteria toward this antibiotic and disrupt mature biofilms at antibacterial-effective concentrations.","authors":[{"name":"Margarida M Fernandes"},{"name":"Kristina Ivanova"},{"name":"Javier Hoyo"},{"name":"Sílvia Pérez-Rafael"},{"name":"Antonio Francesko"},{"name":"Tzanko Tzanov"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vancomycin"},{"word":"antibiotic nanospheres"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"sonochemistry"}]},"article226":{"pmid":"28392838","title":"Global gene expression in Escherichia coli, isolated from the diseased ocular surface of the human eye with a potential to form biofilm.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Escherichia coli, the gastrointestinal commensal, is also known to cause ocular infections such as conjunctivitis, keratitis and endophthalmitis.

Here we present a synthetic peptide P1, derived from a tick antifreeze protein, which significantly reduces S. mutans biofilm formation. Incubating cells with this peptide decreased biofilm biomass by approximately 75% in both a crystal violet microplate assay and an in vitro tooth model using saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs.

Peptide P1 can bind directly to S. mutans cells but does not possess bactericidal activity. Anti-biofilm activity was correlated with peptide aggregation and β-sheet formation in solution, and alternative synthetic peptides of different lengths or charge distribution did not inhibit biofilms.

In comparison with the normal animal group, all MRSA extracts induced a hepatotoxic effect which was indicated from the significant (p < 0.01) increases in the activities of the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) enzymes. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) combined with a partial nephrotoxicity that was monitored from the significant elevation of serum urea concentration. While serum creatinine levels did not affect. Similarly, a significant elevation was recorded in serum levels of tumor biomarkers (alpha fetoprotein; AFP, carcinoembryonic antigen; CEA, and lactate dehydrogenase; LDH) reflecting their carcinogenic potential. On the other hand, the percentage of micronuclei (MN) in polychromatic erythrocytes from bone marrow cells was statistically significant in all groups as compared to the control group. The percentage of sperm abnormalities was statistically significant compared to the control. Different types of head abnormalities and coiled tail were recorded. Consequently, the current study focused on fighting MRSA virulence factors by the new compound ayamycin, which proved to be potent anti-virulence factor against all MRSA strains under study by significant decreasing of their streptokinase activities, hemolysin synthesis, biofilm formation, and their cell surface hydrophobicity.","authors":[{"name":"Mervat Morsy Abbas Ahmed El-Gendy"},{"name":"Khaled G Abdel-Wahhab"},{"name":"Fathia A Mannaa"},{"name":"Ayman A Farghaly"},{"name":"Ahmed M A El-Bondkly"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-virulent"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Carcinogenic activity"},{"word":"Hemolysin"},{"word":"Sperm abnormality"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)"},{"word":"Streptokinase"}]},"article247":{"pmid":"28389641","title":"Dual function of tropodithietic acid as antibiotic and signaling molecule in global gene regulation of the probiotic bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Antibiotics are typically regarded as microbial weapons, but whereas their function at concentrations lethal for bacteria is often well characterized, the role of antibiotics at much lower concentrations as possibly found under natural conditions remains poorly understood. By using whole-transcriptome analyses and phenotypic screenings of the marine bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens we found that the broad-spectrum antibiotic tropodithietic acid (TDA) causes the same regulatory effects in quorum sensing (QS) as the common signaling molecule N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) at concentrations 100-fold lower than the minimal inhibitory concentration against bacteria. Our results show that TDA has a significant impact on the expression of ~10% of the total genes of P. inhibens, in the same manner as the AHL. Furthermore, TDA needs the AHL associated LuxR-type transcriptional regulator, just as the AHL molecule. Low concentrations of antibiotics can obviously have a strong influence on the global gene expression of the bacterium that produces it and drastically change the metabolism and behaviour of the bacterium. For P. inhibens this includes motility, biofilm formation and antibiotic production, all important for settlement on new host-associated surfaces. Our results demonstrate that bacteria can produce antibiotics not only to antagonise other bacteria, but also to mediate QS like endogenous AHL molecules.","authors":[{"name":"Paul G Beyersmann"},{"name":"Jürgen Tomasch"},{"name":"Kwangmin Son"},{"name":"Roman Stocker"},{"name":"Markus Göker"},{"name":"Irene Wagner-Döbler"},{"name":"Meinhard Simon"},{"name":"Thorsten Brinkhoff"}],"keywords":[]},"article248":{"pmid":"28389546","title":"High Levels of the Xenorhabdus nematophila Transcription Factor Lrp Promote Mutualism with the Steinernema carpocapsae Nematode Host.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Xenorhabdus nematophila bacteria are mutualistic symbionts of Steinernema carpocapsae nematodes and pathogens of insects.

We previously reported that natural populations of X. nematophila exhibit various levels of Lrp expression and that cells expressing relatively low levels of Lrp are optimized for virulence in the insect Manduca sexta The adaptive advantage of the high-Lrp-expressing state was not established. Here we used strains engineered to express constitutively high or low levels of Lrp to test the model in which high-Lrp-expressing cells are adapted for mutualistic activities with the nematode host. We demonstrate that high-Lrp cells form more robust biofilms in laboratory media than do low-Lrp cells, which may reflect adherence to host tissues. Also, our data showed that nematodes cultivated with high-Lrp strains are more frequently colonized than are those associated with low-Lrp strains. Taken together, these data support the idea that high-Lrp cells have an advantage in tissue adherence and colonization initiation. Furthermore, our data show that high-Lrp-expressing strains better support nematode reproduction than do their low-Lrp counterparts under both in vitro and in vivo conditions.

Here, we isolated a marine bacterium (Vibrio alginolyticus strain 178) from a seamount in the tropical West Pacific that exhibits vigorous motility on agar plates and severe pathogenicity to zebrafish. We found that V. alginolyticus 178 motility was significantly suppressed by another marine bacterium, Bacillus sp. strain 176, isolated from the same niche. We isolated, purified, and characterized two different cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) from Bacillus sp. 176 using high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The two related CLPs have a pumilacidin-like structure and were both effective inhibitors of V. alginolyticus 178 motility. The CLPs differ by only one methylene group in their fatty acid chains. In addition to motility suppression, the CLPs also induced cell aggregation in the medium and reduced adherence of V. alginolyticus 178 to glass substrates. Notably, upon CLP treatment, the expression levels of two V. alginolyticus flagellar assembly genes (flgA and flgP) dropped dramatically. Moreover, the CLPs inhibited biofilm formation in several other strains of pathogenic bacteria without inducing cell death. This study indicates that CLPs from Bacillus sp. 176 show promise as antimicrobial lead compounds targeting bacterial motility and biofilm formation with a low potential for eliciting antibiotic resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Pengyuan Xiu"},{"name":"Rui Liu"},{"name":"Dechao Zhang"},{"name":"Chaomin Sun"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio alginolyticus"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"antibiotic"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"lipopeptide"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"pumilacidin"}]},"article251":{"pmid":"28389355","title":"Antifungal activity and cytotoxicity of extracts and triterpenoid saponins obtained from the aerial parts of Anagallis arvensis L.","date":"2018-01-05","abs":"Anagallis arvensis L.

Bacterial contamination is commonly associated with failure to heal, despite antibiotic treatment, suggesting that additional therapies must be developed to combat these complications. Treatment failure is likely due to the presence of resistant microbial communities known as biofilms. Biofilm bacteria are able to elicit a direct inhibition of healing through a multitude of known factors. However, they likely also inhibit healing through alteration of the inflammatory response. As inflammation is a critical step in fracture healing, how the presence of biofilm bacteria shifts this response to one that is suboptimal for healing is an important consideration that is currently understudied. The profile of inflammatory factors in response to biofilm bacteria is unique and distinct from those induced during normal healing or by planktonic bacteria alone. This review will examine the presence of inflammatory factors during normal healing and those induced by contaminating bacteria, and will discuss how these differences may ultimately lead to nonunion. Specifically, this review will focus on the Th1/Th2/Th17 type inflammatory responses and how shifts in the balance of these responses during infection can lead to both ineffective clearance and disruption of fracture healing. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations.

In the past decade, next-generation sequencing ( NGS) technologies were improved by longer sequence reads and the development of genome databases and user-friendly pipelines for data analysis, all accessible at lower cost. This has generated an outburst of high-throughput data. The application of OMICS has provided more depth to existing hypotheses as well as new insights in the etiology of dental caries. For example, the determination of complete bacterial microbiomes of oral samples rather than selected species, together with oral metatranscriptome and metabolome analyses, supports the viewpoint of dysbiosis of the supragingival biofilms. In addition, metabolome studies have been instrumental in disclosing the contributions of major pathways for central carbon and amino acid metabolisms to biofilm pH homeostasis. New, often noncultured, oral streptococci have been identified, and their phenotypic characterization has revealed candidates for probiotic therapy. Although findings from OMICS research have been greatly informative, problems related to study design, data quality, integration, and reproducibility still need to be addressed.

Previously, we discovered that deletion of the Enterococcus faecalis rnjB gene significantly attenuates expression of a major virulence factor involved in enterococcal pathogenesis, the Ebp pili. In this work, we demonstrate that E. faecalis rnjB encodes an active RNase J2, and that the ribonuclease activity of RNase J2 is required for regulation of Ebp pili. To further investigate how rnjB affects E. faecalis gene expression on a global scale, we compared transcriptomes of the E. faecalis strain OG1RF with its isogenic rnjB deletion mutant (ΔrnjB). In addition to Ebp pili regulation, previously demonstrated to have a profound effect on the ability of E. faecalis to form biofilm or establish infection, we identified that rnjB regulates the expression of several other genes involved in bacterial virulence and fitness, including gls24 (a virulence factor important in stress response). We further demonstrated that the E. faecalis RNase J2 deletion mutant is more sensitive to bile salt and greatly attenuated in in vivo organ infection as determined by an IV-sublethal challenge infection mouse model, indicating that E. faecalis RNase J2 plays an important role in E. faecalis virulence.","authors":[{"name":"Peng Gao"},{"name":"Kenneth L Pinkston"},{"name":"Agathe Bourgogne"},{"name":"Barbara E Murray"},{"name":"Ambro van Hoof"},{"name":"Barrett R Harvey"}],"keywords":[]},"article271":{"pmid":"28384054","title":"Virulence of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 Is Influenced by the Catabolite Repression Control Protein Crc.","date":"2018-06-01","abs":"Pseudomonas syringae infects diverse plant species and is widely used as a model system in the study of effector function and the molecular basis of plant diseases.

The Crc (catabolite repression control) protein is a putative RNA-binding protein that regulates carbon metabolism as well as a number of other factors in the pseudomonads.

Interestingly, the crc mutant was more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that, in planta, the mutant may be sensitive to reactive oxygen species generated during pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Indeed, HR was further delayed when PTI-induced tissues were challenged with the crc mutant. The crc mutant did not elicit an altered PTI response in plants compared with the wild-type strain.

In contrast to Nl, Nm occasionally causes blood and/or meningitis infection with often fatal consequences. Here, we studied interactions between neisserial strains during biofilm formation. Fluorescent strains were engineered and analyzed for growth in single- and dual-strain biofilms with confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Different strains of diverse Neisseria species formed microcolonies of different sizes and morphologies. Pair-wise combinations of two invasive Nm strains and one Nm carrier isolate showed that these strains can coexist in spite of the fact that they produce toxins to combat congeners. This lack of competition was even observed when the biofilms were formed under nutrient limitation and can be explained by the observation that the separate microcolonies within mixed biofilms are mostly lineage specific. However, these microcolonies showed different levels of interaction. The coexistence of two strains was also observed in mixed biofilms of Nm and Nl strains. Inactivation of the autotransporter NalP, which prevents the release of the heparin-binding antigen NHBA and the α-peptide of IgA protease from the cell surface, and/or the production of autotransporter AutA increased interactions between microcolonies, as evidenced by close contacts between microcolonies on the substratum. Qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed an altered spatial distribution of each strain in mixed biofilms with consequences for the biomass, biofilm architecture and bacterial viability depending on the synthesis of NalP and AutA, the expression of which is prone to phase variation. Being in a consortium resulted in some cases in commensalism and cooperative behavior, which promoted attachment to the substratum or increased survival, possibly as result of the shared use of the biofilm matrix. We hypothesize that Nm strains can cooperate during host colonization, but, possibly, the different capacities of the microcolonies of each strain to resist the host's defenses limits the long-term coexistence of strains in the host.","authors":[{"name":"Jesús Pérez-Ortega"},{"name":"Antonio Rodríguez"},{"name":"Eduardo Ribes"},{"name":"Jan Tommassen"},{"name":"Jesús Arenas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AutA"},{"word":"IgA protease"},{"word":"NHBA"},{"word":"NalP"},{"word":"Neisseria"},{"word":"bacterial interactions"},{"word":"biofilms"}]},"article280":{"pmid":"28381402","title":"Transcutaneous Immunization with a Band-Aid Prevents Experimental Otitis Media in a Polymicrobial Model.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Otitis media (OM) is a common pediatric disease, and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is the predominant pathogen in chronic OM, recurrent OM, and OM associated with treatment failure.

It's genome sequence reveals the presence of a 5,403,026 bp chromosome. A total of 5226 putative protein-coding sequences, 16 rRNA, 120 tRNA, 8 ncRNAs, 58 non-protein coding genes, and 11 prophage regions were identified. Genome sequence comparisons between strain AB211 and other related environmental strains of B. aryabhattai, identified about 3558 genes conserved among all B. aryabhattai genomes analyzed. Most of the common genes involved in plant growth promotion activities were found to be present within core genes of all the genomes used for comparison, illustrating possible common plant growth promoting traits shared among all the strains of B. aryabhattai. Besides the core genes, some genes were exclusively identified in the genome of strain AB211. Functional annotation of the genes predicted in the strain AB211 revealed the presence of genes responsible for mineral phosphate solubilization, siderophores, acetoin, butanediol, exopolysaccharides, flagella biosynthesis, surface attachment/biofilm formation, and indole acetic acid production, most of which were experimentally verified in the present study. Genome analysis and experimental evidence suggested that AB211 has robust central carbohydrate metabolism implying that this bacterium can efficiently utilize the root exudates and other organic materials as an energy source. Genes for the production of peroxidases, catalases, and superoxide dismutases, that confer resistance to oxidative stresses in plants were identified in AB211 genome. Besides these, genes for heat shock tolerance, cold shock tolerance, glycine-betaine production, and antibiotic/heavy metal resistance that enable bacteria to survive biotic/abiotic stress were also identified.

Biofilm formation by Yersinia pestis is regulated by hmsHFRS genes (β-1, 6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine synthesis operon) in its flea vector and in vitro. However, the mechanism of biofilm formation in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that the LysR-type regulator RovM inversely regulates biofilm formation and motility in Y. pseudotuberculosis by acting as a transcriptional regulator of these two functions. RovM is strongly induced during growth in minimal media but strongly repressed in complex media. On one hand, RovM enhances bacterial motility by activating the expression of FlhDC, the master regulator of flagellar genes, via the recognition of an operator upstream of the flhDC promoter. On the other hand, RovM represses β-GlcNAc production under nutrition-limited conditions, negatively regulating hmsHFRS expression by directly binding to the -35 element of its promoter. Compared to wild-type bacteria, the rovM mutant established denser biofilms and caused more extensive mortality in mice and silkworm larvae. These results indicate that RovM acts as a molecular switch to coordinate the expression of genes involved in biofilm formation and motility in response to the availability of nutrients.","authors":[{"name":"Ruoxi Zhao"},{"name":"Yunhong Song"},{"name":"Qingyun Dai"},{"name":"Yiwen Kang"},{"name":"Junfeng Pan"},{"name":"Lingfang Zhu"},{"name":"Lei Zhang"},{"name":"Yao Wang"},{"name":"Xihui Shen"}],"keywords":[]},"article300":{"pmid":"28377583","title":"Preventing microbial biofilms on catheter tubes using ultrasonic guided waves.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Biofilms on indwelling tubes and medical prosthetic devices are among the leading causes of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

It has recently been hypothesized that aggregates are responsible for the high tolerance of chronic infections to host immune functions and antimicrobial therapies. Little is currently known regarding the mechanisms controlling aggregate formation and antimicrobial tolerance primarily because of the lack of robust, biologically relevant experimental systems that promote natural aggregate formation. Here, we developed an in vitro model based on chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. This model utilizes a synthetic sputum medium that readily promotes the formation of P. aeruginosa aggregates with sizes similar to those observed in human CF lung tissue. Using high-resolution imaging, we exploited this model to elucidate the life history of P. aeruginosa and the mechanisms that this bacterium utilizes to tolerate antimicrobials, specifically, bacteriophage. In the early stages of growth in synthetic sputum, planktonic cells form aggregates that increase in size over time by expansion. In later growth, migrant cells disperse from aggregates and colonize new areas, seeding new aggregates. When added simultaneously with phage, P. aeruginosa was readily killed and aggregates were unable to form. When added after initial aggregate formation, phage were unable to eliminate all of the aggregates because of exopolysaccharide production; however, seeding of new aggregates by dispersed migrants was inhibited. We propose a model in which aggregates provide a mechanism that allows P. aeruginosa to tolerate phage therapy during chronic infection without the need for genetic mutation.","authors":[{"name":"Sophie E Darch"},{"name":"Kasper N Kragh"},{"name":"Evelyn A Abbott"},{"name":"Thomas Bjarnsholt"},{"name":"James J Bull"},{"name":"Marvin Whiteley"}],"keywords":[]},"article302":{"pmid":"28377314","title":"Clarithromycin and N-acetylcysteine co-spray-dried powders for pulmonary drug delivery: A focus on drug solubility.","date":"2018-06-18","abs":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs are usually susceptible to Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization and this bacterium is resistant to immune system clearance and drug control.

The aim of this research was to design and develop a stable, portable, easy to use dry powder inhaler (DPI) for CF patients, able to release directly to the lung an association of macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin) and a mucolytic agent (N-Acetyl-Cysteine). Its effectiveness is based on the counteracting of the characteristics of P. aeruginosa infections in CF (lung bacterial adhesion to lung epithelium, biofilm formation and mucus viscosity) and the ability to let the antimicrobial drug exert their pharmacological action. A solution of these two drugs, without any excipients, was spray-dried to obtain respirable microparticles, characterized by aerodynamic diameters suitable for inhalation (<5.0μm). The morphology evaluation evidenced particles shape dependent on water content in the spray drying feeds, with wrinkled particles more evident with higher water content. Moreover, thanks to the presence of N-acetylcysteine which can interact with clarithromycin dimethyl-amino group, a consistent enhancement of drug solubility was obtained, compared to raw material and to the drug sprayed alone.

Microbial communities were shaped by high temperatures, salinity and lead at Toulon by but nutrients and DOC at Lorient. Coatings including pyrithione exhibited a significant decrease of their microbial densities except for nanoeukaryotes. Clustering of communities was mainly based on the surface type and secondly the site, whereas seasons appeared of less importance. The in-depth HTS revealed that γ- and α-proteobacteria, but also Bacteroidetes, dominated highly diversified bacterial communities with a relative low β-diversity. Sensitivity to biocides released by the tested antifouling coatings could be noticed at different taxonomic levels: the percentage of Bacteroidetes overall decreased with the presence of pyrithione, whereas the α/γ-proteobacteria ratio decreased at Toulon when increased at Lorient. Small diatom cells (Amphora and Navicula spp.) dominated on all surfaces, whereas site-specific sub-dominant taxa appeared clearly more sensitive to biocides.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are an important mechanism for the trapping and killing of pathogens that are resistant to phagocytosis. Biofilm formation can protect bacteria from being killed by phagocytes. Until now, there have only been a few studies that focused on the interactions between bacterial biofilms and NETs. SS2 in both a biofilm state and a planktonic cell state were incubated with phagocytes and NETs, and bacterial survival was assessed. DNase I and cytochalasin B were used to degrade NET DNA or suppress phagocytosis, respectively. Extracellular DNA was stained with impermeable fluorescent dye to quantify NET formation. Biofilm formation increased up to 6-fold in the presence of neutrophils, and biofilms were identified in murine tissue. Both planktonic and biofilm cells induced neutrophils chemotaxis to the infection site, with neutrophils increasing by 85.1 and 73.8%, respectively. The bacteria in biofilms were not phagocytized. The bactericidal efficacy of NETs on the biofilms and planktonic cells were equal; however, the biofilm extracellular matrix can inhibit NET release. Although biofilms inhibit NETs release, NETs appear to be an important mechanism to eliminate SS2 biofilms.

Here we define the complete secretome of A. nosocomialis strain M2 in minimal medium and demonstrate that pathogenic Acinetobacter species produce both a functional type I secretion system (T1SS) and a contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) system. Using bioinformatics, quantitative proteomics, and mutational analyses, we show that Acinetobacter uses its T1SS for exporting two putative T1SS effectors, an Repeats-in-Toxin (RTX)-serralysin-like toxin, and the biofilm-associated protein (Bap). Moreover, we found that mutation of any component of the T1SS system abrogated type VI secretion activity under nutrient-limited conditions, indicating a previously unrecognized cross-talk between these two systems. We also demonstrate that the Acinetobacter T1SS is required for biofilm formation. Last, we show that both A. nosocomialis and A. baumannii produce functioning CDI systems that mediate growth inhibition of sister cells lacking the cognate immunity protein. The Acinetobacter CDI systems are widely distributed across pathogenic Acinetobacter species, with many A. baumannii isolates harboring two distinct CDI systems.

Our results indicated that by introducing lysine, which could increase the number of positive charges, and by introducing tryptophan, which could increase the hydrophobicity, we could improve the antimicrobial activity of the peptides against multidrug-resistant strains. The introduction of d-amino acids significantly improved stability. Certain analogs demonstrated antibiofilm activities. In mechanistic studies, the analogs eradicated bacteria not just by interrupting the bacterial membranes, but also by linking to DNA, which was not impacted by known mechanisms of resistance. In a mouse model, certain analogs were able to significantly reduce the bacterial load.

However, the way in which full-length, membrane-bound receptors biochemically detect FA remains unclear. Here, we provide genetic, enzymological and biophysical evidences to demonstrate that in the phytopathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, a medium-chain FA diffusible signal factor (DSF) binds directly to the N-terminal, 22 amino acid-length sensor region of a receptor histidine kinase (HK), RpfC. The binding event remarkably activates RpfC autokinase activity by causing an allosteric change associated with the dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) and catalytic ATP-binding (CA) domains. Six residues were found essential for sensing DSF, especially those located in the region adjoining to the inner membrane of cells. Disrupting direct DSF-RpfC interaction caused deficiency in bacterial virulence and biofilm development. In addition, two amino acids within the juxtamembrane domain of RpfC, Leu172 and Ala178, are involved in the autoinhibition of the RpfC kinase activity. Replacements of them caused constitutive activation of RpfC-mediated signaling regardless of DSF stimulation.

Since as much as 80% of human bacterial infections are biofilm-associated, many researchers have begun investigating therapies that specifically target the biofilm architecture, thereby dispersing the microbial cells into their more vulnerable, planktonic mode of life. This review addresses the current state of research into medical biofilm dispersal. We focus on three major classes of dispersal agents: enzymes (including proteases, deoxyribonucleases, and glycoside hydrolases), antibiofilm peptides, and dispersal molecules (including dispersal signals, anti-matrix molecules, and sequestration molecules). Throughout our discussion, we provide detailed lists and summaries of some of the most prominent and extensively researched dispersal agents that have shown promise against the biofilms of clinically relevant pathogens, and we catalog which specific microorganisms they have been shown to be effective against.

The released vesicles are involved in the transfer of biologically active molecules that induce phenotypic changes in the recipient cells. The messages within the vesicles are delivered to coordinate diverse processes, including virulence factor expression, differentiation state and control of their population density. Importantly, production of such vesicles promotes pathogen survival, as it provides a secure means of pathogen-pathogen communication and an ability to manipulate host responses for their own benefits. This review highlights intriguing findings, which show the important role of EVs in the social activity of pathogens, within and in between their communities. We further present examples of how pathogens use EVs to alter host immune and non-immune responses.

It is limited by its insolubility in aqueous solutions; hence ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of Malaysian propolis were prepared. Both the extracts displayed antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties against Enterococcus faecalis, a common bacterium associated with hospital-acquired infections. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of propolis revealed the presence of flavonoids like kaempferol and pinocembrin. This study investigated the role of propolis developed into nanoparticles with chitosan for its antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties against E. faecalis. Bacteria that grow in a slimy layer of biofilm are resistant to penetration by antibacterial agents. The use of nanoparticles in medicine has received attention recently due to better bioavailability, enhanced penetrative capacity and improved efficacy. A chitosan-propolis nanoformulation was chosen based on ideal physicochemical properties such as particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, encapsulation efficiency and the rate of release of the active ingredients. This formulation inhibited E. faecalis biofilm formation and reduced the number of bacteria in the biofilm by ~90% at 200 μg/ml concentration. When tested on pre-formed biofilms, the formulation reduced bacterial number in the biofilm by ~40% and ~75% at 200 and 300 μg/ml, respectively. The formulation not only reduced bacterial numbers, but also physically disrupted the biofilm structure as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Treatment of biofilms with chitosan-propolis nanoparticles altered the expression of biofilm-associated genes in E. faecalis. The results of this study revealed that chitosan-propolis nanoformulation can be deemed as a potential anti-biofilm agent in resisting infections involving biofilm formation like chronic wounds and surgical site infections.","authors":[{"name":"Teik Hwa Ong"},{"name":"Ebenezer Chitra"},{"name":"Srinivasan Ramamurthy"},{"name":"Rajinikanth Paruvathanahalli Siddalingam"},{"name":"Kah Hay Yuen"},{"name":"Stephen Periathamby Ambu"},{"name":"Fabian Davamani"}],"keywords":[]},"article362":{"pmid":"28362723","title":"Chirality in microbial biofilms is mediated by close interactions between the cell surface and the substratum.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"From microbial biofilms to human migrations, spatial competition is central to the evolutionary history of many species.

Experiments with other microbial species show that chiral growth is found in other bacteria and exclude cell wall biosynthesis and anisotropic shape as the primary causes of chirality. Instead, intimate contact with the substratum is necessary for chirality.

However, natural antibacterial water chemistry has been applied in industrial cooling water systems for over 10 years to inhibit microorganisms with excellent results. The water chemistry method concentrates natural minerals in highly-softened water to produce elevated pH and dissolved solids, while maintaining low calcium and magnesium content. The method provides further benefits in water conservation, and generates a small volume of non-toxic natural salt concentrate for cost efficient separation and disposal if required. This report describes the antimicrobial effects of these chemistry modifications in the cooling water environment and the resultant collective inhibition of microbes, biofilm, and pathogen growth. This article also presents a novel perspective of parasitic microbiome functional relationships, including Trojan Protozoans and biofilms, and the function of polyvalent metal ions in the formation and inhibition of biofilms. Reducing global dependence on toxic antibacterial agents discharged to the environment is an emerging concern due to their impact on the natural microbiome, plants, animals and humans. Concurrently, scientists have concluded that discharge of antibacterial agents plays a key role in development of pathogen resistance to antimicrobials as well as antibiotics.

In this context, a nontargeted LC-MS metabolomics approach of marine biofilm-forming bacterial strains was developed. Four marine bacteria, Persicivirga (Nonlabens) mediterranea TC4 and TC7, Pseudoalteromonas lipolytica TC8, and Shewanella sp. TC11, were used as model organisms. The main objective was to search for some strain-specific bacterial metabolites and to determine how culture parameters (culture medium, growth phase, and mode of culture) may affect the cellular metabolism of each strain and thus the global interstrain metabolic discrimination. LC-MS profiling and statistical partial least-squares discriminant analyses showed that the four strains could be differentiated at the species level whatever the medium, the growth phase, or the mode of culture (planktonic vs biofilm). A MS/MS molecular network was subsequently built and allowed the identification of putative bacterial biomarkers.

The Tax transactivator and the p8 viral proteins are involved in virological synapse and nanotube formation respectively.HTLV-1 transcription from the viral promoter (i.e., LTR) requires the Tax protein that is absent from the viral particle and is expressed after productive infection. The present chapter focuses on a series of protocols used to quantify HTLV-1 de novo infection of target cells. These techniques do not discriminate between the different modes of transmission, but allow an accurate measure of productive infection.

First considered as a by-product of cell lysis, it soon became evident that OMVs are actively secreted from the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria. Accordingly, these small particles (~ 10-300 nm in diameter) consist mainly of OM components like phospholipids (PLs), OM proteins, and lipopolysaccharides or lipooligosaccharides. However, OMVs may also comprise periplasmic, inner membrane, or cytoplasmic components. Since the shedding of substantial amounts of OM material represents a significant energy cost to the bacterial cell, OMV production must have some vital biological functions for Gram-negative bacteria. Indeed, intense research on that topic revealed that OMVs play important roles in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis, ranging from secretion and delivery of biomolecules (for example, toxins, DNA, or quorum sensing molecules) over stress response and biofilm formation to immunomodulation and adherence to host cells. Only recently researchers have begun to elucidate the mechanistic aspects of OMV formation, but a general mechanism for the biogenesis of these vesicles is still lacking. Here we review the findings and implications of our recent study published in Nature Communications (Roier S, et al. (2016) Nat. Commun. 7:10515), where we propose a novel and highly conserved bacterial OMV biogenesis mechanism based on PL accumulation in the outer leaflet of the OM.

Such resistance can be detected as extensive reductions in phage ability to form plaques, that is, reduced efficiency of plating. Mechanisms include restriction-modification systems, CRISPR/Cas systems, and abortive infection systems. Alternatively, phages may be reduced in their vigor when infecting certain bacterial hosts, that is, with phages displaying smaller burst sizes or extended latent periods rather than being outright inactivated. It is well known, as well, that most phages poorly infect bacteria that are less metabolically active. Extracellular polymers such as biofilm matrix material also may at least slow phage penetration to bacterial surfaces. Here I suggest that such less-robust mechanisms of resistance to bacteriophages could serve bacteria by slowing phage propagation within bacterial biofilms, that is, delaying phage impact on multiple bacteria rather than necessarily outright preventing such impact. Related bacteria, ones that are relatively near to infected bacteria, e.g., roughly 10+ µm away, consequently may be able to escape from biofilms with greater likelihood via standard dissemination-initiating mechanisms including erosion from biofilm surfaces or seeding dispersal/central hollowing. That is, given localized areas of phage infection, so long as phage spread can be reduced in rate from initial points of contact with susceptible bacteria, then bacterial survival may be enhanced due to bacteria metaphorically running away to more phage-free locations. Delay mechanisms-to the extent that they are less specific in terms of what phages are targeted-collectively could represent broader bacterial strategies of phage resistance versus outright phage killing, the latter especially as require specific, evolved molecular recognition of phage presence. The potential for phage delay should be taken into account when developing protocols of phage-mediated biocontrol of biofilm bacteria, e.g., as during phage therapy of chronic bacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Stephen T Abedon"}],"keywords":[{"word":"abortive infection systems"},{"word":"bacteriophage therapy"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"central hollowing"},{"word":"dissemination"},{"word":"extracellular polymeric substances"},{"word":"microcolony"},{"word":"native dispersion"},{"word":"phage resistance"},{"word":"phage therapy"},{"word":"reduced infection vigor"},{"word":"seeding dispersal"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"28355587","title":"Exopolymeric substances from drinking water biofilms: Dynamics of production and relation with disinfection by products.","date":"2017-12-01","abs":"Exopolymeric substances (EPS) as an external matrix of biofilm could react with disinfectants in drinking water networks forming disinfection by-products (DBP).

The surfaces were prepared in a way that was compatible with the naturally occurring coating process in aquifers: deposition of colloidal particles from the aqueous phase. The biofilms were evaluated using a novel, in situ and non-invasive technique developed for this purpose. A manufactured polystyrene 12-well plate was used as the reference surface to be coated with synthesized minerals by deposition of their suspended particles through evaporation. Planktonic phase growth indicates that it is independent of the surface charge and hydrophobicity of the studied surfaces. The hydrophobic similarities failed to predict biofilm proliferation. Two of the three hydrophilic strains formed extensive biofilms on the minerals. The third one, Sph2, showed anomalies in contrast to the expected electrostatic attraction between the minerals and the cell surface. Further research showed how the solution's ionic strength affects Sph2 surface potential and shapes the extent of its biofilm formation; reducing the ionic strength from ≈200 mM to ≈20 mM led to a tenfold increase in the number of cells attached to hematite. This study provides a technique to evaluate biofilm formation on metal-oxide surfaces, under well-controlled conditions, using a simple yet reliable method. The findings also highlight that cell numbers in the planktonic phase do not necessarily show the extent of cell attachment, and thorough physicochemical characterization of bacterial strains, substrata and the aquifer medium is fundamental to successfully implementing any bioremediation projects.","authors":[{"name":"Hamid M Pouran"},{"name":"Steve A Banwart"},{"name":"Maria Romero-Gonzalez"}],"keywords":[]},"article397":{"pmid":"28352537","title":"Functional characterization of biomedical potential of biosurfactant produced by Lactobacillus helveticus.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Various lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been isolated and screened for biosurfactant production and their biomedical and food applications.
