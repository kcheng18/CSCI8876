Chronic mouse wounds models have been used to understand the underlying interactions between the microorganisms and the host. The models developed to date rely on the use of haired animals and terminal collection of wound tissue for determination of viable bacteria. While significant insight has been gained with these models, this experimental procedure requires a large number of animals and sampling is time consuming. We have developed a novel murine model that incorporates several optimal innovations to evaluate biofilm progression in chronic wounds: a) it utilizes hairless mice, eliminating the need for hair removal; b) applies pre-formed biofilms to the wounds allowing for the immediate evaluation of persistence and effect of these communities on host; c) monitors biofilm progression by quantifying light production by a genetically engineered bioluminescent strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, allowing real-time monitoring of the infection thus reducing the number of animals required per study. In this model, a single full-depth wound is produced on the back of STZ-induced diabetic hairless mice and inoculated with biofilms of the P. aeruginosa bioluminescent strain Xen 41. Light output from the wounds is recorded daily in an in vivo imaging system, allowing for in vivo and in situ rapid biofilm visualization and localization of biofilm bacteria within the wounds. This novel method is flexible as it can be used to study other microorganisms, including genetically engineered species and multi-species biofilms, and may be of special value in testing anti-biofilm strategies including antimicrobial occlusive dressings.","authors":[{"name":"Alessandra M Agostinho Hunt"},{"name":"Jacob A Gibson"},{"name":"Casandra L Larrivee"},{"name":"Sandra O'Reilly"},{"name":"Svetlana Navitskaya"},{"name":"Julia V Busik"},{"name":"Christopher M Waters"}],"keywords":[]},"article3":{"pmid":"29053421","title":"Development of a Novel Herbal Formulation To Inhibit Biofilm Formation in Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Vibrio cholerae, a causative agent of the waterborne disease cholera, still threatens a large proportion of world's population. The role of biofilm formation in V. cholerae pathogenesis is well established, as it provides the bacterium enhanced tolerance to antimicrobial agents and increased transmission. In the present study, four medicinal plants used in traditional medicines with antidiarrheal properties were evaluated for its antibiofilm activity. Methanol extracts of these plants (Centella asiatica, Elephantopus scaber, Camellia sinensis, and Holarrhena antidysenterica) showed promising antibiofilm activity against V. cholerae with crystal violet and air-liquid interface coverslip assays. Results revealed that C. asiatica, E. scaber, C. sinensis, and H. antidysenterica extracts significantly inhibited biofilm formation by approximately 75, 76, 78, and 55% at concentrations of 3, 2, 1, and 0.6 mg/mL, respectively. A promising antibiofilm activity of ∼89% inhibition at 1.5 mg/mL concentration was observed when a combination of E. scaber and C. sinensis was used. The herbal extracts were thermostable at a temperature range of 40 to 100°C. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay revealed that the viability of bacteria was not affected by treatment with these plant extracts. Gene expression studies revealed that extracts of H. antidysenterica leaf, H. antidysenterica bark, and the whole plant of E. scaber and C. asiatica down-regulate aphA or aphB, the major regulator genes modulating both virulence and biofilm formation.

Thus, 10 strains of Salmonella Enteritidis were used to test cross-contamination from poultry to the cutting boards and from thereon to cucumbers.

In the presence of biofilm, the recovery of salmonellae was 100%, even after washing. Biofilm formation occurred more on wood (60%) and plastic (40%) than glass (10%) boards, demonstrating that bacteria adhered more to a hydrophobic material.

These in vivo biochemistry experiments are enabled by our second-generation RNA-based fluorescent (RBF) biosensors, which exhibit high fluorescence turn-on in response to cyclic di-GMP. Specifically, we demonstrate that intracellular levels of cyclic di-GMP in Escherichia coli are repressed with excess zinc, but not with other divalent metals. Furthermore, in both flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy setups, we monitor the dynamic increase in cellular cyclic di-GMP levels upon zinc depletion and show that this response is due to de-repression of the endogenous diguanylate cyclase DgcZ. In the presence of zinc, cells exhibit enhanced cell motility and increased sensitivity to antibiotics due to inhibited biofilm formation. Taken together, these results showcase the application of RBF biosensors in visualizing single-cell dynamic changes in cyclic di-GMP signaling in direct response to environmental cues such as zinc and highlight our ability to assess whether observed phenotypes are related to specific signaling enzymes and pathways.","authors":[{"name":"Jongchan Yeo"},{"name":"Andrew B Dippel"},{"name":"Xin C Wang"},{"name":"Ming C Hammond"}],"keywords":[]},"article7":{"pmid":"29052931","title":"Far-red light promotes biofilm formation in the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina.","date":"2019-05-09","abs":"Light quantity and quality promotes ecological-niche differentiation of photosynthetic organisms.

Previous in vitro assays have shown that B25 has protease, glucanase, and chitinase activities and siderophores production; however, specific mechanisms by which B25 controls Fv are still unknown. To determine the genetic traits involved in biocontrol, B25 genome was sequenced and analyzed. B25 genome is composed of 5,113,413 bp and 5251 coding genes. A multilocus phylogenetic analysis (MLPA) suggests that B25 is closely related to the Bacillus cereus group and a high percentage (70-75%) of the genetic information is conserved between B25 and related strains, which include most of the genes associated to fungal antagonism. Some of these genes are shared with some biocontrol agents of the Bacillus genus and less with Pseudomonas and Serratia strains. We performed a genomic comparison between B25 and five Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas and Serratia strains. B25 contains genes involved in a wide variety of antagonistic mechanisms including chitinases, glycoside hydrolases, siderophores, antibiotics, and biofilm production that could be implicated in root colonization. Also, 24 genomic islands and 3 CRISPR sequences were identified in the B25 genome. This is the first comparative genome analysis between strains belonging to the B. cereus group and biocontrol agents of phytopathogenic fungi.

In root surfaces, the demineralization is accompanied by microbial invasion of the cementum and dentin resulting in a pulpo-dentinal defense reaction.

The formation of root surface biofilms is influenced by the availability and composition of saliva and gingival crevicular fluid; they provide components for the conditioning film (acquired root surface pellicle) and also act as a source of nutrients. The early bacterial colonizers of the root surface are similar to those found on the enamel, and Gram-positive species such as Streptococcus sanguinis, S. oralis, S. mitis, and Actinomyces species predominate. The root surface has a lower mineral and higher organic content than enamel, and so is more vulnerable to demineralization. The characterization of the microbiota associated with root surface lesions is still ongoing. Traditional culture-based studies have implicated species such as mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and Actinomyces species, while molecular-based studies have provided evidence for a more complex microbiota with many Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria being detected in addition to the more conventional cariogenic organisms. Ecological concepts have been applied to explain the microbial etiology of root caries. The acidic environment generated from the fermentation of dietary sugars selects saccharolytic bacteria that can preferentially grow and metabolize under low pH conditions, and then proteolytic Gram-negative species are selected when the dentin is exposed and collagen and other proteins become accessible to be catabolized.

In this study we investigated the effect of near streambed turbulence in terms of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) on the composition and architecture of biofilms matured in two mountainous streams differing in dissolved nutrient concentrations. Over both streams, TKE significantly explained 7% and 8% of the variability in biofilm composition and architecture, respectively. However, effects were more pronounced in the nutrient richer stream, where TKE significantly explained 12% and 3% of the variability in biofilm composition and architecture, respectively. While at lower nutrient concentrations seasonally varying factors such as stoichiometry of dissolved nutrients (N/P ratio) and light were more important and explained 41% and 6% of the variability in biofilm composition and architecture, respectively. Specific biofilm features such as elongated ripples and streamers, which were observed in response to the uniform and unidirectional flow in experimental settings, were not observed. Microbial biovolume and surface area covered by the biofilm canopy increased with TKE, while biofilm thickness and porosity where not affected or decreased. These findings indicate that under natural flows where near bed flow velocities and turbulence intensities fluctuate with time and space, biofilms became more compact. They spread uniformly on the mineral surface as a film of densely packed coccoid cells appearing like cobblestone pavement. The compact growth of biofilms seemed to be advantageous for resisting hydrodynamic shear forces in order to avoid displacement.

In the present work, we introduce a new chemometric approach to identify heavily weathered and contaminated microplastics without any cleaning. The main idea of this concept is based on an automated curve fitting of most relevant vibrational bands to calculate a highly characteristic fingerprint that contains all vibrational band area ratios. This new data set will be used to estimate the similarity of samples and reference standards for identification. A total of 300 individual naturally weathered plastic particles were measured with Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection mode (FT-IR ATR) and identified successfully with the new method. To that end, all samples were compared with a selection of common reference plastics and bio polymers.

Norspermidine is among the environmental signals that positively regulate Vibrio cholerae biofilm formation. The NspS/MbaA signaling complex detects extracellular norspermidine and mediates the response to this polyamine. Norspermidine binding to the NspS periplasmic binding protein is thought to inhibit the phosphodiesterase activity of MbaA, increasing levels of the biofilm-promoting second messenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate, thus enhancing biofilm formation. V. cholerae can also synthesize norspermidine using the enzyme NspC as well as import it from the environment. Deletion of the nspC gene was shown to reduce accumulation of bacteria in biofilms, leading to the conclusion that intracellular norspermidine is also a positive regulator of biofilm formation. Because V. cholerae uses norspermidine to synthesize the siderophore vibriobactin it is possible that intracellular norspermidine is required to obtain sufficient amounts of iron, which is also necessary for robust biofilm formation. The objective of this study was to assess the relative contributions of intracellular and extracellular norspermidine to the regulation of biofilm formation in V. cholerae. We show the biofilm defect of norspermidine synthesis mutants does not result from an inability to produce vibriobactin as vibriobactin synthesis mutants do not have diminished biofilm forming abilities. Furthermore, our work shows that extracellular, but not intracellular norspermidine, is mainly responsible for promoting biofilm formation. We establish that the NspS/MbaA signaling complex is the dominant mediator of biofilm formation in response to extracellular norspermidine, rather than norspermidine synthesized by NspC or imported into the cell.","authors":[{"name":"Caitlin K Wotanis"},{"name":"William P Brennan"},{"name":"Anthony D Angotti"},{"name":"Elizabeth A Villa"},{"name":"Josiah P Zayner"},{"name":"Alexandra N Mozina"},{"name":"Alexandria C Rutkovsky"},{"name":"Richard C Sobe"},{"name":"Whitney G Bond"},{"name":"Ece Karatan"}],"keywords":[]},"article34":{"pmid":"29044318","title":"Antibiotic activity of Plectranthus ornatus Codd., a Traditional Medicinal Plant.","date":"2018-05-30","abs":"The dichloromethane extract of Plectranthus ornatus Codd., a tradicional medicinal plant, showed antibiotic activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.4 mg.mL-1 and 100 percent of biofilm inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from animals with mastitis infections.

Two T1SS cargo proteins were identified as likely biofilm structural proteins, and the presence of at least one (with either being sufficient) was shown to be required for biofilm formation. Antibodies specific to these biofilm structural proteins confirmed that DVU1017, and thus the T1SS, is essential for localization of these adhesion proteins on the cell surface. We propose that DVU1017 is a member of the lapB category of microbial surface proteins because of its phenotypic similarity to the adhesin export system described for biofilm formation in the environmental pseudomonads.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) revealed that among all microbial and chronic infections, 65% and 80%, respectively, are associated with biofilm formation. The process of biofilm formation consists of many steps, starting with attachment to a living or non-living surface that will lead to formation of micro-colony, giving rise to three-dimensional structures and ending up, after maturation, with detachment. During formation of biofilm several species of bacteria communicate with one another, employing quorum sensing. In general, bacterial biofilms show resistance against human immune system, as well as against antibiotics.

METHODS ATS-2015, an artificial test soil containing 5-8 Log10 colony-forming units (CFU) of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was used to form biofilm in polytetrafluroethylene channels overnight on 5 successive days. Each successive day, full pump-assisted cleaning using bristle brushes or pull-through devices in combination with enzymatic or nonenzymatic detergents followed by fully automated endoscope reprocessor disinfection using peracetic acid was performed. Residuals were visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Destructive testing was used to assess expected cutoffs for adenosine triphosphate (ATP; <200 relative light units), protein (<2 µg/cm2), and viable bacteria count (0 CFU). RESULTS Protein residuals were above 2 µg/cm2, but ATP residuals were <200 relative light units for all methods tested. Only when enzymatic cleaner was used for cleaning were there no viable bacteria detected after disinfection irrespective of whether bristle brushes or pull-through devices were used. SEM revealed that some residual debris remained after all reprocessing methods, but more residuals were detected when a nonenzymatic detergent was used. CONCLUSIONS Surviving E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa were only detected when the non-enzymatic detergent was used, emphasizing the importance of the detergent used for endoscope channel reprocessing.

The ability of P. aeruginosa cells or their extracellular products produced during planktonic or biofilm growth to affect A. fumigatus biofilm metabolism or planktonic A. fumigatus growth was studied in agar and liquid assays using conidia or hyphae. Four mutants, the pvdD pchE, pvdD, lasR rhlR, and lasR mutants, were shown to be defective in various assays. This suggested the P. aeruginosa siderophore pyoverdine as the key inhibitory molecule, although additional quorum sensing-regulated factors likely contribute to the deficiency of the latter two mutants. Studies of pure pyoverdine substantiated these conclusions and included the restoration of inhibition by the pyoverdine deletion mutants. A correlation between the concentration of pyoverdine produced and antifungal activity was also observed in clinical P. aeruginosa isolates derived from lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.

Both attachment and detachment are critical to bacterial environmental survival, pathogenesis and disease transmission. However, the factors that promote detachment are less understood. In this study, we examine the role of flagellar motility and hemagglutinin/protease (HapA) in vibrio detachment from a non-degradable abiotic surface and from the suckling mouse intestine. Flagellar motility facilitated V. cholerae detachment from abiotic surfaces. HapA had no effect on the stability of biofilms formed on abiotic surfaces despite representing >50% of the proteolytic activity present in the extracellular matrix. We developed a balanced lethal plasmid system to increase the bacterial cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) pool late in infection, a condition that represses motility and HapA expression. Increasing the c-di-GMP pool enhanced V. cholerae colonization of the suckling mouse intestine. The c-di-GMP effect was fully abolished in hapA isogenic mutants.

However, it is unknown why these STs can emerge as highly prevalent clones in bovine dairy farms. Here, to determine if a variety of virulence characteristics were associated with these highly prevalent STs, the molecular and virulence characterization of 116 strains isolated from bovine, human, fish and environment were analyzed. Our data showed that all bovine-adapted strains could be assigned to capsular genotype Ia or II, and carried pilus island 2b, and lactose operon. Importantly, we demonstrated that the growth ability in milk, biofilm formation ability and adhesion ability to bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) were significantly higher for all bovine-adapted strains compared to strains from other origins. Additionally, ST103 and ST568 strains exhibited significantly higher hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity than ST67 strains. In conclusion, our study provides substantial evidence for the hypothesis that the virulence characteristics including efficient growth in milk, elevated biofilm formation ability, together with strong adhesion ability might have favored the high prevalence of the STs in the bovine environment, whereas the hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity were not the crucial characteristics.","authors":[{"name":"Maoda Pang"},{"name":"Lichang Sun"},{"name":"Tao He"},{"name":"Hongdu Bao"},{"name":"Lili Zhang"},{"name":"Yan Zhou"},{"name":"Hui Zhang"},{"name":"Ruicheng Wei"},{"name":"Yongjie Liu"},{"name":"Ran Wang"}],"keywords":[]},"article59":{"pmid":"29037147","title":"De novo assembly of genomes from long sequence reads reveals uncharted territories of Propionibacterium freudenreichii.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Propionibacterium freudenreichii is an industrially important bacterium granted the Generally Recognized as Safe (the GRAS) status, due to its long safe use in food bioprocesses.

A total of 18 samples from equine, feline and canine origin were characterized. A sample from canine otitis media produced a phenotypically heterogeneous pair of P. aeruginosa isolates, 42121A and 42121B, which during growth on culture medium respectively exhibited hyper dye-binding small colony morphology and wild-type phenotypes.

Low fluctuations in biofilm compositions were observed across distinct oxygen environments, with dual-species biofilms exhibiting similar relative proportions and P. aeruginosa and/or D. pigrum populations dominating three-species consortia. Once exposed to antibiotics, biofilms displayed high resistance profiles, and microbial compositions, distributions, and microbial interactions significantly challenged. The antibiotic/oxygen environment supported such fluctuations, which enhanced for three-species communities. In conclusion, antibiotic therapy hugely disturbed CF communities' dynamics, inducing significant compositional changes on multispecies consortia. Clearly, multiple perturbations may disturb this dynamic, giving rise to various microbiological scenarios in vivo, and affecting disease phenotype.

Copper is often employed to control pathogens in agriculture and is increasingly used in healthcare facilities, but mechanisms mediating tolerance of L. monocytogenes to copper remain poorly understood. A mariner-based mutant library of L. monocytogenes 2011L-2858, implicated in the 2011 listeriosis outbreak via whole cantaloupe, was screened for growth at sublethal levels of copper yielding mutant G2B4 with decreased copper tolerance. The transposon was localized in pbp4 (lmo2229 homolog), encoding a penicillin-binding protein (PBP). In addition to reduced copper tolerance, G2B4 exhibited increased susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics, reduced biofilm formation and reduced virulence in the Galleria mellonella model. Mutant phenotypes were fully restored upon genetic complementation of G2B4 with intact pbp4. Findings provide the first evidence for the role of a PBP in copper tolerance of L. monocytogenes and suggest that pbp4 may be a suitable target to enable the use of lower levels of copper or enhance the effectiveness of levels currently in use.

Periodontitis (inflammation with corresponding loss of attachment) affects 40-50% of adults. Recently, members of the Triggering Receptor on Myeloid Cell (TREM) family have been studied to determine their relationship to these diseases. Areas covered: TREM-1 is a receptor expressed on the surface of PMNs, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and keratinocytes upregulated in the presence of periodontal inflammation. TREM-1 expression can be upregulated by oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis that can be abrogated by a sub-antimicrobial dose of doxycycline. When cleaved from the cell surface, a soluble form of TREM-1 (sTREM-1) can be used as a biomarker of inflammation and might also provide a link between oral and systemic inflammation. While less understood, TREM-2 has a role in osteoclastogenesis which could contribute to the alveolar bone destruction seen in more advanced periodontitis. Expert commentary: Additional studies to simulate biofilm microenvironment in TREM research are warranted.

However, the inhibition rate of Vrc-NLCs at lower concentrations was significantly higher than that of Vrc during planktonic growth in C. albicans in yeast-extract peptone dextrose medium. Surprisingly, Vrc-NLCs treatment reduced cell density in biofilm growth in C. albicans and induced more switches form hyphal cells to yeast cells compared with Vrc treatment. In conclusion, Vrc-NLCs maintain antifungal activity of Vrc and increase antifungal drug-delivery efficiency to C. albicans. Therefore, Vrc-NLCs will greatly contribute to the treatment of infectious diseases caused by C. albicans.","authors":[{"name":"Baocheng Tian"},{"name":"Qi Yan"},{"name":"Juan Wang"},{"name":"Chen Ding"},{"name":"Sixiang Sai"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"antifungal activity"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"nanostructured lipid carriers"},{"word":"voriconazole"}]},"article97":{"pmid":"29026191","title":"Mechanisms involved in the triggering of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by Candida glabrata during planktonic and biofilm growth.","date":"2019-07-01","abs":"Candida spp. adhere to medical devices, such as catheters, forming drug-tolerant biofilms that resist killing by the immune system. Little is known about how C. glabrata, an emerging pathogen, resists attack by phagocytes. Here we show that upon encounter with planktonic (non-biofilm) C. glabrata, human neutrophils initially phagocytose the yeast and subsequently release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), complexes of DNA, histones, and proteins capable of inhibiting fungal growth and dissemination. When exposed to C. glabrata biofilms, neutrophils also release NETs, but significantly fewer than in response to planktonic cells. Impaired killing of biofilm parallels the decrease in NET production. Compared to biofilm, neutrophils generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when presented with planktonic organisms, and pharmacologic inhibition of NADPH-oxidase partially impairs NET production. In contrast, inhibition of phagocytosis nearly completely blocks NET release to both biofilm and planktonic organisms. Imaging of the host response to C. glabrata in a rat vascular model of infection supports a role for NET release in vivo. Taken together, these findings show that C. glabrata triggers NET release. The diminished NET response to C. glabrata biofilms likely contributes to the resilience of these structured communities to host defenses.","authors":[{"name":"Chad J Johnson"},{"name":"John F Kernien"},{"name":"Amanda R Hoyer"},{"name":"Jeniel E Nett"}],"keywords":[]},"article98":{"pmid":"29025936","title":"Complete Genome Sequence of Super Biofilm-Elaborating Staphylococcus aureus Isolated in Japan.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus JP080, previously named TF2758, is a clinical isolate from an atheroma and a super biofilm-elaborating strain whose biofilm elaboration is dependent solely on polysaccharide poly-N-acetylglucosamine/polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PNAG/PIA).

In this work, we show differences between some physicochemical properties of biofilms in mono- and multi-species, formed by bacteria from clinical samples of infected chronic wounds. Of the most prevalent bacteria in wounds, two mono- and one multi-species biofilms were developed in vitro by Drip Flow Reactor: one biofilm was developed by S. aureus, other by P. aeruginosa, and a third one by the mix of both strains. With these biofilms, we determined microbial growth by plate counting, and their physicochemical characterization by Atomic Force Microscopy, Raman Micro-Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. We found that the viability of S. aureus was less than P. aeruginosa in multi-species biofilm. However, the adhesion force of S. aureus is much higher than that of P. aeruginosa, but it decreased while that of P. aeruginosa increased in the multi-species biofilm. In addition, we found free pyrimidines functional groups in the P. aeruginosa biofilm and its mix with S. aureus. Surprisingly, each bacterium alone formed single layer biofilms, while the mix bacteria formed a multilayer biofilm at the same observation time.

However, despite their widespread clinical application, these implants are susceptible to failure induced by microbial infection due to bacterial biofilm formation. Immobilization of chimeric peptides with antibacterial properties on the Ti surface may be a promising antimicrobial approach to inhibit biofilm formation. Here, chimeric peptides were designed by connecting three sequences (hBD-3-1/2/3) derived from human β-defensin-3 (hBD-3) with Ti-binding peptide-l (TBP-l: RKLPDAGPMHTW) via a triple glycine (G) linker to modify Ti surfaces. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the properties of individual domains of the chimeric peptides were evaluated for their binding activity toward the Ti surface. The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm efficacy of the peptides against initial settlers, Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii) and Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis), was evaluated with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to study cell membrane changes and the underlying antimicrobial mechanism. Compared with the other two peptides, TBP-1-GGG-hBD3-3 presented stronger antibacterial activity and remained stable in saliva and serum. Therefore, it was chosen as the best candidate to modify Ti surfaces in this study. This peptide inhibited the growth of initial streptococci and biofilm formation on Ti surfaces with no cytotoxicity to MC3T3-E1 cells. Disruption of the integrity of bacterial membranes and decreased expression of adhesion protein genes from S. gordonii revealed aspects of the antibacterial mechanism of TBP-1-GGG-hBD3-3.

However, recent trends indicate that natural teeth are lost later in life. Functional decline and age-related pathologies have to be considered in oral health care for this vulnerable population. Retaining and restoring teeth and oral function in elders is important. Tooth loss significantly impairs masticatory performance, which cannot be fully restored by prosthodontic means. Hence an unconscious change in food intake occurs, often involving malnutrition and withdrawal from common meals. Poor oral appearance and bad breath may further impede social activities. Although a chewing activity may be beneficial for cognitive function, natural teeth can present a considerable risk for fragile elders, in whom aspiration of biofilm can lead to pneumonia and death. The presence of natural teeth is also correlated with higher life expectancy, but socio-economic confounding factors have to be considered. When evaluating oral health in the elderly population, standards and priorities for reporting oral health outcome measures have to be defined. Anatomical indicators such as the number of natural teeth or the presence of prostheses might be one option for reporting. However, functional indicators such as masticatory performance and patient-centred outcome measures may be more relevant.

Exopolysaccharides (EPS) provide a matrix scaffold and an abundance of primary binding sites within biofilms. The role of EPS in binding calcium in cariogenic biofilms is only partially understood. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the calcium dissolution rates and calcium tolerance of caries-associated bacteria and yeast as well as to examine the properties of EPS to quantify its binding affinity for dissolved calcium. Calcium dissolution was measured by dissolution zones on Pikovskaya's agar. Calcium tolerance was assessed by isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) by adding CaCl2 to the bacterial cultures. Acid-base titration and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to identify possible functional groups responsible for calcium binding, which was assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Lactobacillus spp. and mutans streptococci demonstrated calcium dissolution in the presence of different carbohydrates. All strains that demonstrated high dissolution rates also revealed higher rates of calcium tolerance by IMC. In addition, acidic functional groups were predominantly identified as possible binding sites for calcium ions by acid-base titration and FTIR. Finally, ITC revealed EPS to have a higher binding affinity for calcium compared, for example, to lactic acid. In conclusion, this study illustrates the role of EPS in terms of the calcium tolerance of cariogenic microbiota by determining the ability of EPS to control free calcium concentrations within the biofilms as a self-regulating mode of action in the pathogenesis of dental caries.","authors":[{"name":"Monika Astasov-Frauenhoffer"},{"name":"Muth M Varenganayil"},{"name":"Alan W Decho"},{"name":"Tuomas Waltimo"},{"name":"Olivier Braissant"}],"keywords":[]},"article111":{"pmid":"29023454","title":"Antifungal defense of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is mediated by blocking adhesion and nutrient depletion.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Candida albicans is an inhabitant of mucosal surfaces in healthy individuals but also the most common cause of fungal nosocomial blood stream infections, associated with high morbidity and mortality.

Instead, transcriptional profiling using RNA-Seq indicated dramatic metabolic reprogramming of C. albicans. Additionally, LGG had a significant impact on major virulence attributes, including adhesion, invasion, and hyphal extension, whose reduction, consequently, prevented epithelial damage. This was accompanied by glucose depletion and repression of ergosterol synthesis, caused by LGG, but also due to blocked adhesion sites.

L. plantarum CIRM653 activity against K. pneumoniae was also assessed in a murine intestinal colonisation model: a constant faecal pathogen burden was observed, as against a gradual decrease in the control group. These results reveal that an in vitro a priori attracting anti-biofilm activity of Lactobacillus might be counterbalanced by an in vivo behaviour in a complex microbiota environment with potential deleterious dispersal of highly adherent K. pneumoniae cells, raising the question of the accuracy of in vitro assays in screening of beneficial microbes.","authors":[{"name":"R Lagrafeuille"},{"name":"S Miquel"},{"name":"D Balestrino"},{"name":"M Vareille-Delarbre"},{"name":"F Chain"},{"name":"P Langella"},{"name":"C Forestier"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"intestinal colonisation"},{"word":"lactobacilli"}]},"article118":{"pmid":"29022243","title":"Pyrosequencing analysis of source water switch and sulfate-induced bacterial community transformation in simulated drinking water distribution pipes.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Inter-basin water transfer and source water switching will be increasingly launched due to significant population increase and the shortage of the local water resources in cities around the world.

One way to cope with various stress-related situations is through the activation of the stringent stress response pathway. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa this pathway is controlled and coordinated by the activity of the RelA and SpoT enzymes that metabolize the small nucleotide secondary messenger molecule (p)ppGpp. Intracellular ppGpp concentrations are crucial in mediating adaptive responses and virulence. Targeting this cellular stress response has recently been the focus of an alternative approach to fight antibiotic resistant bacteria. Here, we examined the role of the stringent response in the virulence of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and the Liverpool epidemic strain LESB58. A ΔrelA/ΔspoT double mutant showed decreased cytotoxicity toward human epithelial cells, exhibited reduced hemolytic activity, and caused down-regulation of the expression of the alkaline protease aprA gene in stringent response mutants grown on blood agar plates. Promoter fusions of relA or spoT to a bioluminescence reporter gene revealed that both genes were expressed during the formation of cutaneous abscesses in mice. Intriguingly, virulence was attenuated in vivo by the ΔrelA/ΔspoT double mutant, but not the relA mutant nor the ΔrelA/ΔspoT complemented with either gene. Treatment of a cutaneous P. aeruginosa PAO1 infection with anti-biofilm peptides increased animal welfare, decreased dermonecrotic lesion sizes, and reduced bacterial numbers recovered from abscesses, resembling the phenotype of the ΔrelA/ΔspoT infection. It was previously demonstrated by our lab that ppGpp could be targeted by synthetic peptides; here we demonstrated that spoT promoter activity was suppressed during cutaneous abscess formation by treatment with peptides DJK-5 and 1018, and that a peptide-treated relA complemented stringent response double mutant strain exhibited reduced peptide susceptibility. Overall these data strongly indicated that synthetic peptides target the P. aeruginosa stringent response in vivo and thus offer a promising novel therapeutic approach.","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Pletzer"},{"name":"Heidi Wolfmeier"},{"name":"Manjeet Bains"},{"name":"Robert E W Hancock"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-biofilm peptides"},{"word":"Pseudomonas"},{"word":"Stringent response"},{"word":"mouse abscess infections"}]},"article121":{"pmid":"29021783","title":"Extracellular Polymeric Substance Production and Aggregated Bacteria Colonization Influence the Competition of Microbes in Biofilms.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The production of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) is important for the survival of biofilms.

Strikingly, F. nucleatum achieves virulence in the absence of large, multiprotein secretion systems (Types I, II, III, IV, and VI), which are widely used by Gram-negative bacteria for pathogenesis. By contrast, F. nucleatum strains contain genomic expansions of Type V secreted effectors (autotransporters) that are critical for host cell adherence, invasion, and biofilm formation. Here, we present the first characterization of an F. nucleatum Type Vd phospholipase class A1 autotransporter (strain ATCC 25586, gene FN1704) that we hereby rename Fusobacterium phospholipase autotransporter (FplA). Biochemical analysis of multiple Fusobacterium strains revealed that FplA is expressed as a full-length 85-kDa outer membrane-embedded protein or as a truncated phospholipase domain that remains associated with the outer membrane. Whereas the role of Type Vd secretion in bacteria remains unidentified, we show that FplA binds with high affinity to host phosphoinositide-signaling lipids, revealing a potential role for this enzyme in establishing an F. nucleatum intracellular niche. To further analyze the role of FplA, we developed an fplA gene knock-out strain, which will guide future in vivo studies to determine its potential role in F. nucleatum pathogenesis. In summary, using recombinant FplA constructs, we have identified a biochemical toolbox that includes lipid substrates for enzymatic assays, potent inhibitors, and chemical probes to detect, track, and characterize the role of Type Vd secreted phospholipases in Gram-negative bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Michael A Casasanta"},{"name":"Christopher C Yoo"},{"name":"Hans B Smith"},{"name":"Alison J Duncan"},{"name":"Kyla Cochrane"},{"name":"Ann C Varano"},{"name":"Emma Allen-Vercoe"},{"name":"Daniel J Slade"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Fusobacterium"},{"word":"autotransporter"},{"word":"chemical biology"},{"word":"colorectal cancer"},{"word":"host-pathogen interaction"},{"word":"phospholipase A"},{"word":"protein secretion"}]},"article124":{"pmid":"29021250","title":"Electrostatic lipid-protein interactions sequester the curli amyloid fold on the lipopolysaccharide membrane surface.","date":"2018-12-01","abs":"Curli is a functional amyloid protein in the extracellular matrix of enteric Gram-negative bacteria.

Oligomeric intermediates that accumulate during the lag phase of amyloidogenesis are generally toxic, but the underlying mechanism by which bacterial cells overcome this toxicity during curli assembly at the surface remains elusive. Here, we elucidated the mechanism of curli amyloidogenesis and provide molecular insights into the strategy by which bacteria can potentially bypass the detrimental consequences of toxic amyloid intermediates. Using a diverse range of biochemical and biophysical tools involving circular dichroism, fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy imaging, we characterized the molecular basis of the interaction of CsgB with a membrane-mimetic anionic surfactant as well as with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) constituting the outer leaflet of Gram-negative bacteria. Aggregation studies revealed that the electrostatic interaction of the positively charged C-terminal region of the protein with a negatively charged head group of surfactant/LPS promotes a protein-protein interaction that results in facile amyloid formation without a detectable lag phase. We also show that CsgB, in the presence of surfactant/LPS, accelerates the fibrillation rate of CsgA by circumventing the lag phase during nucleation. Our findings suggest that the electrostatic interactions between lipid and protein molecules play a pivotal role in efficiently sequestering the amyloid fold of curli on the membrane surface without significant accumulation of toxic oligomeric intermediates.","authors":[{"name":"Hema M Swasthi"},{"name":"Samrat Mukhopadhyay"}],"keywords":[{"word":"amyloid"},{"word":"atomic force microscopy (AFM)"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"fibril"},{"word":"fluorescence"},{"word":"lipopolysaccharide (LPS)"},{"word":"protein aggregation"},{"word":"protein misfolding"}]},"article125":{"pmid":"29020439","title":"Nonleachable Imidazolium-Incorporated Composite for Disruption of Bacterial Clustering, Exopolysaccharide-Matrix Assembly, and Enhanced Biofilm Removal.","date":"2019-01-10","abs":"Surface-grown bacteria and production of an extracellular polymeric matrix modulate the assembly of highly cohesive and firmly attached biofilms, making them difficult to remove from solid surfaces.

Low-dose inclusion of imidazolium moiety (∼2 wt %) resulted in bioactivity with minimal cytotoxicity without compromising mechanical integrity of the restorative material. The antibiofilm properties of ABR-MC were assessed using an exopolysaccharide-matrix-producing (EPS-matrix-producing) oral pathogen (Streptococcus mutans) in an experimental biofilm model. Using high-resolution confocal fluorescence imaging and biophysical methods, we observed remarkable disruption of bacterial accumulation and defective 3D matrix structure on the surface of ABR-MC. Specifically, the antibacterial composite impaired the ability of S. mutans to form organized bacterial clusters on the surface, resulting in altered biofilm architecture with sparse cell accumulation and reduced amounts of EPS matrix (versus control composite). Biofilm topology analyses on the control composite revealed a highly organized and weblike EPS structure that tethers the bacterial clusters to each other and to the surface, forming a highly cohesive unit. In contrast, such a structured matrix was absent on the surface of ABR-MC with mostly sparse and amorphous EPS, indicating disruption in the biofilm physical stability. Consistent with lack of structural organization, the defective biofilm on the surface of ABR-MC was readily detached when subjected to low shear stress, while most of the biofilm biomass remained on the control surface. Altogether, we demonstrate a new nonleachable antibacterial composite with excellent antibiofilm activity without affecting its mechanical properties, which may serve as a platform for development of alternative antifouling biomaterials.","authors":[{"name":"Geelsu Hwang"},{"name":"Bernard Koltisko"},{"name":"Xiaoming Jin"},{"name":"Hyun Koo"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EPS matrix"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"dental composite"},{"word":"imidazolium-containing resin"},{"word":"mechanical stability"}]},"article126":{"pmid":"29020266","title":"Propionibacterium avidum: A Virulent Pathogen Causing Hip Periprosthetic Joint Infection.","date":"2019-09-30","abs":"Propionibacteria are important members of the human skin microbiota, but are also opportunistic pathogens associated with periprosthetic joint infection (PJI).

Quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) have great potential to inhibit pathogenic biofilm formation and are considered possible replacements for antibiotics; however, further investigation is required to understand the mechanisms of action of QSIs and to avoid inhibitory effects on beneficial bacteria. Lactobacillus paraplantarum L-ZS9, isolated from fermented sausage, is a bacteriocin-producing bacteria that shows potential to be a probiotic starter. Since exogenous autoinducer-2 (AI-2) promoted biofilm formation of the strain, expression of genes involved in AI-2 production was determined in L. paraplantarum L-ZS9, especially the key gene luxS. D-Ribose was used to inhibit biofilm formation because of its AI-2 inhibitory activity. Twenty-seven differentially expressed proteins were identified by comparative proteomic analysis following D-ribose treatment and were functionally classified into six groups. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that AI-2 had a counteractive effect on transcription of the genes tuf, fba, gap, pgm, nfo, rib, and rpoN. Over-expression of the tuf, fba, gap, pgm, and rpoN genes promoted biofilm formation of L. paraplantarum L-ZS9, while over-expression of the nfo and rib genes inhibited biofilm formation. In conclusion, D-ribose inhibited biofilm formation of L. paraplantarum L-ZS9 by regulating multiple genes involved in the glycolytic pathway, extracellular DNA degradation and transcription, and translation.

The presence of virulence genes associated with DEC [enterotoxigenic (lt and st), enteropathogenic (eaeA), shiga toxin-producing (stx1and stx2), enteroinvasive (ipaH), enteroaggregative (aggR), and diffusely adherent (daaD)] was determined by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Those positive E. coli strains were further analyzed for 18 additional virulence factors encoding genes and others phenotypic features. Virulence genes associated with DEC were identified in seven bacteremic children (10%), including: one aggR-positive [enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC)], one eaeA-positive [enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)], one st-positive [enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)], one daaD-positive [diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC)], and three strain positive for aggR and daaD (EAEC/DAEC) at the same time. All strains, except EPEC, had the Ag43 adhesin, and all, except ETEC had the siderophore gene fyuA. The phylogenetic profile of these strains was variable, two (B2), two (D), two (A), and one (B1) strain. These isolates were susceptible to all tested antibacterial agents except to ampicillin and gentamicin. The three EAEC/DAEC strains showed biofilm formation and aggregative adhesion and had the same repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR patterns. These findings suggest that some DEC strains, especially agg-R and daa-D positive, might cause bacteremia in children.","authors":[{"name":"Maribel Riveros"},{"name":"Wilfredo García"},{"name":"Coralith García"},{"name":"David Durand"},{"name":"Erik Mercado"},{"name":"Joaquim Ruiz"},{"name":"Theresa J Ochoa"}],"keywords":[]},"article140":{"pmid":"29016193","title":"The Possible Emergence of Life and Differentiation of a Shallow Biosphere on Irradiated Icy Worlds: The Example of Europa.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Irradiated ice-covered ocean worlds with rocky mafic mantles may provide the conditions needed to drive the emergence and maintenance of life. Alkaline hydrothermal springs-relieving the geophysical, thermal, and chemical disequilibria between oceans and tidally stressed crusts-could generate inorganic barriers to the otherwise uncontrolled and kinetically disfavored oxidation of hydrothermal hydrogen and methane. Ionic gradients imposed across these inorganic barriers, comprising iron oxyhydroxides and sulfides, could drive the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and the oxidation of methane through thermodynamically favorable metabolic pathways leading to early life-forms. In such chemostatic environments, fuels may eventually outweigh oxidants. Ice-covered oceans are primarily heated from below, creating convection that could transport putative microbial cells and cellular cooperatives upward to congregate beneath an ice shell, potentially giving rise to a highly focused shallow biosphere. It is here where electron acceptors, ultimately derived from the irradiated surface, could be delivered to such life-forms through exchange with the icy surface. Such zones would act as electron disposal units for the biosphere, and occupants might be transferred toward the surface by buoyant diapirs and even entrained into plumes.

Despite this, SCVs are associated with persistent infections of the bloodstream, bones, and prosthetic devices. The survival of SCVs in the host has been ascribed to intracellular residency, biofilm formation, and resistance to antibiotics. However, the ability of SCVs to resist host defenses is largely uncharacterized. To address this, we measured the survival of wild-type and SCV S. aureus in whole human blood, which contains high numbers of neutrophils, the key defense against staphylococcal infection. Despite the loss of leukocidin production and staphyloxanthin biosynthesis, SCVs defective for heme or menaquinone biosynthesis were significantly more resistant to the oxidative burst than wild-type bacteria in human blood or the presence of purified neutrophils. Supplementation of the culture medium of the heme-auxotrophic SCV with heme, but not iron, restored growth, hemolysin and staphyloxanthin production, and sensitivity to the oxidative burst. Since Enterococcus faecalis is a natural heme auxotroph and cause of bloodstream infection, we explored whether restoration of the electron transport chain in this organism also affected survival in blood. Incubation of E. faecalis with heme increased growth and restored catalase activity but resulted in decreased survival in human blood via increased sensitivity to the oxidative burst. Therefore, the lack of functional electron transport chains in SCV S. aureus and wild-type E. faecalis results in reduced growth rate but provides resistance to a key immune defense mechanism.","authors":[{"name":"Kimberley L Painter"},{"name":"Alex Hall"},{"name":"Kam Pou Ha"},{"name":"Andrew M Edwards"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"bacteremia"},{"word":"enterococcus"},{"word":"neutrophil"},{"word":"oxidative burst"},{"word":"small-colony variant"}]},"article145":{"pmid":"28992595","title":"Electrical current generation in microbial electrolysis cells by hyperthermophilic archaea Ferroglobus placidus and Geoglobus ahangari.","date":"2018-01-03","abs":"Few microorganisms have been examined for current generation under thermophilic (40-65°C) or hyperthermophilic temperatures (≥80°C) in microbial electrochemical systems.

This Review focuses on the recent progress (particularly over the past 5 years) on such smart antibacterial surfaces. According to the different design strategies, these surfaces can be divided into three categories: (i) K + R-type surfaces, which have both a killing unit and a releasing unit; (ii) K → R-type surfaces, which have a surface-immobilized killing unit that can be switched to perform a releasing function; and (iii) K + (R)-type surfaces, which have only a killing unit but can release dead bacteria upon the addition of a release solution.

Based on the findings of a previous metabolomic study, the role of intracellular γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) as a potential signal in the Gac/Rsm pathway was investigated herein. The function and regulation of a gabDT (c01870-c01880) gene cluster in strain CHA0 were described. The gabT gene encoded GABA transaminase (GABAT) and enabled the growth of the bacterium on GABA, whereas the upstream gabD gene (annotated as a gene encoding succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase) had an unknown function. A gacA mutant exhibited low GABAT activity, leading to the markedly greater intracellular accumulation of GABA than in the wild type. In the gacA mutant, the RsmA and RsmE proteins caused translational gabD repression, with concomitant gabT repression. Due to very low GABAT activity, the gabT mutant accumulated GABA to high levels. This trait promoted a planktonic lifestyle, reduced biofilm formation, and favored root colonization without exhibiting the highly pleiotropic gacA phenotypes. These results suggest an important role of GABA in the Gac/Rsm-regulated niche adaptation of strain CHA0 to plant roots.","authors":[{"name":"Kasumi Takeuchi"}],"keywords":[]},"article153":{"pmid":"28990144","title":"Biofilm formation by Candida albicans is inhibited by photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT), using chlorin e6: increase in both ROS production and membrane permeability.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal producing both superficial and systemic infections in immunocompromised patients.

In order to address this issue, we have focused our efforts on studying the fungal community in the GI tract known as the mycobiome. We found that patients with Crohn's disease (CD) tend to have much higher levels of the fungus Candida tropicalis compared to their healthy family members, as well as two bacteria, Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Furthermore, we showed that these three organisms worked together to form robust biofilms capable of exacerbating intestinal inflammation. Herein, we discuss the role of the mycobiome in health and disease, and highlight the importance of maintaining balance of the GI microbiota. Additionally, taking into consideration recent next generation sequencing data, we provide insight into potentially new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of IBD through the use of antifungals and/or probiotics aimed at establishing and maintaining a healthy balance of the GI total microbial community including fungi and bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Christopher L Hager"},{"name":"Mahmoud A Ghannoum"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Fungus"},{"word":"Inflammatory bowel disease"},{"word":"Probiotics"}]},"article162":{"pmid":"28988525","title":"The role of biofilm forming on mortality in patients with candidemia: a study derived from real world data.","date":"2018-08-17","abs":"Evaluation of the role on patient mortality exerted by biofilm forming (BF) Candida strains, by using predictive clinical data.","authors":[{"name":"Carlo Tascini"},{"name":"Emanuela Sozio"},{"name":"Laura Corte"},{"name":"Francesco Sbrana"},{"name":"Claudio Scarparo"},{"name":"Andrea Ripoli"},{"name":"Giacomo Bertolino"},{"name":"Maria Merelli"},{"name":"Enrico Tagliaferri"},{"name":"Antonio Corcione"},{"name":"Matteo Bassetti"},{"name":"Gianluigi Cardinali"},{"name":"Francesco Menichetti"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antifungal therapy"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Candidemia"}]},"article163":{"pmid":"28988312","title":"Contamination occurs during ACL graft harvesting and manipulation, but it can be easily eradicated.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Why anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) autograft soaking in a 5 mg/ml vancomycin solution decreases the rate of infection has not been well-explained.

In this study, we genotypically and phenotypically characterized 187 human clinical E. coli isolates representing various pathotypes (e.g., uropathogenic, enteropathogenic, and enteroaggregative E. coli). We investigated the presence of biofilm-associated genes (genotype) and phenotypically analyzed the isolates for motility and curli and cellulose production (phenotype). We developed a new screening method to examine the in vitro biofilm formation ability. In summary, we found a high prevalence of biofilm-associated genes.

We assessed the inhibitory effect of micafungin against 78 clinical isolates of Candida spp., growing as planktonic or sessile cells, by widely recommended broth microdilution method. The in vitro effect on sessile cells viability was evaluated by colorimetric reduction assay. All examined strains were susceptible or intermediate to micafungin when growing as planktonic cells.

The most intriguing of these responses is a release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of decondensed chromatin and granular proteins with antimicrobial activity. An important potential target of NETs is Candida albicans-an opportunistic fungal pathogen that employs morphological and phenotype switches and biofilm formation during contact with neutrophils, accompanied by changes in epitope exposition that mask the pathogen from host recognition. These processes differ depending on infection conditions and are thus influenced by the surrounding environment. In the current study, we compared the NET release by neutrophils upon contact with purified main candidal cell surface components. We show here for the first time that in addition to the main cell wall-building polysaccharides (mannans and β-glucans), secreted aspartic proteases (Saps) trigger NETs with variable intensities. The most efficient NET-releasing response is with Sap4 and Sap6, which are known to be secreted by fungal hyphae. This involves mixed, ROS-dependent and ROS-independent signaling pathways, mainly through interactions with the CD11b receptor. In comparison, upon contact with the cell wall-bound Sap9 and Sap10, neutrophils responded via a ROS-dependent mechanism using CD16 and CD18 receptors for protease recognition. In addition to the Saps tested, the actuation of selected mediating kinases (Src, Syk, PI3K, and ERK) was also investigated. β-Glucans were found to trigger a ROS-dependent process of NET production with engagement of Dectin-1 as well as CD11b and CD18 receptors. Mannans were observed to be recognized by TLRs, CD14, and Dectin-1 receptors and triggered NET release mainly via a ROS-independent pathway. Our results thus strongly suggest that neutrophils activate NET production in response to different candidal components that are presented locally at low concentrations at the initial stages of infection. However, NET release seemed to be blocked by increasing numbers of fungal cells.","authors":[{"name":"Marcin Zawrotniak"},{"name":"Oliwia Bochenska"},{"name":"Justyna Karkowska-Kuleta"},{"name":"Karolina Seweryn-Ozog"},{"name":"Wataru Aoki"},{"name":"Mitsuyoshi Ueda"},{"name":"Andrzej Kozik"},{"name":"Maria Rapala-Kozik"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"fungal cell wall proteins"},{"word":"glucans"},{"word":"host defense"},{"word":"mannans"},{"word":"neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)"},{"word":"secreted aspartic proteases"}]},"article177":{"pmid":"28983302","title":"Biofilm Attached Cultivation of Chlorella pyrenoidosa Is a Developed System for Swine Wastewater Treatment and Lipid Production.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"This study showed the new potential of using soluble contents and heavy metals in swine wastewater as nutrient supplements for the algae Chlorella pyrenoidosa with biofilm attached method.

However, the exact physiological role and mechanism of pigmentation were less studied. Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 (SM9913), an non-pigmented strain isolated from the deep-sea sediment, formed attached biofilm at the solid-liquid interface and pellicles at the liquid-air interface at a wide range of temperatures. Lower temperatures and lower nutrient levels promoted the formation of attached biofilm, while higher nutrient levels promoted pellicle formation of SM9913. Notably, after prolonged incubation at higher temperatures growing planktonically or at the later stage of the biofilm formation, we found that SM9913 released a brownish pigment. By comparing the protein profile at different temperatures followed by qRT-PCR, we found that the production of pigment at higher temperatures was due to the induction of melA gene which is responsible for the synthesis of homogentisic acid (HGA). The auto-oxidation of HGA can lead to the formation of pyomelanin, which has been shown in other bacteria. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer analysis confirmed that the pigment produced in SM9913 was pyomelanin-like compound. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, during heat stress and during biofilm formation, the induction level of melA gene was significantly higher than that of the hmgA gene which is responsible for the degradation of HGA in the L-tyrosine catabolism pathway.

The MIC of S. mutans parental strain and induced persisters remained the same. The induced persisters in S. mutans biofilms could be eliminated via higher doses of 300 μg/mL of DMAHDM and CHX. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that (1) DMAHDM induced persisters only in biofilms, but not in planktonic bacteria; and (2) both DMAHDM-induced and CHX-induced S. mutans persister biofilms could be completely eradicated by even higher concentrations of DMAHDM and CHX. More studies are needed on the induction of persisters in oral biofilms for the development and use of a new generation of antibacterial dental monomers and resins.","authors":[{"name":"Suping Wang"},{"name":"Chenchen Zhou"},{"name":"Biao Ren"},{"name":"Xiaodong Li"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Radi M Masri"},{"name":"Thomas W Oates"},{"name":"Lei Cheng"},{"name":"Hockin K H Xu"}],"keywords":[]},"article185":{"pmid":"28979839","title":"The periplasmic binding protein NrtT affects xantham gum production and pathogenesis in Xanthomonas citri.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"In Xanthomonas citri, the bacterium that causes citrus canker, three ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are known to be dedicated to the uptake of sulfur compounds.

Bacteria use a variety of surface structures to promote interfacial adhesion, with the level of expression of these structures varying in response to local conditions and environmental signals. Here, we investigated how overexpression of type 1 fimbriae, one such appendage, modifies the ability of Escherichia coli to adhere to solid substrates, via biofilm formation and yeast agglomeration, and to oil/water interfaces, via a microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon assay. A plasmid that enables inducible expression of E. coli MG1655 type 1 fimbriae was transformed into fimbriae-deficient mutant strain MG1655ΔfimA. The level of fimH gene expression in the engineered strain, measured using quantitative real-time PCR, could be tuned by changing the concentration of inducer isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and was higher than that in strain MG1655. Increasing the degree of fimbriation only slightly modified the surface energy and zeta potential of the bacteria, but enhanced their ability to agglomerate yeast cells and to adhere to solid substrates (as measured by biofilm formation) and to oil/water interfaces.

The threat is even more severe in the developing countries where there is a lack of advanced medical amenities and contemporary anti-TB drugs. In such situations, dosage optimization of existing medication regimens seems to be the only viable option. Therapeutic drug monitoring study results suggest that high-dose treatment regimens can compensate the low serum concentration of anti-TB drugs and shorten the therapy duration. The article presents a critical review on the possible changes that occur in the host and the pathogen upon the administration of standard and high-dose regimens. Some of the most common factors that are responsible for low anti-TB drug concentrations in the serum are differences in hosts' body weight, metabolic processing of the drug, malabsorption and/or drug-drug interaction. Furthermore, failure to reach the cavitary pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues also contributes to the therapeutic inefficiency of the drugs. In such conditions, administration of higher doses can help in compensating the pathogenic outcomes of enhancement of the pathogen's physical barriers, efflux pumps and genetic mutations. The present article also presents a summary of the recorded treatment outcomes of clinical trials that were conducted to test the efficacy of administration of high dose of anti-tuberculosis drugs.

PEL is a cationic polymer that promotes cell-cell interactions within the biofilm matrix through electrostatic interactions with extracellular DNA. Translocation of PEL across the outer membrane is proposed to occur via PelB, a membrane-embedded porin with a large periplasmic domain predicted to contain 19 tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). TPR-containing domains are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, and we therefore sought to determine whether PelB serves as a periplasmic scaffold that recruits other components of the PEL secretion apparatus. In this study, we show that the TPR domain of PelB interacts with PelA, an enzyme with PEL deacetylase and hydrolase activities. Structure determination of PelB TPRs 8-11 enabled us to design systematic deletions of individual TPRs and revealed that repeats 9-14, which are required for the cellular localization of PelA with PelB are also essential for PEL-dependent biofilm formation. Copurification experiments indicated that the interaction between PelA and PelB is direct and that the deacetylase activity of PelA increases and its hydrolase activity decreases when these proteins interact. Combined, our results indicate that the TPR-containing domain of PelB localizes PelA to the PEL secretion apparatus within the periplasm and that this may allow for efficient deacetylation of PEL before its export from the cell.","authors":[{"name":"Lindsey S Marmont"},{"name":"Gregory B Whitfield"},{"name":"Jacquelyn D Rich"},{"name":"Patrick Yip"},{"name":"Laura B Giesbrecht"},{"name":"Carol A Stremick"},{"name":"John C Whitney"},{"name":"Matthew R Parsek"},{"name":"Joe J Harrison"},{"name":"P Lynne Howell"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)"},{"word":"X-ray crystallography"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"polysaccharide"},{"word":"protein-protein interaction"}]},"article207":{"pmid":"28972138","title":"Photorhabdus luminescens lectin A (PllA): A new probe for detecting α-galactoside-terminating glycoconjugates.","date":"2019-01-18","abs":"Lectins play important roles in infections by pathogenic bacteria, for example, in host colonization, persistence, and biofilm formation. The Gram-negative entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens symbiotically lives in insect-infecting Heterorhabditis nematodes and kills the insect host upon invasion by the nematode. The P. luminescens genome harbors the gene plu2096, coding for a novel lectin that we named PllA. We analyzed the binding properties of purified PllA with a glycan array and a binding assay in solution. Both assays revealed a strict specificity of PllA for α-galactoside-terminating glycoconjugates. The crystal structures of apo PllA and complexes with three different ligands revealed the molecular basis for the strict specificity of this lectin. Furthermore, we found that a 90° twist in subunit orientation leads to a peculiar quaternary structure compared with that of its ortholog LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa We also investigated the utility of PllA as a probe for detecting α-galactosides. The α-Gal epitope is present on wild-type pig cells and is the main reason for hyperacute organ rejection in pig to primate xenotransplantation. We noted that PllA specifically recognizes this epitope on the glycan array and demonstrated that PllA can be used as a fluorescent probe to detect this epitope on primary porcine cells in vitro In summary, our biochemical and structural analyses of the P. luminescens lectin PllA have disclosed the structural basis for PllA's high specificity for α-galactoside-containing ligands, and we show that PllA can be used to visualize the α-Gal epitope on porcine tissues.","authors":[{"name":"Ghamdan Beshr"},{"name":"Asfandyar Sikandar"},{"name":"Eva-Maria Jemiller"},{"name":"Nikolai Klymiuk"},{"name":"Dirk Hauck"},{"name":"Stefanie Wagner"},{"name":"Eckhard Wolf"},{"name":"Jesko Koehnke"},{"name":"Alexander Titz"}],"keywords":[{"word":"carbohydrate"},{"word":"carbohydrate-binding protein"},{"word":"glycobiology"},{"word":"lectin"},{"word":"protein structure"},{"word":"structural biology"}]},"article208":{"pmid":"28971863","title":"Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Dispersed Cells to Antimicrobial Agents Is Dependent on the Dispersion Cue and Class of the Antimicrobial Agent Used.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The biofilm life cycle is characterized by the transition of planktonic cells exhibiting high susceptibly to antimicrobial agents to a biofilm mode of growth characterized by high tolerance to antimicrobials, followed by dispersion of cells from the biofilm back into the environment.

This raised the question whether dispersed cells are as susceptible as planktonic cells and whether the dispersion inducer or the antibiotic class affects the drug susceptibility of dispersed cells. Dispersed cells obtained in response to dispersion cues glutamate and nitric oxide (NO) were thus exposed to tobramycin and colistin. Although NO-induced dispersed cells were as susceptible to colistin and tobramycin as exponential-phase planktonic cells, glutamate-induced dispersed cells were susceptible to tobramycin but resistant to colistin. The difference in colistin susceptibility was independent of cellular c-di-GMP levels, with modulation of c-di-GMP failing to induce dispersion. Instead, drug susceptibility was inversely correlated with LPS modification system and the biofilm-specific transcriptional regulator BrlR. The susceptibility phenotype of glutamate-induced dispersed cells to colistin was found to be reversible, with dispersed cells being rendered as susceptible to colistin within 2 h postdispersion, though additional time was required for dispersed cells to display expression of genes indicative of exponential growth.","authors":[{"name":"Jacob R Chambers"},{"name":"Kathryn E Cherny"},{"name":"Karin Sauer"}],"keywords":[{"word":"attachment"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm control"},{"word":"colistin"},{"word":"dispersion"},{"word":"exponential phase"},{"word":"susceptibility"},{"word":"tobramycin"}]},"article209":{"pmid":"28971508","title":"Current review-The rise of bacteriophage as a unique therapeutic platform in treating peri-prosthetic joint infections.","date":"2019-03-18","abs":"Peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is one of the most serious and dreaded complications after total joint replacement (TJR). Due to an aging population and the constant rise in demand for TJR, the incidence of PJI is also increasing. Successful treatment of PJI is challenging and is associated with high failure rates. One of the main causes for treatment failure is bacterial biofilm formation on implant surfaces and the adherence of biofilm bacteria on tissue and bone next to the implant. Biofilms are protective shields to bacterial cells and possess many unique properties that leads to antibiotic resistance. New therapeutic platforms are currently being explored to breakdown biofilm matrix in order to enhance the efficacy of antibiotics. Bacteriophages (phages) is one of these unique therapeutic platforms that can degrade biofilms as well as target the killing of bacterial cells. Preclinical studies of biofilm-mediated infections have demonstrated the ability of phage to eradicate biofilms and clear infections by working synergistically with antibiotics. There is strong preclinical evidence that phage can reduce the concentration of antibiotics required to treat an infection. These findings support a promising role for phages as a future clinical adjunct to antibiotics. In addition, phage therapy can be personalized to target a specific bacterial strain. Clinical studies using phage therapy are limited in Western literature; but phase I studies have established good safety profile with no adverse outcomes reported. In order to translate phage therapy to treat PJI in clinics, further preclinical testing is still required to study optimal delivery methods as well as the interaction between phage and the immune system in vivo. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Despite continuous improvements in device design, surgical procedures, and wound care, biomaterial-associated infections (BAI) are still a major problem in modern medicine. Conventional antibiotic treatment often fails due to the low levels of antibiotic at the site of infection. The presence of biofilms on the biomaterial and/or the multidrug-resistant phenotype of the bacteria further impair the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Removal of the biomaterial is then the last option to control the infection. Clearly, there is a pressing need for alternative strategies to prevent and treat BAI. Synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising candidates as they are active against a broad spectrum of (antibiotic-resistant) planktonic bacteria and biofilms. Moreover, bacteria are less likely to develop resistance to these rapidly-acting peptides. In this review we highlight the four main strategies, three of which applying AMPs, in biomedical device manufacturing to prevent BAI. The first involves modification of the physicochemical characteristics of the surface of implants. Immobilization of AMPs on surfaces of medical devices with a variety of chemical techniques is essential in the second strategy. The main disadvantage of these two strategies relates to the limited antibacterial effect in the tissue surrounding the implant. This limitation is addressed by the third strategy that releases AMPs from a coating in a controlled fashion. Lastly, AMPs can be integrated in the design and manufacturing of additively manufactured/3D-printed implants, owing to the physicochemical characteristics of the implant material and the versatile manufacturing technologies compatible with antimicrobials incorporation. These novel technologies utilizing AMPs will contribute to development of novel and safe antimicrobial medical devices, reducing complications and associated costs of device infection.","authors":[{"name":"Martijn Riool"},{"name":"Anna de Breij"},{"name":"Jan W Drijfhout"},{"name":"Peter H Nibbering"},{"name":"Sebastian A J Zaat"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"antimicrobial resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biomaterial-associated infection"},{"word":"device manufacturing"},{"word":"implant"}]},"article212":{"pmid":"28970943","title":"Towards individualized diagnostics of biofilm-associated infections: a case study.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Organized within biofilm communities, bacteria exhibit resistance towards a broad spectrum of antibiotics. Thus, one might argue that bacteria isolated from biofilm-associated chronic infections should be subjected to resistance profiling under biofilm growth conditions. Various test systems have been developed to determine the biofilm-associated resistance; however, it is not clear to what extent the in vitro results reflect the situation in vivo, and whether the biofilm-resistance profile should guide clinicians in their treatment choice. To address this issue, we used confocal microscopy in combination with live/dead staining, and profiled biofilm-associated resistance of a large number (>130) of clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from overall 15 cystic fibrosis patients. Our results demonstrate that in addition to a general non-responsiveness of bacteria when grown under biofilm conditions, there is an isolate-specific and antibiotic-specific biofilm-resistance profile. This individual resistance profile is independent on the structural properties of the biofilms. Furthermore, biofilm resistance is not linked to the resistance profile under planktonic growth conditions, or a mucoid, or small colony morphology of the tested isolates. Instead, it seems that individual biofilm structures evolve during biofilm-associated growth and are shaped by environment-specific cues. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that biofilm resistance profiles are isolate specific and cannot be deduced from commonly studied phenotypes. Further clinical studies will have to show the added value of biofilm-resistance profiling. Individualized diagnosis of biofilm resistance might lead to more rational recommendations for antimicrobial therapy and, thus, increased effectiveness of the treatment of chronically infected patients.","authors":[{"name":"Mathias Müsken"},{"name":"Kathi Klimmek"},{"name":"Annette Sauer-Heilborn"},{"name":"Monique Donnert"},{"name":"Ludwig Sedlacek"},{"name":"Sebastian Suerbaum"},{"name":"Susanne Häussler"}],"keywords":[]},"article213":{"pmid":"28970909","title":"Engineering microbial physiology with synthetic polymers: cationic polymers induce biofilm formation in Vibrio cholerae and downregulate the expression of virulence genes.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Here we report the first application of non-bactericidal synthetic polymers to modulate the physiology of a bacterial pathogen.

To characterize the role of biofilms in equine endometritis, six mares were inoculated with lux-engineered Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from equine uterine infections. Following establishment of infection, the horses were euthanized and the endometrial surfaces were imaged for luminescence to localize adherent lux-labeled bacteria. Samples from the endometrium were collected for cytology, histopathology, carbohydrate analysis, and expression of inflammatory cytokine genes. Tissue-adherent bacteria were present in focal areas between endometrial folds (6/6 mares). The Pel exopolysaccharide (biofilm matrix component) and cyclic di-GMP (biofilm-regulatory molecule) were detected in 6/6 mares and 5/6 mares, respectively, from endometrial samples with tissue-adherent bacteria (P < 0.05). A greater incidence (P < 0.05) of Pel exopolysaccharide was present in samples fixed with Bouin's solution (18/18) than in buffered formalin (0/18), indicating that Bouin's solution is more appropriate for detecting bacteria adherent to the endometrium. There were no differences (P > 0.05) in the number of inflammatory cells in the endometrium between areas with and without tissue-adherent bacteria. Neutrophils were decreased (P < 0.05) in areas surrounding tissue-adherent bacteria compared to those in areas free of adherent bacteria. Gene expression of interleukin-10, an immune-modulatory cytokine, was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in areas of tissue-adherent bacteria compared to that in endometrium absent of biofilm. These findings indicate that P. aeruginosa produces a biofilm in the uterus and that the host immune response is modulated focally around areas with biofilm, but inflammation within the tissue is similar in areas with and without biofilm matrix.

BTA employs specific reagents whose color changed according to bacterial metabolism. BTA is based on the principle that a metabolic reaction will be faster when more bacteria are present in the sample. Therefore, the time required for color changes of BTA reagents determines the number of bacteria present in the sample through a correlation line. Here, for the first time, we applied BTA and a specifically developed laboratory procedure to evaluate CVC colonization in comparison with the routine microbiological method (RMM). 125 CVCs removed from patients for suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) or at hospital discharge were examined. BTA was reliable in assessing sterility and CVC colonization (100% agreement with RMM) and in recognizing the presence of fermenting or non-fermenting bacteria (97.1% agreement with RMM) shortening the analytical time by between 2- and 3-fold.

The cell compatibility of TiO2+Ag coated brackets is superior to the uncoated samples therefore can be used in orthodontics as it not only provide suitable antimicrobial activity and resistance to biofilm formation but also sustained the cell viability of human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cell lines.","authors":[{"name":"Eman Jameel Fatani"},{"name":"Hamed H Almutairi"},{"name":"Ali O Alharbi"},{"name":"Yasser Obaidallah Alnakhli"},{"name":"Darshan Devang Divakar"},{"name":" Muzaheed"},{"name":"Abdulaziz Abdullah Alkheraif"},{"name":"Aftab Ahmed Khan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial"},{"word":"BioFilm"},{"word":"Dental brackets"},{"word":"Orthodontic brackets"},{"word":"Stainless steel"}]},"article226":{"pmid":"28965656","title":"Effects of binge alcohol exposure on Burkholderia thailandensis-alveolar macrophage interaction.","date":"2018-05-22","abs":"Alcohol consumption has diverse and well-documented effects on the human immune system and its ability to defend against infective agents. One example is melioidosis, a disease caused by infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is of public health importance in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, with an expanding global distribution. While B. pseudomallei infections can occur in healthy humans, binge alcohol use is progressively being recognized as a major risk factor. Although binge alcohol consumption has been considered as a risk factor for the development of melioidosis, no experimental studies have investigated the outcomes of alcohol exposure on Burkholderia spp. infection. Therefore, we proposed the use of non-pathogenic B. thailandensis E264 as a useful BSL-1 model system to study the effects of binge alcohol exposure on bacteria and alveolar macrophage interactions. The MH-S alveolar macrophage (AMs) cell line was used to characterize innate immune responses to infection in vitro. Our results showed that alcohol exposure significantly suppressed the uptake and killing of B. thailandensis by AMs. Alveolar macrophages incubated in alcohol (0.08%) for 3 h prior to infection showed significantly lower bacterial uptake at 2 and 8 h post infection. Activated AMs with IFN-γ and pre and post-incubation in alcohol when exposed to B. thailandensis released lower nitric oxide (NO) concentrations, compared to activated AMs with IFN-γ from non-alcoholic controls. As a result, B. thailandensis survival and replication increased ∼2.5-fold compared to controls. The presence of alcohol (1%) also increased bacterial survival within AMs. Alcohol significantly decreased bacterial motility compared to non-alcoholic controls. Increased biofilm formation was observed at 3 and 6 h when bacteria were pre-incubated in (0.08%) alcohol. These results provide insights into binge alcohol consumption, a culturally prevalent risk factor, as a predisposing factor for melioidosis.","authors":[{"name":"Victor Jimenez"},{"name":"Ryan Moreno"},{"name":"Emily Kaufman"},{"name":"Heidie Hornstra"},{"name":"Erik Settles"},{"name":"Bart J Currie"},{"name":"Paul Keim"},{"name":"Fernando P Monroy"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acute alcohol toxicity"},{"word":"Alcohol"},{"word":"Binge drinking"},{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Burkholderia"},{"word":"Macrophage"},{"word":"Nitric oxide"},{"word":"Phagocytosis"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article227":{"pmid":"28965300","title":"Rapid biosynthesized AgNPs from Gelidiella acerosa aqueous extract mitigates quorum sensing mediated biofilm formation of Vibrio species-an in vitro and in vivo approach.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The present study explores the non-bactericidal anti-virulence efficacy of green synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from Gelidiella acerosa against multi-drug resistant Vibrio spp. Spectral characterization of AgNPs was performed through UV-Visible, FT-IR, and energy-dispersive spectroscopic techniques followed by X-ray crystallography and zeta potential analysis.

Single or dual S. oligofermentans and S. mutans biofilms were grown in a 96-well active attachment model for 48 h. Several growth conditions were examined in the model, namely: S. oligofermentans was inoculated 24 h before S. mutans or vice versa; the growth medium was supplemented with 0.2% sucrose or 0.4% glucose; biofilms were grown under a constantly neutral pH or pH-cycling condition, which included 8 h of neutral pH and 16 h of pH 5.5. The 48-h biofilms were examined for viable cell counts and lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide production ability. When S. oligofermentans was inoculated first, it clearly inhibited the growth of S. mutans and reduced the biofilm lactic acid production by up to 8-fold through hydrogen peroxide production, independently of sugar supply and pH conditions. When S. mutans was inoculated first, the level of inhibition by S. oligofermentans varied depending on the sugar supply and pH conditions. Thus, the inhibition efficacy of S. oligofermentans against S. mutans in dual-species biofilms is influenced by environmental factors.

Here we report on G. sulfurreducens biofilms grown across the gap separating two electrodes by maintaining one electrode at 0.300V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.510V vs. SHE) to act as a sustained metabolic electron acceptor while the second electrode was at open circuit. The poised electrode exhibited the characteristic current-time profile for electrode-dependent G. sulfurreducens biofilm growth. The open circuit potential (OCP) of the second electrode however increased after initially decreasing for 1.5-2days. The increase in OCP is taken to indicate the point at which the growing biofilm bridged the gap between the electrodes, enabling cells in contact with the open circuit electrode to utilize the poised electrode as an electron acceptor. After but not prior to reaching this point, the second electrode was able to act as a sustainable electron acceptor immediately after being placed under potential control without requiring further time to develop.

The factors under study were as follows: times of pre-irradiation of the photosensitizer in three levels (1, 2, or 5 min). For the control of the cariogenic dental biofilm with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), methylene blue (0.01%) was used in association with the diode laser (InGaAlP) with a wavelength of 660 nm. Chlorhexidine digluconate (0.12% CHX) and saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The study design was carried out in complete and randomized blocks. The sample consisted of 15 S. mutans biofilms cultures, randomly divided into five groups and 15 C. albicans cultures, also divided into five groups. The experiment was performed in triplicate (n = 3) and the response variables were obtained through quantitative analysis of bacterial viability, expressed in colony-forming units (CFU) per square millimeter of the specimen area. The data were analyzed with the aid of the ANOVA one-way test and Tukey's post-test. All analyses were performed using the Graph Pad Prism 4.0 program, with a significance level of 5%. For the S. mutans group, only the saline solution presented a statistically significant difference when compared to the other treatments (p < 0.05), that is, the treatment with aPDT, irrespective of the irradiation time applied, was similar to the treatment with CHX and both were more effective in reducing cariogenic biofilm compared to saline. For the group of C. albicans, there was no statistical difference between the groups (p > 0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that the treatment with aPDT reduced the number of CFUs of S. mutans in a similar way to CHX, independently of the pre-irradiation time applied. No effect of this therapy or of the different pre-irradiation times on the C. albicans biofilm could be observed. In this way, the pre-irradiation time of 1 min can be used to reduce the microbial load of S. mutans.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Caroline Fumes"},{"name":"Priscilla Coutinho Romualdo"},{"name":"Rachel Maciel Monteiro"},{"name":"Evandro Watanabe"},{"name":"Silmara Aparecida Milori Corona"},{"name":"Maria Cristina Borsatto"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Candida albicans"},{"word":"Dental biofilm"},{"word":"Photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"}]},"article238":{"pmid":"28963222","title":"Draft Genome Sequences of Biofilm-Forming and Non-Biofilm-Forming Nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica Serovars.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The genetic basis for biofilm formation among nontyphoidal salmonellae (NTS) remains poorly understood.

The top disc is covered with the analyzed dressing and the entire set is incubated for 24h. During this time, the investigated antimicrobial substance is released from the dressing and penetrates to subsequent biofilm-covered agar discs. Biofilm reduction is measured using 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) spectrometric assay and the results are compared to untreated control samples (agar plug covered with biofilm and without the dressing/or with a passive dressing placed on the top disc). Furthermore, in order to standardize the differences in penetrability of the drugs released from active dressings the results can be expressed as a dimensionless value referred to as the Penetrability Index. In summary, A.D.A.M. test is simple, cheap, can be performed practically in every clinical laboratory and takes no more time than routine microbiological diagnostics. Apart from measuring the released drug's activity, the A.D.A.M. test allows to assess drug penetrability (across three agar discs), reflecting real wound conditions, where microbes are frequently hidden under the necrotic tissue or cloth.

We combined batch experiments with mathematical modelling, considering the bacterium Pseudomonas putida and either a suspension-feeding (i.e. the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia) or a surface-feeding grazer (i.e. the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii). We find that both plankton and biofilm phenotypes were consumed, when exposed to their specialised grazer, whereas the other phenotype remained grazing-resistant. This was consistently shown in two experiments (starting with either only planktonic bacteria or with additional pre-grown biofilms) and matches model predictions. In the experiments, the plankton feeder strongly stimulated the biofilm biomass. This stimulation of the resistant prey phenotype was not predicted by the model and it was not observed for the biofilm feeders, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms that stimulate biofilm formation besides selective feeding.

However, although the skin microbiota is composed of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, the extent and the consequences of TIVAP colonization by nonpathogenic bacteria have rarely been studied. Here, we used culture-dependent and 16S rRNA gene-based culture-independent approaches to identify differences in bacterial colonization of TIVAPs obtained from two French hospitals. To explore the relationships between nonpathogenic organisms colonizing TIVAPs and the potential risk of infection, we analyzed the bacterial community parameters between TIVAPs suspected (symptomatic) or not (asymptomatic) of infection. Although we did not find a particular species assemblage or community marker to distinguish infection risk on an individual sample level, we identified differences in bacterial community composition, diversity, and structure between clinically symptomatic and asymptomatic TIVAPs that could be explored further. This study therefore provides a new view of bacterial communities and colonization patterns in intravascular TIVAPs and suggests that microbial ecology approaches could improve our understanding of device-associated infections and could be a prognostic tool to monitor the evolution of bacterial communities in implants and their potential susceptibility to infections.

Likewise Vibrio cholerae O1, the causative agent of cholera, and ubiquitous in aquatic environments, produces vps-dependent biofilm conferring resistance to environmental stressors and predators. Here we show that a 49-bp deletion mutation in the flrA gene of V. cholerae N16961S strain resulted in promotion of vps-independent biofilm in filter sterilized lake water (FSLW), but not in nutrient-rich L-broth. Complementation of flrA mutant with the wild-type flrA gene inhibited vps-independent biofilm formation. Our data demonstrate that mutation in the flrA gene positively contributed to vps-independent biofilm production in FSLW. Furthermore, inactivation of mshA gene, encoding the main pilin of mannose sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA pilus) in the background of a ΔflrA mutant, inhibited vps-independent biofilm formation. Complementation of ΔflrAΔmshA double mutant with wild-type mshA gene restored biofilm formation, suggesting that mshA mutation inhibited ΔflrA-driven biofilm. Taken together, our data suggest that V. cholerae flrA and mshA act inversely in promoting vps-independent biofilm formation in FSLW. Using a standard chemotactic assay, we demonstrated that vps-independent biofilm of V. cholerae, in contrast to vps-dependent biofilm, promoted bacterial movement toward chitin and phosphate in FSLW. A ΔflrAΔmshA double mutant inhibited the bacterium from moving toward nutrients; this phenomenon was reversed with reverted mutants (complemented with wild-type mshA gene). Movement to nutrients was blocked by mutation in a key chemotaxis gene, cheY-3, although, cheY-3 had no effect on vps-independent biofilm. We propose that in fresh water reservoirs, V. cholerae, on repression of flagella, enhances vps-independent biofilm that aids the bacterium in acquiring nutrients, including chitin and phosphate; by doing so, the microorganism enhances its ability to persist under nutrient-limited conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Shrestha Sinha-Ray"},{"name":"Afsar Ali"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Vibrio cholerae"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chemotaxis"},{"word":"microcosm"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"nutrient-poor"}]},"article258":{"pmid":"28959177","title":"Ancient permafrost staphylococci carry antibiotic resistance genes.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Elena Kashuba"},{"name":"Alexey A Dmitriev"},{"name":"Shady Mansour Kamal"},{"name":"Ojar Melefors"},{"name":"Gennady Griva"},{"name":"Ute Römling"},{"name":"Ingemar Ernberg"},{"name":"Vladimir Kashuba"},{"name":"Anatoli Brouchkov"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Permafrost"},{"word":"Staphylococcus"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"evolution"},{"word":"genome sequence"},{"word":"microbial physiology"}]},"article259":{"pmid":"28958886","title":"Effect of hydraulic retention time on the performance of a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor-membrane bioreactor system for micropollutants removal from municipal wastewater.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This study evaluated micropollutants removal and membrane fouling behaviour of a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor-membrane bioreactor (MBBR-MBR) system at four different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (24, 18, 12 and 6h).

C. albicans biofilms are intrinsically resistant to antifungal drugs, the host immune system, and environmental stresses. Biofilm is an important virulence factor and a major clinical challenge. With the development of new technologies in global gene expression profiles and genetic manipulation, the regulatory mechanisms that govern C. albicans biofilm development and drug resistance become more and more clear.

It regulates many important bacterial physiological functions such as biofilm formation, motility, adhesion, virulence and extracellular polysaccharide synthesis. It binds with many different proteins or RNA receptors, one of which is called riboswitch that is usually located at the 5'-untranslational region (5'-UTR) in some mRNA. Riboswitch usually comprises a specific ligand-binding (sensor) domain (named aptamer domain, AD), as well as a variable domain, termed expression platform (EP), to regulate expression of downstream coding sequences. When a specific metabolite concentration exceeds its threshold level, it will bind to its cognate riboswitch receptor to induce a conformational change of 5'-UTR, leading to modulation of downstream gene expression.

Oxic and hypoxic biofilm samples were enriched in bacterial iron oxidizers from the genus Leptospirillum, order Acidithiobacillales, class Betaproteobacteria, and archaea from the class Thermoplasmata. Water samples were enriched in Cyanobacteria and Thermoplasmata archaea at a 3-98% of the sunlight influence, whilst Betaproteobacteria, Thermoplasmata archaea, and Micrarchaea dominated in acid water collected in total darkness. Stalactites hanging from the Fe-rich mine ceiling were dominated by the neutrophilic iron oxidizer Gallionella and other lineages that were absent in the rest of the microhabitats (e.g., Chlorobi, Chloroflexi). Eukaryotes were detected in biofilms and open-air water samples, and belonged mainly to clades SAR (Alveolata and Stramenopiles), and Opisthokonta (Fungi). Oxic and hypoxic biofilms displayed higher proportions of ciliates (Gonostomum, Oxytricha), whereas water samples were enriched in fungi (Paramicrosporidium and unknown microbial Helotiales). Predicted function through bacterial community composition suggested adaptive evolutive convergence of function in heterogeneous communities. Our study showcases a broad description of the microbial diversity across different microhabitats in the same environment and expands the knowledge on the diversity of microbial eukaryotes in AMD habitats.","authors":[{"name":"Victoria Mesa"},{"name":"Jose L R Gallego"},{"name":"Ricardo González-Gil"},{"name":"Béatrice Lauga"},{"name":"Jesús Sánchez"},{"name":"Celia Méndez-García"},{"name":"Ana I Peláez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Archaea"},{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Eukarya"},{"word":"acid mine drainage"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"ore"},{"word":"sediment"},{"word":"stalactite"}]},"article296":{"pmid":"28955316","title":"Anti-biofilm Activities from Bergenia crassifolia Leaves against Streptococcus mutans.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Streptococcus mutans has been reported as a primary cariogenic pathogen associated with dental caries. The bacteria can produce glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) to synthesize extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) that are known as virulence factors for adherence and formation of biofilms. Therefore, an ideal inhibitor for dental caries is one that can inhibit planktonic bacteria growth and prevent biofilm formation. Bergenia crassifolia (L.), widely used as a folk medicine and tea beverage, has been reported to have a variety of bioactivities. The present study aimed to explore the effect of B. crassifolia (L.) leaf extracts on the biofilm of Streptococcus mutans. The B. crassifolia (L.) leaf extracts showed inhibitory effects by decreasing viability of bacteria within the biofilm, as evidenced by the XTT assay, live/dead staining assay and LDH activity assay, and could decrease the adherence property of S. mutans through inhibiting Gtfs to synthesize EPSs. In addition, the reduced quantity of EPSs and the inhibition of Gtfs were positively correlated with concentrations of test samples. Finally, the MTT assay showed that the extracts had no cytotoxicity against normal oral cells. In conclusion, the extracts and sub-extracts of B. crassifolia leaves were found to be antimicrobial and could reduce EPS synthesis by inhibiting activities of Gtfs to prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. Therefore, B. crassifolia leaves have potential to be developed as a drug to prevent and cure dental caries.","authors":[{"name":"Yucui Liu"},{"name":"Yanjie Xu"},{"name":"Qiuhang Song"},{"name":"Fei Wang"},{"name":"Luguo Sun"},{"name":"Lei Liu"},{"name":"Xiaoguang Yang"},{"name":"Jingwen Yi"},{"name":"Yongli Bao"},{"name":"Haifeng Ma"},{"name":"Honglan Huang"},{"name":"Chunlei Yu"},{"name":"Yanxin Huang"},{"name":"Yin Wu"},{"name":"Yuxin Li"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Bergenia crassifolia"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"cytotoxicity"},{"word":"extracellular polysaccharides"},{"word":"glucosyltransferase activity"}]},"article297":{"pmid":"28955315","title":"Analysis of Bacterial Community Composition of Corroded Steel Immersed in Sanya and Xiamen Seawaters in China via Method of Illumina MiSeq Sequencing.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Metal corrosion is of worldwide concern because it is the cause of major economic losses, and because it creates significant safety issues. The mechanism of the corrosion process, as influenced by bacteria, has been studied extensively. However, the bacterial communities that create the biofilms that form on metals are complicated, and have not been well studied. This is why we sought to analyze the composition of bacterial communities living on steel structures, together with the influence of ecological factors on these communities. The corrosion samples were collected from rust layers on steel plates that were immersed in seawater for two different periods at Sanya and Xiamen, China. We analyzed the bacterial communities on the samples by targeted 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region) sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bacteria fell into 13 phylotypes (similarity level = 97%). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, accounting for 88.84% of the total. Deltaproteobacteria, Clostridia and Gammaproteobacteria were the dominant classes, and accounted for 70.90% of the total. Desulfovibrio spp., Desulfobacter spp. and Desulfotomaculum spp. were the dominant genera and accounted for 45.87% of the total. These genera are sulfate-reducing bacteria that are known to corrode steel. Bacterial diversity on the 6 months immersion samples was much higher than that of the samples that had been immersed for 8 years (P < 0.001, Student's t-test). The average complexity of the biofilms from the 8-years immersion samples from Sanya was greater than those from Xiamen, but not significantly so (P > 0.05, Student's t-test). Overall, the data showed that the rust layers on the steel plates carried many bacterial species. The bacterial community composition was influenced by the immersion time. The results of our study will be of benefit to the further studies of bacterial corrosion mechanisms and corrosion resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaohong Li"},{"name":"Jizhou Duan"},{"name":"Hui Xiao"},{"name":"Yongqian Li"},{"name":"Haixia Liu"},{"name":"Fang Guan"},{"name":"Xiaofan Zhai"}],"keywords":[{"word":"16S rRNA gene"},{"word":"Illumina MiSeq sequencing"},{"word":"MIC"},{"word":"bacterial community"},{"word":"carbon steel"}]},"article298":{"pmid":"28954956","title":"Preincubation of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 with NaCl Increases Its Attachment to Lettuce Surfaces Compared with Other Chemicals.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"　The inhibition of microbial attachment to food is important for the prevention of cross-contamination during food processing. The effect of several chemicals that were added in an Escherichia coli growth medium on the attachment of the bacterium to lettuce was investigated. E. coli ATCC 25922, which is reportedly a useful surrogate for E. coli O157:H7 in surface attachment studies, was preincubated in a nutrient broth (NB) containing sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium deoxycholate, sodium linear alkylbenzene sulfonate, or sorbic acid. The bacterial cells were placed in contact with cut lettuce in a saline solution at 5℃ for 24 hours. Only the addition of NaCl in the NB influenced the attachment of E. coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. Enteritidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to the lettuce. The attachment of E. coli showed the largest significant increase at 2% NaCl. Changes in the attachment levels were not due to surface hydrohobicity or the motility of E. coli cells. Similar results were observed for S. enterica although the variation in the degree of attachment of the latter was quite small. These results suggested that the attachment of E. coli O157:H7 to food surfaces is influenced by the bacterial growth conditions prior to food exposure and prior to the development of the biofilm; furthermore, the environmental NaCl concentration should be controlled during food processing to prevent the cross-contamination of foods with E. coli.","authors":[{"name":"Kazuhisa Tomita"},{"name":"Jun Sawai"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Cell motility"},{"word":"Minimally processed vegetables"},{"word":"Sodium chloride"},{"word":"Surface hydrophobicity"}]},"article300":{"pmid":"28954653","title":"Biological Fixed Film.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The review includes scientific and technical literature published in the year of 2016 regarding the uses of biofilm and bioreactors to treat wastewater.

The aim of this study was to perform a physiological and transcriptomic analysis of a salt-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) mutant generated by evolutionary engineering. NaCl-resistant S. cerevisiae strains were obtained by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis followed by successive batch cultivations in the presence of gradually increasing NaCl concentrations, up to 8.5% w/v of NaCl (1.45 M). The most probable number (MPN) method, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and glucose oxidase/peroxidase method were used for physiological analysis, while Agilent yeast DNA microarray systems were used for transcriptome analysis. NaCl-resistant mutant strain T8 was highly cross-resistant to LiCl and highly sensitive to AlCl3. In the absence of NaCl stress, T8 strain had significantly higher trehalose and glycogen levels compared to the reference strain. Global transcriptome analysis by means of DNA microarrays showed that the genes related to stress response, carbohydrate transport, glycogen and trehalose biosynthesis, as well as biofilm formation, were upregulated. According to gene set enrichment analysis, 548 genes were upregulated and 22 downregulated in T8 strain, compared to the reference strain. Among the 548 upregulated genes, the highest upregulation was observed for the FLO11 (MUC1) gene (92-fold that of the reference strain).

Curli nanofibers exhibit exceptional underwater adhesion to various surfaces, have high rigidity and strong tensile mechanical properties, and thus hold great promise in biomaterials. The mechanisms of how curli fibers strongly attach to surfaces and detach under force remain elusive. To investigate curli fiber adhesion to surfaces, we developed a coarse-grained curli fiber model, in which the protein subunit CsgA (curli specific gene A) self-assembles into the fiber. The coarse-grained model yields physiologically relevant and tunable bending rigidity and persistence length. The force-induced desorption of a single curli fiber is examined using coarse-grained modeling and theoretical analysis. We find that the bending energy penalty arising from high persistence length enhances the resistance of the curli fiber against desorption and thus strengthens the adhesion of the curli fiber to surfaces. The CsgA-surface adhesion energy and the curli fiber bending rigidity both play crucial roles in the resistance of curli fiber against desorption from surfaces. To enable the desorption process, the applied peeling force must overcome both the interfacial adhesion energy and the energy barrier for bending the curli fiber at the peeling front. We show that the energy barrier to desorption increases with the interfacial adhesion energy, however, the bending induced failure of a single curli fiber limits the work of adhesion if the proportion of the CsgA-surface adhesion energy to the CsgA-CsgA cohesive energy becomes large. These results illustrate that the optimal adhesion performance of nanofibers is dictated by the interplay between bending, surface energy and cohesive energy. Our model provides timely insight into enterobacteriaceae adhesion mechanisms as well as future designs of engineered curli fiber based adhesives.","authors":[{"name":"Yao Zhang"},{"name":"Ao Wang"},{"name":"Elizabeth P DeBenedictis"},{"name":"Sinan Keten"}],"keywords":[]},"article311":{"pmid":"28952436","title":"Engineered Nanoparticles with Antimicrobial Property.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The urge for the development and manufacture of new and effective antimicrobial agents is particularly demanding especially in the present scenario of emerging multiple drug resistant microorganisms.

In the case of arrested spreading, the lateral expansion of the biofilm is confined, albeit the colony is biologically active. However, a small reduction in the surface tension of the biofilm is sufficient to induce spreading. The incorporation of surface forces into our hydrodynamic model allows us to capture this transition in biofilm spreading behavior.","authors":[{"name":"Sarah Trinschek"},{"name":"Karin John"},{"name":"Sigolène Lecuyer"},{"name":"Uwe Thiele"}],"keywords":[]},"article323":{"pmid":"28949325","title":"Microbial megacities fueled by methane oxidation in a mineral spring cave.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Massive biofilms have been discovered in the cave of an iodine-rich former medicinal spring in southern Germany. The biofilms completely cover the walls and ceilings of the cave, giving rise to speculations about their metabolism. Here we report on first insights into the structure and function of the biofilm microbiota, combining geochemical, imaging and molecular analytics. Stable isotope analysis indicated that thermogenic methane emerging into the cave served as an important driver of biofilm formation. The undisturbed cavern atmosphere contained up to 3000 p.p.m. methane and was microoxic. A high abundance and diversity of aerobic methanotrophs primarily within the Methylococcales (Gammaproteobacteria) and methylotrophic Methylophilaceae (Betaproteobacteria) were found in the biofilms, along with a surprising diversity of associated heterotrophic bacteria. The highest methane oxidation potentials were measured for submerged biofilms on the cavern wall. Highly organized globular structures of the biofilm matrix were revealed by fluorescent lectin staining. We propose that the extracellular matrix served not only as an electron sink for nutrient-limited biofilm methylotrophs but potentially also as a diffusive barrier against volatilized iodine species. Possible links between carbon and iodine cycling in this peculiar habitat are discussed.","authors":[{"name":"Clemens Karwautz"},{"name":"Günter Kus"},{"name":"Michael Stöckl"},{"name":"Thomas R Neu"},{"name":"Tillmann Lueders"}],"keywords":[]},"article324":{"pmid":"28949068","title":"Phototrophic microbes form endolithic biofilms in ikaite tufa columns (SW Greenland).","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Marine tufa-columns, formed by the hydrated carbonate mineral ikaite, present a unique alkaline microbial habitat only found in Ikka Fjord (SW-Greenland).

We present a detailed study of the optical microenvironment, spatial organization, and photosynthetic activity of endolithic phototrophs within the porous ikaite crystal matrix. Cyanobacteria and diatoms formed distinctly coloured zones and were closely associated with ikaite-crystals via excretion of exopolymers. Scalar-irradiance measurements showed strong attenuation of visible light (400-700 nm), where only ∼1% of incident irradiance remained at 20 mm depth. Transmission spectra showed in vivo absorption signatures of diatom and cyanobacterial photopigments, which were confirmed by HPLC-analysis. Variable-chlorophyll-fluorescence-imaging showed active photosynthesis with high-light acclimation in the outer diatom layer, and low-light acclimation in the underlying cyanobacterial part. Phototrophs in ikaite thus thrive in polymer-bound endolithic biofilms in a complex gradient microhabitat experiencing constant slow percolation of highly alkaline phosphate-enriched spring water mixing with cold seawater at the tufa-column-apex.

Furthermore, biofilms, as visualized by alcian blue staining and atomic force microscopy, were observed within the tissue where the degradation of connective tissue fibers was prominent.

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two LCFA-CoA synthetases, ScFaa1p and ScFaa4p. The disruption of ScFAA1 and ScFAA4 leads to synthetic lethality in the presence of a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor-cerulenin. The homologue-CaFAA4-rescued the lethality of an S. cerevisiae Scfaa1-Scfaa4 double mutant in the presence of cerulenin. On the other hand, a C. albicans faa4 mutant was unable to grow in the presence of cerulenin even if LCFAs were provided exogenously. Moreover, a biofilm analysis showed that the metabolic activity of the Cafaa4 mutant was approximately 40% lower than that of the wild-type parent, even though there was no significant difference in cell number or cell morphology between these strains. Notably, the Cafaa4 mutant showed increased susceptibility to micafungin during biofilm formation, a phenotype that presumably can be attributed to the impaired metabolism of the mutant strain.

Indeed, in their direct environment, bacteria are often faced with conditions that remove cell-bound water through air-drying of the atmosphere. Bacterial cells are subject to daily or seasonal environmental variations, sometimes going through periods of severe desiccation. This is also the case in the food industry, where air dehumidification treatments are applied after the daily cleaning-disinfection procedures. In plants producing low-water activity products, it is also usual to significantly reduce or eliminate water usage. Periodic desiccation exposure affects bacteria viability and so they require strategies to persist. Negative effects of desiccation are wide ranging and include direct cellular damage but also changes in the biochemical and biophysical properties of cells for which planktonic cells are more exposed than cells in biofilm.

Its remarkable ability to assemble structured biofilms has been its major known pathogenic feature to date. Notwithstanding important discoveries that have been accomplished, several questions about S. epidermidis biofilm formation still remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to assess whether iron availability modulates S. epidermidis biofilm formation and, if so, to explore how such modulation occurs. Biofilms of three S. epidermidis strains were grown under iron-enriched/-deficient conditions and several physiologic and transcriptomic changes were assessed. Our data revealed that while physiologic iron levels do not compromise biofilm formation, iron excess or deficiency is detrimental for this process. Conversely, biofilm cells were not affected in the same way when grown planktonically. By studying biofilm cells in detail we found that their viability and cultivability were seriously compromised by iron deficiency. Also, a temporal analysis of biofilm formation revealed that iron excess/deficiency: i) impaired biomass accumulation from 6h onwards, and ii) induced changes in the biofilm structure, indicating that iron availability plays a pivotal role from an early biofilm development stage. The expression of several putative iron-related genes, namely encoding siderophore biosynthesis/transport-related proteins, was found to be modulated by iron availability, providing a biological validation of their function on S. epidermidis iron metabolism.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the contribution of T6SS in Aaa strain RS2 virulence using insertional deletion mutation and complementation approaches. This strain produced weak virulence but contains a complete T6SS gene cluster based on a genome-wide analysis. Here we compared the virulence-related phenotypes between the wild-type (RS-2) and 25 T6SS mutants, which were constructed using homologous recombination methods. The mutation of 15 T6SS genes significantly reduced bacterial virulence and the secretion of Hcp protein.

It is important to determine the properties of these causative microorganisms in order to make appropriate treatment of such infections. The aims of our study were to evaluate the biofilm formation of coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) which were causative agents of bloodstream (BSI) and catheter related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI), to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of planktonic forms and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of sessile forms for vancomycin and daptomycin and to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotics in infections with biofilm-forming isolates in vitro. A total of 65 CoNS (n= 26 catheter colonizers, n= 28 CR-BSI, n= 11 BSI agents) were identified by conventional methods and also with BD Phoenix (Becton Dickinson, USA) and Bruker Microflex MS (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) systems. Methicillin resistance was determined by the presence of mecA gene with PCR. MIC values of vancomycin and daptomycin were investigated by broth microdilution, for daptomycin medium containing 25 and 50 μg/ml Ca++ were used. Assessment of biofilm formation and detection of MBEC were determined by microplate method. The clonal relationship was investigated by the PFGE method. A total of 65 isolates; 26 catheter colonizers, 28 CR-BSI agents and 11 BSI agents were evaluated and identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis (n= 33), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n= 16), Staphylococcus hominis (n= 15), and Staphylococcus capitis (n= 1). 81.5% of the isolates were found to be methicillin resistant and all of them were found to be sensitive to vancomycin (MIC= 0.125-4 μg/ml) and daptomycin (MIC= 0.062-0.25 μg/ml in 25 μg/ml Ca++ and MIC= 0.031-0.50 μg/ml in 50 μg/ml Ca++ containing medium). MIC values were lower in medium containing 50 μg/ml Ca++ for daptomycin. As it is known that the efficacy of daptomycin depends on the physiological levels of Ca++, which causes conformational changes in the structure of these antibacterials. Our findings also suggested that high levels of Ca++ are needed to ensure the efficacy of daptomycin. All of the isolates produced biofilm at different strengths of positivity (n= 12/18.5% weak, n= 35/%53.8 moderate, n= 18/%27.7 strong). MBEC and MBEC/MIC values for vancomycin were found to be higher than daptomycin (p< 0.001). Strong biofilm producers had higher MBEC and MBEC/MIC, MBEC50/MIC50 ve MBEC90/MIC90 values (p< 0.05). Especially in infections with biofilm forming isolates, the detection of only MIC values are not always sufficient in the treatment of biofilm-related infections as they reflect the sensitivity of planktonic bacteria. The inconsistency between the MIC and MBEC values and the high rates of MBEC/MIC found in our study supported this prediction.The lower detection of MBEC and MBEC/MIC values of daptomycin compared to the same values of vancomycin suggested that daptomycin might be effective at lower doses than vancomycin in the treatment of biofilm infections.","authors":[{"name":"Duygu Nilüfer Öcal"},{"name":"İştar Dolapçı"},{"name":"Zeynep Gençtürk"},{"name":"Alper Tekeli"}],"keywords":[]},"article388":{"pmid":"28929793","title":"Stainless steel and polyethylene surfaces functionalized with silver nanoparticles.","date":"2018-07-19","abs":"The antimicrobial effects of a stainless steel surface and a polyethylene surface functionalized with silver nanoparticles on the adhesion of different bacteria and the changes in physical and chemical characteristics of these surfaces that influence biofilm formation were evaluated.

One of the most important virulence factors in this pathogen is the siderophore pyoverdine. Pyoverdine serves several critical roles during infection. Due to its extremely high affinity for ferric iron, pyoverdine gives the pathogen a significant advantage over the host in their competition for iron. In addition, pyoverdine can regulate the production of multiple bacterial virulence factors and perturb host mitochondrial homeostasis. Inhibition of pyoverdine biosynthesis decreases P. aeruginosa pathogenicity in multiple host models. To better understand the regulation of pyoverdine production, we developed a high-throughput genetic screen that uses the innate fluorescence of pyoverdine to identify genes necessary for its biosynthesis. A substantial number of hits showing severe impairment of pyoverdine production were in genes responsible for early attachment and biofilm formation. In addition to genetic disruption of biofilm, both physical and chemical perturbations also attenuated pyoverdine production. This regulatory relationship between pyoverdine and biofilm is particularly significant in the context of P. aeruginosa multidrug resistance, where the formation of biofilm is a key mechanism preventing access to antimicrobials and the immune system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the biofilm inhibitor 2-amino-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole effectively attenuates pyoverdine production and rescues Caenorhabditis elegans from P. aeruginosa-mediated pathogenesis. Our findings suggest that targeting biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa infections may have multiple therapeutic benefits and that employing an unbiased, systems biology-based approach may be useful for understanding the regulation of specific virulence factors and identifying novel anti-virulence therapeutics or new applications for existing therapies for P. aeruginosa infections.","authors":[{"name":"Donghoon Kang"},{"name":"Natalia V Kirienko"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"anti-virulence"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"biofilm inhibitors"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"high-throughput screen"},{"word":"pyoverdine"}]},"article391":{"pmid":"28928721","title":"Onion Peel Ethylacetate Fraction and Its Derived Constituent Quercetin 4'-O-β-D Glucopyranoside Attenuates Quorum Sensing Regulated Virulence and Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The resistance and pathogenesis of bacteria could be related to their ability to sense and respond to population density, termed quorum sensing (QS).

Here, we describe the green berry consortia of the Sippewissett salt marsh (Falmouth, MA, United States): millimeter-sized aggregates dominated by an uncultured, diazotrophic unicellular cyanobacterium of the order Chroococcales (termed GB-CYN1). We show that GB-CYN1 is closely related to Crocosphaera watsonii (UCYN-B) and Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A), two groups of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria that play an important role in marine primary production. Other green berry consortium members include pennate diatoms and putative heterotrophic bacteria from the Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Tight coupling was observed between photosynthetic oxygen production and heterotrophic respiration. When illuminated, the green berries became supersaturated with oxygen. From the metagenome, we observed that GB-CYN1 encodes photosystem II genes and thus has the metabolic potential for oxygen production unlike UCYN-A. In darkness, respiratory activity rapidly depleted oxygen creating anoxia within the aggregates. Metagenomic data revealed a suite of nitrogen fixation genes encoded by GB-CYN1, and nitrogenase activity was confirmed at the whole-aggregate level by acetylene reduction assays. Metagenome reads homologous to marker genes for denitrification were observed and suggest that heterotrophic denitrifiers might co-occur in the green berries, although the physiology and activity of facultative anaerobes in these aggregates remains uncharacterized. Nitrogen fixation in the surface ocean was long thought to be driven by filamentous cyanobacterial aggregates, though recent work has demonstrated the importance of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria (UCYN) from the order Chroococcales. The green berries serve as a useful contrast to studies of open ocean UCYN and may provide a tractable model system to investigate microbial dynamics within phytoplankton aggregates, a phenomenon of global importance to the flux of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen in surface waters.","authors":[{"name":"Elizabeth G Wilbanks"},{"name":"Verena Salman-Carvalho"},{"name":"Ulrike Jaekel"},{"name":"Parris T Humphrey"},{"name":"Jonathan A Eisen"},{"name":"Daniel H Buckley"},{"name":"Stephen H Zinder"}],"keywords":[{"word":"UCYN-A"},{"word":"UCYN-B"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"cyanobacteria"},{"word":"marine aggregate"},{"word":"nitrogen fixation"},{"word":"salt marsh"},{"word":"unicellular cyanobacteria"}]},"article393":{"pmid":"28928474","title":"Using experimental evolution to identify druggable targets that could inhibit the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.","date":"2019-05-01","abs":"With multi-drug and pan-drug-resistant bacteria becoming increasingly common in hospitals, antibiotic resistance has threatened to return us to a pre-antibiotic era that would completely undermine modern medicine. There is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics and strategies to combat resistance that are substantially different from earlier drug discovery efforts. One such strategy that would complement current and future antibiotics would be a class of co-drugs that target the evolution of resistance and thereby extend the efficacy of specific classes of antibiotics. A critical step in the development of such strategies lies in understanding the critical evolutionary trajectories responsible for resistance and which proteins or biochemical pathways within those trajectories would be good candidates for co-drug discovery. We identify the most important steps in the evolution of resistance for a specific pathogen and antibiotic combination by evolving highly polymorphic populations of pathogens to resistance in a novel bioreactor that favors biofilm development. As the populations evolve to increasing drug concentrations, we use deep sequencing to elucidate the network of genetic changes responsible for resistance and subsequent in vitro biochemistry and often structure determination to determine how the adaptive mutations produce resistance. Importantly, the identification of the molecular steps, their frequency within the populations and their chronology within the evolutionary trajectory toward resistance is critical to assessing their relative importance. In this work, we discuss findings from the evolution of the ESKAPE pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to the drug of last resort, colistin to illustrate the power of this approach.","authors":[{"name":"Heer H Mehta"},{"name":"Amy G Prater"},{"name":"Yousif Shamoo"}],"keywords":[]},"article394":{"pmid":"28928400","title":"Inhibiting P. fluorescens biofilms with fluoropolymer-embedded silver nanoparticles: an in-situ spectroscopic study.","date":"2019-06-25","abs":"Surface colonization by microorganisms leads to the formation of biofilms, i.e. aggregates of bacteria embedded within a matrix of extracellular polymeric substance.

C-di-GMP regulates various cellular processes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. BolA is a transcription factor that promotes survival in different stresses and is also involved in biofilm formation. Both BolA and c-di-GMP participate in the regulation of motility mechanisms leading to similar phenotypes. Here, we establish the importance of the balance between these two factors for accurate regulation of the transition between the planktonic and sessile lifestyles. This balance is achieved by negative-feedback regulation of BolA and c-di-GMP. BolA not only contributes directly to the motility of bacteria but also regulates the expression of diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases. This expression modulation influences the synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP, while this signaling metabolite has a negative influence in bolA mRNA transcription. Finally, we present evidence of the dominant role of BolA in biofilm, showing that, even in the presence of elevated c-di-GMP levels, biofilm formation is reduced in the absence of BolA. C-di-GMP is one of the most important bacterial second messengers involved in several cellular processes, including virulence, cell cycle regulation, biofilm formation, and flagellar synthesis. In this study, we unravelled a direct connection between the bolA morphogene and the c-di-GMP signaling molecule. We show the important cross-talk that occurs between these two molecular regulators during the transition between the motile/planktonic and adhesive/sessile lifestyles in Escherichia coli This work provides important clues that can be helpful in the development of new strategies, and the results can be applied to other organisms with relevance for human health.","authors":[{"name":"Ricardo N Moreira"},{"name":"Clémentine Dressaire"},{"name":"Susana Barahona"},{"name":"Lisete Galego"},{"name":"Volkhard Kaever"},{"name":"Urs Jenal"},{"name":"Cecília M Arraiano"}],"keywords":[{"word":"BolA"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"diguanylate cyclase"},{"word":"motility"},{"word":"phosphodiesterase"}]},"article396":{"pmid":"28927409","title":"Biological and physicochemical properties of biosurfactants produced by Lactobacillus jensenii P","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Lactobacillus species produce biosurfactants that can contribute to the bacteria's ability to prevent microbial infections associated with urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts and the skin.

In this method, upstream and downstream sequences of the gene/locus to be deleted are amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and seamlessly fused with the linearized pEX18Tc sacB suicide plasmid by Gibson assembly. The resulting deletion plasmid is transformed into P. aeruginosa by an electroporation method optimized in this study.
