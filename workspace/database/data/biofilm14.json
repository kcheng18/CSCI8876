The selenate reduction profiles of D. lacustris were investigated by varying selenate concentration, inoculum size, concentration and source of organic electron donor in minimal salt medium. Interestingly, the bacterium was able to reduce both selenate and selenite under aerobic conditions. Although considerable removal of selenate was observed at all concentrations investigated, D. lacustris was able to completely reduce 0.1 mM selenate within 96 h using lactate as the carbon source. Around 62.2% unaccounted selenium (unidentified organo-selenium compounds), 10.9% elemental selenium and 26.9% selenite were determined in the medium after complete reduction of selenate. Studies of the enzymatic activity of the cell fractions show that the selenite/selenate reducing enzymes were intracellular and independent of NADPH availability. D. lacustris shows an unique metabolism of selenium oxyanions to form elemental selenium and possibly also selenium ester compounds, thus a potential candidate for the remediation of selenium-contaminated wastewaters in aerobic environments. This novel finding will advance the field of bioremediation of selenium-contaminated sites and selenium bio-recovery and the production of potentially beneficial organic and inorganic reactive selenium species.","authors":[{"name":"Shrutika L Wadgaonkar"},{"name":"Yarlagadda V Nancharaiah"},{"name":"Claus Jacob"},{"name":"Giovanni Esposito"},{"name":"Piet N L Lens"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Delftia lacustris"},{"word":"aerobic selenate reduction"},{"word":"bioremediation"},{"word":"organo-selenium compounds"},{"word":"selenium speciation"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"30899248","title":"Nucleotide Second Messenger-Based Signaling in Extreme Acidophiles of the Acidithiobacillus Species Complex: Partition Between the Core and Variable Gene Complements.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Cyclic and linear nucleotides are key elements of the signal transduction networks linking perception of the environment to specific cellular behavior of prokaryotes. These molecular mechanisms are particularly important in bacteria exposed to different, and frequently simultaneous, types of extreme conditions. This is the case in acidithiobacilli, a group of extremophilic bacteria thriving in highly acidic biotopes, that must also cope with significant variations in temperature, osmotic potentials and concentrations of various transition metals and metalloids. Environmental cues sensed by bacteria are transduced into differential levels of nucleotides acting as intracellular second messengers, promoting the activation or inhibition of target components and eliciting different output phenotypes. Cyclic (c) di-GMP, one of the most common bacterial second messengers, plays a key role in lifestyle changes in many bacteria, including acidithiobacilli. The presence of functional c-di-GMP-dependent signal transduction pathways in representative strains of the best-known linages of this species complex has been reported. However, a comprehensive panorama of the c-di-GMP modulated networks, the cognate input signals and output responses, are still missing for this group of extremophiles. Moreover, little fundamental understanding has been gathered for other nucleotides acting as second messengers. Taking advantage of the increasing number of sequenced genomes of the taxon, here we address the challenge of disentangling the nucleotide-driven signal transduction pathways in this group of polyextremophiles using comparative genomic tools and strategies. Results indicate that the acidithiobacilli possess all the genetic elements required to establish functional transduction pathways based in three different nucleotide-second messengers: (p)ppGpp, cyclic AMP (cAMP), and c-di-GMP. The elements related with the metabolism and transduction of (p)ppGpp and cAMP appear highly conserved, integrating signals related with nutrient starvation and polyphosphate metabolism, respectively. In contrast, c-di-GMP networks appear diverse and complex, differing both at the species and strain levels. Molecular elements of c-di-GMP metabolism and transduction were mostly found scattered along the flexible genome of the acidithiobacilli, allowing the identification of probable control modules that could be critical for substrate colonization, biofilm development and intercellular interactions. These may ultimately convey increased endurance to environmental stress and increased potential for gene sharing and adaptation to changing conditions.","authors":[{"name":"Ana Moya-Beltrán"},{"name":"Camila Rojas-Villalobos"},{"name":"Mauricio Díaz"},{"name":"Nicolás Guiliani"},{"name":"Raquel Quatrini"},{"name":"Matías Castro"}],"keywords":[{"word":"(p)ppGpp"},{"word":"Acidithiobacillia"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"c-di-GMP"},{"word":"cAMP"},{"word":"extremophile"},{"word":"nucleotide second messenger"},{"word":"signal transduction"}]},"article2":{"pmid":"30898559","title":"Scientific evidence in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: An alternative approach for reducing cariogenic bacteria.","date":"2020-01-13","abs":"Several studies of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) have been performed to verify the efficiency of this treatment against caries-related microorganisms.

In the last decades, several lines of evidence have supported the existence of a relationship between periodontitis and systemic health. For instance, as periodontitis acts within the same chronic inflammatory model seen in cardiovascular disease (CVD), or other disorders, such as diabetes, several studies have suggested the existence of a bi-directional link between periodontal health and these pathologies. For instance, people with diabetes are more susceptible to infections and are more likely to suffer from periodontitis than people without this syndrome. Analogously, it is now evident that cardiac disorders are worsened by periodontitis, both experimentally and in humans. For all these reasons, it is very plausible that preventing periodontitis has an impact on the onset or progression of CVD and diabetes.

The urochordate, Ciona robusta, is a model organism that has been adapted to experimental studies of host/microbiome interactions. Ciona variable-region containing chitin-binding proteins (VCBPs) are innate immune effectors, composed of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable regions and a chitin-binding domain (CBD) and are expressed in high abundance in the gut. It was previously shown that VCBP-C binds bacteria and influences both phagocytosis by granular amoebocytes and biofilm formation via its Ig domains. We show here that the CBD of VCBP-C independently recognizes chitin molecules present in the cell walls, sporangia (spore-forming bodies), and spores of a diverse set of filamentous fungi isolated from the gut of Ciona.

Because the incubation temperature can influence both the reactivity of electron mediators and cell growth, it may also affect the electron-shuttle-mediated extracellular electron transfer (EET) process. Here, the effect of incubation temperature (22-38°C) was investigated in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and 50 μM of 9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS). We found that current generation increased as the temperature was increased from 22 to 34°C and then decreased sharply at 38°C. The biofilm biomass, as indicated by the total protein extracted from the electrode, increased as the temperature increased from 22 to 34°C and then decreased at 38°C, mirroring the current generation results. These results were further confirmed by increasing the temperature slowly, step-by-step, in a single BES with a constant biofilm biomass, suggesting that the EET rates could be substantially influenced by temperature, even with the same biofilm. The effects of temperature on the AQS bioreduction rate, c-type cytochrome (c-Cyts)-bound-cofactor-mediated EET, the AQS mid-point potential, and the AQS diffusion coefficient were studied. From these results, we were able to conclude that temperature influenced the EET rates by changing the c-Cyts-bound-cofactor-mediated EET process and the AQS bioreduction rate, and that the change in biofilm formation was a dominant factor influencing the overall EET rates. These findings should contribute to the fundamental understanding of EET processes. Moreover, optimization of the operating parameters for current generation will be helpful for the practical application of bioelectrochemical techniques.","authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu"},{"name":"Yundang Wu"},{"name":"Tongxu Liu"},{"name":"Fangbai Li"},{"name":"Hui Dong"},{"name":"Meiqing Jing"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"extracellular electron transfer"},{"word":"mediator"},{"word":"redox transformation"},{"word":"temperature"}]},"article15":{"pmid":"30894842","title":"Shear Stress Affects Biofilm Structure and Consequently Current Generation of Bioanode in Microbial Electrochemical Systems (MESs).","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Shear stress is an important factor that affects the formation and structure of anode biofilms, which are strongly related to the extracellular electron transfer phenomena and bioelectric performance of bioanodes.

Gingival recession etiology, animal studies, free gingival grafts, pedicle flaps (semilunar, laterally positioned, and coronally positioned), and subepithelial connective tissue grafts are extensively reviewed. The use of allografts as an alternative to subepithelial connective tissue grafts, the treatment of multiple gingival recessions, and the rationale for use of guided tissue regeneration and enamel matrix derivative in plastic periodontal procedure is discussed. We also assess how smoking can affect the treatment outcomes in plastic surgery procedures. Minimally invasive procedures are of great value in improving the features of the final tissues. The following aspects identified in this compilation were of great interest: (a) some factors, anatomical in nature, favor the formation of root recessions, but it is the inflammatory process (caused by the presence of biofilm and/or by traumatic toothbrushing) that is responsible for the development of root recessions; and (b) pedicle flap procedures (especially the coronally positioned flap) are extremely versatile and have the most predictable outcome of all root-coverage procedures, especially when combined with subepithelial connective tissue grafting and/or allogeneic grafts. In summary: subepithelial connective tissue grafting is considered as the first option to augment gingival width and thickness, and it may provide better long-term results; the same principles of root-coverage procedures in individual sites appear be used in clinical practice also for multiple-recession type defects; an allograft is an efficient alternative to a subepithelial connective tissue graft and, when it is the treatment option of choice, the use of wide, extended flaps should be considered; because of the superiority of plastic periodontal procedures over guided tissue regeneration and the technical difficulty of the latter, guided tissue regeneration has become obsolete for root-coverage procedures; there is rather a large body of evidence attesting that smoking negatively influences root-coverage procedures, especially subepithelial connective tissue grafts; and minimally invasive techniques may be of great value for improving the results obtained with plastic periodontal procedures, but these techniques need to be better addressed in clinical trials, both in terms of the quality and quantity of the new tissue generated.","authors":[{"name":"Arthur Belém Novaes"},{"name":"Daniela Bazan Palioto"}],"keywords":[]},"article22":{"pmid":"30892766","title":"Maintenance therapy for teeth and implants.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"Maintenance care is mandatory for the long-term success of periodontal and implant treatment.

The main features on the controversy of the role played by trauma from occlusion on the physiologic behavior of the periodontal structures are shown, together with how deviations from the normal characteristics of this relationship itself affect the integrity of the periodontal tissues when or associated with dental biofilm in the presence or not of periodontal pockets have arisen. The literature provides evidence showing that the very first publication to establish a strong correlation between trauma from occlusion and periodontal pockets in humans was of Latin-American origin. However, subsequently, trauma from occlusion was mostly evaluated by an American group, followed by a Scandinavian group, yet with some contributions from the Latin-American group. Basically trauma from occlusion has been correlated with periodontal pockets in view of the fact that these would render the periodontal supporting tissues more amenable to the spread of inflammation of biofilm-related periodontal pockets. This would facilitate the fast deepening of periodontal pockets, influencing the generation of infrabony periodontal pockets or suprabony periodontal pockets that are deeper than in areas without trauma from occlusion. The factors related to these different behaviors are discussed. Several clinical cases are presented showing evidence that corroborates the possibility of an actual interrelationship between trauma from occlusion and periodontitis. Theoretical evaluations based on recent advances of the mechanisms involving molecular modulation in physiological and altered occlusal functions, as well as on research data, and evaluations from data of clinical cases, support the assumption that trauma from occlusion and periodontitis may embrace the unique pathologic condition of the associated lesion trauma from occlusion plus periodontitis or act independently even if both co-exist simultaneously in a particular case. The link between both conditions that was emphasized as definitively necessary in order for an associated lesion to develop is that both lesions, namely trauma from occlusion and periodontitis, occur in their destructive stage at exactly the same time. This involvement would explain why so many different data are presented in the literature and hopefully will shed some light for development of new methodologies of research. Clinical cases were selected to present a treatment philosophy on the subject.","authors":[{"name":"Euloir Passanezi"},{"name":"Adriana Campos Passanezi Sant'Ana"}],"keywords":[{"word":"combined lesion"},{"word":"pathogenesis"},{"word":"periodontal disease"},{"word":"traumatogenic occlusion"}]},"article24":{"pmid":"30892761","title":"Periodontal herpesvirus morbidity and treatment.","date":"2019-11-26","abs":"Four billion individuals worldwide have a history of periodontitis, with the poorest people in society most affected.

Periodontal herpesviruses that disseminate via the systemic circulation to nonoral sites may represent a major link between periodontitis and systemic diseases. Current treatment of periodontitis focuses almost exclusively on bacterial biofilm and will require revision.

In this work, we sought to measure in vivo antimicrobial release from PNDJ hydrogels and the antimicrobial concentrations provided in adjacent tissues. PNDJ hydrogels containing tobramycin and vancomycin were administered in four dosing sites in rabbits (intramedullary in the femoral canal, soft tissue defect in the quadriceps, intramuscular injection in the hamstrings, and intra-articular injection in the knee). Gel and tissue were collected up to 72 h after dosing and drug levels were analyzed. In vivo antimicrobial release (43-95% after 72 h) was markedly faster than in vitro release. Drug levels varied significantly depending on the dosing site but not between polymer formulations tested. Notably, total antimicrobial concentrations in adjacent tissue in all dosing sites were sustained at estimated biofilm-eradicating levels for at least 24 h (461-3161 μg/mL at 24 h).

Pilus-mediated initial adherence of N. meningitidis to the epithelial mucosa is followed by the formation of three-dimensional aggregates, called microcolonies. Dispersal from microcolonies contributes to the transmission of N. meningitidis across the epithelial mucosa. We have recently discovered that environmental concentrations of host cell-derived lactate influences N. meningitidis microcolony dispersal. Here, we examined the ability of N. meningitidis mutants deficient in lactate metabolism to form biofilms. A lactate dehydrogenease A (ldhA) mutant had an increased level of biofilm formation. Deletion of ldhA increased the N. meningitidis cell surface hydrophobicity and aggregation. In this study, we used FAM20, which belongs to clonal complex ST-11 that forms biofilms independently of extracellular DNA (eDNA). However, treatment with DNase I abolished the increased biofilm formation and aggregation of the ldhA-deficient mutant, suggesting a critical role for eDNA. Compared to wild-type, the ldhA-deficient mutant exhibited an increased autolytic rate, with significant increases in the eDNA concentrations in the culture supernatants and in biofilms. Within the ldhA mutant biofilm, the transcription levels of the capsule, pilus, and bacterial lysis genes were downregulated, while norB, which is associated with anaerobic respiration, was upregulated. These findings suggest that the absence of ldhA in N. meningitidis promotes biofilm formation and aggregation through autolysis-mediated DNA release.","authors":[{"name":"Sara Sigurlásdóttir"},{"name":"Gabriela M Wassing"},{"name":"Fanglei Zuo"},{"name":"Melanie Arts"},{"name":"Ann-Beth Jonsson"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Neisseria meningitidis"},{"word":"autolysis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"eDNA"},{"word":"lactate dehydrogenase"}]},"article31":{"pmid":"30891013","title":"Corrigendum: Flor Yeast Diversity and Dynamics in Biologically Aged Wines.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02235.].","authors":[{"name":"Vanessa David-Vaizant"},{"name":"Hervé Alexandre"}],"keywords":[{"word":"FLO11"},{"word":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"flor yeast"},{"word":"scanning electron microscopy"},{"word":"vin jaune"},{"word":"wine"}]},"article32":{"pmid":"30890906","title":"Common miRNA Patterns of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease and Their Putative Impact on Commensal Gut Microbiota.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"With the rise of Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) methods, Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have achieved an important position in the research landscape and have been found to present valuable diagnostic tools in various diseases such as multiple sclerosis or lung cancer. There is also emerging evidence that miRNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). Apparently, these diseases come along with changes in miRNA expression patterns which led to attempts from researchers to use these small RNA species from several body fluids for a better diagnosis and in order to observe disease progression. Additionally, it became evident that microbial commensals might play an important role for pathology development and were shown to have a significantly different composition in patients suffering from neurodegeneration compared with healthy controls. As it could recently be shown that secreted miRNAs are able to enter microbial organisms, it is conceivable that the host's miRNA might affect the gut microbial ecosystem. As such, miRNAs may inherit a central role in shaping the diseased microbiome and thereby mutually act on the characteristics of these neurodegenerative diseases. We have therefore (1) compiled a list of miRNAs known to be associated with AD and/or PD, (2) performed an in silico target screen for binding sites of these miRNA on human gut metagenome sequences and (3) evaluated the hit list for interesting matches potentially relevant to the etiology of AD and or PD. The examination of protein identifiers connected to bacterial secretion system, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation revealed an overlap of 37 bacterial proteins that were targeted by human miRNAs. The identified links of miRNAs to the biological processes of bacteria connected to AD and PD have yet to be validated via in vivo experiments.

In porous media, biofilms grow to clog partially or totally the pore network. Dynamics of biofilm accumulation (e.g., by attachment, detachment, advective transport in depth) and their impact on both surface and deep bioclogging are still not yet fully understood. To address this concern, a 104 day-long outdoor infiltration experiment in sand tanks was performed, using secondary treated wastewater and two grain size distributions (GSDs): a monolayer system filled with fine sand, and a bilayer one composed by a layer of coarse sand placed on top of a layer of fine sand. Biofilm dynamics as a function of GSD and depth were studied through cross-correlations and multivariate statistical analyses using different parameters from biofilm biomass and activity indices, plus hydraulic parameters measured at different depths. Bioclogging (both surface and deep) was found more significant in the monolayer fine system than in the bilayer coarse-fine one, possibly due to an early low-cohesive biofilm formation in the former, driven by lower porosity and lower fluxes; under such conditions biomass is favorably detached from the top layer, transported and accumulated in depth, so that new biomass might colonize the surface.

Here we show that these four genes form an operon, whose transcription is driven from the upstream PflhA promoter. A second promoter, PflhF, provides additional transcription of the three distal genes. PflhA and PflhF are σN-dependent, activated by the flagellar regulator FleQ, and negatively regulated by FleN. Motility, surface adhesion and colonization defects of a transposon insertion mutant in flhF revealed transcriptional polarity on fleN and fliA, as the former was required for strong surface adhesion and biofilm formation, and the latter was required for flagellar synthesis. On the other hand, FlhF and FleN were necessary to attain proper flagellar location and number for a fully functional flagellar complement. FleN, along with FleQ and the second messenger c-di-GMP differentially regulated transcription of lapA and the bcs operon, encoding a large adhesion protein and cellulose synthase. FleQ positively regulated the PlapA promoter and activation was antagonized by FleN and c-di-GMP. PbcsD was negatively regulated by FleQ and FleN, and repression was antagonized by c-di-GMP. FleN promoted FleQ binding to both PlapA and PbcsD in vitro, while c-di-GMP antagonized interaction with PbcsD and stimulated interaction with PlapA. A single FleQ binding site in PlapA was critical to activation in vivo.

Another beneficial feature of our prototype dressing is prolonged release of gentamycin, which provides efficient protection from microbial contamination and subsequent infection.

The higBA locus of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes a type II TA system. Previous work found that the higBA operon is cotranscribed and that HigB toxin regulates biofilm formation and virulence expression. In this study, we demonstrate that HigA antitoxin is produced at a higher level than HigB and that higA mRNA is expressed separately from a promoter inside higB during the late stationary phase. Critically, HigA represses the expression of mvfR, which is an important virulence-related regulator, by binding to a conserved HigA palindrome (5'-TTAAC GTTAA-3') in the mvfR promoter, and the binding of HigB to HigA derepresses this process. During the late stationary phase, excess HigA represses the expression of mvfR and higBA. However, in the presence of aminoglycoside antibiotics where Lon protease is activated, the degradation of HigA by Lon increases P. aeruginosa virulence by simultaneously derepressing mvfR and higB transcription. Therefore, this study reveals that the antitoxin of the P. aeruginosa TA system is integrated into the key virulence regulatory network of the host and functions as a transcriptional repressor to control the production of virulence factors.","authors":[{"name":"Yunxue Guo"},{"name":"Chenglong Sun"},{"name":"Yangmei Li"},{"name":"Kaihao Tang"},{"name":"Songwei Ni"},{"name":"Xiaoxue Wang"}],"keywords":[]},"article71":{"pmid":"30882982","title":"Prophage LambdaSo uses replication interference to suppress reproduction of coexisting temperate phage MuSo2 in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.","date":"2020-03-13","abs":"Many bacterial genomes carry multiple prophages that compete with each other, potentially affecting the physiology, fitness, and pathogenicity of their hosts. However, molecular mechanisms of such prophage-prophage conflicts remain poorly understood. The genome of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, a Gammaproteobacterium residing in aquatic environments and notable for its ability to reduce metal ions, harbours four prophages, two of which (LambdaSo and MuSo2) form infectious virions during biofilm formation. Here, we constructed indicator strains of LambdaSo and MuSo2 by deleting the corresponding prophages from the MR-1 chromosome and investigated their reproduction. Interestingly, the fitness of MuSo2 increased in the absence of LambdaSo, suggesting that prophage LambdaSo repressed MuSo2 reproduction. Partial deletion of LambdaSo from the MR-1 chromosome revealed that gene cluster R of LambdaSo, which was responsible for the switch to the lytic cycle and LambdaSo genome replication initiation, was necessary and sufficient to repress MuSo2. Furthermore, activation of cluster R genes facilitated replication of cluster R-encoding DNA and inhibited host and MuSo2 DNA replication. These findings suggest that LambdaSo represses MuSo2 propagation by inhibiting DNA replication during simultaneous induction. We predict that such a mechanism of inter-prophage interference is more widespread in bacteria than currently appreciated.","authors":[{"name":"Qinggong Guo"},{"name":"Beibei Chen"},{"name":"Yishuai Tu"},{"name":"Shishen Du"},{"name":"Xiangdong Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article72":{"pmid":"30882300","title":"In vitro activities of daptomycin combined with fosfomycin or rifampin on planktonic and adherent linezolid-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.","date":"2019-03-21","abs":"This study aimed to explore daptomycin combined with fosfomycin or rifampin against the planktonic and adherent linezolid-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.","authors":[{"name":"Jin-Xin Zheng"},{"name":"Xiang Sun"},{"name":"Zhi-Wei Lin"},{"name":"Guo-Bin Qi"},{"name":"Hao-Peng Tu"},{"name":"Yang Wu"},{"name":"Si-Bo Jiang"},{"name":"Zhong Chen"},{"name":"Qi-Wen Deng"},{"name":"Di Qu"},{"name":"Zhi-Jian Yu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"daptomycin"},{"word":"fosfomycin"},{"word":"linezolid-resistant"},{"word":"rifampin"}]},"article73":{"pmid":"30882296","title":"Introducing BAIT (Biofilm Architecture Inference Tool): a software program to evaluate the architecture of oral multi-species biofilms.","date":"2020-01-14","abs":"Biofilm model systems are used to study biofilm growth and predict the effects of anti-biofilm interventions within the human oral cavity.

Since multidrug resistant S. Infantis isolates are highly prevalent in the broiler meat industry and may represent a public health concern through the food chain, we aimed to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility, genetic diversity, and biofilm-forming ability of S. Infantis from Slovenian broiler flocks. A total of 87 S. Infantis strains isolated from broiler faeces in the period between 2007 and 2013 were studied. The samples originated from 41 farms which were subcontractors of three major food business operators and from two autonomously operating holdings (farms). Isolates were phenotypically tested for their susceptibility to 14 antimicrobials from nine classes by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration with the microdilution method. Only 8% of the isolates were susceptible to all of the antimicrobial agents tested, while 88.5% of the isolates were multidrug resistant, with the most common resistance pattern CipNxSSuT (65.5%) followed by CipNxSuT (17.2%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) divided the strains into five clusters (A-E) comprising 16 distinct XbaI PFGE profiles. Sixty-five out of 87 isolates were grouped in clusters A and B, with the predominant PFGE profiles A1 and B1 encompassing 33 and 28 isolates, respectively. A vast majority of the isolates (75/87) showed >90% PFGE profile similarity. The biofilm-forming capacity of the tested isolates, determined with crystal violet assay in polystyrene microwell plates, was generally weak. The average biofilm formation for persistent strains was higher than for presumably nonpersistent strains; however, the difference was not significant. It seems that S. Infantis persistence on broiler farms is more related to its widespread occurrence in the broiler production chain and ineffective disinfection protocols than to its ability to form biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Mateja Pate"},{"name":"Jasna Mičunovič"},{"name":"Majda Golob"},{"name":"Lene Karine Vestby"},{"name":"Matjaž Ocepek"}],"keywords":[]},"article75":{"pmid":"30881614","title":"'Second-generation' 1,2,3-triazole-based inhibitors of Porphyromonas gingivalis adherence to oral streptococci and biofilm formation.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Several 'second-generation' click inhibitors of the multi-species biofilm propagated by the adherence of the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis to Streptococcus gordonii were synthesized and evaluated.

Urine samples were collected from catheterized patients and processed using a standard bacteriological protocol for isolation and identification. Evaluation of in vitro biofilm formation and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of uropathogenic bacteria was done using microtiter plates and disk diffusion method, respectively. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered into SPSS version 20 for analysis. All statistical test values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Biofilms were evaluated during adhesion, development and after maturation for metabolic activity and biomass, as well as regarding ultrastructure by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. NaBut inhibited the growth of planktonic cells by 50% at 60 mM or 120 mM (p < 0.05) and also reduced filamentation of Trichosporon spp. NaBut reduced adhesion of Trichosporon cells by 45% (10xMIC) on average (p < 0.05). During biofilm development, NatBut (10xMIC) reduced metabolic activity and biomass up to 63% and 81%, respectively (p < 0.05). Mature biofilms were affected by NaBut (10xMIC), showing reduction of metabolic activity and biomass of approximately 48% and 77%, respectively (p < 0.05). Ultrastructure analysis showed that NaBut (MIC and 10xMIC) was able to disassemble mature biofilms. The present study describes the antifungal and anti-biofilm potential of NaBut against these opportunist emerging fungi.","authors":[{"name":"Rossana de Aguiar Cordeiro"},{"name":"Ana Luiza Ribeiro Aguiar"},{"name":"Vandbergue Santos Pereira"},{"name":"Lívia Maria Galdino Pereira"},{"name":"Fernando Victor Monteiro Portela"},{"name":"Raimunda Sâmia Nogueira Brilhante"},{"name":"Zoilo Pires de Camargo"},{"name":"José Júlio Costa Sidrim"},{"name":"Débora de Souza Collares Maia Castelo-Branco"},{"name":"Marcos Fábio Gadelha Rocha"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Sodium butyrate"},{"word":"Trichosporon asahii"},{"word":"Trichosporon inkin"}]},"article87":{"pmid":"30878285","title":"Effects of single species versus multispecies periodontal biofilms on the antibacterial efficacy of a novel bioactive Class-V nanocomposite.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"The objectives of this studywere to: (1) develop a novel bioactive nanocomposite for Class V restorations with subgingival margins to inhibit periodontal pathogens; and (2) investigate if the bioactive nanocomposite could inhibit multi-species periodontal biofilms with a potency as strong as that against single species biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Lin Wang"},{"name":"Xianju Xie"},{"name":"Manlin Qi"},{"name":"Michael D Weir"},{"name":"Mark A Reynolds"},{"name":"Chunyan Li"},{"name":"Chenchen Zhou"},{"name":"Hockin H K Xu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antibacterial"},{"word":"Dental composite"},{"word":"Periodontal biofilm"},{"word":"Protein-repellent"},{"word":"Root caries"},{"word":"Surface roughness"}]},"article88":{"pmid":"30877999","title":"Context-Specific Requirement of Forty-Four Two-Component Loci in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Swarming.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a coordinated movement of bacteria over semisolid surfaces (0.5%-0.7% agar).

Proteogenomic studies on N47 allowed the identification of a gene cluster with products suggested to be involved in the initial reaction of naphthalene degradation. Here, we performed comparative proteomic studies with N47 proteins extracted from naphthalene versus 2-methylnapththalene-grown cells on blue native PAGE. The analysis led to the identification of subunits of the naphthalene carboxylase of N47.

These findings were supported by a pull-down experiment revealing in vitro interaction partners of a heterologously produced GST-tagged naphthalene carboxylase subunit. Based on these lines of evidence, naphthalene carboxylase is proposed to be a complex of about 750 kDa.

The threat of selecting for resistance genes largely precludes sustained antimicrobial elution as a wide-spread clinical solution. In response, self-defensive surfaces have been developed where antimicrobial is released only when and where there is a bacterial challenge. We explore a new self-defensive approach using anionic microgels into which small-molecule cationic antimicrobials are loaded by complexation. We identify conditions where antimicrobial remains sequestered within the microgels for periods as long as weeks. However, bacterial contact triggers release and leads to local bacterial killing. We speculate that the close proximity of bacteria alters the local thermodynamic environment and interferes with the microgel-antimicrobial complexation. The contact-transfer approach does not require bacterial metabolism but instead appears to be driven by differences between the microgels and the bacterial cell envelope where there is a high concentration of negative charge and hydrophobicity. Contact with metabolizing macrophages or osteoblasts is, however, insufficient to trigger antimicrobial release, indicating that contact transfer can be specific to bacteria and suggesting an avenue to biomedical device surfaces that can simultaneously promote healing and resist infection.","authors":[{"name":"Jing Liang"},{"name":"Hongjun Wang"},{"name":"Matthew Libera"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial"},{"word":"Cell-material interactions"},{"word":"Drug delivery"},{"word":"Implant infection"},{"word":"Microgel"},{"word":"Triggered-release"}]},"article99":{"pmid":"30875284","title":"Animal models of orthopaedic infections.

The eradication of biofilm remains a great challenge for the host immune system, as well as for medical and surgical approaches, thus imposing the need for new prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategies in which animal models have an essential role.

Pilus biogenesis by the CU pathway requires two specialized assembly components: a dedicated periplasmic chaperone and an integral outer membrane assembly and secretion platform termed the usher. The CU pathway assembles a variety of surface fibers, ranging from thin, flexible filaments to rigid, rod-like organelles. Pili typically act as adhesins and function as virulence factors that mediate contact with host cells and colonization of host tissues. Pilus-mediated adhesion is critical for early stages of infection, allowing bacteria to establish a foothold within the host. Pili are also involved in modulation of host cell signaling pathways, bacterial invasion into host cells, and biofilm formation. Pili are critical for initiating and sustaining infection and thus represent attractive targets for the development of antivirulence therapeutics. Such therapeutics offer a promising alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics and provide a means to combat antibiotic resistance and treat infection while preserving the beneficial microbiota.

IcaZ is transcribed as a primary transcript from its own promoter during early- and mid-exponential growth and its transcription is induced by low temperature, ethanol and salt stress. IcaZ targets the icaR 5' UTR and hampers icaR mRNA translation, which alleviates repression of icaADBC operon transcription and results in PIA production.

The CW is remodeled by bacterial hydrolases, whose activities are carefully regulated to maintain cell integrity or lead to bacterial death. Each cell wall hydrolase (CWH) has a specific role regarding the PG: (i) cell wall amidase (CWA) cleaves the amide bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and L-alanine residue at the N-terminal of the stem peptide, (ii) cell wall glycosidase (CWG) catalyses the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages, whereas (iii) cell wall peptidase (CWP) cleaves amide bonds between amino acids within the PG chain.

Transcriptome analysis through differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and reporter gene fusions demonstrate that S. epidermidis protein- and PIA-biofilm matrix producers differ with respect to RsaE and metabolic gene expression. RsaE is spatiotemporally expressed within S. epidermidis PIA-mediated biofilms, and its overexpression triggers a PIA biofilm phenotype as well as eDNA release in an S. epidermidis protein biofilm matrix-producing strain background. dRNA-seq and Northern blot analyses revealed RsaE to exist as a major full-length 100-nt transcript and a minor processed species lacking approximately 20 nucleotides at the 5'-end. RsaE processing results in expansion of the mRNA target spectrum. Thus, full-length RsaE interacts with S. epidermidis antiholin-encoding lrgA mRNA, facilitating bacterial lysis and eDNA release. Processed RsaE, however, interacts with the 5'-UTR of icaR and sucCD mRNAs, encoding the icaADBC biofilm operon repressor IcaR and succinyl-CoA synthetase of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, respectively. RsaE augments PIA-mediated biofilm matrix production, most likely through activation of icaADBC operon expression via repression of icaR as well as by TCA cycle inhibition and re-programming of staphylococcal central carbon metabolism towards PIA precursor synthesis. Additionally, RsaE supports biofilm formation by mediating the release of eDNA as stabilizing biofilm matrix component. As RsaE itself is heterogeneously expressed within biofilms, we consider this sRNA to function as a factor favoring phenotypic heterogeneity and supporting division of labor in S. epidermidis biofilm communities.","authors":[{"name":"Sonja M K Schoenfelder"},{"name":"Claudia Lange"},{"name":"Srinivasa Abishek Prakash"},{"name":"Gabriella Marincola"},{"name":"Maike F Lerch"},{"name":"Freya D R Wencker"},{"name":"Konrad U Förstner"},{"name":"Cynthia M Sharma"},{"name":"Wilma Ziebuhr"}],"keywords":[]},"article124":{"pmid":"30870411","title":"Growth substrate may influence biofilm susceptibility to antibiotics.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"The CDC biofilm reactor is a robust culture system with high reproducibility in which biofilms can be grown for a wide variety of analyses.

Despite the fact that multiple stent designs have been researched in recent years, encrustation and biofilm-associated infections remain significant complications of ureteral stenting, potentially leading to the functional failure of the stent. It has been suggested that inactive side-holes of stents may act as anchoring sites for encrusting crystals, as they are associated with low wall shear stress (WSS) levels. Obstruction of side-holes due to encrustation is particularly detrimental to the function of the stent, since holes provide a path for urine to by-pass the occlusion. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop novel stents to reduce deposition of encrusting particles at side-holes. In this study, we employed a stent-on-chip microfluidic model of the stented and occluded ureter to investigate the effect of stent architecture on WSS distribution and encrustation over its surface. Variations in the stent geometry encompassed (i) the wall thickness and (ii) the shape of side-holes. Stent thickness was varied in the range 0.3-0.7 mm, while streamlined side-holes of triangular shape were evaluated (with a vertex angle in the range 45°-120°). Reducing the thickness of the stent increased WSS and thus reduced the encrustation rate at side-holes. A further improvement in performance was achieved by using side-holes with a triangular shape; notably, a 45° vertex angle showed superior performance compared to other angles investigated, resulting in a significant increase in WSS within inactive side-holes. In conclusion, combining the optimal stent thickness (0.3 mm) and hole vertex angle (45°) resulted in a ∼90% reduction in encrustation rate within side-holes, compared to a standard design. If translated to a full-scale ureteric stent, this optimised architecture has the potential for significantly increasing the stent lifetime while reducing clinical complications.","authors":[{"name":"A Mosayyebi"},{"name":"D Lange"},{"name":"Q Yann Yue"},{"name":"B K Somani"},{"name":"X Zhang"},{"name":"C Manes"},{"name":"D Carugo"}],"keywords":[]},"article131":{"pmid":"30867835","title":"Real-Time Monitoring of Pharmacokinetics of Antibiotics in Biofilms with Raman-Tagged Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy.","date":"2020-03-09","abs":"Antibiotics resistance developed by biofilms has posed a clinical challenge in the effective treatment of bacterial infections.

We found that iron restriction renders hypersensitivity to multidrug-resistant MTB strains against first-line anti-TB drugs. To decipher the effect of iron restriction on possible mechanisms of chemosensitization and altered cellular circuitry governing drug resistance and virulence of MTB, we explored MTB cellular architecture.

Moreover, the persister status of cells isolated from S. aureus biofilm after treatment with vancomycin was also analyzed.

This study was aimed to explore the effect of baicalin on APEC and APEC-induced inflammatory responses. After treatment with baicalin, we mainly examined the AI-2 secretion, biofilm formation, expression of virulence genes of APEC, and the levels of inflammatory cytokines, as well as the expression of NF-κB pathway. Our results showed that baicalin significantly inhibited the QS via decreasing the AI-2 secretion, biofilm formation, and the expression of virulence genes of APEC such as LsrB, LsrK, LuxS, pfs, H-NS, fimA, fimB, fyuA, csgA, csgB, and rpoS. Moreover, baicalin significantly attenuated the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the adhesion of APEC to chicken type II pneumocytes to reduce cell damage. Furthermore, baicalin also inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB activation. Thus, our data revealed that baicalin could interfere with the quorum sensing, biofilm formation and virulence genes expression to relieve the APEC pathogenicity.

Biologically active media was sampled from a full-scale biofilter operating under cold-water conditions (3.6 ± 0.5 °C) and extracted using a cation exchange resin into a phosphate buffer solution.

Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is an essential component for biofilm development and maturation in many bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the eDNA released by B. pseudomallei during biofilm formation using DNase treatment. The extent of biofilm formation and quantity of eDNA were assessed by crystal-violet staining and fluorescent dye-based quantification, respectively, and visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Variation in B. pseudomallei biofilm formation and eDNA quantity was demonstrated among isolates. CLSM images of biofilms stained with FITC-ConA (biofilm) and TOTO-3 (eDNA) revealed the localization of eDNA in the biofilm matrix. A positive correlation of biofilm biomass with quantity of eDNA during the 2-day biofilm-formation observation period was found. The increasing eDNA quantity over time, despite constant living/dead ratios of bacterial cells during the experiment suggests that eDNA is delivered from living bacterial cells. CLSM images demonstrated that depletion of eDNA by DNase I significantly lessened bacterial attachment (if DNase added at 0 h) and biofilm developing stages (if added at 24 h) but had no effect on mature biofilm (if added at 45 h). Collectively, our results reveal that eDNA is released from living B. pseudomallei and is correlated with biofilm formation. It was also apparent that eDNA is essential during bacterial cell attachment and biofilm-forming steps. The depletion of eDNA by DNase may provide an option for the prevention or dispersal of B. pseudomallei biofilm.","authors":[{"name":"Rattiyaphorn Pakkulnan"},{"name":"Chitchanok Anutrakunchai"},{"name":"Sakawrat Kanthawong"},{"name":"Suwimol Taweechaisupapong"},{"name":"Pisit Chareonsudjai"},{"name":"Sorujsiri Chareonsudjai"}],"keywords":[]},"article185":{"pmid":"30855954","title":"n → π* Interactions in N-Acyl Homoserine Lactone Derivatives and Their Effects on Hydrolysis Rates.","date":"2019-04-05","abs":"N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) mediate population-wide behavioral changes in Gram-negative bacteria through quorum sensing (QS), a process shown to regulate virulence, biofilm formation, and other phenotypes that impact human health.

The infection incidence after craniotomy ranges from 0.8 to 3%, with approximately half caused by Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus). To mitigate infectious complications following craniotomy, we engineered a three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted bone scaffold to harness the potent antibacterial activity of macrophages (MΦs) together with antibiotics using a mouse S. aureus craniotomy-associated biofilm model that establishes a persistent infection on the bone flap, subcutaneous galea, and brain. The 3D scaffold contained rifampin and daptomycin printed in a composite slurry, with viable MΦs incorporated into a hydrogel-based bioink, which was assessed for both the treatment and prevention of craniotomy-associated infections in the mouse model. For the treatment paradigm, the bone flap was removed at day 7 post infection after a mature biofilm had formed and was replaced with a 3D printed antibiotic scaffold, with or without MΦ incorporation. Bacterial burdens in the galea and brain were reduced by at least 100-fold at early time points, which was potentiated by bioprinting viable MΦs into the 3D antibiotic scaffold. We also examined a prevention paradigm, where the scaffolds were placed at the time of surgery and challenged with S. aureus one day later at the surgical site. Interestingly, unlike the treatment paradigm, the incorporation of viable MΦs into the 3D antibiotic scaffold did not enhance bacterial clearance compared to that of antibiotic alone. With further refinement, our 3D bioprinted scaffold represents a potential treatment modality, as it delivers therapeutic antibiotic levels more rapidly than systemic administration, based on its proximity to the infection site. In addition, the incorporation of viable MΦs into the 3D scaffold is an important advance, which demonstrated an improved therapeutic benefit for the treatment of established biofilms that represent the most clinically challenging scenario.","authors":[{"name":"Amy Aldrich"},{"name":"Mitchell A Kuss"},{"name":"Bin Duan"},{"name":"Tammy Kielian"}],"keywords":[{"word":"3D bioprinting"},{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"biofilm infection"},{"word":"craniotomy"},{"word":"macrophage"}]},"article190":{"pmid":"30855050","title":"Pyrazolopyrimidinones, a novel class of copper-dependent bactericidal antibiotics against multi-drug resistant S. aureus.","date":"2020-02-26","abs":"The treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections poses a therapeutic challenge as even last resort drugs become increasingly ineffective. As the demand for antibiotics with novel modes of action is growing, new approaches are needed to probe a greater spectrum of antimicrobial activities for their potential efficacy against drug-resistant pathogens. The use of copper (Cu) by the innate immune system to mount an antimicrobial response against bacterial invaders has created an opportunity to explore a role for Cu in antimicrobial therapy. Here we describe pyrazolopyrimidinones (PZP) as novel copper-dependent inhibitors (CDI) of S. aureus. 5-Benzyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-methyl-4H,7H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-one (PZP-915) showed potent bactericidal properties at sub-micromolar concentrations and activity against clinical MRSA isolates and biofilms cultures. This cupricidal activity is founded on the molecule's ability to coordinate Cu and induce accumulation of Cu ions inside S. aureus cells. We demonstrate that exposure to 915 + Cu led to an almost instantaneous collapse of the membrane potential which was accompanied by a complete depletion of cellular ATP, loss of cell-associated K+, a substantial gain of cell associated Na+, and an inability to control the influx of protons in slightly acidic medium, while the integrity of the cell membrane remained intact. These findings highlight PZP-915 as a novel membrane-directed metalloantibiotic against S. aureus that is likely to target a multiplicity of membrane associated protein functions rather than imposing physical damage to the membrane structure.","authors":[{"name":"Cameron L Crawford"},{"name":"Alex G Dalecki"},{"name":"Whitney T Narmore"},{"name":"Jessica Hoff"},{"name":"Audra A Hargett"},{"name":"Matthew B Renfrow"},{"name":"Man Zhang"},{"name":"Madumali Kalubowilage"},{"name":"Stefan H Bossmann"},{"name":"Stacy L Queern"},{"name":"Suzanne E Lapi"},{"name":"Robert N Hunter"},{"name":"Donghui Bao"},{"name":"Corinne E Augelli-Szafran"},{"name":"Olaf Kutsch"},{"name":"Frank Wolschendorf"}],"keywords":[]},"article191":{"pmid":"30854956","title":"Medicinal Plant Compounds for Combating the Multi-drug Resistant Pathogenic Bacteria: A Review.","date":"2019-07-30","abs":"Globally, people utilize plants as the main source of remedy to heal various ailments.

The main aim of this study is to reveal the phytoconstituents responsible for antimicrobial and antibiofilm action to demonstrate the effectiveness of such compounds by extrapolating the data using clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, evaluation of P. cerasoides organic extract and phytoconstituents for their antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential against reference microbial strains was carried out. Antimicrobial potential was carried out using agar diffusion assay and biosafety of organic extract and its phytoconstituents was evaluated by MTT and Ames mutagenicity assay. Ethyl acetate was found to be the best organic extractant, where Klebsiella pneumoniae 1 (39.5 mm) and Staphylococcus aureus (22.5 mm) were the most sensitive microorganisms, respectively. Among the major phytoconstituents, flavonoids (14.5-33.5mm), diterpenes (14-28.7 mm), and cardiac glycosides (11.5-20.5mm) exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Ethyl acetate extract showed better potency with lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (0.1-10 mg/ml) than the most active partially purified phytoconstituents (0.5-10 mg/ml). Total activity potency for ethyl acetate extract ranged from 26.66-2666 ml/g and for flavonoids, it was 41-410 ml/g, thus considered as highly potent and bactericidal in nature as evidenced from VCC study. The major bioactive compounds were found to be biosafe.

In order to further understand the role of these compounds in AGS, lectin staining, genome analysis of the dominant bacterial species, and shielding tests were done. Fluorescence lectin bar-coding (FLBC) analysis showed an overlap with protein staining, indicating presence of sialoglycoproteins in the EPS matrix.

FT-IR analysis shows upon selective removal of sialic acids a decrease in carbohydrates, extension of the protein side chain, and exposure of penultimate sugars. Enzymatic removal of sialic acids results in the removal of galactose residues from the EPS upon subsequent treatment with β-galactosidase, indicating a linkage between galactose and sialic acid at the terminus of glycan chains.

Via genome-wide RNA sequencing of these two strains, we found that c-di-GMP regulates (i) fliN, fliE, and flhA, which are associated with flagellar assembly; (ii) alg8 and alg44, which are related to the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway; (iii) pvdE, pvdP, and pvsA, which are associated with the siderophore biosynthesis pathway; and (iv) sodA, which encodes a superoxide dismutase. In particular, we identified three promoters that are sensitive to elevated levels of c-di-GMP and inserted them into luciferase-based reporters that respond effectively to the c-di-GMP levels in P. syringae; these promoters could be useful in the measurement of in vivo levels of c-di-GMP in real time. Further phenotypic assays validated the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) results and confirmed the effect on c-di-GMP-associated pathways, such as repressing the type III secretion system (T3SS) and motility while inducing biofilm production, siderophore production, and oxidative stress resistance.

This type of infection is inherently difficult to treat because of a reduced metabolic activity of biofilm-embedded cells and the protective nature of a surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). However, little is known about S. aureus biofilm physiology and the proteinaceous composition of the ECM. Thus, we cultivated S. aureus biofilms in a flow system and comprehensively profiled intracellular and extracellular (ECM and flow-through (FT)) biofilm proteomes, as well as the extracellular metabolome compared with planktonic cultures. Our analyses revealed the expression of many pathogenicity factors within S. aureus biofilms as indicated by a high abundance of capsule biosynthesis proteins along with various secreted virulence factors, including hemolysins, leukotoxins, and lipases as a part of the ECM. The activity of ECM virulence factors was confirmed in a hemolysis assay and a Galleria mellonella pathogenicity model. In addition, we uncovered a so far unacknowledged moonlighting function of secreted virulence factors and ribosomal proteins trapped in the ECM: namely their contribution to biofilm integrity. Mechanistically, it was revealed that this stabilizing effect is mediated by the strong positive charge of alkaline virulence factors and ribosomal proteins in an acidic ECM environment, which is caused by the release of fermentation products like formate, lactate, and acetate because of oxygen limitation in biofilms. The strong positive charge of these proteins most likely mediates electrostatic interactions with anionic cell surface components, eDNA, and anionic metabolites. In consequence, this leads to strong cell aggregation and biofilm stabilization.

Cu NPs were produced by magnetron sputtering via the aggregation in a cool buffer gas whereas polyether layers were synthesized by Plasma-Assisted Vapor Phase Deposition with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) used as a precursor. In situ specific heat spectroscopy and XPS analysis revealed the formation of a modified polymer layer around the NPs which propagates on the scale of a few nanometers from the Cu NP/polymer interface and then transforms into a bulk polymer phase. The chemical composition of the modified layer is found to be ether-deficient due to the catalytic influence of copper whereas the bulk polymer phase exhibits the chemical composition close to the original PEO. Two cooperative glass transition phenomena are revealed that belong to the modified polymer layer and the bulk phase. The former is characterized by constrained mobility of polymer segments which manifests itself via a 30 K increase of dynamic glass transition temperature. Furthermore, the modified layer is characterized by the heterogeneous structure which results in higher fragility of this layer as compared to the bulk phase.

The reaction dynamics of PapB, as well as dynamics of signal transduction in the PapB-PapA complex, were studied mostly by time-resolved transient grating and CD methods. It was found that although PapB exists as a monomer in both dark and light states, the diffusion coefficient slightly increases and partial molar volume changes upon light irradiation with time constants of 80 μs, 3.2 ms, and 24 ms. The last conformational change leads to a signaling state that is attributed to the α-helix unfolding in the C-terminal region of the BLUF domain. Interestingly, when PapA is added to a PapB solution to form a PapB-PapA complex, the diffusion coefficient decreases significantly, with a time constant of 26 ms, which is similar to the rate of the last conformational change of PapB. It was found that this change is due to the conformational change of PapA, and the light signal from PapB is transmitted through the conformational change of PapB.

Previous studies have shown that biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes and presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the biofilm matrix varies with environmental conditions and may involve agr peptide sensing. Experiments in normal and diluted (hypoosmotic) complex media at different temperatures revealed reduced biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes EGD-e ΔagrD, a mutant deficient in agr peptide sensing, specifically in diluted Brain Heart Infusion at 25°C. This defect was not related to reduced sensitivity to DNase treatment suggesting sufficient levels of eDNA. Re-analysis of a previously published transcriptional profiling indicated that a total of 132 stress-related genes, that is 78.6% of the SigB-dependent stress regulon, are differentially expressed in the ΔagrD mutant. Additionally, a number of genes involved in flagellar motility and a large number of other surface proteins including internalins, peptidoglycan binding and cell wall modifying proteins showed agr-dependent gene expression. However, survival of the ΔagrD mutant in hypoosmotic conditions or following exposure to high hydrostatic pressure was comparable to the wild type. Also, flagellar motility and surface hydrophobicity were not affected. However, the ΔagrD mutant displayed a significantly reduced viability upon challenge with lysozyme. These results suggest that the biofilm phenotype of the ΔagrD mutant is not a consequence of reduced resistance to hypoosmotic or high pressure stress, motility or surface hydrophobicity.

Tobramycin accumulation assays demonstrated that deletion of TctD-TctE resulted in an increase in the amount of tobramycin retained in biofilm cells. The PA14 wild type responded to increasing concentrations of citric acid by producing less biofilm. In contrast, the amount of ΔtctED mutant biofilm formation remained constant or enhanced. Furthermore, the ΔtctED strain was incapable of growing on citric acid as a sole carbon source and was highly reduced in its ability to grow in the presence of citric acid even when an additional carbon source was available. Use of phenotypic and genetic microarrays found that this growth deficiency of the ΔtctED mutant is unique to citric acid and that multiple metabolic genes are dysregulated.

The reduced T3SS expression in topA-RM seemed to be directly related to TopA functionality, but not to DNA supercoiling. The drastically increased pyocyanin production in the mutant was a result of up-regulation of the pyocyanin related genes, and the regulation was mediated through the transcriptional regulator PrtN, which is known to regulate bacteriocin.

The L. plantarum biofilm-integrated nanofiber membranes were used as reusable starter cultures for fermented milk production showing excellent fermentative ability and higher survival of L. plantarum during shelf life. The viable cells in fermented milk remained at 11 log CFU/g throughout the reusable batches, which is far above the required value of 7 log CFU/g in commercial products. In addition, the produced fermented milk possesses shorter fermentation time and higher survival of probiotics during shelf life. The results suggest electrospun nanofiber membranes are ideal scaffold materials for bacteria biofilms immobilization in biotechnology and fermentation engineering, which broaden the potential use of electrospun nanofiber membranes in microbiology and strengthen the application of biofilms in fermentation engineering.","authors":[{"name":"Meng-Xin Hu"},{"name":"Ji-Nian Li"},{"name":"Qian Guo"},{"name":"Ya-Qian Zhu"},{"name":"Hong-Mei Niu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"electrospun nanofiber membrane"},{"word":"fermented milk"},{"word":"probiotics"},{"word":"scaffold"}]},"article249":{"pmid":"30838765","title":"Visualization and characterization of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 pellicles.","date":"2020-03-10","abs":"Cellulose, whose production is controlled by c-di-GMP, is a commonly found exopolysaccharide in bacterial biofilms. Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000, a model organism for molecular studies of plant-pathogen interactions, carries the wssABCDEFGHI operon for the synthesis of acetylated cellulose. The high intracellular levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP induced by the overexpression of the heterologous diguanylate cyclase PleD stimulate cellulose production and enhance air-liquid biofilm (pellicle) formation. To characterize the mechanisms involved in Pto DC3000 pellicle formation, we studied this process using mutants lacking flagella, biosurfactant or different extracellular matrix components, and compared the pellicles produced in the absence and in the presence of PleD. We have discovered that neither alginate nor the biosurfactant syringafactin are needed for their formation, whereas cellulose and flagella are important but not essential. We have also observed that the high c-di-GMP levels conferred more cohesion to Pto cells within the pellicle and induced the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies and extracellular fibres and vesicles. Since the pellicles were very labile and this greatly hindered their handling and processing for microscopy, we have also developed new methods to collect and process them for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. These techniques open up new perspectives for the analysis of fragile biofilms in other bacterial strains.","authors":[{"name":"Gabriela A Farias"},{"name":"Adela Olmedilla"},{"name":"María-Trinidad Gallegos"}],"keywords":[]},"article250":{"pmid":"30838598","title":"The Supragingival Biofilm in Early Childhood Caries: Clinical and Laboratory Protocols and Bioinformatics Pipelines Supporting Metagenomics, Metatranscriptomics, and Metabolomics Studies of the Oral Microbiome.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Early childhood caries (ECC) is a biofilm-mediated disease. Social, environmental, and behavioral determinants as well as innate susceptibility are major influences on its incidence; however, from a pathogenetic standpoint, the disease is defined and driven by oral dysbiosis. In other words, the disease occurs when the natural equilibrium between the host and its oral microbiome shifts toward states that promote demineralization at the biofilm-tooth surface interface. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of dental caries as a disease requires the characterization of both the composition and the function or metabolic activity of the supragingival biofilm according to well-defined clinical statuses. However, taxonomic and functional information of the supragingival biofilm is rarely available in clinical cohorts, and its collection presents unique challenges among very young children. This paper presents a protocol and pipelines available for the conduct of supragingival biofilm microbiome studies among children in the primary dentition, that has been designed in the context of a large-scale population-based genetic epidemiologic study of ECC. The protocol is being developed for the collection of two supragingival biofilm samples from the maxillary primary dentition, enabling downstream taxonomic (e.g., metagenomics) and functional (e.g., transcriptomics and metabolomics) analyses.

A comprehensive understanding of these genomic factors is necessary for the realization of precision medicine in the oral health domain. To aid in this direction, the advent and increasing affordability of high-throughput genotyping has enabled the simultaneous interrogation of millions of genetic polymorphisms for association with oral and craniofacial traits. Specifically, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of dental caries and periodontal disease have provided initial insights into novel loci and biological processes plausibly implicated in these two common, complex, biofilm-mediated diseases. This paper presents a summary of protocols, methods, tools, and pipelines for the conduct of GWAS of dental caries, periodontal disease, and related traits. The protocol begins with the consideration of different traits for both diseases and outlines procedures for genotyping, quality control, adjustment for population stratification, heritability and association analyses, annotation, reporting, and interpretation. Methods and tools available for GWAS are being constantly updated and improved; with this in mind, the presented approaches have been successfully applied in numerous GWAS and meta-analyses among tens of thousands of individuals, including dental traits such as dental caries and periodontal disease.

The control of this bacterium is difficult especially when Salmonella spp. is organized into biofilms. We hypothesized that the novel nanocomposites of ZnO nanocrystals doped with silver (Ag) and silver oxide (AgO) nanocrystals (ZnO:Ag-AgO) synthesized by the coprecipitation method could control or prevent the formation of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) and Salmonella Heidelberg (SH) biofilm and its entry into turkey eggs. The diffraction characteristics of ZnO and AgO showed sizes of 28 and 30 nm, respectively. The Zn to Ag substitution into the ZnO crystalline structure was evidenced by the ionic radius of Ag+2 (1.26 Å), which is greater than Zn+2 (0.74 Å). For the SE analyses post-biofilm formation, the ZnO:Ag-AgO was not able to eliminate the biofilm, but the bacterial load was lower than that of the control group. Additionally, SE was able to infiltrate into the eggs and was found in both albumen and yolk. For the SH analyses applied onto the eggshells before biofilm formation, the ZnO:Ag-AgO treatment prevented biofilm formation, and although the bacterium infiltration into the eggs was observed in all treated groups, it was significantly smaller in ZnO:Ag-AgO pre-treated eggs, and SH could not reach the yolk. There was no difference in pore size between groups; therefore, the inhibition of biofilm formation and the prevention of bacterium entry into the egg were attributable to the use of ZnO:Ag-AgO, which was not influenced by the egg structure. Although the amount of Ag and Zn in the shell of the ZnO:Ag-AgO group was greater in relation to the control, this difference was not detected in the other egg components. In the search for new measures that are effective, safe and viable for controlling microorganisms in poultry farming, the application of a nanocomposite of Ag-doped ZnO and AgO nanocrystals appears as an alternative of great potential to prevent Salmonella sp biofilms in eggshells and other surfaces.","authors":[{"name":"Belchiolina Beatriz Fonseca"},{"name":"Paula Luiza Alves Pereira Andrada Silva"},{"name":"Anielle Christine Almeida Silva"},{"name":"Noelio Oliveira Dantas"},{"name":"Aline Teodoro de Paula"},{"name":"Otavio Cintra Lemos Olivieri"},{"name":"Marcelo Emilio Beletti"},{"name":"Daise Aparecida Rossi"},{"name":"Luiz Ricardo Goulart"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacterium"},{"word":"disinfection"},{"word":"nanocrystal"},{"word":"pore"},{"word":"preventive"}]},"article259":{"pmid":"30837499","title":"A permeability-increasing drug synergizes with bacterial efflux pump inhibitors and restores susceptibility to antibiotics in multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.","date":"2020-03-19","abs":"Resistance to antibiotics poses a major global threat according to the World Health Organization. Restoring the activity of existing drugs is an attractive alternative to address this challenge. One of the most efficient mechanisms of bacterial resistance involves the expression of efflux pump systems capable of expelling antibiotics from the cell. Although there are efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) available, these molecules are toxic for humans. We hypothesized that permeability-increasing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) could lower the amount of EPI necessary to sensitize bacteria to antibiotics that are efflux substrates. To test this hypothesis, we measured the ability of polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), to synergize with antibiotics in the presence of EPIs. Assays were performed using planktonic and biofilm-forming cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains overexpressing the MexAB-OprM efflux system. Synergy between PMBN and EPIs boosted azithromycin activity by a factor of 2,133 and sensitized P. aeruginosa to all tested antibiotics. This reduced several orders of magnitude the amount of inhibitor needed for antibiotic sensitization. The selected antibiotic-EPI-PMBN combination caused a 10 million-fold reduction in the viability of biofilm forming cells. We proved that AMPs can synergize with EPIs and that this phenomenon can be exploited to sensitize bacteria to antibiotics.","authors":[{"name":"Raquel Ferrer-Espada"},{"name":"Hawraa Shahrour"},{"name":"Betsey Pitts"},{"name":"Philip S Stewart"},{"name":"Susana Sánchez-Gómez"},{"name":"Guillermo Martínez-de-Tejada"}],"keywords":[]},"article260":{"pmid":"30837494","title":"Probabilistic variable-length segmentation of protein sequences for discriminative motif discovery (DiMotif) and sequence embedding (ProtVecX).","date":"2020-03-20","abs":"In this paper, we present peptide-pair encoding (PPE), a general-purpose probabilistic segmentation of protein sequences into commonly occurring variable-length sub-sequences. The idea of PPE segmentation is inspired by the byte-pair encoding (BPE) text compression algorithm, which has recently gained popularity in subword neural machine translation. We modify this algorithm by adding a sampling framework allowing for multiple ways of segmenting a sequence. PPE segmentation steps can be learned over a large set of protein sequences (Swiss-Prot) or even a domain-specific dataset and then applied to a set of unseen sequences. This representation can be widely used as the input to any downstream machine learning tasks in protein bioinformatics. In particular, here, we introduce this representation through protein motif discovery and protein sequence embedding. (i) DiMotif: we present DiMotif as an alignment-free discriminative motif discovery method and evaluate the method for finding protein motifs in three different settings: (1) comparison of DiMotif with two existing approaches on 20 distinct motif discovery problems which are experimentally verified, (2) classification-based approach for the motifs extracted for integrins, integrin-binding proteins, and biofilm formation, and (3) in sequence pattern searching for nuclear localization signal. The DiMotif, in general, obtained high recall scores, while having a comparable F1 score with other methods in the discovery of experimentally verified motifs. Having high recall suggests that the DiMotif can be used for short-list creation for further experimental investigations on motifs. In the classification-based evaluation, the extracted motifs could reliably detect the integrins, integrin-binding, and biofilm formation-related proteins on a reserved set of sequences with high F1 scores. (ii) ProtVecX: we extend k-mer based protein vector (ProtVec) embedding to variablelength protein embedding using PPE sub-sequences. We show that the new method of embedding can marginally outperform ProtVec in enzyme prediction as well as toxin prediction tasks. In addition, we conclude that the embeddings are beneficial in protein classification tasks when they are combined with raw amino acids k-mer features.","authors":[{"name":"Ehsaneddin Asgari"},{"name":"Alice C McHardy"},{"name":"Mohammad R K Mofrad"}],"keywords":[]},"article261":{"pmid":"30837355","title":"D-Tryptophan governs biofilm formation rates and bacterial interaction in P. mendocina and S. aureus.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biofilm genesis by Pseudomonasand Staphylococcus sp is associated with biofouling in natural settings.

Though planktonic cells typically grow faster, bacteria in aggregates are more resistant to stress such as desiccation, antibiotics and predation. Here we ask if and to what extent informed surface-attachments improve fitness during early surface colonization under periodic stress conditions. We use an individual-based modeling approach to simulate foraging planktonic cells colonizing a surface under alternating wet-dry cycles. Such cycles are common in the largest terrestrial microbial habitats-soil, roots, and leaf surfaces-that are not constantly saturated with water and experience daily periods of desiccation stress. We compared different surface-attachment strategies, and analyzed the emerging spatio-temporal dynamics of surface colonization and population yield as a measure of fitness. We demonstrate that a simple strategy of preferential attachment (PA), biased to dense sites, carries a large fitness advantage over any random attachment across a broad range of environmental conditions-particularly under periodic stress.","authors":[{"name":"Maor Grinberg"},{"name":"Tomer Orevi"},{"name":"Nadav Kashtan"}],"keywords":[]},"article269":{"pmid":"30835535","title":"Antimicrobial photodynamic activity of toluidine blue encapsulated in mesoporous silica nanoparticles against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.","date":"2019-07-01","abs":"In the present study, the antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy of toluidine blue (TB) encapsulated in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) was investigated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus treated with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) using a red diode laser 670 nm wavelength, 97.65 J cm","authors":[{"name":"Paramanantham Parasuraman"},{"name":"Asha P Antony"},{"name":"Sruthil Lal S B"},{"name":"Alok Sharan"},{"name":"Busi Siddhardha"},{"name":"Kaviyarasu Kasinathan"},{"name":"Needa A Bahkali"},{"name":"Turki M S Dawoud"},{"name":"Asad Syed"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"anti-biofilm"},{"word":"encapsulation"},{"word":"mesoporous silica nanoparticles"},{"word":"photosensitizer"},{"word":"reactive oxygen species"},{"word":"toluidine blue"}]},"article270":{"pmid":"30835168","title":"Source or Sink: Examining the Role of Biofilms in Transmission of Mycobacterium spp. in Laboratory Zebrafish.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Zebrafish health is a primary research concern because diseases can have unintended impacts on experimental endpoints. Ideally, research would be conducted using disease-free fish or fish with known disease status. Mycobacteriosis is a common bacterial disease in wild and captive fishes, including zebrafish. Despite its prevalence, the dynamics of transmission and potential sources of mycobacterial infections in zebrafish are only partially understood. One suspected natural infection source is surface biofilms on tanks and other system components. This study investigates the role that tank biofilms play in mycobacteriosis in laboratory zebrafish by evaluating the establishment of biofilms from bacteria shed from fish, and conversely, the acquisition of infections in fish from surface biofilms. We found that zebrafish infected with Mycobacterium chelonae shed bacteria through feces, and bacteria are transmitted to tank biofilms from one to 16 weeks postinfection. We also found that zebrafish acquire M. chelonae infections as soon as 2 weeks when introduced to tanks with established M. chelonae biofilms. The results from this study highlight the role that tank biofilms play as both a reservoir and source of mycobacterial infections in zebrafish. Results support the inclusion of biofilm surveillance and prevention as part of a disease control program in zebrafish research facilities.","authors":[{"name":"Carolyn T Chang"},{"name":"Jet'aime Lewis"},{"name":"Christopher M Whipps"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":" spp."},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"husbandry"},{"word":"zebrafish"}]},"article271":{"pmid":"30834977","title":"Synergism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (LSE-2) nodule endophyte with Bradyrhizobium sp.

All isolates were screened for multifarious PGP traits viz. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), phosphate (P) and zinc (Zn) solubilization, siderophore, cell wall degrading enzymes and pathogenicity. Compatible of LSBR-3 and LSE-2 enhanced IAA, P-solubilization, 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylate deaminase and biofilm formation over the single inoculant treatment. Further, consortium was evaluated in vivo for growth, symbiotic traits, nutrient acquisition, soil quality parameters and yield attributes of soybean. Improvement in growth parameters were recorded with dual inoculant LSBR-3 + LSE-2 as compared to LSBR-3 alone and un-inoculated control treatments. Significantly (p ≥ 0.05) high symbiotic and soil quality parameters (phosphatase and soil dehydrogenase activity) was recorded with LSBR-3 + LSE-2 at vegetative and flowering stage as compared to LSBR-3 alone and un-inoculated control treatments. Single inoculation of LSBR-3 improved grain yield by 4.25% over the un-inoculated control treatment, further, enhancement in yield was recorded with consortium inoculant (LSBR-3 and LSE-2) by 3.47% over the LSBR-3 alone. Application of consortium inoculant (LSBR-3 + LSE-2) gave an additional income of Rs. 5089/ha over the un-inoculated control treatment.

Enhanced bacterial suppression, more efficient penetration into biofilms, and lowered chances for the emergence of phage resistance are the likely advantages of the combined strategy. While a number of studies have provided experimental evidence in support of this concept, negative interference between phages and antibiotics have been reported as well. Neutral effects have also been observed, but in those cases, combined approaches may still be important for at least hampering the development of resistance. In any case, the choice of phage type and antibiotic as well as their mixing ratios must be given careful consideration when deciding for a dual antibacterial approach.

Herboheal at ≥0.1% v/v was able to inhibit (19-55%) in vitro production of quorum sensing-regulated pigments in all these bacteria and seemed to interfere with bacterial quorum sensing by acting as a signal-response inhibitor. This formulation could compromise haemolytic activity of all three bacteria by ∼18-69% and induced their catalase activity by ∼8-21%. Herboheal inhibited P. aeruginosa biofilm formation up to 40%, reduced surface hydrophobicity of P. aeruginosa cells by ∼9%, and also made them (25%) more susceptible to lysis by human serum. Antibiotic susceptibility of all three bacteria was modulated owing to pretreatment with Herboheal. Exposure of these test pathogens to Herboheal (≥0.025% v/v) effectively reduced their virulence towards the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Repeated subculturing of P. aeruginosa on the Herboheal-supplemented growth medium did not induce resistance to Herboheal in this mischievous pathogen, and this polyherbal extract was also found to exert a post-extract effect on P. aeruginosa, wherein virulence of the Herboheal-unexposed daughter cultures, of the Herboheal-exposed parent culture, was also found to be attenuated.

In addition, B. subtilis cell chaining prevented coculture wrinkling, even though chaining was previously associated with more robust monoculture biofilms. We also observed that increasing the relative proportion of P. agglomerans (which forms completely featureless monoculture colonies) increased coculture wrinkling. Using microscopy and rheology, we observed that these two bacteria assemble into an organized layered structure that reflects the physical properties of both monocultures. This partitioning into distinct regions negatively affected the survival of P. agglomerans while also serving as a protective mechanism in the presence of antibiotic stress.

The prevention of biofilm formation and the treatment of existing biofilms is currently a difficult challenge; therefore, the discovery of new multi-targeted or combinatorial therapies is growing. The development of anti-bioﬁlm agents is considered of major interest and represents a key strategy as non-biocidal molecules are highly valuable to avoid the rapid appearance of escape mutants. Among bacteria, staphylococci are predominant causes of biofilm-associated infections. Staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an extraordinarily versatile pathogen that can survive in hostile environmental conditions, colonize mucous membranes and skin, and can cause severe, non-purulent, toxin-mediated diseases or invasive pyogenic infections in humans. Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) has also emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen in infections associated with medical devices (such as urinary and intravascular catheters, orthopaedic implants, etc.), causing approximately from 30% to 43% of joint prosthesis infections. The scientific community is continuously looking for new agents endowed of anti-biofilm capabilities to fight S. aureus and S epidermidis infections. Interestingly, several reports indicated in vitro efficacy of non-biocidal essential oils (EOs) as promising treatment to reduce bacterial biofilm production and prevent the inducing of drug resistance. In this report were analyzed 89 EOs with the objective of investigating their ability to modulate bacterial biofilm production of different S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. Results showed the assayed EOs to modulated the biofilm production with unpredictable results for each strain. In particular, many EOs acted mainly as biofilm inhibitors in the case of S. epidermidis strains, while for S. aureus strains, EOs induced either no effect or stimulate biofilm production. In order to elucidate the obtained experimental results, machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to the EOs' chemical compositions and the determined associated anti-biofilm potencies. Statistically robust ML models were developed, and their analysis in term of feature importance and partial dependence plots led to indicating those chemical components mainly responsible for biofilm production, inhibition or stimulation for each studied strain, respectively.","authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Patsilinakos"},{"name":"Marco Artini"},{"name":"Rosanna Papa"},{"name":"Manuela Sabatino"},{"name":"Mijat Božović"},{"name":"Stefania Garzoli"},{"name":"Gianluca Vrenna"},{"name":"Raissa Buzzi"},{"name":"Stefano Manfredini"},{"name":"Laura Selan"},{"name":"Rino Ragno"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus species"},{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"essential oil"},{"word":"machine learning"}]},"article293":{"pmid":"30831512","title":"A novel comparative study of modified carriers in moving bed biofilm reactor for the treatment of wastewater: Process optimization and kinetic study.","date":"2019-08-21","abs":"In this work, modified plastic carriers; polypropylene (PP), low-density polyethylene- polypropylene (LDPE-PP), and polyurethane foam-polypropylene (PUF-PP) were developed and used in moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) for the wastewater treatment containing naphthalene.

Current treatments for S. aureus infections involve the systemic delivery of antibiotics and additional surgeries, increasing health-care costs and affecting patient's quality of life. As a step toward the development of new strategies that can prevent these infections, we build upon previous work demonstrating that the colonization of catheters by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans can be prevented by coating them with thin polymer multilayers composed of chitosan (CH) and hyaluronic acid (HA) designed to release a β-amino acid-based peptidomimetic of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We demonstrate here that this β-peptide is also potent against S. aureus (MBPC = 4 μg/mL) and characterize its selectivity toward S. aureus biofilms. We demonstrate further that β-peptide-containing CH/HA thin-films can be fabricated on the surfaces of rough planar titanium substrates in ways that allow mammalian cell attachment and permit the long-term release of β-peptide. β-Peptide loading on CH/HA thin-films was then adjusted to achieve release of β-peptide quantities that selectively prevent S. aureus biofilms on titanium substrates in vitro for up to 24 days and remained antimicrobial after being challenged sequentially five times with S. aureus inocula, while causing no significant MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cytotoxicity compared to uncoated and film-coated controls lacking β-peptide. We conclude that these β-peptide-containing films offer a novel and promising localized delivery approach for preventing orthopaedic implant infections. The facile fabrication and loading of β-peptide-containing films reported here provides opportunities for coating other medical devices prone to biofilm-associated infections. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are used widely in orthopaedic devices due to their mechanical strength and long-term biocompatibility. However, these devices are susceptible to bacterial colonization and the subsequent formation of biofilms. Here we report a chitosan and hyaluronic acid polyelectrolyte multilayer-based approach for the localized delivery of helical, cationic, globally amphiphilic β-peptide mimetics of antimicrobial peptides to inhibit S. aureus colonization and biofilm formation. Our results reveal that controlled release of this β-peptide can selectively kill S. aureus cells without exhibiting toxicity toward MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells. Further development of this polymer-based coating could result in new strategies for preventing orthopaedic implant-related infections, improving outcomes of these titanium implants.","authors":[{"name":"Angélica de L Rodríguez López"},{"name":"Myung-Ryul Lee"},{"name":"Benjamín J Ortiz"},{"name":"Benjamin D Gastfriend"},{"name":"Riley Whitehead"},{"name":"David M Lynn"},{"name":"Sean P Palecek"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial β-peptides"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Polyelectrolyte multilayers"},{"word":"S. aureus"},{"word":"Titanium substrates"}]},"article297":{"pmid":"30831229","title":"Influence of catecholamines on biofilm formation by Salmonella Enteritidis.","date":"2019-05-28","abs":"Salmonella spp. are the main pathogens responsible for foodborne disease worldwide. Bacterial communities use the quorum sensing system to control biofilm formation. These systems function through the secretion of substances, called auto-inducers (AI), into the environment. AI-3 is structurally similar to epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NOR) -catecholamines secreted by eukaryotic cells to communicate with each other. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate the effect of EPI and NOR on biofilm formation by S. Enteritidis at 12 °C and 25 °C. Also, we detected the presence of the csgD, adrA, and fimA genes in these strains. Biofilm formation was investigated at two temperatures (12 °C and 25 °C) using a microtiter plate assay, under four different treatments (50 mM EPI, 100 mM EPI, 50 mM NOR; 100 mM NOR) and a control group. PCR was used to detect the virulence genes associated with biofilm production. A greater number of biofilm producer isolates were observed at 25 °C than at 12 °C, regardless of the treatment. The number of biofilms forming strains at 12 °C was significantly higher in the treatment with norepinephrine at 100 μM. The proportion of non-producer and biofilm producer strains at 25 °C did not differ significantly among the treatments. All strains presented the three genes (csgD, adrA, and fimA). The approach carried out in this work is a precursor in veterinary medicine, focusing on both public and poultry health, and evaluates the influence of catecholamines on the formation of biofilms with S.

Because many bacterial infections are caused by pathogens that reside in biofilms, we sought to investigate how biofilms influence the evolution of antibiotic resistance. We hypothesize that the inherent spatial structure of biofilms facilitates the accumulation and persistence of spontaneously evolved antibiotic-resistant mutants. To test this, we tracked the frequency of mutants resistant to kanamycin and rifampicin in biofilm populations of Escherichia coli before, during, and after an antibiotic treatment regimen. Our results show that biofilms accumulate resistant mutants even in the absence of antibiotics. This resistance was found to be heritable and thus unlike the phenotypic plasticity of so-called persister cells that have been shown to occur in biofilms. Upon exposure to an antibiotic, resistant mutants swept to high frequency. Following the conclusion of treatment, these resistant mutants remained at unexpectedly high frequencies in the biofilms for over 45 days. In contrast, when samples from kanamycin-treated biofilms were used to found well-mixed liquid cultures and propagated by serial transfer, the frequency of resistant cells dramatically decreased as they were outcompeted by sensitive clones. These observations suggest that the emergence of antibiotic resistance through spontaneous mutations in spatially structured biofilms may significantly contribute to the emergence and persistence of mutants that are resistant to antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Michael T France"},{"name":"Ana Cornea"},{"name":"Hanna Kehlet-Delgado"},{"name":"Larry J Forney"}],"keywords":[{"word":"adaptation"},{"word":"antibiotic resistance"},{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"selection"}]},"article304":{"pmid":"30827805","title":"Biofilm prevention concentrations (BPC) of minocycline compared to polymyxin B, meropenem, and amikacin against Acinetobacter baumannii.","date":"2019-11-07","abs":"Infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to treat as they are often multidrug resistant (MDR) and frequently form biofilms.

We have designed a PEEK antibiotic reservoir that would clip to the metal fixation rod and that would achieve slow antibiotic release over several days, followed by a bolus release of antibiotics triggered by ultrasound (US) rupture of a reservoir membrane. We have found using human physiological fluid (synovial fluid), that higher levels (100-500 μg) of vancomycin are required to achieve a marked reduction in adherent bacteria vs. that seen in the common bacterial medium, trypticase soy broth. To achieve these levels of release, we applied a polylactic acid coating to a porous PEEK puck, which exhibited both slow and US-triggered release. This design was further refined to a one-hole or two-hole cylindrical PEEK reservoir that can clip onto a spinal rod for clinical use.

There are countless reports in molecular cell biology addressing the functioning of proteins under physiological and pathological conditions, aiming to understand life at the atomistic-molecular level and thereby being able to develop remedies against diseases. The central theme in most of these studies is that the functional unit under study is the protein itself. Recent rapid progress has radically challenged and extended this protein-function paradigm, by demonstrating that novel function(s) may emerge when proteins form dynamic and non-stoichiometric supramolecular assemblies. There is an increasing number of cases for such collective functions, such as targeting, localization, protection/shielding and filtering effects, as exemplified by signaling complexes and prions, biominerals and mucus, amphibian adhesions and bacterial biofilms, and a broad range of membraneless organelles (bio-condensates) formed by liquid-liquid phase separation in the cell. In this short review, we show that such non-stoichiometric organization may derive from the heterogeneity of the system, a mismatch in valency and/or geometry of the partners, and/or intrinsic structural disorder and multivalency of the component proteins. Either way, the resulting functional features cannot be simply described by, or predicted from, the properties of the isolated single protein(s), as they belong to the collection of proteins.","authors":[{"name":"Rita Pancsa"},{"name":"Eva Schad"},{"name":"Agnes Tantos"},{"name":"Peter Tompa"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biomolecular condensate"},{"word":"Contextual function"},{"word":"Dynamic assembly"},{"word":"Emergent function"},{"word":"Intrinsically disordered protein"},{"word":"Membraneless organelle"},{"word":"Phase separation"}]},"article312":{"pmid":"30826440","title":"Robust biofilm assay for quantification and high throughput screening applications.","date":"2020-02-24","abs":"Bacterial biofilms are populations of bacteria within a self-produced adherent extracellular matrix that are notoriously resistant to treatment. Existing methods for biofilm quantification are often limited in their dynamic range of detection (signal-to-background), throughput, and require modifications to the protocol depending on the bacterial species. To address these limitations, a broad utility, high-throughput (HTP) method was required. Using a fluorescent dye, FM1-43, we stained the biofilm, followed by solvent extraction and quantitation of biofilm employing a fluorescent plate reader. Utilizing eight different bacterial pathogens, we demonstrate that this method is widely applicable for biofilm quantification. Depending on the species, this biofilm assay offered a large dynamic range of 8-146 fold change compared to 2-22 fold for crystal violet staining under similar conditions. In addition to routine biofilm quantification using this new assay, as a proof-of-concept, 1200 compounds were screened against two different bacterial species to identify biofilm inhibitors. In our HTP screens we successfully identified compounds rifabutin and ethavarine as potential biofilm inhibitors of Burkholderia pseudomallei Bp82 and Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm production respectively.

Its common use makes it interesting to investigate with respect to antimicrobial properties both as a single agent and in combination with conventional antibiotics. Resveratrol displays antimicrobial activity against a surprisingly wide range of bacterial, viral and fungal species. At subinhibitory concentrations, resveratrol can alter bacterial expression of virulence traits leading to reduced toxin production, inhibition of biofilm formation, reduced motility and interference with quorum sensing. In combination with conventional antibiotics, resveratrol enhances the activity of aminoglycosides against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas it antagonises the lethal activity of fluoroquinolones against S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Whilst the antimicrobial properties of the compound have been extensively studied in vitro, little is known about its efficacy in vivo. Nonetheless, following topical application resveratrol has alleviated acne lesions caused by the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. There are currently no in vivo studies addressing its effect in combination with antibiotics, but recent research suggests that there may be a potential for enhancing the antimicrobial efficacy of certain existing antibiotic classes in combination with resveratrol.

The biofilm formation was found to be highly correlated with the antibiotic resistance of H. pylori in the last decades. Moreover, H. pylori colonizes on the digestive tract epithelium located under the mucus layers, which further reduces therapeutic efficacy as mucus layers trap and remove exogenous substances including drugs. Herein, we reported a novel lipid polymer nanoparticles (LPNs) to overcome both biofilm and mucus layers obstruction. LPNs employed chitosan nanoparticle (CS NPs) as the core, mixed lipid layer containing rhamnolipids (RHL) as the shell and the surface of LPNs was further modified with DSPE-PEG2000 to improve hydrophilicity. Clarithromycin (CLR), a first-line drug for H. pylori infection, was encapsulated in LPNs. LPNs, especially the formulation utilizing 100% of RHL as the lipid shell, exhibited excellent eradicating ability to H. pylori biofilm, which was mainly reflected in the significant reduction of biofilm biomass and viability, destruction of biofilm architecture and elimination of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The anti-biofilm activities of LPNs are related to: 1) the disrupting effect of RHL on biofilm matrix; 2) antibacterial effects of CLR and CS NPs on biofilm bacteria and 3) inhibitory effects of CS NPs and RHL on bacteria adhesion and biofilm formation. Furthermore, PEGylated LPNs could rapidly penetrate through mucus without interacting with mucins and effectively eradicate H. pylori biofilm under mucus layer. In conclusion, a novel approach of drug-containing LPNs that could penetrate through mucus layers and effectively eradicate H. pylori biofilm provides new ways to treat persistent H. pylori infections.","authors":[{"name":"Pengyu Li"},{"name":"Xiaonan Chen"},{"name":"Yuanna Shen"},{"name":"Huatian Li"},{"name":"Yiqing Zou"},{"name":"Gang Yuan"},{"name":"Ping Hu"},{"name":"Haiyan Hu"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Clarithromycin"},{"word":"Helicobacter pylori"},{"word":"Mucus penetration"},{"word":"Nanoparticles"}]},"article322":{"pmid":"30825378","title":"Prevalence and predictive factors of dentin hypersensitivity in Brazilian adolescents.","date":"2019-12-17","abs":"To measure the prevalence of dentin hypersensitivity (DH) in adolescents.","authors":[{"name":"Markelane Santana Silva"},{"name":"Alessandra Noleto de Almeida Nunes Lima"},{"name":"Marta Maria Alves Pereira"},{"name":"Regina Ferraz Mendes"},{"name":"Raimundo Rosendo Prado Júnior"}],"keywords":[{"word":"aetiology"},{"word":"associated factors"},{"word":"dentin sensitivity"},{"word":"dentistry"},{"word":"epidemiology"},{"word":"risk factors"}]},"article323":{"pmid":"30825355","title":"Antibiofilm potential of purified environmental bacteriophage preparations against early stage Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.","date":"2019-07-16","abs":"This paper presents the potential of environmentally sourced bacteriophages to affect the growth of clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, and assesses the respective plaque morphotypes presented by each bacteriophage, in vitro.","authors":[{"name":"R Issa"},{"name":"N Chanishvili"},{"name":"J Caplin"},{"name":"E Kakabadze"},{"name":"N Bakuradze"},{"name":"K Makalatia"},{"name":"I Cooper"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antibiotics"},{"word":"bacteriophage"},{"word":"biofilms"},{"word":"environmental"},{"word":"environmental/recreational water"}]},"article324":{"pmid":"30825340","title":"Modulation of Candida albicans virulence in in vitro biofilms by oral bacteria.","date":"2019-11-17","abs":"Candida-associated denture stomatitis presents as erythema of the palatal mucosa and is caused by biofilms containing the fungus Candida albicans that co-reside with oral bacteria on the denture-fitting surface.

Biofilms containing C. albicans and selected bacterial species were grown on denture acrylic, and analysed by microscopy and by qPCR for expression of putative virulence genes.

The possibility to selectively modulate microbial virulence by addition of, or treatment with pro- or prebiotics avoids the use of conventional antimicrobial compounds, thus reducing the contribution to potential drug resistance.

However, most essential pathways are not regarded as good targets for antibiotic therapy since their products might be acquired from the environment. This issue raises doubts about the essentiality of such targets during infection. A putative target in bacterial anabolism is the methionine biosynthesis pathway. In contrast to humans, almost all bacteria carry methionine biosynthesis pathways which have often been suggested as putative targets for novel anti-infectives. While the growth of methionine auxotrophic strains can be stimulated by exogenous methionine, the extracellular concentrations required by most bacterial species are unknown. Furthermore, several phenotypic characteristics of methionine auxotrophs are only partly reversed by exogenous methionine. We investigated methionine auxotrophic mutants of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli (all differing in methionine biosynthesis enzymes) and found that each needed concentrations of exogenous methionine far exceeding that reported for human serum (∼30 µM). Accordingly, these methionine auxotrophs showed a reduced ability to proliferate in human serum. Additionally, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa methionine auxotrophs were significantly impaired in their ability to form and maintain biofilms.

Comparative genomics analyses revealed that OXYL pertains to a family of intronless genes found with several paralogous copies in different crinoid species. Immunohistochemistry assays identified the tissues surrounding coelomic cavities and the arms as the main sites of production of OXYL.

Adsorption of polymer coatings, often polyelectrolytes, is typically used to alter hydroxyapatite biointerfaces and alter their bioactivity, for example to promote cell adhesion or prevent biofilm formation. The morphology of the resulting coatings is typically expected to play an important role in determining its bioactivity, yet a full picture of such structures at the surface of hydroxyapatite remains incomplete. In this study, a combination of three model substrates was characterized via in situ ellipsometry, in combination with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), to study the in situ conformation of hyaluronic acid films adsorbed at the surface of hydroxyapatite. The modes of adsorption of such polyelectrolytes are found to strongly depend on the ability of the bioceramic to readily undergo ion exchange, resulting in the remodeling and partial dissolution of the mineral phase, prior to complexation and re-precipitation at the surface, therefore forming a relatively compact, poorly solvated coating. This is in contrast to the very open and swollen polymer film that is formed on more chemically stable interfaces.

Then the extracted amyloid fibers from biofilm were studied for their characteristics. Further, the influencing factors, PH, temperature and eDNA, were investigated. Results showed there were mainly two morphologies of amyloid fibers in S. mutans, different in width. Amyloid fibers inhibitor-EGCG obviously destroyed biofilm at different stages, which is dose-dependent. The amount of amyloid fibers positively correlated with biofilm biomass in clinical isolates. Acidic pH and high temperature obviously accelerated amyloid fibrillation. During amyloid fibrillation, amyloid growth morphologies were observed by TEM and results showed two growth morphologies.

CPNP was more effective in reducing the viability of both planktonic as well as biofilm bacteria compared to Eth and EA.

The ASM1 approach has been confirmed by respirometry since the resulting respirograms were successfully simulated with ASM1. 0DBFM distinguishes between attached and suspended biomass and incorporates attachment of suspended matter from the bulk liquid onto the biofilm and detachment of biofilm into the bulk liquid. Still, 0DBFM respects the golden rule of modelling, which says that 'models should be as simple as possible and as complex as needed' and resists Occam's razor. The practicability of 0DBFM has been shown on a pilot-scale plant since nine days of wastewater treatment were successfully simulated and effluent quality was dynamically predicted.

The investigation was conducted in C. albicans ATCC 10231 and C. albicans isolates from dentures and was performed in flat‑bottomed 96‑well polystyrene plates. Yeast growth and their capacity to form biofilms were evaluated following 24 and 48 h incubations at 37˚C in Sabouraud broth supplemented with 0.001‑3 mM farnesol and/or 1‑20 mM tyrosol. Yeast growth was assessed by turbidimetry and biofilms were quantitated by crystal violet staining, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The viability of the fungal cells was controlled by the culture of planktonic cells and by examination of the biofilms using fluorescence microscopy following staining with fluorescein diacetate and ethidium bromide. Farnesol at 3 mM exerted a stronger action when added at the beginning of biofilm formation (>50% inhibition) than when added to preformed biofilms (<10% inhibition). Similarly, tyrosol at 20 mM had a greater effect on biofilm formation (>80% inhibition) than on preformed biofilms (<40% inhibition). Despite significant reductions in attached biomass, yeast growth varied little in the presence of the investigated molecules, as corroborated by the turbidimetry, culture of supernatants on solid culture medium followed by counting of colony‑forming units and viability tests using fluorescence microscopy. At the highest tested concentration, the molecules had a greater effect during the initial phases of biofilm formation. The effect of farnesol during anaerobiosis was not significantly different from that observed during aerobiosis, unlike that of tyrosol during anaerobiosis, which exhibited slightly reduced yeast biofilm inhibition. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the specific anti‑biofilm effect, independent of fungicidal or fungistatic action, of farnesol and tyrosol, as tested in C. albicans ATCC 10231 and 6 strains isolated from dentures.

Chemosensitizers like 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP) can inhibit an efflux pump and therefore can overcome MDR. However, secondary effects of NMP other than efflux pump inhibition are rarely investigated. Here, using phenotypic assays, phenotypic microarray and transcriptomic assays we show that NMP creates membrane destabilization in MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 strain. The NMP mediated membrane destabilization activity was measured using β-lactamase activity, membrane potential alteration studies, and transmission electron microscopy assays. Results from both β-lactamase and membrane potential alteration studies shows that both outer and inner membranes are destabilized in NMP exposed K. pneumoniae MGH 78578 cells. Phenotypic Microarray and RNA-seq were further used to elucidate the metabolic and transcriptional signals underpinning membrane destabilization. Membrane destabilization happens as early as 15 min post-NMP treatment. Our RNA-seq data shows that many genes involved in envelope stress response were differentially regulated in the NMP treated cells. Up-regulation of genes encoding the envelope stress response and repair systems show the distortion in membrane homeostasis during survival in an environment containing sub-inhibitory concentration of NMP. In addition, the lsr operon encoding the production of autoinducer-2 responsible for biofilm production was down-regulated resulting in reduced biofilm formation in NMP treated cells, a phenotype confirmed by crystal violet-based assays. We postulate that the early membrane disruption leads to destabilization of inner membrane potential, impairing ATP production and consequently resulting in efflux pump inhibition.","authors":[{"name":"João Anes"},{"name":"Sathesh K Sivasankaran"},{"name":"Dechamma M Muthappa"},{"name":"Séamus Fanning"},{"name":"Shabarinath Srikumar"}],"keywords":[{"word":"1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine"},{"word":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"word":"NMP"},{"word":"chemosensitizers"},{"word":"membrane destabilization"},{"word":"secondary effects"}]},"article365":{"pmid":"30814454","title":"Effect of various polishing burs on surface roughness and bacterial adhesion in pediatric zirconia crowns.","date":"2019-10-22","abs":"To evaluate the effect of various polishing points on surface roughness of pediatric zirconia crowns and to correlate findings with bacterial adhesion.

Infectious and inflammatory response leads to an increase in mucus viscosity and mucus plugging of small and medium-size bronchioles. Eventually, neutrophils chronically infiltrate the airways with biofilm or chronic bacterial infection. Perpetual infection and airway inflammation destroy the lungs, which leads to increased morbidity and eventual mortality in most of the patients with CF. Studies have now established that neutrophil cytotoxins, extracellular DNA, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are associated with increased mucus clogging and lung injury in CF. In addition to opportunistic pathogens, various aspects of the CF airway milieux (e.g., airway pH, salt concentration, and neutrophil phenotypes) influence the NETotic capacity of neutrophils. CF airway milieu may promote the survival of neutrophils and eventual pro-inflammatory aberrant NETosis, rather than the anti-inflammatory apoptotic death in these cells. Degrading NETs helps to manage CF airway disease; since DNAse treatment release cytotoxins from the NETs, further improvements are needed to degrade NETs with maximal positive effects. Neutrophil-T cell interactions may be important in regulating viral infection-mediated pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bacterial infections.

After incubation with a robust biofilm-forming methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolate, disks were rinsed and sonicated to collect biofilm bacteria. Serial dilutions were plated on blood agar, and colony forming units were counted log (ln) transformed for analysis of variance. Interference microscopy quantified surface roughness for comparison to biofilm growth. Scanning electron microscopy on both pre- and post-sonicated disks confirmed biofilm presence and subsequent removal, and visualized surface features on cleaned disks. Significantly more bacteria grew on rough versus polished metal preparations (p < 0.0001). Titanium alloy had more bacterial biofilm growth compared to cobalt chromium alloy (p = 0.0001) and stainless steel (p < 0.0001). There were no significant growth differences between cobalt chromium alloy and stainless steel (p = 0.4737).

Indole derivatives are more potent signals when the plant polysaccharide xylan serves as a carbon source, a mechanism to sustain beneficial biofilms at a biomass that can be supported by the plant. Moreover, B. subtilis biofilms formed by mutants resistant to indole derivatives become deleterious to the plants due to their capacity to consume and recycle plant polysaccharides. These results demonstrate how a dynamic metabolite-based dialogue can promote homeostasis between plant hosts and their beneficial biofilm communities.","authors":[{"name":"Hadas Ganin"},{"name":"Natalie Kemper"},{"name":"Sagit Meir"},{"name":"Ilana Rogachev"},{"name":"Shir Ely"},{"name":"Hassan Massalha"},{"name":"Aviad Mandaby"},{"name":"Abraham Shanzer"},{"name":"Alona Keren-Paz"},{"name":"Michael M Meijler"},{"name":"Sergey Malitsky"},{"name":"Asaph Aharoni"},{"name":"Ilana Kolodkin-Gal"}],"keywords":[{"word":"metabolism"},{"word":"microbial ecology"},{"word":"molecular signaling"}]},"article377":{"pmid":"30811265","title":"Incidence of Virulence Determinants Among Enterococcal Clinical Isolates in Egypt and Its Association with Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-12-25","abs":"None","authors":[{"name":"Basant Elmetwally Aladarose"},{"name":"Heba Shehta Said"},{"name":"Eman Salama Abdelmegeed"}],"keywords":[{"word":"None"},{"word":"ERIC typing"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"enterococci"},{"word":"virulence factors"}]},"article378":{"pmid":"30811044","title":"The role of rpoS in the regulation of Vibrio alginolyticus virulence and the response to diverse stresses.","date":"2019-05-10","abs":"Vibrio alginolyticus is a leading aquatic pathogen, causing huge losses to aquaculture. rpoS has been proven to play a variety of important roles in stress response and virulence in several bacteria.

Overall, 412 crude cell extracts were tested against Candida albicans using disk diffusion assays, with 42% (43/103) of the strains showing the ability to produce antifungal agents. Also, extracts inhibited growth of important human pathogens: Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida glabrata. Based on the established degree and range of antifungal activity, nine isolates, confirmed as streptomycetes by 16S rRNA sequencing, were selected for further testing. Their ability to inhibit Candida growth in liquid culture, to inhibit biofilm formation, and to disperse pre-formed biofilms was assessed with active concentrations from 8 to 250 μg/mL.

Several bacteria contribute to burn infections; among these, Pseudomonas aeruginosa majorly contributes to these infections revealing significant drug resistance. Similar to other bacteria, P. aeruginosa reveals various mechanisms to attain highest pathogenicity and resistance; among these, efflux pumps and quorum sensing are crucial. Quorum sensing enables effective communication between bacteria and synchronizes their gene expression resulting in optimum effect of the secreted proteins; alternatively, efflux pumps increase the bacterial resistance by pumping out the antimicrobial factors as well as the QS signals and precursors. Of recent, increasing episodes of drug resistance led to new findings and approaches for killing pathogenic bacteria without inducing the drug-resistant species. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), considered as an adjuvant and innovative method for conventional antibiotic therapy, is a photochemical reaction that includes visible light, oxygen, and a photosensitizer (PS). In this therapy, after exposure to visible light, the PS generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Furthermore, this oxidative stress can disrupt the coordination of gene expression and alter the bacterial behavior. Considering the fact that the adaption and several gene expression patterns of microorganisms within the biofilm make them notably resistant to the recent antimicrobial treatments, this study aimed to emphasize the relationship between the efflux pump and QS under oxidative stress and their role in P. aeruginosa's reaction to PDT.","authors":[{"name":"Parizad Rezaie"},{"name":"Maryam Pourhajibagher"},{"name":"Nasim Chiniforush"},{"name":"Nava Hosseini"},{"name":"Abbas Bahador"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy"},{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"}]},"article390":{"pmid":"30809273","title":"Nitric oxide increases biofilm formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by activating the transcriptional factor Mac1p and thereby regulating the transmembrane protein Ctr1.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Biofilms with immobilized cells encased in extracellular polymeric substance are beneficial for industrial fermentation.

As yet, we know little about how various benthic cyanobacteria are distributed in river networks, or how environmental conditions or other associated microbes in their consortia affect their biosynthetic capacities. We performed metagenomic sequencing for 22 Oscillatoriales-dominated (Cyanobacteria) microbial mats collected across the Eel River network in Northern California and investigated factors associated with anatoxin-a producing cyanobacteria. All microbial communities were dominated by one or two cyanobacterial species, so the key mat metabolisms involve oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon oxidation. Only a few metabolisms fueled the growth of the mat communities, with little evidence for anaerobic metabolic pathways. We genomically defined four cyanobacterial species, all which shared <96% average nucleotide identity with reference Oscillatoriales genomes and are potentially novel species in the genus Microcoleus. One of the Microcoleus species contained the anatoxin-a biosynthesis genes, and we describe the first anatoxin-a gene cluster from the Microcoleus clade within Oscillatoriales. Occurrence of these four Microcoleus species in the watershed was correlated with total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, and the species that contains the anatoxin-a gene cluster was found in sites with higher nitrogen concentrations. Microbial assemblages in mat samples with the anatoxin-a gene cluster consistently had a lower abundance of Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria) species than did mats without the anatoxin-producing genes. The associations of water nutrient concentrations and certain co-occurring microbes with anatoxin-a producing Microcoleus motivate further exploration for their roles as potential controls on the distributions of toxigenic benthic cyanobacteria in river networks.","authors":[{"name":"Keith Bouma-Gregson"},{"name":"Matthew R Olm"},{"name":"Alexander J Probst"},{"name":"Karthik Anantharaman"},{"name":"Mary E Power"},{"name":"Jillian F Banfield"}],"keywords":[]},"article393":{"pmid":"30808979","title":"Glyoxylate cycle gene ICL1 is essential for the metabolic flexibility and virulence of Candida glabrata.","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"The human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata appears to utilise unique stealth, evasion and persistence strategies in subverting the onslaught of host immune response during systemic infection. However, macrophages actively deprive the intracellular fungal pathogen of glucose, and therefore alternative carbon sources probably support the growth and survival of engulfed C. glabrata. The present study aimed to investigate the role of the glyoxylate cycle gene ICL1 in alternative carbon utilisation and its importance for the virulence of C. glabrata. The data showed that disruption of ICL1 rendered C. glabrata unable to utilise acetate, ethanol or oleic acid. In addition, C. glabrata icl1∆ cells displayed significantly reduced biofilm growth in the presence of several alternative carbon sources. It was also found that ICL1 is crucial for the survival of C. glabrata in response to macrophage engulfment. Disruption of ICL1 also conferred a severe attenuation in the virulence of C. glabrata in the mouse model of invasive candidiasis. In conclusion, a functional glyoxylate cycle is essential for C. glabrata to utilise certain alternative carbon sources in vitro and to display full virulence in vivo. This reinforces the view that antifungal drugs that target fungal Icl1 have potential for future therapeutic intervention.","authors":[{"name":"Shu Yih Chew"},{"name":"Kok Lian Ho"},{"name":"Yoke Kqueen Cheah"},{"name":"Tzu Shan Ng"},{"name":"Doblin Sandai"},{"name":"Alistair J P Brown"},{"name":"Leslie Thian Lung Than"}],"keywords":[]},"article394":{"pmid":"30808968","title":"Bactericidal ZnO glass-filled thermoplastic polyurethane and polydimethyl siloxane composites to inhibit biofilm-associated infections.","date":"2020-03-17","abs":"This study investigates a novel approach to controlling biofilms of the most frequent pathogens implicated in the etiology of biomaterials-associated infections.
