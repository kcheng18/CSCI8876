Both PK and TO were encapsulated in liposomes to improve their chemical stability and to allow for a controlled release. The optimal PK/TO-loaded liposomes (particle size of 170.4 nm, polydispersity index of 0.309, zeta potential of -29.8 mV and entrapment efficiency of 33.2%) were engineered. The antibacterial activities of the PK/TO liposomes against E. coli O157:H7 biofilms in vitro and on the cucumber were observed. Compared to free PK, free TO, and free PK/TO and TO liposome treatments, PK/TO-liposomes exhibited a higher antibiofilm activity and longer action duration.

Research has shown that the mechanical properties of bilayer membranes significantly affects their biological behavior. The properties of a lipid bilayer are governed by lipid acyl chain length, headgroup type, and the presence of membrane proteins. However, few studies have explored how membrane architecture, in particular trans-bilayer lipid asymmetry, influences membrane mechanical properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of lipid bilayer architecture (i.e. asymmetry) on the mechanical properties of biological membranes. This was achieved using a customized micropipette aspiration system and a novel microfluidic technique previously developed by our team for building asymmetric phospholipid vesicles with tailored bilayer architecture. We found that the bending modulus and area expansion modulus of the synthetic asymmetric bilayers were up to 50% larger than the values acquired for symmetric bilayers. This was caused by the dissimilar lipid distribution in each leaflet of the bilayer for the asymmetric membrane. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the impact of trans-bilayer asymmetry on the area expansion modulus of synthetic bilayer membranes. Since the mechanical properties of bilayer membranes play an important role in numerous cellular processes, these results have significant implications for membrane biology studies.","authors":[{"name":"Li Lu"},{"name":"William J Doak"},{"name":"Jeffrey W Schertzer"},{"name":"Paul R Chiarot"}],"keywords":[]},"article3":{"pmid":"27721053","title":"Piper betle and its bioactive metabolite phytol mitigates quorum sensing mediated virulence factors and biofilm of nosocomial pathogen Serratia marcescens in vitro.","date":"2017-03-21","abs":"Piper betle, a tropical creeper plant belongs to the family Piperaceae.

Interestingly, Py11 exhibited higher anti-biofilm activity against MDRPA compared to LL-37.

In the present study, green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were explored for triggering the ROS production in A431 skin carcinoma cells. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized for size, charge, morphology, and phase through high-throughput DLS, Fe-SEM, XRD, and ATR-FTIR techniques.

The cleaning tests were conducted using commercial alkaline detergents and caustic soda at conditions which are relevant to actual farm environment. The spores removal effect was evaluated by comparing the number of viable spores (attached to sampling plates) before and after cleaning. Evaluation of the cleaning and disinfecting effect of cleaning agents toward biofilm derived spores was further performed, which indicates whether spores elimination effect of an agent is due to killing the spores or removing them from the surfaces of dairy equipment. Moreover, it was established that the presence of extracellular matrix is an important factor responsible for high level of cleaning difficulty characteristic for surface attached spores.

Therefore, new bacterial targets and new antimicrobials are unmet medical needs. Rhodanine derivatives have been shown to possess potent antimicrobial activity via a novel mechanism. However, their potential use as antibacterials has not been fully examined. In this study, we determined the spectrum of activity of seven rhodanine derivatives (compounds Rh 1-7) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and Candida albicans. We also synthesized and tested three additional compounds, ethyl ester and amide of rhodanine 2 (Rh 8 and Rh 10, respectively) and ethyl ester of rhodanine 3 (Rh 9) to determine the significance of the carboxyl group modification towards antibacterial activity and human serum albumin binding. A broth microdilution assay confirmed Rh 1-7 exhibit bactericidal activity against Gram-positive pathogens. Rh 2 had significant activity against various vancomycin-resistant (MIC90 = 4 Î¼M) and methicillin-resistant (MIC90 = 4 Î¼M) Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA and MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC = 4 Î¼M) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains (MIC90 = 8 Î¼M). The rhodanine compounds exhibited potent activity against Bacillus spp., including Bacillus anthracis, with MIC range of 2-8 Î¼M. In addition, they had potent activity against Clostridium difficile. The most potent compound, Rh 2, at 4 and 8 times its MIC, significantly decreased S. epidermidis biofilm mass by more than 35% and 45%, respectively. None of the rhodanine compounds showed antimicrobial activity (MIC > 128 Î¼M) against various 1) Gram-negative pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella Typhimurium) or 2) strains of Candida albicans (MIC > 64 Î¼M). The MTS assay confirmed that rhodanines were not toxic to mouse murine macrophage (J774.1A) up to 64 Î¼M, human keratinocytes (HaCat) up to 32 Î¼M, and human ileocecal colorectal cell (HRT-18) up to 128 Î¼M. Overall, these data suggest that certain rhodanine compounds may have potential use for the treatment of several multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections.","authors":[{"name":"Ahmed AbdelKhalek"},{"name":"Charles R Ashby"},{"name":"Bhargav A Patel"},{"name":"Tanaji T Talele"},{"name":"Mohamed N Seleem"}],"keywords":[]},"article28":{"pmid":"27710799","title":"Trace levels of sewage effluent are sufficient to increase class 1 integron prevalence in freshwater biofilms without changing the core community.","date":"2017-09-04","abs":"Most river systems are impacted by sewage effluent.

Here, we combine computational, biophysical and in cell analysis to address the specific contribution of individual PSMs to biofilm structure. We demonstrate that despite their highly similar sequence and structure, contrary to what it was previously thought, not all PSMs participate in amyloid fibril formation. A balance of hydrophobic/hydrophilic forces and helical propensity seems to define the aggregation propensity of PSMs and control their assembly and function. This knowledge would allow to target specifically the amyloid properties of these peptides. In this way, we show that Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the principal polyphenol in green tea, prevents the assembly of amyloidogenic PSMs and disentangles their preformed amyloid fibrils.","authors":[{"name":"Patrizia Marinelli"},{"name":"Irantzu Pallares"},{"name":"Susanna Navarro"},{"name":"Salvador Ventura"}],"keywords":[]},"article35":{"pmid":"27708366","title":"Biotransformation of ferulic acid to vanillin in the packed bed-stirred fermentors.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"We performed the biotransformation of ferulic acid to vanillin using Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) in the stirring packed-bed reactors filled with carbon fiber textiles (CFT).

The full length enzyme (AaPgaB) and the N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 25-290, AaPgaBN) from A.Â actinomycetemcomitans were cloned, expressed and purified. The enzymatic activities of the AaPgaB enzymes were determined using 7-acetoxycoumarin-3-carboxylic acid as the substrate. The AaPgaB enzymes displayed significantly lower de-N-acetylase activity compared with the activity of the deacetylase PdaA from Bacillus subtilis, a member of the CE4 family of enzymes. To delineate the differences in the activity and the active site architecture, the structure of AaPgaBN was determined. The AaPgaBN structure has two metal ions in the active site instead of one found in other CE4 enzymes. Based on the crystal structure comparisons among the various CE4 enzymes, two residues, Q51 and R271, were identified in AaPgaB, which could potentially affect the enzyme activity. Of the two mutants generated, Q51E and R271K, the variant Q51E showed enhanced activity compared with AaPgaB, validating the requirement that an activating aspartate residue in the active site is essential for higher activity.

Therefore, the purpose of our study was to explore different methods of extracting the total proteins of the E. faecalis (ATCC 33186 standard strain) biofilm. The total proteins in the biofilm were extracted using an ultrasonication method with varied parameters, including duration, amplitude setting, period, and duty cycle. After the optimal conditions of ultrasonication were determined based on the protein profile from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, the total protein content in the biofilm was detected using the bicinchoninic acid assay, Bradford Coomassie brilliant blue assay, and Lowry assay, and the results were compared and analyzed. The parameters for the optimal conditions of ultrasonication were as follows: a processing duration of 2 min, amplitude setting of 20%, and ultrasonication period of 4 s at a 50% duty cycle. The total protein content was 2299.1 mg/dish when measured by the bicinchoninic assay, 3793.8 mg/dish when measured by the Bradford Coomassie brilliant blue assay, and 1858.0 mg/dish when measured by the Lowry assay.

However, the role of other internalin-independent surface proteins as adhesins has been uncharacterized to date. Using two strains each of weakly- and strongly-adherent L. monocytogenes as platforms for temperature-dependent adherence assays and targeted mRNA analyses, these observations (i.e., sessile- and/or temperature-dependent gene expression) were further investigated. Microplate fluorescence assays of both surface-adherent strains exhibited significant (P < 0.05) adherence at higher incubation temperature (42 Â°C). Of the 15 genes selected for RT-qPCR, at least ten gene transcripts recovered from cells (weakly-adherent strain CW35, strongly-adherent strain 99-38) subject to various growth conditions were over expressed [planktonic/30 Â°C (10), sessile/30 Â°C (12), planktonic/42 Â°C (10)] compared to their internal control (16SrRNA transcripts). Of four genes overexpressed in all three conditions tested, three and one were implicated as virulence factors and unknown function, respectively.

The resistance is related to several mechanisms. One of the possible mechanisms is the efflux pump. Using bioinformatics analysis, it was found that BPSL1661, BPSL1664 and BPSL1665 were orthologous genes of the efflux transporter encoding genes for biofilm-related antibiotic resistance, PA1874-PA1877 genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1. Expression of selected encoding genes for the efflux transporter system during biofilm formation were investigated. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR expression of amrB, cytoplasmic membrane protein of AmrAB-OprA efflux transporter encoding gene, was slightly increased, while BPSL1665 was significantly increased during growth of bacteria in biofilm formation. Minimum biofilm inhibition concentration and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ceftazidime (CTZ), doxycycline (DOX) and imipenem were found to be 2- to 1024-times increased when compared to their MICs for of planktonic cells. Inhibition of the efflux transporter by adding phenylalanine arginine Î²-napthylamide (PAÎ²N), a universal efflux inhibitor, decreased 2 to 16 times as much as MBEC in B. pseudomallei biofilms with CTZ and DOX. When the intracellular accumulation of antibiotics was tested to reveal the pump inhibition, only the concentrations of CTZ and DOX increased in PAÎ²N treated biofilm. Taken together, these results indicated that BPSL1665, a putative precursor of the efflux pump gene, might be related to the adaptation of B. pseudomallei in biofilm conditions. Inhibition of efflux pumps may lead to a decrease of resistance to CTZ and DOX in biofilm cells.","authors":[{"name":"Nopphasul Sirijant"},{"name":"Rasana W Sermswan"},{"name":"Surasakdi Wongratanacheewin"}],"keywords":[]},"article50":{"pmid":"27701503","title":"Toothbrushing procedure in schoolchildren with no previous formal instruction: variables associated to dental biofilm removal.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The aim of this study was to establish the association between features regarding brushing procedure performed by schoolchildren without previous formal training and the effectiveness of biofilm removal.

Proteome-wide occurrence of S/T/Y phosphorylation has been reported for many prokaryotic systems. Previously, we reported the phosphoproteome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. In this study, we show the role of S/T phosphorylation of one motility protein, FliC, in regulating multiple surface-associated phenomena of P. aeruginosa PAO1. This is the first report of occurrence of phosphorylation in the flagellar protein, flagellin FliC in its highly conserved N-terminal NDO domain across several Gram negative bacteria. This phosphorylation is likely a well-regulated phenomenon as it is growth phase dependent in planktonic cells. The absence of phosphorylation in the conserved T27 and S28 residues of FliC, interestingly, did not affect swimming motility, but affected the secretome of type 2 secretion system (T2SS) and biofilm formation of PAO1. FliC phosphomutants had increased levels and activities of type 2 secretome proteins. The secretion efficiency of T2SS machinery is associated with flagellin phosphorylation. FliC phosphomutants also formed reduced biofilms at 24 h under static conditions and had delayed biofilm dispersal under dynamic flow conditions, respectively. The levels of type 2 secretome and biofilm formation under static conditions had an inverse correlation. Hence, increase in type 2 secretome levels was accompanied by reduced biofilm formation in the FliC phosphomutants. As T2SS is involved in nutrient acquisition and biofilm dispersal during survival and spread of P. aeruginosa, we propose that FliC phosphorylation has a role in ecological adaptation of this opportunistic environmental pathogen. Altogether, we found a system of phosphorylation that affects key surface related processes such as proteases secretion by T2SS, biofilm formation and dispersal.","authors":[{"name":"Tanujaa Suriyanarayanan"},{"name":"Saravanan Periasamy"},{"name":"Miao-Hsia Lin"},{"name":"Yasushi Ishihama"},{"name":"Sanjay Swarup"}],"keywords":[]},"article52":{"pmid":"27701451","title":"External Resistances Applied to MFC Affect Core Microbiome and Swine Manure Treatment Efficiencies.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can be designed to combine water treatment with concomitant electricity production.

We found that cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulates curli, cellulose, and UPEC biofilms through csgD The alarmone cAMP is produced by adenylate cyclase (CyaA), and deletion of cyaA resulted in reduced extracellular matrix production and biofilm formation. The catabolite repressor protein (CRP) positively regulated csgD transcription, leading to curli and cellulose production in the UPEC isolate, UTI89.

These processes are well known to complicate CAUTI, but the consequences for colonization and persistence of P. mirabilis in polymicrobial biofilms have not been explored. Here we characterized the role of biomineralization in regulating the development of P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa dual-species biofilms. Time-series observations revealed that the dominance of P. mirabilis was synchronized with mineral formation in the biofilm. After 24 hours of development, the dual-species biofilm was dominated by P. mirabilis, and the distribution of P. mirabilis biomass was strongly correlated with the mineral fraction of the biofilm. Conversely, dual-species growth without biomineralization yielded strikingly different patterns in the biofilm, with P. aeruginosa dominating the biofilm biomass. These results show that biomineralization is responsible for the increased success of P. mirabilis in the polymicrobial biofilm. Since biofilm biomineralization commonly occurs in diverse clinical, natural and engineered systems, these findings imply that biomineralization could broadly influence the microbial ecology of multispecies biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaobao Li"},{"name":"Nanxi Lu"},{"name":"Hannah R Brady"},{"name":"Aaron I Packman"}],"keywords":[]},"article62":{"pmid":"27697688","title":"Biofouling in forward osmosis systems: An experimental and numerical study.","date":"2017-09-04","abs":"This study evaluates with numerical simulations supported by experimental data the impact of biofouling on membrane performance in a cross-flow forward osmosis (FO) system.

In this review, we highlight the similarities between cancer cells/tumors and bacterial infections, and present evidence that supports the utilization of some anticancer drugs, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), gallium (Ga) compounds, and mitomycin C, as antibacterials. Each of these drugs has some promising properties such as broad activity (all three compounds), dual antibiotic and antivirulence properties (5-FU), efficacy against multidrug resistant strains (Ga), and the ability to kill metabolically dormant persister cells which cause chronic infections (mitomycin C).","authors":[{"name":"Valerie W C Soo"},{"name":"Brian W Kwan"},{"name":"HÃ©ctor Quezada"},{"name":"Israel Castillo-JuÃ¡rez"},{"name":"Berenice PÃ©rez-Eretza"},{"name":"Silvia Julieta GarcÃ­a-Contreras"},{"name":"Mariano MartÃ­nez-VÃ¡zquez"},{"name":"Thomas K Wood"},{"name":"Rodolfo GarcÃ­a-Contreras"}],"keywords":[{"word":"5-fluorouracil"},{"word":"Antibiotics"},{"word":"Bacteria"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Cancer cells"},{"word":"Gallium"},{"word":"Infections"},{"word":"Mitomycin C"},{"word":"Persisters"},{"word":"Virulence"}]},"article68":{"pmid":"27696696","title":"Growth of Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120âC biofilms in the presence of n-butanol.","date":"2019-01-13","abs":"Biocatalytic processes often encounter problems due to toxic reactants and products, which reduce biocatalyst viability.

This study systematically investigated the physiological response of Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120âC biofilms when exposed to n-butanol, one of the potential next generation biofuels as well as a toxic substance using microscopic and biochemical methods. Initially P.Â taiwanensis VLB120âC biofilms did not show any observable growth in the presence of 3% butanol. Prolonged cultivation of 10Â days led to biofilm adaptation, glucose and oxygen uptake doubled and consequently it was possible to quantify biomass. Complementing the medium with yeast extract and presumably reducing the metabolic burden caused by butanol exposure further increased the biomass yield. In course of cultivation cells reduced their size in the presence of n-butanol which results in an enlarged surface-to-volume ratio and thus increased nutrient uptake. Finally, biofilm enhanced its extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production when exposed to n-butanol. The predominant response of these biofilms under n-butanol stress are higher energy demand, increased biomass yield upon medium complements, larger surface-to-volume ratio and enhanced EPS production. Although we observed a distinct increase in biomass in the presence of 3% butanol it was not possible to cultivate P.Â taiwanensis VLB120âC biofilms at higher n-butanol concentrations.

Different extracellular polymeric substances are used to entrap this multispecies community forming a biofilm, which can be associated to biotic and abiotic surfaces. This widespread and successful way of bacterial life, however, can lead to negative effects for human activity since many pathogen and spoiling bacteria form biofilms which are not easy to eradicate. Therefore, the search for novel anti-biofilm bio-active molecules is a very active research area for which simple, reliable, and fast screening methods are demanded. In this work we have successfully validated an impedance-based method, initially developed for the study of adherent eukaryotic cells, to monitor the formation of single-species biofilms of three model bacteria in real time. The xCelligence real time cell analyzer (RTCA) equipment uses specific microtiter E-plates coated with gold-microelectrodes that detect the attachment of adherent cells, thus modifying the impedance signal. In the current study, this technology allowed the distinction between biofilm-producers and non-producers of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as the formation of Streptococcus mutans biofilms only when sucrose was present in the culture medium. Besides, different impedance values permitted discrimination among the biofilm-producing strains tested regardless of the nature of the polymeric biofilm matrix. Finally, we have continuously monitored the inhibition of staphylococcal biofilm formation by the bacteriophage phi-IPLA7 and the bacteriophage-encoded endolysin LysH5, as well as the removal of a preformed biofilm by this last antimicrobial treatment. Results observed with the impedance-based method showed high correlation with those obtained with standard approaches, such as crystal violet staining and bacteria enumeration, as well as with those obtained upon other abiotic surfaces (polystyrene and stainless steel). Therefore, this RTCA technology opens new opportunities in the biofilm research arena and its application could be further explored for other bacterial genera as well as for different bio-active molecules.","authors":[{"name":"Diana GutiÃ©rrez"},{"name":"Claudio Hidalgo-Cantabrana"},{"name":"Ana RodrÃ­guez"},{"name":"Pilar GarcÃ­a"},{"name":"Patricia Ruas-Madiedo"}],"keywords":[]},"article74":{"pmid":"27695050","title":"Graphlet Based Metrics for the Comparison of Gene Regulatory Networks.","date":"2019-02-12","abs":"Understanding the control of gene expression remains one of the main challenges in the post-genomic era. Accordingly, a plethora of methods exists to identify variations in gene expression levels. These variations underlay almost all relevant biological phenomena, including disease and adaptation to environmental conditions. However, computational tools to identify how regulation changes are scarce. Regulation of gene expression is usually depicted in the form of a gene regulatory network (GRN). Structural changes in a GRN over time and conditions represent variations in the regulation of gene expression. Like other biological networks, GRNs are composed of basic building blocks called graphlets. As a consequence, two new metrics based on graphlets are proposed in this work: REConstruction Rate (REC) and REC Graphlet Degree (RGD). REC determines the rate of graphlet similarity between different states of a network and RGD identifies the subset of nodes with the highest topological variation. In other words, RGD discerns how th GRN was rewired. REC and RGD were used to compare the local structure of nodes in condition-specific GRNs obtained from gene expression data of Escherichia coli, forming biofilms and cultured in suspension. According to our results, most of the network local structure remains unaltered in the two compared conditions. Nevertheless, changes reported by RGD necessarily imply that a different cohort of regulators (i.e. transcription factors (TFs)) appear on the scene, shedding light on how the regulation of gene expression occurs when E. coli transits from suspension to biofilm. Consequently, we propose that both metrics REC and RGD should be adopted as a quantitative approach to conduct differential analyses of GRNs. A tool that implements both metrics is available as an on-line web server (http://dlab.cl/loto).","authors":[{"name":"Alberto J M Martin"},{"name":"Calixto Dominguez"},{"name":"SebastiÃ¡n Contreras-Riquelme"},{"name":"David S Holmes"},{"name":"Tomas Perez-Acle"}],"keywords":[]},"article75":{"pmid":"27695030","title":"Phosphorylation of Staphylococcus aureus Protein-Tyrosine Kinase Affects the Function of Glucokinase and Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"When Staphylococcus aureus is grown in the presence of high concentration of external glucose, this sugar is phosphorylated by glucokinase (glkA) to form glucose-6-phosphate.

To study jackpot events in spatially structured populations, we track mutant clones in microbial populations using fluorescence microscopy and population sequencing. High-frequency mutations are found to be massively enriched in microbial colonies compared with well-shaken liquid cultures, as a result of late-occurring mutations surfing at the edge of range expansions. Thus, jackpot events can be generated not only when mutations arise early but also when they occur at favourable locations, which exacerbates their role in adaptation and disease. In particular, because spatial competition with the wild type keeps most mutant clones in a quiescent state, strong selection pressures that kill the wild type promote drug resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Diana Fusco"},{"name":"Matti Gralka"},{"name":"Jona Kayser"},{"name":"Alex Anderson"},{"name":"Oskar Hallatschek"}],"keywords":[]},"article78":{"pmid":"27694725","title":"Biofilm-forming and antimicrobial resistance traits of staphylococci isolated from goat dairy plants.","date":"2018-10-23","abs":"Biofilm-associated antimicrobial resistance is of increasing importance to the maintenance and spread of foodborne pathogens in the food industry.

The objective of this study was to propose a new drug candidate against the biofilm formation promoted by subinhibitory dose of antimicrobials. To determine the effect on biofilm formation of Escherichia coli, a subinhibitory concentration of lactoferrin (LF), a milk protein involved in a broad range of biological properties including antimicrobial action, or ampicillin (AMP), a typical antibiotic, was added to an E. coli cell culture in a 96-well microtiter plate. On the other hand, warfarin (WARF), an oral anticoagulant, or polymyxin B (PMB), a strong antibiotic for biofilm treatment, was added as an antagonist against the biofilm promoted by LF or AMP. The amount of biofilm formed at 100Î¼g/mL LF in lysogeny broth medium was four times higher than in the absence of LF. Meanwhile, it was found that WARF suppressed the LF-promoted biofilm formation to a level comparable with the LF-free condition. WARF worked in a similar manner to PMB, which is known as an antibiofilm agent. Furthermore, WARF could also suppress the biofilm promoted by AMP.

However, bringing AMPs into clinics requires to overcome their low stability, high toxicity and inefficient delivery to the target site at high concentrations.

Furthermore, AuNPs@Esc(1-21) resulted to be significantly more resistant to proteolytic digestion and to disintegrate the bacterial membrane at very low concentration (5nM). Finally, we demonstrated for the first time the capability of peptide-coated AuNPs to display a wound healing activity on a keratinocytes monolayer.

For several decades they have attracted interest as promising alternatives to current petroleum-based surfactants. Aside from their green profile, they have remarkably low critical micelle concentrations, reduce the air/water surface tension to very low levels and are excellent emulsifiers, all of which make them comparable or superior to their synthetic counterparts. These remarkable physical properties derive from their more complex chemical structures in which hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions are not as clearly separated as chemical surfactants but have a more mosaic distribution of polarity as well as branched or circular structures. This allows the lipopeptide surfactin to adopt spherical structures to facilitate dense packing at interfaces. They are also more complex. Glycolipid BS, e.g. rhamnolipids (RL) and sophorolipids, are produced biologically as mixtures which vary in the size and saturation of the hydrophobic region as well as modifications in the hydrophilic headgroup, such as the number of sugar groups and different levels of acetylation, leading to variable surface-active properties. Their amphiphilicity allows RL to insert easily into membranes at sub-cmc concentrations to modulate membrane structure and extract lipopolysaccharides, leading to extensive biofilm remodeling in vivo, sometimes in collaboration with hydrophobic RL precursors. Thanks to their mosaicity, even anionic BS like RL only bind weakly to proteins and show much lower denaturing potency, even supporting membrane protein refolding. Nevertheless, they can promote protein degradation by proteases e.g. by neutralizing positive charges, which together with their biofilm-combating properties makes them very promising detergent surfactants.

Canonical LuxI/R-type/acyl homoserine lactone mediated quorum sensing system is the best studied quorum sensing circuit and is described in Gram-negative bacteria which employ it for inter-species communication mostly. Gram-positive bacteria possess a peptide-mediated quorum sensing system.

Exfoliating oral epithelial cells act as reservoirs for key periodontal pathogens, facilitating reinfection or infection of new sites. Since saliva is a rich source of oral epithelial cells, we hypothesized that the microbial and functional profile of salivary epithelial cells (SECs) will reflect the in situ host response and disease severity. We used a case-control study design. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected from 20 chronic periodontitis patients and 20 healthy controls in accordance with the institutional review board. The isolated SECs were assessed for viability by trypan blue exclusion. Gram-stained SECs were analyzed by ImageJ, and Gram stain index (GSI) per SEC was calculated. Equal numbers of SECs from each sample were exposed to 2 periodontal pathogens- Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum-in biofilm or planktonic formulations at varying proportions. Cytokines in culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Additionally, soluble Toll-like receptor 2 (sTLR-2)-a pattern recognition receptor capable of binding microbial ligands associated with periodontitis-was measured in clarified saliva by ELISA. An increased number of SECs, a higher GSI/SEC, and a lower sTLR-2 were observed in periodontitis saliva as compared with healthy saliva. SECs from periodontitis saliva secreted higher amounts of interleukin 8 in response to P. gingivalis, and the presence of F. nucleatum dampened the response. Nonsurgical periodontal treatment improved clinical parameters, reduced the number of SECs, decreased GSI/SEC, and increased sTLR-2 in clarified saliva. In conclusion, our data suggest that SECs can provide a phenotypically distinct individualized resource for assessing epithelial response to pathogens in the course of periodontal disease. Furthermore, correlation between the sTLR-2 and GSI/SEC suggests that the expression profile of epithelial and soluble Toll-like receptor could provide an indirect measure of periodontal disease-associated dysbiosis. Knowledge Transfer Statement: The results of this study can be used for prognostic evaluation of chronic periodontitis in response to therapy and provide an opportunity for early identification of poor responders. A chip-based simple test incorporating the identified salivary epithelial cell characteristics can be developed and validated for future clinical applications, especially for monitoring patients with increased susceptibility for refractory and/or recurrent periodontitis.","authors":[{"name":"A Wang"},{"name":"C Swinford"},{"name":"A Zhao"},{"name":"E D Ramos"},{"name":"R L Gregory"},{"name":"M Srinivasan"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Toll-like receptor"},{"word":"chronic periodontitis"},{"word":"cytokines"},{"word":"periodontal pathogens"},{"word":"prognosis"},{"word":"saliva"}]},"article96":{"pmid":"30375825","title":"A 'green' means of effective disinfection.","date":"2018-11-16","abs":"John Ware, director at Envirolyte, a specialist in water purification, sterilization, and disinfection, describes the workings and benefits of the company's electrolysed water technology.

The aim of this study was to assess the inhibitory effect of a 2-methacryloxylethyl dodecyl methyl ammonium bromide (MAE-DB)-incorporated sealant against Streptococcus mutans. MAE-DB (4% wt) was incorporated into a commercially available sealant, Eco-S resin-based pit-and-fissure sealant (Vericom Co., Ltd., Korea); a sealant without MAE-DB served as a negative control, and Clinproâ¢ Sealant (3Mâ¢ ESPEâ¢), a fluoride-releasing resin, was used as a commercial control. The effects of the cured sealants and their eluents on the growth of S. mutans were determined according to colony-forming unit counts and metabolic tests. The effects of the cured sealants on the adherence and membrane integrity of S. mutans were investigated using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) in conjunction with fluorescent indicators. Compared with the negative control and commercial control, the cured MAE-DB-incorporated pit-and-fissure sealant exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of S. mutans (P < 0.05), whereas the eluents did not show any detectable antibacterial activity. The commercial control also showed no detectable bactericidal activity. Moreover, the aged experimental material retained its property of contact inhibition of biofilm formation. The fluorescence analysis of CLSM images demonstrated that the cured MAE-DB-incorporated sealant could hamper the adherence of S. mutans and exert a detrimental effect on bacterial membrane integrity. The incorporation of MAE-DB can render a pit-and-fissure sealant with contact antibacterial activity after polymerization via influencing the growth, adherence, and membrane integrity of S. mutans. Therefore, MAE-DB-containing pit-and-fissure sealant shows promise for preventing or controlling dental caries on occlusal pit and fissures of molars.","authors":[{"name":"Fan Yu"},{"name":"Haohan Yu"},{"name":"Pingting Lin"},{"name":"Yan Dong"},{"name":"Ling Zhang"},{"name":"Xiang Sun"},{"name":"Zhengya Liu"},{"name":"Huihui Guo"},{"name":"Li Huang"},{"name":"Jihua Chen"}],"keywords":[]},"article102":{"pmid":"27685160","title":"In Situ Impregnation of Silver Nanoclusters in Microporous Chitosan-PEG Membranes as an Antibacterial and Drug Delivery Percutaneous Device.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"An in situ synthesis method for preparing silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) embedded in chitosan-polyethylene glycol (CS-PEG) membranes is disclosed.

To address the question of how quorum sensing controls biofilm formation in A. ferrooxidans (T), the transcriptome of this organism in conditions in which quorum sensing response is stimulated by a synthetic superagonist AHL (N-acyl homoserine lactones) analog has been studied. First, the effect on biofilm formation of a synthetic AHL tetrazolic analog, tetrazole 9c, known for its agonistic QS activity, was assessed by fluorescence and electron microscopy. A fast adherence of A. ferrooxidans (T) cells on sulfur coupons was observed. Then, tetrazole 9c was used in DNA microarray experiments that allowed the identification of genes regulated by quorum sensing signaling, and more particularly, those involved in early biofilm formation. Interestingly, afeI gene, encoding the AHL synthase, but not the A. ferrooxidans quorum sensing transcriptional regulator AfeR encoding gene, was shown to be regulated by quorum sensing. Data indicated that quorum sensing network represents at least 4.5% (141 genes) of the ATCC 23270(T) genome of which 42.5% (60 genes) are related to biofilm formation. Finally, AfeR was shown to bind specifically to the regulatory region of the afeI gene at the level of the palindromic sequence predicted to be the AfeR binding site.

Here, we explore the role of one of these Ahp homologs, AhpA. While previous studies demonstrated that AhpA can scavenge peroxides and thus defend cells against peroxides, they did not clarify when during growth the cell produces AhpA. The results presented here show that the expression of ahpA is regulated in a manner distinct from that of the other peroxide-scavenging enzymes in B.Â subtilis. While the primary Ahp, AhpC, is expressed during exponential growth and stationary phase, these studies demonstrate that the expression of ahpA is dependent on the transition-state regulator AbrB and the sporulation and biofilm formation transcription factor Spo0A. Furthermore, these results show that ahpA is specifically expressed during biofilm formation, and not during sporulation or stationary phase, suggesting that derepression of ahpA by AbrB requires a signal other than those present upon entry into stationary phase. Despite this expression pattern, ahpA mutant strains still form and maintain robust biofilms, even in the presence of peroxides. Thus, the role of AhpA with regard to protecting cells within biofilms from environmental stresses is still uncertain. These studies highlight the need to further study the Ahp homologs to better understand how they differ from one another and the unique roles they may play in oxidative stress resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Joelie V Zwick"},{"name":"Sarah Noble"},{"name":"Yasser K Ellaicy"},{"name":"Gabrielle Dierker Coe"},{"name":"Dylan J Hakey"},{"name":"Alyssa N King"},{"name":"Alex J Sadauskas"},{"name":"Melinda J Faulkner"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AbrB"},{"word":"AhpC"},{"word":"Spo0A"},{"word":"alkylhydroperoxide reductase"},{"word":"biofilm formation"},{"word":"oxidative stress"},{"word":"peroxide"},{"word":"peroxiredoxin"},{"word":"sporulation"}]},"article108":{"pmid":"27682847","title":"Quantification of biofilm formation on silicone intranasal splints: An in vitro study.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Biofilms are associated with persistent infections and resistant to conventional therapeutic strategies.

Consequently, we hypothesized that fibrin is a key component of the extracellular matrix of S. aureus biofilms under in vivo conditions, and that the recalcitrance of biofilm infections can be overcome by combining antibiotic treatment with a fibrinolytic drug. We quantified S. aureus USA300 biofilms grown on peg-lids in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth with 0%-50% human plasma. Young (2 h) and mature (24 h) biofilms were then treated with streptokinase to determine if this lead to dispersal.

KpTs101 polysaccharide is neutral and composed only of galactose, in both pyranose and furanose ring configurations. Conversely, KpTs113 polysaccharide is anionic due to glucuronic acid units, and also contains glucose and mannose residues. The susceptibility of the two strains to two bovine cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides, BMAP-27 and Bac7(1-35), was assessed using both planktonic cultures and biofilms. Biofilm matrices exerted a relevant protection against both antimicrobials, which act with quite different mechanisms. Similar protection was also detected when antimicrobial peptides were tested against planktonic bacteria in the presence of the polysaccharides extracted from KpTs101 and KpTs113 biofilms, suggesting sequestering adduct formation with antimicrobials. Circular dichroism experiments on BMAP-27 in the presence of increasing amounts of either polysaccharide confirmed their ability to interact with the peptide and induce an Î±-helical conformation.

At 4, 10, and 20 Â°C, an inoculum of 8 log PFU/cmÂ² was required to completely eliminate 2 log L. monocytogenes/cmÂ² and to reach the absence in 25 g product according to USA food law.

P100 remained stable on dry-cured ham slices over a 14-day storage period, with only a marginal loss of 0.2 log PFU/cmÂ² from an initial phage treatment of approximately 8 log PFU/cmÂ². Moreover, phage P100 eliminated free L. monocytogenes cells and biofilms on the machinery surfaces used for dry-cured ham production.

We sought to compare the development of epinecrotic (biofilms on Sus scrofa domesticus carcasses) and epilithic (biofilms on unglazed ceramic tiles) communities in two small streams using bacterial automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. Epinecrotic communities were significantly different from epilithic communities even though environmental factors associated with each stream location also had a significant influence on biofilm structure. All communities at both locations exhibited significant succession suggesting that changing communities throughout time is a general characteristic of stream biofilm communities. The implications resulting from this work are that epinecrotic communities have distinctive shifts at the first and second weeks, and therefore the potential to be used in forensic applications by associating successional changes with submersion time to estimate a PMSI. The influence of environmental factors, however, indicates the lack of a successional pattern with the same organisms and a focus on functional diversity may be more applicable in a forensic context.

Multidrug-resistant (â¥3 antibiotic groups) S. capitis was detected in 28.6Â % of isolates, methicillin resistance in 38.1Â % and fluoroquinolone resistance in 14.3Â %; no isolates were rifampin-resistant. Heterogeneous glycopeptide-intermediate resistance was detected in 38.1Â %. Biofilm-forming ability was common. All episodes were either early post-interventional or chronic, and there were no haematogenous infections. Ten patients experienced monomicrobial infections.

To this end, the sessile worm Tubifex tubifex was used as a model oligochaete and was batch cultivated in an 18-L airlift reactor.

Sludge predation resulted in an increased release of inorganic nitrogen, phosphate and soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD). The sCOD consisted mainly of polysaccharides; however, fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy analysis also revealed the presence of Tryptophan-protein-like substances. Results suggest that the released polysaccharides contain a protein-like element. Additionally, soluble iron increased slightly in concentration after WP. The extent of hydrolysis seemed to reach an average plateau of about 40% volatile solids (VS) reduction after 4 days, which is substantially higher than the 29% VS reduction for endogenous decay of activated sludge after 30 days. Furthermore, T. tubifex predominantly consumed the protein fraction of the extracellular polymeric substances.

In dynamic mode (circulation of a contaminated nutrient medium), there was no observable bacterial adhesion at the surface of the Cu-exchanged material. These results confirm the antifouling properties of the Cu-mordenite layer due to both the increased hydrophilicity and antibacterial properties of the active layer.Tests performed with tubular filtration membranes (without copper exchange) showed a significant decline in membrane hydraulic properties during filtration of culture media containing bacteria, whereas copper-exchanged membranes showed no decline in hydraulic permeability. Filtration tests performed with concentrated culture media containing spores of B. subtilis led to a significant decrease in membrane hydraulic permeabilities (but less so with Cu-exchanged membranes). The surfaces showed less effective global antifouling properties during the filtration of a concentrated culture medium due to competition between bacterial growth and the bactericidal effect of copper.

It is synthesized by diguanylate cyclases (with GGDEF domains), degraded by specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs, with EAL of HD-GYP domains) and sensed by a wide variety of c-di-GMP-binding effectors that control diverse targets. c-di-GMP-binding effectors can be riboswitches as well as proteins with highly diverse structures and functions. The latter include 'degenerate' GGDEF/EAL domain proteins that are enzymatically inactive but still able to bind c-di-GMP. Surprisingly, two enzymatically active 'trigger PDEs', the Escherichia coli proteins PdeR and PdeL, have recently been added to this list of c-di-GMP-sensing effectors. Mechanistically, trigger PDEs are multifunctional.

The resulting kinetics and circuitry of control are ideally suited for trigger PDEs to serve as key components in regulatory switches.This article is part of the themed issue 'The new bacteriology'.","authors":[{"name":"Regine Hengge"}],"keywords":[{"word":"EAL domain"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cellulose"},{"word":"curli fibres"},{"word":"diguanylate cyclase"},{"word":"second messenger"}]},"article135":{"pmid":"27672085","title":"The Bacterial Second Messenger Cyclic di-GMP Regulates Brucella Pathogenesis and Leads to Altered Host Immune Response.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Brucella species are facultative intracellular bacteria that cause brucellosis, a chronic debilitating disease significantly impacting global health and prosperity. Much remains to be learned about how Brucella spp. succeed in sabotaging immune host cells and how Brucella spp. respond to environmental challenges. Multiple types of bacteria employ the prokaryotic second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) to coordinate responses to shifting environments. To determine the role of c-di-GMP in Brucella physiology and in shaping host-Brucella interactions, we utilized c-di-GMP regulatory enzyme deletion mutants.

Here, we report the discovery of a novel plant defence mechanism resulting from an unusual symbiosis between finger millet and a root-inhabiting bacterial endophyte, M6 (Enterobacter sp.). Seed-coated M6 swarms towards root-invading Fusarium and is associated with the growth of root hairs, which then bend parallel to the root axis, subsequently forming biofilm-mediated microcolonies, resulting in a remarkable, multilayer root-hair endophyte stack (RHESt). The RHESt results in a physical barrier that prevents entry and/or traps F. graminearum, which is then killed. M6 thus creates its own specialized killing microhabitat. Tn5-mutagenesis shows that M6 killing requires c-di-GMP-dependent signalling, diverse fungicides and resistance to a Fusarium-derived antibiotic. Further molecular evidence suggests long-term host-endophyte-pathogen co-evolution. The end result of this remarkable symbiosis is reduced deoxynivalenol mycotoxin, potentially benefiting millions of subsistence farmers and livestock. Further results suggest that the anti-Fusarium activity of M6 may be transferable to maize and wheat.

Each strain was inoculated onto blood agar plates containing one of the antimicrobial agents. The plates were incubated anaerobically at 37Â°C for 96 hr and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined. Ten strains required an MIC of 32 Î¼g/ml or greater for amoxicillin, 6 for cefmetazole, and 5 for cefcapene among Î²-lactam antibiotics; 8 strains required an MIC of 32 Î¼g/ml or greater for clindamycin, 4 for azithromycin, and 11 for clarithromycin among macrolide antibiotics; 3 strains required an MIC of 32 Î¼g/ml or greater for ciprofloxacin and 2 for ofloxacin among fluoroquinolones. The effect of cefcapene on 5 strains was evaluated after biofilm formation to investigate the relationship between biofilm formation and susceptibility. All strains showed a decrease in susceptibility after biofilm formation. The results revealed that several antimicrobial agents commonly used in a clinical setting, including amoxicillin, cefmetazole, and clindamycin, are potentially effective in the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections. The development of resistant strains, however, means that this can no longer be guaranteed. In addition, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin were more effective than the 3 Î²-lactam antibiotics tested.

A deep sequence analysis of GeCKO library transferred to the cells shows that the chance to succeed in the selection of antibody-negative cells and, therefore, to identify a mAb depends on the quality of cell library preparation. We believe that the described method is applicable for identification of many other hybridomas and represents a good alternative to the current protein- and gene-based methods used for mAb validation.","authors":[{"name":"Anastasia Zotova"},{"name":"Ivan Zotov"},{"name":"Alexander Filatov"},{"name":"Dmitriy Mazurov"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Antigen specificity"},{"word":"CRISPR/Cas9"},{"word":"Cell sorting"},{"word":"Knockout library"},{"word":"Monoclonal antibody"}]},"article158":{"pmid":"27664741","title":"Unraveling the predator-prey relationship of Cupriavidus necator and Bacillus subtilis.","date":"2018-05-12","abs":"Cupriavidus necator is a non-obligate bacterial predator of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

The predatory activity depends on the nutrition status of C. necator, but does not require a quorum of predator cells. This suggests that C. necator is no group predator. Further analyses revealed that sporulation enables B. subtilis to avoid predation by C. necator. In contrast to the interaction with predatory myxobacteria, however, an intact spore coat is not required for resistance. Instead resistance is possibly mediated by quiescence.

The alarmone guanosine 5'-triphosphate-3'-diphosphate (ppGpp), the levels of which are regulated by the RelA and SpoT enzymes, plays a critical role in mediating bacterial adaptive responses and virulence. However, the mechanism by which ppGpp regulates virulence-associated traits in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is poorly understood. To investigate the regulatory role of ppGpp, the ppGpp-deficient strain ÎRS (relA and spoT gene double mutant) and the complemented strain ÎRS(++) (complemented with relA and spoT genes) were constructed. Herein, we reported that the ÎRS strain showed decreased cytotoxicity towards A549 human alveolar adenocarcinoma cell lines and led to reduced mortality, lung edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in a mouse model of acute pneumonia compared to wild-type PAO1 and the complemented strain ÎRS(++). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that the ÎRS strain displayed reduced T3SS expression, decreased levels of elastase activity, pyocyanin, pyoverdin and alginate, and inhibited swarming and biofilm formation compared to PAO1 and the complemented strain ÎRS(++). In addition, the results demonstrate that ppGpp-mediated regulation of T3SS, virulence factor production, and swarming occurs in a quinolone quorum-sensing system-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that ppGpp is required for virulence regulation in P. aeruginosa, providing new clues for the development of interference strategies against bacterial infection.

Some C. tropicalis tended to produce more hyphae than others in the same circumstance. Six C. tropicalis strains with different morphologies were injected into mice via the tail vein, and the survival proportions and fungal burdens of the strains were evaluated. Hyphal production by C. tropicalis was associated with stronger virulence. RNA sequencing revealed that C. tropicalis with more hyphae up-regulated several genes involved in morphological differentiation and oxidative response, including IF2, Atx1, and Sod2.

Infectious complications have been reported in >25% of those evacuated for trauma, and 50% of such patients were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Osteomyelitis has been reported in 9% (14% of intensive care unit patients), and deep-wound infection in 27% of type III open-tibia fractures. Infections complicating extremity trauma are frequently caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria and have been demonstrated to lead to failure of limb salvage, unplanned operative take-backs, late amputations, and decreased likelihood of returning to duty. Invasive fungal infections of extremities have also presented a unique challenge in combat-injured patients, particularly in those with blast injuries with massive transfusion requirements and high injury severity scores. Infection prevention should begin at the time of injury and, although context-specific depending on the level of care, includes appropriate irrigation, surgical debridement, wound care and coverage, fracture fixation, and antibiotic prophylaxis, in addition to basic infection prevention measures. Clinical practice guidelines to address infection prevention after combat trauma (including extremity infection) were developed in 2007 and revised in 2011, with endorsement from the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain, including austere environments of care, multiple transitions of care, and lack of coordinated efforts in prevention. Treatment of established infections is optimally multidisciplinary, particularly when deep wounds, bone, and joints are involved. Surgical debridement of overtly infected or necrotic tissue is necessary, with particularly aggressive margins if invasive fungal infection is suspected. Infected nonunion frequently requires the use of prosthetic materials for fixation, potentiating biofilm formation, and complicating medical therapy. Antibiotic therapy should be targeted at results of deep wound and bone cultures. However, this is complicated by frequent contamination of wounds, requiring differentiation between potential pathogens in terms of their virulence and decreased culture recovery in patient who have frequently received previous antibiotics. Lessons learned in infection prevention and treatment of orthopaedic trauma from combat can serve to inform the care of patients injured in natural disasters and noncombat trauma.","authors":[{"name":"Heather C Yun"},{"name":"Clinton K Murray"},{"name":"Kenneth J Nelson"},{"name":"Michael J Bosse"}],"keywords":[]},"article170":{"pmid":"27660992","title":"Enhanced butanol production by solvent tolerance Clostridium acetobutylicum SE25 from cassava flour in a fibrous bed bioreactor.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"To enhance the butanol productivity and reduce the material cost, acetone, butanol, and ethanol fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum SE25 was investigated using batch, repeated-batch and continuous cultures in a fibrous bed bioreactor, where cassava flour was used as the substrate.

Surprisingly, this anti-microbial agent preserves symbionts like Lactobacillus species. Moreover, ethyl pyruvate prevents the formation of biofilms and promotes matured biofilms dissolution. This potentially new anti-microbial and anti-biofilm agent could have a tremendous positive impact on human, veterinary medicine and technical industry as well.","authors":[{"name":"Tewodros Debebe"},{"name":"Monika KrÃ¼ger"},{"name":"Klaus Huse"},{"name":"Johannes Kacza"},{"name":"Katja MÃ¼hlberg"},{"name":"Brigitte KÃ¶nig"},{"name":"Gerd Birkenmeier"}],"keywords":[]},"article181":{"pmid":"27658123","title":"Occlusal Caries: Biological Approach for Its Diagnosis and Management.","date":"2018-05-28","abs":"The management of occlusal caries still remains a major challenge for researchers as well as for general practitioners. The present paper reviews and discusses the most up-to-date knowledge and evidence of the biological principles guiding diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of the caries process on occlusal surfaces. In addition, it considers the whole spectrum of the caries process on occlusal surfaces, ranging from the molecular ecology of occlusal biofilms to the management of deep occlusal caries lesions. Studies using molecular methods with focus on biofilms in relation to occlusal caries should explore the relationship between the function and the structural composition of these biofilms to understand the role of occlusal biofilms in caries development. State-of-the-art measures to evaluate risk for occlusal caries lesion activity, caries incidence, and progression should include the assessment of the occlusal biofilm and the stage of tooth eruption. Careful clinical examination of non-cavitated lesions, including assessment of the lesion activity status, remains the major tool to determine the immediate treatment need and to follow on the non-operative treatment outcome. Even medium occlusal caries lesions in the permanent dentition may be treated by non-invasive fissure sealing. By extending the criteria for non-invasive treatments, traditional restoration of occlusal surfaces can be postponed or even avoided, and the dental health in children and adolescents can be improved. Selective removal (incomplete) to soft dentin in deep carious lesions has greater success rates than stepwise excavation. Selective (complete) removal to firm dentin has a lower success rate due to increased pulp exposure.","authors":[{"name":"Joana Christina Carvalho"},{"name":"Irene Dige"},{"name":"Vita Machiulskiene"},{"name":"Vibeke Qvist"},{"name":"Azam Bakhshandeh"},{"name":"Clarissa Fatturi-Parolo"},{"name":"Marisa Maltz"}],"keywords":[]},"article182":{"pmid":"27657657","title":"The potential of hybrid forward osmosis membrane bioreactor (FOMBR) processes in achieving high throughput treatment of municipal wastewater with enhanced phosphorus recovery.","date":"2017-09-11","abs":"Extensive research in recent years has explored numerous new features in the forward osmosis membrane bioreactor (FOMBR) process. However, there is an aspect, which is revolutionary but not yet been investigated. In FOMBR, FO membrane shows high rejection for a wide range of soluble contaminants. As a result, hydraulic retention time (HRT) does not correctly reflect the nominal retention of these dissolved contaminants in the bioreactor. This decoupling of contaminants retention time (CRT, i.e. the nominal retention of the dissolved contaminants) from HRT endows FOMBR a potential in significantly reducing the HRT for wastewater treatment. In this work, we report our results in this unexplored treatment potential. Using real municipal wastewater as feed, both a hybrid microfiltration-forward osmosis membrane bioreactor (MF-FOMBR) and a newly developed hybrid biofilm-forward osmosis membrane bioreactor (BF-FOMBR) achieved high removal of organic matter and nitrogen under HRT of down to 2.0Â h, with significantly enhanced phosphorus recovery capacities. In the BF-FOMBR, the used of fixed bed biofilm not only obviated the need of additional solid/liquid separation (e.g. MF) to extract the side-stream for salt accumulation control and phosphorus recovery, but effectively quarantined the biomass from the FO membrane. The absence of MF in the side-stream further allowed suspended growth to be continuously removed from the system, which produced a selection pressure for the predominance of attached growth. As a result, a significant reduction in FO membrane fouling (by 24.7-54.5%) was achieved in the BF-FOMBR due to substantially reduced bacteria deposition and colonization.","authors":[{"name":"Guanglei Qiu"},{"name":"Sui Zhang"},{"name":"Divya Shankari Srinivasa Raghavan"},{"name":"Subhabrata Das"},{"name":"Yen-Peng Ting"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Contaminants retention time (CRT)"},{"word":"Forward osmosis membrane bioreactor"},{"word":"Hybrid biofilm-forward osmosis membrane bioreactor"},{"word":"Hybrid microfiltration-forward osmosis membrane bioreactor"},{"word":"Membrane fouling"},{"word":"Phosphorus recovery"}]},"article183":{"pmid":"27656070","title":"Effect of chitosan-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid on Enterococcus faecalis dentinal biofilm and smear layer removal.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of chitosan and chitosan-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (3:1,1:1,1:3) in comparison with 5.2% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in disinfecting Enterococcus faecalis biofilm on root canal dentin and in the removal of smear layer with minimal erosion.","authors":[{"name":"Nagarajan Geethapriya"},{"name":"Arunajatesan Subbiya"},{"name":"Kesavaram Padmavathy"},{"name":"Krishnan Mahalakshmi"},{"name":"Paramasivam Vivekanandan"},{"name":"Virudhachalam Ganapathy Sukumaran"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Chitosan"},{"word":"Enterococcus faecalis"},{"word":"chitosan-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid"},{"word":"dentinal biofilm"},{"word":"ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid"}]},"article184":{"pmid":"27655385","title":"A CHASE3/GAF sensor hybrid histidine kinase BmsA modulates biofilm formation and motility in Pseudomonas alkylphenolica.","date":"2019-11-01","abs":"Pseudomonas alkylphenolica is an important strain in the biodegradation of toxic alkylphenols and mass production of bioactive polymannuronate polymers.

In addition, the gene, named here as bmsA, is co-transcribed with three genes encoding proteins with CheR (PSAKL28_21700) and CheB (PSAKL28_21710) domains and response regulator and histidine kinase domains (PSAKL28_21720). This gene cluster is thus named bmsABCD and is found widely distributed in pseudomonads and other bacteria. Deletion of the genes in the cluster, except forbmsA, did not result in changes in biofilm-related phenotypes. The RNA-seq analysis showed that the expression of genes coding for flagellar synthesis was increased when bmsA was mutated. In addition, the expression of rsmZ, which is one of final targets of the Gac regulon, was not significantly altered in the bmsA mutant, and overexpression of bmsA in the gacA mutant did not produce the WT phenotype.

Clinical examinations assessed the presence of gingivitis (primary outcome) and biofilm accumulation (secondary outcome) using the Gingival-Bleeding Index (GBI) and Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), respectively, at baseline and after seven days of tooth brushing 3x/day. The data were analyzed using paired and unpaired t-test (GBI) and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney (OHI-S), with pâ¤0.05. The experimental dentifrice showed efficient antibacterial activity in vitro.

Here, we compare the activation of natural and synthetic Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasI/R QS systems in bacteria exposed to quiescent conditions and controlled flows. Quantification of QS-dependent GFP expression in suspended cultures and in surface-attached microcolonies revealed that QS onset in both systems was similar under quiescent conditions but markedly differed under flow. Moderate flow (Peâ>â25) was sufficient to suppress LasI/R QS recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, whereas only high flow (Peâ>â102) suppressed QS in wild-type P. aeruginosa.

These results suggest that the expression of a biofilm matrix extends the environmental conditions under which QS-based cell-cell communication is effective and that findings from synthetic QS circuits cannot be directly translated to natural systems.","authors":[{"name":"Philippe Emge"},{"name":"Jens Moeller"},{"name":"Hongchul Jang"},{"name":"Roberto Rusconi"},{"name":"Yutaka Yawata"},{"name":"Roman Stocker"},{"name":"Viola Vogel"}],"keywords":[]},"article203":{"pmid":"27650185","title":"Fosfomycin resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii is mediated by efflux through a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter-AbaF.","date":"2017-12-11","abs":"To decipher the function of A1S_1331, named AbaF (Acinetobacter baumannii Fosfomycin efflux), one of the primary targets of AbsR25, a small RNA of A. baumannii.","authors":[{"name":"Atin Sharma"},{"name":"Rajnikant Sharma"},{"name":"Tapas Bhattacharyya"},{"name":"Timsy Bhando"},{"name":"Ranjana Pathania"}],"keywords":[]},"article204":{"pmid":"27649698","title":"The application of sonication in diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a catastrophic complication after total joint arthroplasty.

The biofilm inhibitory concentration of usnic acid (4âÂµg/mL) exhibited a significant biofilm inhibition, 71.08â% for azole-resistant and 87.84â% for azole-sensitive C. albicans strains. Confocal scanning laser microscopy showed that the morphology of mature biofilm was altered (reduced the biomass and thickness) in the presence of usnic acid. The antifungal effect was mediated by an oxidative and nitrosative stress, with a significant accumulation of intracellular and extracellular reactive oxygen species detected by confocal scanning laser microscopy and by nitro blue tetrazolium, respectively. In fact, azole-resistant and azole-sensitive C. albicans biofilms treated at the biofilm inhibitory concentration of usnic acid presented 30-fold and 10-fold increased reactive oxygen species measurements compared to basal levels, respectively, and important nitric oxide generation, showing 25-fold and 60-fold increased reactive nitrogen intermediates levels with respect to the controls, respectively. Nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant defenses were increased in both strains compared to biofilm basal levels as response to the increase of oxidant metabolites.

Treatment and eradication of biofilms by conventional antibiotic therapy has major drawbacks including toxicity and side effects associated with high-dosage antibiotics. Additionally, administration of high doses of antibiotics may facilitate the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of treatments that are not based on conventional antibiotic therapies. Presented herein is a novel bacterial biofilm combination treatment independent of traditional antibiotics, by using low electric fields in combination with small molecule inhibitors of bacterial quorum sensing - autoinducer-2 analogs. We investigate the effect of this treatment on mature Escherichia coli biofilms by application of an alternating and offset electric potential in combination with the small molecule inhibitor for 24Â h using both macro and micro-scale devices. Crystal violet staining of the macro-scale biofilms shows a 46Â % decrease in biomass compared to the untreated control. We demonstrate enhanced treatment efficacy of the combination therapy using a high-throughput polydimethylsiloxane-based microfluidic biofilm analysis platform. This microfluidic flow cell is designed to reduce the growth variance of in vitro biofilms while providing an integrated control, and thus allows for a more reliable comparison and evaluation of new biofilm treatments on a single device. We utilize linear array charge-coupled devices to perform real-time tracking of biomass by monitoring changes in optical density. End-point confocal microscopy measurements of biofilms treated with the autoinducer analog and electric fields in the microfluidic device show a 78Â % decrease in average biofilm thickness in comparison to the negative controls and demonstrate good correlation with real-time optical density measurements. Additionally, the combination treatment showed 76Â % better treatment efficacy compared to conventional antibiotic therapy. Taken together these results suggest that the antibiotic-free combination treatment described here may provide an effective alternative to traditional antibiotic therapies against bacterial biofilm infections. Use of this combination treatment in the medical and environmental fields would alleviate side effects associated with high-dosage antibiotic therapies, and reduce the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","authors":[{"name":"Sowmya Subramanian"},{"name":"Konstantinos Gerasopoulos"},{"name":"Min Guo"},{"name":"Herman O Sintim"},{"name":"William E Bentley"},{"name":"Reza Ghodssi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Autoinducer analogs"},{"word":"Bioelectric effect"},{"word":"Biofilms"},{"word":"Micro-systems"},{"word":"Microfluidics"},{"word":"Polydimethylsiloxane"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"}]},"article212":{"pmid":"27647069","title":"[Advances in the research of LuxR family protein in quorum-sensing system of gram-negative bacteria].","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-density-dependent method for information transmission among bacteria, as well as a mechanism for the bacteria to adapt to environment.

In this microorganism, acetate is involved directly or indirectly on the regulation of functional processes, such as motility, formation of biofilms, and responses to stress. Furthermore, it is a relevant nutrient in gut, where it serves additional roles, which regulate or, at least, modulate pathophysiological responses of E. coli and other bacteria. Acetate is one of the major by-products of anaerobic (fermenting) metabolism, and it is also produced under fully aerobic conditions. This acetate overflow is recognized as one of the major drawbacks limiting E. coli's productivity in biotechnological processes. This review sums up current knowledge on acetate metabolism in E. coli, explaining the major milestones that have led to deciphering its complex regulation in the K-12 strain.

As an initial means to identify agents that may have a greater propensity to improve clearance of wound-associated bacterial pathogens, we screened a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug library for members that display bactericidal activity toward 72-h-established P.Â aeruginosa biofilms using an adenylate kinase reporter assay for bacterial cell death. A total of 34 compounds displayed antibiofilm activity. Among these, zinc pyrithione was also shown to reduce levels of A.Â baumannii and S.Â aureus biofilm-associated bacteria and exhibited an additive effect in combination with silver sulfadiazine, a leading topical therapeutic for wound site infections. The improved antimicrobial activity of zinc pyrithione and silver sulfadiazine was maintained in an ointment formulation and led to improved clearance of P.Â aeruginosa, A.Â baumannii, and S.Â aureus in a murine model of wound infection. Taken together, these results suggest that topical zinc pyrithione and silver sulfadiazine combination formulations may mitigate wound-associated bacterial infections and disease progression. IMPORTANCE Topical antimicrobial ointments ostensibly mitigate bacterial wound disease and reliance on systemic antibiotics. Yet studies have called into question the therapeutic benefits of several traditional topical antibacterials, accentuating the need for improved next-generation antimicrobial ointments. Yet the development of such agents consisting of a new chemical entity is a time-consuming and expensive proposition. Considering that drug combinations are a mainstay therapeutic strategy for the treatment of other therapeutic indications, one alternative approach is to improve the performance of conventional antimicrobial ointments by the addition of a well-characterized and FDA-approved agent. Here we report data that indicate that the antimicrobial properties of silver sulfadiazine ointments can be significantly improved by the addition of the antifungal zinc pyrithione, suggesting that such combinations may provide an improved therapeutic option for the topical treatment of wound infections.

Biofilms formed by Candida species which associated with drastically enhanced resistance against most antimicrobial agents. The aim of this study was to identify and determine the antifungal susceptibility pattern of Candida species isolated from endotracheal tubes from ICU patients. Methods. One hundred forty ICU patients with tracheal tubes who were intubated and mechanically ventilated were surveyed for endotracheal tube biofilms. Samples were processed for quantitative microbial culture. Yeast isolates were identified to the species level based on morphological characteristics and their identity was confirmed by PCR-RFLP. Antifungal susceptibility testing was determined according to CLSI document (M27-A3). Results. Ninety-five strains of Candida were obtained from endotracheal tubes of which C. albicans (n = 34; 35.7%) was the most frequently isolated species followed by other species which included C. glabrata (n = 24; 25.2%), C. parapsilosis (n = 16; 16.8%), C. tropicalis (n = 12; 12.6%), and C. krusei (n = 9; 9.4%). The resulting MIC90 for all Candida species were in increasing order as follows: caspofungin (0.5âÎ¼g/mL); amphotericin B (2âÎ¼g/mL); voriconazole (8.8âÎ¼g/mL); itraconazole (16âÎ¼g/mL); and fluconazole (64âÎ¼g/mL).

The associated contact forces play a critical role in a variety of population-level processes, including biofilm formation [5-7], the colonization of porous media [8, 9], and the invasion of biological tissues [10-12]. Although mechanical forces have been characterized at the single cell level [13-16], it remains elusive how collective pushing forces result from the combination of single cell forces. Here, we reveal a collective mechanism of confinement, which we call self-driven jamming, that promotes the build-up of large mechanical pressures in microbial populations. Microfluidic experiments on budding yeast populations in space-limited environments show that self-driven jamming arises from the gradual formation and sudden collapse of force chains driven by microbial proliferation, extending the framework of driven granular matter [17-20]. The resulting contact pressures can become large enough to slow down cell growth, to delay the cell cycle in the G1 phase, and to strain or even destroy the microenvironment through crack propagation. Our results suggest that self-driven jamming and build-up of large mechanical pressures is a natural tendency of microbes growing in confined spaces, contributing to microbial pathogenesis and biofouling [21-26].","authors":[{"name":"Morgan Delarue"},{"name":"JÃ¶rn Hartung"},{"name":"Carl Schreck"},{"name":"Pawel Gniewek"},{"name":"Lucy Hu"},{"name":"Stephan Herminghaus"},{"name":"Oskar Hallatschek"}],"keywords":[]},"article230":{"pmid":"27642322","title":"Down-Regulation of Glycosyl Transferase Genes in Streptococcus Mutans by Punica Granatum L.

In this study, the effect of herbal extracts on expression of gtfB, C (encoding enzymes that produce water-insoluble glucans) and D (encoding enzymes that produce water-soluble glucans) genes in S. mutans growing in planktonic state was evaluated quantitatively by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of understudied herbal water extracts significantly suppressed gtfB, C and D gene expression by 85.3 Â± 7.5%, 33.3 Â± 6.4% and 25 Â± 14%, respectively for Punica granatum L. extract and 73.4 Â± 7.3%, 93.8 Â± 2.7% and 59.3 Â± 9.8%, respectively for Rhus coriaria L. extract compared to the non-treated control group (P < 0.05). Also, the real-rime PCR showed that the inhibitory effect of Rhus coriaria L. extract on gtfC and D was significantly greater (10.8 and 1.8 fold, respectively) than that of Punica granatum L. extract.

SETTING A 400-bed tertiary care university hospital in Sherbrooke, Canada. METHODS Hot water samples were collected and cultured for L. pneumophila from 25 taps (baths and sinks) within wing A and 9 taps in wing B. Biofilm (5) and 2 L water samples (3) were collected within the heat exchangers for L. pneumophila culture and detection of protists. Sequence-based typing was performed on strain DNA extracts and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were analyzed. RESULTS Following 2 cases of hospital-acquired legionellosis, the hot water system investigation revealed a large proportion of L. pneumophila serogroup 5 positive taps (22/25 in wing A and 5/9 in wing B). High positivity was also detected in the heat exchanger of wing A in water samples (3/3) and swabs from the heat exchanger (4/5). The outbreak genotyping investigation identified the hot water system as the source of infections. Genotyping results revealed that all isolated environmental strains harbored the same related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern and sequence-based type. CONCLUSIONS Two cases of hospital-acquired legionellosis occurred in the year following the installation of a heat exchanger to preheat hospital hot water.

Recurrent infections related to multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in hospitals are untreatable and question the effectiveness of notable drugs. Two major reasons for these recurrent infections are acquired antibiotic resistance genes and biofilm formation. None of the traditionally known effective techniques have been able to efficiently resolve these issues. Hence, development of a highly effective antibacterial practice has become inevitable. One example of a hard-to-eradicate pathogen in dentistry is Enterococcus faecalis, which is one of the most common threats observed in recurrent root canal treatment failures, of which the most problematic to treat are its biofilm-forming VRE strains. An effective response against such infections could be the use of bacteriophages (phages). Phage therapy was found to be highly effective against biofilm and multidrug-resistant bacteria and has other advantages like ease of isolation and possibilities for genetic manipulations. The potential of phage therapy in dentistry, in particular against E. faecalis biofilms in root canals, is almost unexplored. Here we review the efforts to develop phage therapy against biofilms. We also focus on the phages isolated against E. faecalis and discuss the possibility of using phages against E. faecalis biofilm in root canals.

Micro-PS were incubated with bacteria in different media (Zobell culture medium and artificial seawater) with or without natural marine aggregates. The highest percentage of colonized particles (38-100%) was observed in Zobell culture medium, which may be related to nutrient availability for production of pili and exopolysaccharide adhesion structures. A longer bacterial attachment (6 days) was observed on irregular micro-PS compared to smooth particles (<10 h), but complete decolonization of all particles eventually occurred. The presence of natural marine agreggates around micro-PS led to substantial and perennial colonization featuring monospecific biofilms at the surface of the aggregates. These exploratory results suggest that V. crassostreae may be a secondary colonizer of micro-PS, requiring a multispecies community to form a durable adhesion phenotype.

The biofilms were exposed in situ to pulse exposures of metals (Zn and Pb) and nutrients (N and P) individually and in combination to mimic patterns of discharge in the study area. The reference community's structure (composition and abundance of taxa) was modified after metals and/or nutrients exposure, but each stressor acted in different way. Irrespective of the stressors or scenario, the abundance of the dominant species Opephora krumbeinii declined, and it is proposed as sensitive species. Nutrient supply favoured the proliferation of certain species with high nutrient tolerances (Fragilaria famelica, Tabularia ktenoeides), whereas metals promoted the colonisation of metal-tolerant species, e.g., Berkeleya fennica, Opephora marina. Simultaneous exposure induced an amplification of levels of accumulated metals, chlorophyll a and EPS contents and triggered the succession of species towards tolerant species with specific growth. Metals seemed to act as a selective factor of metal-tolerant species, and nutrients favoured the proliferation of those species forming zig-zag colonies (Neosynedra provincialis), mucous tubes (Berkeleya spp.) and motile diatoms (Navicula salinicola, Nitzschia incognita), resulting in biofilms with a more complex architecture. The diatom communities from the historically contaminated site were more resistant to pulse exposure, but metals or nutrients loads induced overproduction of mucilage. We propose that growth forms may complement taxonomic approaches and provide a quick and easy way to detect community changes related to metal and nutrient pollution.","authors":[{"name":"M D Belando"},{"name":"A MarÃ­n"},{"name":"M Aboal"},{"name":"A J GarcÃ­a-FernÃ¡ndez"},{"name":"L MarÃ­n-Guirao"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Coastal systems"},{"word":"Diatom community composition"},{"word":"Growth form"},{"word":"Multiple stressors"},{"word":"Species succession"}]},"article243":{"pmid":"27639235","title":"The performance of microbial anodes in municipal wastewater: Pre-grown multispecies biofilm vs. natural inocula.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"In this study, different inoculation strategies for continuously operated microbial anodes are analyzed and compared.

Production of these compounds is controlled at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level by quorum sensing (QS) and the Gac-two component regulatory system. In order to be successful, a biocontrol agent must persist in the environment at levels sufficient for pathogen control. Bacterivorous predators, including nematodes, represent a challenge to the establishment of introduced microorganisms. In the current study, DF41 was investigated for its ability to resist predation by Caenorhabditis elegans. We discovered that this bacterium is capable of killing C. elegans through two different mechanisms: the first involves exposure to toxic metabolites; and the second entails biofilm formation on the nematode head blocking the buccal cavity. Biofilm formation on nematodes, which has only been reported for Yersinia spp. and Xenorhabdus nematophila, is dependent upon the Gac system. Biofilms were not observed when bacteria were grown on NaCl-containing media, and on C. elegans biofilm-resistant mutants. Co-culturing with nematodes lead to increased expression of the pdfRI-rfiA QS genes and hcnA which is under QS control. HCN was the most nematicidal of the exometabolites, suggesting that this bacterium can respond to predator cues and upregulate expression of toxins accordingly.

Disruption of fleQ caused strong defects in flagellar motility, biofilm formation and surface attachment, and the ability of this mutation to suppress multiple biofilm-related phenotypes associated to cyclic diguanylate overproduction suggests that FleQ mediates cyclic diguanylate signaling critical to biofilm growth.

Our results suggest a dual mode of action for FleQ. Low cyclic diguanylate levels favor FleQ interaction with ÏN-dependent promoters to activate the flagellar cascade, encompassing the flagellar cluster and additional genes involved in cyclic diguanylate metabolism, signal transduction and gene regulation. On the other hand, characterization of the FleQ-regulated ÏN- and FliA-independent PlapA and PbcsD promoters revealed two disparate regulatory mechanisms leading to a similar outcome: the synthesis of biofilm matrix components in response to increased cyclic diguanylate levels.

Oral rinses were collected and isolates were identified by API 20 Strep and confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. E. faecalis isolates, in particular, were evaluated for virulence attributes such as their biofilm formation potential, and susceptibility to antimicrobials and an antiseptic, chlorhexidine gluconate. A total of 40 individuals (16.6%) and 10% children, 4% adolescents, 14% young adults, 30% adults, and 25% elderly carried oral enterococci. The oral enterococcal burden in adolescents was significantly lower than in the adults (p = 0.000) and elderly (p = 0.004). The proportion of carriers was higher among females (p = 0.001). E. faecalis was the most frequent isolate in all the age groups (p = 0.000), followed by E. durans and E. faecium. Whilst all the clinical isolates were able to form biofilms, only a proportion of them were able to produce lipase (92%), hemolysin (38%), and gelatinase (39%). Of all the isolates 53.8% were resistant to tetracycline, 12.3% to amoxicillin, 16.0% to ampicillin, 20.8% to chloramphenicol and 43.4% to erythromycin. None of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin.

Hence clinicians should be cognizant of this silent reservoir of virulent enterococci that may pose a particular threat of nosocomial infection.

Invasive M3-type strains, however, have evolved two unique conserved features in the scl1 locus: (i) an IS1548 element insertion in the scl1 promoter region and (ii) a nonsense mutation within the scl1 coding sequence. The scl1 transcript is drastically reduced in M3-type GAS, contrasting with a high transcription level of scl1 allele in invasive M1-type GAS. This leads to a lack of Scl1 expression in M3 strains. In contrast, while scl2 transcription and Scl2 production are elevated in M3 strains, M1 GAS lack Scl2 surface expression. M3-type strains were shown to have reduced biofilm formation on inanimate surfaces coated with cellular fibronectin and laminin, and in human skin equivalents. Repair of the nonsense mutation and restoration of Scl1 expression on M3-GAS cells, restores biofilm formation on cellular fibronectin and laminin coatings. Inactivation of scl1 in biofilm-capable M28 and M41 strains results in larger skin lesions in a mouse model, indicating that lack of Scl1 adhesin promotes bacterial spread over localized infection. These studies suggest the uniquely evolved scl1 locus in the M3-type strains, which prevents surface expression of the major Scl1 adhesin, contributed to the emergence of the invasive M3-type strains.

Conventional antibiotic CDI therapy can result in treatment failure and recurrent infection. C. difficile produces biofilms which contribute to its virulence and impair antimicrobial activity. Some bacteriophages (phages) can penetrate biofilms and thus could be developed to either replace or supplement antibiotics. Here, we determined the impact of a previously optimized 4-phage cocktail on C. difficile ribotype 014/020 biofilms, and additionally as adjunct to vancomycin treatment in Galleria mellonella larva CDI model. The phages were applied before or after biofilm establishment in vitro, and the impact was analyzed according to turbidity, viability counts and topography as observed using scanning electron and confocal microscopy. The infectivity profiles and efficacies of orally administered phages and/or vancomycin were ascertained by monitoring colonization levels and larval survival rates. Phages prevented biofilm formation, and penetrated established biofilms. A single phage application reduced colonization causing extended longevity in the remedial treatment and prevented disease in the prophylaxis group. Multiple phage doses significantly improved the larval remedial regimen, and this treatment is comparable to vancomycin and the combined treatments. Taken together, our data suggest that the phages significantly reduce C. difficile biofilms, and prevent colonization in the G. mellonella model when used alone or in combination with vancomycin. The phages appear to be highly promising therapeutics in the targeted eradication of CDI and the use of these models has revealed that prophylactic use could be a propitious therapeutic option.

Multispecies biofilms are structured and spatially defined communities that have received much attention due to their omnipresence in natural environments. Species residing in these complex bacterial communities usually interact both intra- and interspecifically. Such interactions are considered to not only be fundamental in shaping overall biomass and the spatial distribution of cells residing in multispecies biofilms, but also to result in coordinated regulation of gene expression in the different species present. These communal interactions often lead to emergent properties in biofilms, such as enhanced tolerance against antibiotics, host immune responses, and other stresses, which have been shown to provide benefits to all biofilm members not only the enabling sub-populations. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of cellular processes affecting spatial organization, and vice versa, are poorly understood and very complex to unravel. Therefore, detailed description of the spatial organization of individual bacterial cells in multispecies communities can be an alternative strategy to reveal the nature of interspecies interactions of constituent species. Closing the gap between visual observation and biological processes may become crucial for resolving biofilm related problems, which is of utmost importance to environmental, industrial, and clinical implications.

The transcriptome data revealed a link between calcineurin signaling and PA as among the several categories of PA responsive genes the down regulation of calcineurin signaling gene CNB1 was noteworthy which was also confirmed by both molecular docking and susceptibility assays. We observed that PA treated Candida phenocopied compromised calcineurin pathway stress responses and turned sensitive to alkaline pH, ionic, membrane, salinity, endoplasmic reticulum and serum stresses. Indispensability of functional calcineurin was further confirmed as calcineurin mutant was hypersensitive to PA while constitutively expressed calcineurin strain remained resistant. We explored that PA leads to perturbed membrane integrity as depicted through depleted ergosterol levels and disrupted pH homeostasis. Moreover, PA caused cell wall damage which was evident from hypersensitivity against cell wall perturbing agents (congo red, calcoflour white), SEM and enhanced rate of cell sedimentation. Furthermore, PA inhibited potential virulence traits including morphological transition, biofilm formation and displayed diminished capacity to adhere both to the polystyrene surface and buccal epithelial cells.

Together, the present study provides enough evidence for further work on PA so that better strategies could be employed to treat Candida infections.

The ability of these strains to form biofilm on different abiotic surfaces (stainless steel, glass, and polystyrene) as well as factors potentially associated with biofilm formation (bacterial surface hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, and initial attachment) was also determined. The results showed that cells grown as sessile culture generally have a greater ability to form biofilm (PÂ <Â 0.05) compared to their planktonic counterparts.

Instead of using bacterial lactonases that can evoke immune response when administered, we focus on the human paraoxonase 2 (huPON2). However, insolubility when heterologously overexpressed hinders its application as anti-infection therapeutics. In this study, huPON2 was engineered for soluble expression with minimal introduction of foreign sequences. On the basis of structure modeling, degenerate linkers were exploited for the removal of hydrophobic helices of huPON2 without disrupting its folding structure and thus retaining its enzymatic function. High soluble expression levels were achieved with a yield of 76 mg of fully human PON2 variants per liter of culture media. Particularly, two clones, D2 and E3, showed significant quorum quenching (QQ) bioactivities and effectively impeded Pseudomonas aeruginosa swimming and swarming motilities, signs of an early stage of biofilm formation. In addition, by correlating QQ with luminescence signal readouts, quantitative analysis of QQ toward natural or non-natural AHL-regulator combinations suggested that D2 and E3 exhibited strong lactone hydrolysis activities toward five AHLs of different side chain lengths and modifications widely utilized by a variety of biomedically important pathogens.","authors":[{"name":"Xin Cathy Li"},{"name":"Christopher Wang"},{"name":"Ashok Mulchandani"},{"name":"Xin Ge"}],"keywords":[]},"article284":{"pmid":"27623313","title":"Lysine-Based Small Molecules That Disrupt Biofilms and Kill both Actively Growing Planktonic and Nondividing Stationary Phase Bacteria.","date":"2016-09-14","abs":"The emergence of bacterial resistance is a major threat to global health.

Rifapentine is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis that targets RNA polymerase, but prevents curli-dependent adhesion and biofilm formation in E. coli at concentrations below those that affect viability. Rifapentine inhibits curli production and prevents biofilm formation on plastic, on agar, and at the air-liquid interface by inhibiting curli gene transcription.

Here, we describe a novel interspecies dispersal signaling pathway between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. E. coli biofilms disperse in response to compounds in P. aeruginosa culture supernatant. Two components of the P. aeruginosa Las and Rhl quorum sensing systems, N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl) homoserine lactone (3oxoC12HSL) and rhamnolipids, are found to act cooperatively to disperse E. coli biofilms. Our results indicate that rhamnolipids do not affect growth, biofilm development, or dispersal in E. coli but instead complement 3oxoC12HSL signaling by inducing selective permeability of the E. coli membrane. The increased target cell permeability is consistent with rhamnolipid-mediated removal of lipopolysaccharide from E. coli membranes and appears to selectively increase the permeability of lipophilic acyl homoserine lactones.

In contrast to planktonic C. albicans, biofilms triggered negligible release of NETs. Time lapse imaging confirmed the impairment in NET release and revealed neutrophils adhering to hyphae and migrating on the biofilm. NET inhibition depended on an intact extracellular biofilm matrix as physical or genetic disruption of this component resulted in NET release. Biofilm inhibition of NETosis could not be overcome by protein kinase C activation via phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and was associated with suppression of neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The degree of impaired NET release correlated with resistance to neutrophil attack. The clinical relevance of the role for extracellular matrix in diminishing NET production was corroborated in vivo using a rat catheter model.

Biofilm mass was significantly greater in the major epidemic than the minor epidemic and sporadic clones. Major and minor epidemic clones expressed biofilm-associated genes, abaI, bap, pgaABCD, and csuA/BABCDE, higher than the sporadic clones in sessile conditions. The csuC, csuD, and csuE genes were more highly expressed in the major epidemic than minor epidemic clones. Interestingly, minor epidemic clones expressed more biofilm-associated genes than the major epidemic clone under planktonic conditions. Major epidemic clones were more resistant to desiccation than minor epidemic and sporadic clones on day 21. In conclusion, the epidemic CRAB ST191 clones exhibit a higher capacity to form biofilms, express the biofilm-associated genes under sessile conditions, and resist desiccation than sporadic clones. These phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of CRAB ST191 may account for the epidemicity of specific CRAB ST191 clones in the hospital.

A key factor in the development of nonhealing ulcers is infection, which often leads to the development of biofilm, gangrene, and amputation. A novel approach to treating DFUs is the local release of antibiotics from calcium sulfate beads. We have developed a novel model system to study and compare the release and efficacy of antibiotics released locally, using collagen as a substrate for biofilm growth and incorporating serum to mimic the biochemical complexity of the wound environment. We found that our soft-tissue model supports the growth of a robust Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm, and that this was completely eradicated by the introduction of calcium sulfate beads loaded with tobramycin or gentamicin. The model also enabled us to measure the concentration of these antibiotics at different distances from the beads and in simulated wound fluid bathing the collagen matrix. We additionally found that a multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilm, nonsusceptible to antibiotics, nonetheless showed an almost 1-log drop in viable counts when exposed to calcium sulfate beads combined with antibiotics. Together, these data suggest that locally applied antibiotics combined with calcium sulfate provide surprising efficacy in diabetic foot infections and offer an effective alternative approach to infection management.

In these cases, root canal infections are commonly treated with Ledermix(Â®) paste, which contains demeclocycline, or the new alternative endodontic paste Odontopaste, which contains clindamycin; however, these treatments are often ineffective. We studied the killing activity of the cyclic antimicrobial peptide gramicidin S (GS) against planktonic and biofilm cells of tetracycline-resistant clinical isolates of E. faecalis. The high therapeutic potential of GS for the topical treatment of problematic teeth is based on the rapid bactericidal effect toward the biofilm-forming, tetracycline-resistant E. faecalis. GS reduces the cell number of planktonic cells within 20-40 min at a concentration of 40-80 Î¼g/mL. It kills the cells of pre-grown biofilms at concentrations of 100-200 Î¼g/mL, such that no re-growth is possible. The translocation of the peptide into the cell interior and its complexation with intracellular nucleotides, including the alarmon ppGpp, can explain its anti-biofilm effect. The successful treatment of persistently infected root canals of two volunteers confirms the high effectiveness of GS. The broad GS activity towards resistant, biofilm-forming E. faecalis suggests its applications for approval in root canal medication.

In this study, the ability of adherence of Methicillin Resistant Strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to catheters treated with magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs), produced by three methods and functionalized with oleic acid and a hydro-alcoholic extract of propolis from Morocco, was evaluated. The chemical composition of propolis was established by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the fabricated nanostructures characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Mossbauer spectroscopy and Fourrier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The capacity for impairing biofilm formation was dependent on the strain, as well as on the mode of production of MNPs. The co-precipitation method of MNPs fabrication using Fe(3+) and NaâSOâ solution and functionalized with oleic acid and propolis was the most effective in the impairment of adherence of all MRSA strains to catheters (p < 0.001). The adherence of the strain MRSA16 was also significantly lower (p < 0.001) when the catheters were treated with the hybrid MNPs with oleic acid produced by a hydrothermal method. The anti-MRSA observed can be attributed to the presence of benzyl caffeate, pinocembrin, galangin, and isocupressic acid in propolis extract, along with MNPs. However, for MRSA16, the impairment of its adherence on catheters may only be attributed to the hybrid MNPs with oleic acid, since very small amount, if any at all of propolis compounds were added to the MNPs.

M. marinum lives in water, forms biofilms and infects fish and frogs. M. marinum is a biosafety level 2 (BSL2) organism as it can infect humans, although infections are limited to the skin. M. marinum is accepted as a model to study mycobacterial pathogenesis, as M. marinum and M. tuberculosis are genetically closely related and have similar mechanisms of survival and persistence inside macrophage. The aim of this study was to determine whether M. marinum could be used as a model to understand M. tuberculosis NHEJ repair. We identified and cloned the M. marinum genes encoding NHEJ proteins and generated E. coli strains that express the M. marinum Ku (Mm-Ku) and ligase D (Mm-Lig) individually or together (LHmKumLig strain) from expression vectors integrated at phage attachment sites in the genome. We demonstrated that Mm-Ku and Mm-Lig are both required to re-circularize Cla I-linearized plasmid DNA in E. coli. We compared repair of strain LHmKumLig with that of an E. coli strain (BWKuLig#2) expressing the M. tuberculosis Ku (Mt-Ku) and ligase D (Mt-Lig), and found that LHmKumLig performed 3.5 times more repair and repair was more accurate than BWKuLig#2. By expressing the Mm-Ku with the Mt-Lig, or the Mt-Ku with the Mm-Lig in E. coli, we have shown that the NHEJ proteins from M. marinum and M. tuberculosis can function together to join DNA DSBs. NHEJ repair is therefore conserved between the two species. Consequently, M. marinum is a good model to study NHEJ repair during mycobacterial pathogenesis.","authors":[{"name":"Douglas G Wright"},{"name":"Reneau Castore"},{"name":"Runhua Shi"},{"name":"Amrita Mallick"},{"name":"Don G Ennis"},{"name":"Lynn Harrison"}],"keywords":[]},"article319":{"pmid":"27612828","title":"Polyethylene/silver-nanofiber composites: A material for antibacterial films.","date":"2017-04-21","abs":"Silver nanofibers (Ag-Nfbs)~80nm in diameter were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment.

Antimicrobial urinary catheters have been developed through the photo-chemical deposition of silver coatings on the external and luminal surfaces.

The silver coatings demonstrated good distribution of silver particles to the substrate, and proved an effective antibacterial capability in simulated biological conditions.

This study provides an agent-based model for the bacterial dynamics and interactions influencing bacterial biofilm shape. Cell motility in the model relies on recently published experimental data. Our simulations show colony formation by immotile cells. Motile cells escape from a single colony by nutrient chemotaxis and hence no mushroom shape develops. A high number density of non-motile colonies leads to migration of motile cells onto the top of the colonies and formation of mushroom-shaped structures. This model proposes that the formation of mushroom-shaped structures can be predicted by parameters at the time of bacteria inoculation. Depending on nutrient levels and the initial number density of stalks, mushroom-shaped structures only form in a restricted regime.

To assemble and analyze phage metagenomic data, we developed a custom module, VIRITAS, implemented within the MetAMOS framework. This module bins contigs into groups based on tetranucleotide frequencies and CRISPR spacer-protospacer matching and ORF calling. Using this pipeline we were able to assemble phage sequences into contigs and bin them into three clusters that corroborated with their potential host range. The virome contained 52,348 predicted ORFs; some were clearly phage-like; 9319 ORFs had a recognizable Pfam domain while the rest were hypothetical. Of the recognized domains with CRISPR spacer matches, was the phage endolysin used by lytic phage to disrupt cells. Analysis of the endolysins present in the thermophilic cyanophage contigs revealed a subset of characterized endolysins as well as a Glyco_hydro_108 (PF05838) domain not previously associated with sequenced cyanophages. A search for CRISPR spacer matches to all identified phage endolysins demonstrated that a majority of endolysin domains were targets. This strategy provides a general way to link host and phage as endolysins are known to be widely distributed in bacteriophage. Endolysins can also provide information about host cell wall composition and have the additional potential to be used as targets for novel therapeutics.

In this study, the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were quantified in each treatment tank of the ecological WWTP treating human wastewater at a highway rest stop and visitor center in Vermont. The concentrations of detected PPCPs were substantially greater than values reported for conventional WWTPs likely due to onsite recirculation of wastewater. The greatest reductions in PPCPs concentrations were observed in the anoxic treatment tank where Bacilli dominated the biofilm community. Benzoate degradation was the most abundant xenobiotic metabolic category identified throughout the system. Collectively, the microbial communities residing in the wastewater were taxonomically and metabolically more diverse than the immersed plant root biofilm.

Thus, here we used a combination of community level physiological profile (CLPP) analysis and 16S rRNA gene quantification and sequencing (coupled with in silico analysis and metagenome prediction), to get insights on bacterial features and processes involved in rhizosphere colonization of sugarcane. CLPP revealed a higher metabolic activity in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil, and suggested that D-galacturonic acid plays a role in bacterial selection by the plant roots (supported by results of metagenome prediction). Quantification of the 16S rRNA gene confirmed the higher abundance of bacteria in the rhizosphere. Sequence analysis showed that of the 252 classified families sampled, 24 were significantly more abundant in the bulk soil and 29 were more abundant in the rhizosphere. Furthermore, metagenomes predicted from the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a significant higher abundance of predicted genes associated with biofilm formation and with horizontal gene transfer (HGT) processes.

By using a common counter and reference electrode, the potentials of the two WEs were independently controlled to maintain a suitable voltage window, which enabled simultaneous oxidation and reduction of electron mediators as evidenced by the concurrent anodic and cathodic currents, respectively. To validate the method, the electrochemical properties of different mediators (hexacyanoferrate, HCF, riboflavin, RF) were characterized by stepwise shifting the voltage window (ranging between 25 and 200mV) within a range of potentials after steady equilibrium current of both WEs was established.

The virulence phenotypes of both strains were determined by using the RWPE-1 prostate cell line. The results obtained indicated that LF82 and EC73 are able to adhere to, invade, and survive within prostate epithelial cells. Invasion was confirmed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Moreover, cytochalasin D and colchicine strongly inhibited bacterial uptake of both strains, indicating the involvement of actin microfilaments and microtubules in host cell invasion.

A novel representative from the metallo-Î²-lactamase superfamily, dubbed GcL, was isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus caldoxylosilyticus.

To achieve this goal, two representative epidemic Staphylococcus strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis, RP62A) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, USA 300), were used, and it was found that an Ag-nanoparticle-modified Ti surface could regulate the expression levels of biofilm-related genes (icaA and icaR for S. epidermidis; fnbA and fnbB for S. aureus) to inhibit bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. Moreover, a novel bacteria-fibroblast co-culture study revealed that the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles on such a surface can help mammalian cells to survive, adhere and spread more successfully than Staphylococcus. Therefore, the modified surface was demonstrated to possess a good anti-infective capability against both sessile bacteria and planktonic bacteria through synergy between the effects of Ag nanoparticles and ion release.

Biofilm formation was investigated by adherence to polystyrene plates. Positive strains were submitted to the broth microdilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for planktonic and biofilm cells and the minimal bactericidal concentration for biofilm cells (MBCB). Forty-nine Staphylococcus spp. strains (14 S. aureus, 13 S. epidermidis, 13 S. saprophyticus, 3 S. haemolyticus, 1 S. hominis, 3 S. warneri, and 2 S. lugdunensis) were biofilm producers. These isolates were evaluated regarding their resistance profile. Determination of planktonic cell MIC identified three (21.4%) S. aureus strains that were resistant to oxacillin and six (42.8%) that were resistant to erythromycin. Among the CoNS, 31 (88.6%) strains were resistant to oxacillin, 14 (40%) to erythromycin, 18 (51.4%) to gentamicin, and 8 (22.8%) to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. None of the planktonic isolates were resistant to vancomycin or linezolid. MICs were 2-, 4-, 8-, and up to 16-fold higher for biofilm cells than for planktonic cells. This observation was more common for vancomycin and erythromycin. The MBCB ranged from 8 to >256 Âµg/mL for oxacillin, 128 to >128 Âµg/mL for vancomycin, 256 to >256 Âµg/mL for erythromycin and gentamicin, >64 Âµg/mL for linezolid, and 32/608 to >32/608 Âµg/mL for sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The results showed considerably higher MICs for S. aureus and CoNS biofilm cells compared to planktonic cells. Analysis of MBCM confirmed that even high concentrations of vancomycin were unable to eliminate the biofilms of S. aureus and CoNS species. Linezolid was the most effective drug in inhibiting staphylococci in the biofilm, without an increase in the MIC, when compared to planktonic cells. None of the isolates were resistant to this drug.

Both mucins generated hydrated films on hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces from spontaneous adsorption arising from their amphiphilic characteristic. However, BSM formed more elastic films than PGM at neutral pH condition. This structural difference was manifested from the initial film formation processes to the responses to shear stresses applied to the films. Acidification of environmental pH led to strengthening the elastic character of BSM films with increased adsorbed mass, whereas an opposite trend was observed for PGM films. We propose that this contrast originates from that negatively charged motifs are present for both the central and terminal regions of BSM molecule, whereas a similar magnitude of negative charges is localized at the termini of PGM molecule. Given that hydrophobic motifs acting as an anchor are also localized in the terminal region, electrostatic repulsion between anchoring units of PGM molecules on a nonpolar PDMS surface leads to weakening of the mechanical integrity of the films.","authors":[{"name":"Jan Busk Madsen"},{"name":"Javier Sotres"},{"name":"Kirsi I Pakkanen"},{"name":"Petr Efler"},{"name":"Birte Svensson"},{"name":"Maher Abou Hachem"},{"name":"Thomas Arnebrant"},{"name":"Seunghwan Lee"}],"keywords":[]},"article369":{"pmid":"27597232","title":"The role of Bgl2p in the transition to filamentous cells during biofilm formation by Candida albicans.","date":"2017-03-23","abs":"The fungal pathogen Candida albicans undergoes a transition from yeast cells to filamentous cells that is related to its pathogenicity.

We hypothesize that the activity of aciduric/acidogenic bacterial taxa, reflected by a rise in ribosomal counts, could resolve differences between plaque biofilm from sound surfaces and caries lesions. The included subjects were allocated to two groups: caries-free (CF) or caries-active (CA). CF subjects presented one donor site, namely one sound surface (CFS, n = 10), whereas CA subjects presented two donor sites: a cavitated lesion with an ICDAS score of 5-6 (CAC, n = 13), and a sound reference surface (CAS, n = 13). Four aciduric/acidogenic bacterial taxa (Streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Scardovia wiggsiae) and one asaccharolytic taxon (fusobacteria) as a contrast were selected. 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes were quantified by quantitative PCR. Based on these parameters, bacterial and ribosomal counts, as well as relative activities were calculated as the quotient of relative ribosomal abundance and relative genome abundance. Caries-associated bacteria showed the highest relative activity in caries lesions (e.g. lactobacilli CAC: 177.5 Â± 46.0%) and lower activities on sound surfaces (e.g. lactobacilli CAS: 96.3 Â± 31.5%), whereas asaccharolytic fusobacteria were most active on sound surfaces and less active in caries lesions (CFS: 275.7 Â± 171.1%; CAS: 205.8 Â± 114.3%; CAC: 51.1 Â± 19.0%).

They can attach to various surfaces in aquatic habitats and form biofilms. Their unique FtsZ-independent budding cell division mechanism is associated with slow growth and doubling times from 6 h up to 1 month. Despite this putative disadvantage in the struggle to colonize surfaces, Planctomycetes are frequently associated with aquatic phototrophic organisms such as diatoms, cyanobacteria or kelp, whereby Planctomycetes can account for up to 50% of the biofilm-forming bacterial population. Consequently, Planctomycetes were postulated to play an important role in carbon utilization, for example as scavengers after phototrophic blooms. However, given their observed slow growth, such findings are surprising since other faster- growing heterotrophs tend to colonize similar ecological niches. Accordingly, Planctomycetes were suspected to produce antibiotics for habitat protection in response to the attachment on phototrophs. Recently, we demonstrated their genomic potential to produce non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, bacteriocins, and terpenoids that might have antibiotic activities. In this study, we describe the development of a pipeline that consists of tools and procedures to cultivate Planctomycetes for the production of antimicrobial compounds in a chemically defined medium and a procedure to chemically mimic their interaction with other organisms such as for example cyanobacteria. We evaluated and adjusted screening assays to enable the hunt for planctomycetal antibiotics. As proof of principle, we demonstrate antimicrobial activities of planctomycetal extracts from Planctopirus limnophila DSM 3776, Rhodopirellula baltica DSM 10527, and the recently isolated strain Pan216. By combining UV/Vis and high resolution mass spectrometry data from high-performance liquid chromatography fractionations with growth inhibition of indicator strains, we were able to assign the antibiotic activity to candidate peaks related to planctomycetal antimicrobial compounds. The MS analysis points toward the production of novel bioactive molecules with novel structures.

Exposure of the activated sludge biocommunity to light source, resulted in the growth of microalgae and photoreactors exhibited higher removal rates of total nitrogen and nitrates. However, operation at longer times resulted in low effluent quality due to the presence of microalgae cells as a result of high growth rates, and potential light shading effect. Nevertheless, the moving bed system was more beneficial than the single photoreactor, as biofilm carriers provided a self cleaning capacity of the light source, reducing the effect of microalgae deposition. Advanced treatment of the biological effluents, by electrocoagulation, increased even more the process efficiency: the combined photobioreactor and electrocoagulation process resulted in about 78% COD removal and more than 35% total nitrogen removal in the effluent, where nitrates represented almost the single form of total nitrogen.

In addition to the typical stabilizing interactions in type II loops, MDB shows extensive stabilizing forces between the two loops, including two distinctive modes of interactions between the minor groove residues.

A significant decrease in biovolume and average thickness of S. mutans biofilms was observed in both static and flow cell assays when 3% CPP-ACP was incorporated into the GIC substratum. A single ten min treatment with aqueous 1% CPP-ACP resulted in a 58% decrease in biofilm biomass and thickness of established S. mutans biofilms grown in a flow cell. The treatment also significantly altered the structure of these biofilms compared with controls. The incorporation of 3% CPP-ACP into GIC significantly reduced S. mutans biofilm development indicating another potential anticariogenic mechanism of this material. Additionally aqueous CPP-ACP disrupted established S. mutans biofilms. The use of CPP-ACP containing GIC combined with regular CPP-ACP treatment may lower S. mutans challenge.

Millions of new cases of tuberculosis occur each year, emphasizing the need for better methods of treatment. The design of novel therapeutics is dependent on our understanding of factors that are essential for pathogenesis. Many bacterial pathogens use pili and other adhesins to mediate pathogenesis. The recently identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis pilus (MTP) and the hypothetical, widely conserved Flp pilus have been speculated to be important for Mtb virulence based on in vitro studies and homology to other pili, respectively. However, the roles for these pili during infection have yet to be tested. We addressed this gap in knowledge and found that neither MTP nor the hypothetical Flp pilus is required for Mtb survival in mouse models of infection, although MTP can contribute to biofilm formation and subsequent isoniazid tolerance. However, differences in mtp expression did affect lesion architecture in infected lungs. Deletion of mtp did not correlate with loss of cell-associated extracellular structures as visualized by transmission electron microscopy in Mtb Erdman and HN878 strains, suggesting that the phenotypes of the mtp mutants were not due to defects in production of extracellular structures. These findings highlight the importance of testing the virulence of adhesion mutants in animal models to assess the contribution of the adhesin to infection. This study also underscores the need for further investigation into additional strategies that Mtb may use to adhere to its host so that we may understand how this pathogen invades, colonizes and disseminates.","authors":[{"name":"Katherine M Mann"},{"name":"Aaron C Pride"},{"name":"Kelly Flentie"},{"name":"Jacqueline M Kimmey"},{"name":"Leslie A Weiss"},{"name":"Christina L Stallings"}],"keywords":[]},"article394":{"pmid":"27585669","title":"Novel bioactive tetracycline-containing electrospun polymer fibers as a potential antibacterial dental implant coating.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The purpose of this investigation was to determine the ability of tetracycline-containing fibers to inhibit biofilm formation of peri-implantitis-associated pathogens [i.e., Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa)].
