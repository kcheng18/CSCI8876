The ability of the bacterium to form biofilms and the presence of a thick and stagnant mucus in the airways of CF patients largely contribute to antibiotic therapy failure and demand for new antimicrobial agents able to act in the CF environment. The present study investigated the anti-P. aeruginosa activity of lin-SB056-1, a recently described semi-synthetic antimicrobial peptide, used alone and in combination with the cation chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Bactericidal assays were carried out in standard culture conditions and in an artificial sputum medium (ASM) closely resembling the CF environment. Peptide's structure and interaction with large unilamellar vesicles in media with different ionic strengths were also investigated through infrared spectroscopy. Lin-SB056-1 demonstrated fast and strong bactericidal activity against both mucoid and non-mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa in planktonic form and, in combination with EDTA, caused significant reduction of the biomass of P. aeruginosa mature biofilms. In ASM, the peptide/EDTA combination exerted a strong bactericidal effect and inhibited the formation of biofilm-like structures of P. aeruginosa. Overall, the results obtained highlight the potential of the lin-SB056-1/EDTA combination for the treatment of P. aeruginosa lung infections in CF patients.","authors":[{"name":"Giuseppantonio Maisetta"},{"name":"Lucia Grassi"},{"name":"Semih Esin"},{"name":"Ilaria Serra"},{"name":"Mariano A Scorciapino"},{"name":"Andrea C Rinaldi"},{"name":"Giovanna Batoni"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"antimicrobial peptide"},{"word":"artificial sputum medium"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"cystic fibrosis"},{"word":"infrared spectroscopy"}]},"article1":{"pmid":"28926915","title":"Bioelectrochemical methane (CH","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) at various cell voltages (0.5, 0.7 1.0 and 1.5V) were operated in anaerobic fermentation.

While nanoparticle (NP)-plant interactions are increasingly studied, the effect of NPs on the plant microbiome is less researched. Here a root-mimetic hollow fiber membrane (HFM) is presented for generating biofilms of plant-associated microbes nurtured by artificial root exudates (AREs) to correlate exudate composition with biofilm formation and response to NPs. Two microbial isolates from field-grown wheat, a bacillus endophyte and a pseudomonad root surface colonizer, were examined on HFMs fed with AREs varying in N and C composition. Bacterial morphology and biofilm architecture were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) and responses to CuO and ZnO NP challenges of 300 mg/L evaluated. The bacillus isolate sparsely colonized the HFM. In contrast, the pseudomonad formed robust biofilms within 3 days. Dependent on nutrient sources, the biofilm cells produced extensive extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and large intracellular granules. Pseudomonad biofilms were minimally affected by ZnO NPs. CuO NPs, when introduced before biofilm maturation, strongly reduced biofilm formation. The findings demonstrate the utility of the HFM root-mimetic to study rhizoexudate influence on biofilms of root-colonizing microbes but without active plant metabolism. The results will allow better understanding of how microbe-rhizoexudate-NP interactions affect microbial and plant health.","authors":[{"name":"Michelle Bonebrake"},{"name":"Kaitlyn Anderson"},{"name":"Jonathan Valiente"},{"name":"Astrid Jacobson"},{"name":"Joan E McLean"},{"name":"Anne Anderson"},{"name":"David W Britt"}],"keywords":[{"word":"extracellular polymeric material"},{"word":"microbiome"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"rhizosphere"},{"word":"root mimetic"}]},"article6":{"pmid":"28926192","title":"Testing of a bioactive, moldable bone graft substitute in an infected, critically sized segmental defect model.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Large infected bone defects, often resulting from high energy traumas, are difficult to treat due to their variability in complexity and location. Standard treatment for infected bone defects begins with a protocol that includes a series of debridements in conjunction with an extended course of systemic antibiotics. Only after the infection has been eliminated will repair of the defect commence, typically with implantation of autologous bone. To address some of the shortcomings of the standard treatment methods, such as serial procedures, limited grafting material, and the need for a second surgical site for autologous bone, a sequential, dual drug-releasing, moldable, calcium sulfate-based bone graft substitute was developed previously. In the present studies, the effectiveness of the material for treating both the infection with vancomycin and bone defect with simvastatin was evaluated in vivo using a critically sized, infected segmental defect model in rat femurs. Although the infection was not fully eliminated, the local release of vancomycin increased survivorship of infected animals by 464% compared to nontreated controls. Infected animals receiving antimicrobial treatment showed comparable amounts of new bone formation within the defect site when compared to noninfected controls. Incorporating agents capable of disrupting established biofilms into bone graft substitutes may enhance effectiveness in treating a biofilm infection within a bone defect. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here, we investigated the resilience of biofilm communities with a gradient of diversity, and explored the relationship between biodiversity and stability in response to a pH shock. The results showed that all bioreactors could recover to stable performance after pH disturbance, exhibiting a great resilience ability. A further analysis of microbial composition showed that the rebound of Geobacter and other exoelectrogens contributed to the resilient effectiveness, and that the presence of Methanobrevibacter might delay the functional recovery of biofilms. The microbial communities with higher diversity tended to be recovered faster, implying biofilms with high biodiversity showed better resilience in response to environmental disturbance. Network analysis revealed that the negative interactions between the two dominant genera of Geobacter and Methanobrevibacter increased when the recovery time became longer, implying the internal resource or spatial competition of key functional taxa might fundamentally impact the resilience performances of biofilm communities.

Foreign materials such as implants or surgical sutures are optimal surfaces for the adherence of bacteria and subsequent colonization and biofilm formation. Due to a significant increase in antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, naturally occurring agents exhibiting antibacterial properties have great potential in prophylactic therapies. The aim of this study was to develop a coating for surgical sutures consisting of the antibacterial substance totarol, a naturally occurring diterpenoid isolated from Podocarpustotara in combination with poly(lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) as a biodegradable drug delivery system. Hence, non-absorbable monofilament and multifilament sutures were coated with solutions containing different amounts and ratios of totarol and PLGA, resulting in a smooth, crystalline coating. Using an agar diffusion test (ADT), it became evident that the PLGA/totarol-coated sutures inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus over a period of 15 days. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that the coated sutures were not cytotoxic to murine fibroblasts.

Stationary-phase cultures of P. aeruginosa were used to generate persister cells. A range of tobramycin concentrations was tested with a range of metabolite concentrations to determine the potentiation effect of the metabolite under a variety of conditions, including a range of pH values and in the presence of azithromycin or cystic fibrosis (CF) patient sputum. In addition, 96-well dish biofilm and colony biofilm assays were performed, and the cytotoxicity of the tobramycin-fumarate combination was determined utilizing a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Enhanced killing of up to 6 orders of magnitude of P. aeruginosa persisters over a range of CF isolates, including mucoid and nonmucoid strains, was observed for the tobramycin-fumarate combination compared to killing with tobramycin alone. Furthermore, significant fumarate-mediated potentiation was seen in the presence of azithromycin or CF patient sputum. Fumarate also reduced the cytotoxicity of tobramycin-treated P. aeruginosa to human epithelial airway cells. Finally, in mucoid and nonmucoid CF isolates, complete eradication of P. aeruginosa biofilm was observed in the colony biofilm assay due to fumarate potentiation.

This work determined the surface properties of p-PVC platelet concentrate bags and investigated how these characteristics influenced biofilm formation. Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus epidermidis, two species commonly implicated in platelet contamination, were used to study biofilm growth. The platelet concentrate bags were physically flattened to determine if reducing the surface roughness altered biofilm formation. The results demonstrated that the flattening process of the platelet bags affected the chemistry of the surface and reduced the surface hydrophobicity. Flattening of the surfaces resulted in a reduction in biofilm formation for both species after 5 days, with S. marcescens demonstrating a greater reduction. However, there was no significant difference between the smooth and flat surfaces following 7 days' incubation for S. marcescens and no significant differences between any of the surfaces following 7 days' incubation for S. epidermidis. The results suggest that flattening the p-PVC surfaces may limit potential biofilm formation for the current duration of platelet storage time of 5 days.

In addition to stringent sterile techniques, an efficacious way to prevent this destructive complication is to create new implants with antimicrobial properties. Specifically, these implants must be active in the dental implant environment where the implant is bathed in the glycoprotein-rich salivary fluids that enhance bacterial adhesion, and propagation, and biofilm formation. However, in designing an antimicrobial surface, a balance must be struck between antimicrobial activity and the need for the implant to interact with the bone environment. Three types of surfaces have been designed to combat biofilm formation, while attempting to maintain osseous interactions: 1) structured surfaces where topography, usually at the nanoscale, decreases bacterial adhesion sufficiently to retard establishment of infection; 2) surfaces that actively elute antimicrobials to avert bacterial adhesion and promote killing; and 3) surfaces containing permanently bonded agents that generate antimicrobial surfaces that prevent long-term bacterial adhesion.

The effect of lysozyme on biofilm formation capacities of 16 strains of selected microorganisms was investigated, whereby four testing replicates have been performed in vitro using the Test Tube method, and the potential of lysozyme to change biofilm forming capacities depending on its concentration, species, and strains of microorganisms is demonstrated. A lysozyme concentration of 30 μg/ml indicated to have the highest inhibiting effect on all tested microorganisms. Furthermore, G. vaginalis was the most sensitive of them all, as its biofilm formation was inhibited in the presence of as low as 2.5 μg/ml of lysozyme. At enzyme concentrations of 7.5-50 μg/ml (with the exception of 30 μg/ml) the biofilm forming capacities of P. aeruginosa were enhanced. Depending on the strain of P. aeruginosa, the total biofilm quantity was either reduced or unaffected at lysozyme concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 30 μg/ml. In contrast, lysozyme concentrations below 15 or 20 μg/ml did not affect or increase the volume of biofilm formation, while higher concentrations (15, 20, 25 μg/ml) reduced biofilm formation by 50% (3/6) and 30 μg/ml of biofilm reduced biofilm forming capacity of S. aureus by 100% (6/6).

Compared with independent biodegradation, pyridine and quinoline removal rates were slowed when biodegraded simultaneously, although the pyridine removal rate decreased more than for quinoline. The first mono-oxygenation of quinoline (to 2-hydroxyquinoline) always was faster than the first mono-oxygenation of pyridine (to 2-hydroxypyridine), and the difference was accentuated with pyridine and quinoline which were biodegraded simultaneously due to the competition for intracellular electron donor. Competition also existed between the second mono-oxygenations, and the removal rate of 2-hydroxypyridine was faster than the rate for 2-hydroxyquinoline, even though the rate was faster for quinoline than pyridine. Adding an exogenous electron donor accelerated all mono-oxygenations in proportion to the amount of donor added, but the increments were greater for quinoline due to its higher affinity for intracellular electron donors than pyridine.

Ellipsoid-shaped flocs of similar volume and different projected circularities were constructed in-silico and a mathematical model was developed to compare their UV DRC tailing levels (indicative of UV-resistance). It was found that floc shape can significantly influence tailing level, and rounder flocs (i.e. flocs with higher circularity) were more UV-resistant. This result was confirmed experimentally by obtaining UV DRCs of two 75-90 μm floc populations with different percentages (20% vs. 30%) of flocs with circularities higher than 0.5. The population enriched in less circular flocs (i.e. 20% flocs with circularities >0.5) had a lower tailing level (at least by 1-log) compared to the other population. The second model was developed to describe variations in UV disinfection kinetics observed in flocs with transverse vs. radial biomass non-homogeneity, indicative of biofilm-originated vs. suspended flocs. The varied-density hemispheres model and shell-core model were developed to simulate transverse and radial non-homogeneity, respectively. The UV DRCs were mathematically constructed and biofilm-originated flocs showed higher UV resistance compared to suspended flocs.

This study was enabled by the use of hierarchically structured electrodes, which could be tailored for high/stable loadings of PSII core complexes and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells. The mediated photocurrent densities generated by the biofilm were 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of the protein-film. This was partly attributed to a lower photocatalyst loading as the rate of mediated electron extraction from PSII in vitro is only double that of PSII in vivo. On the other hand, the biofilm exhibited much greater longevity (>5 days) than the protein-film (<6 h), with turnover numbers surpassing those of the protein-film after 2 days.

Hydrogen produced by electrolysis of Black Sea deep water can also be used in hydrogen fuel cells.

The biofilm formation was investigated in M63 medium with casein in microtiter plates, and the drug susceptibility was performed by disk diffusion methods. We found that 80-98% strains formed a biofilm. Strains showing sensitivity to amikacin and tobramycin from ICU produced more biofilm than strains showing resistance to these antibiotics. Ceftazidime-sensitive strains formed a smaller biofilm than resistant. The logistic regression shows association between drug resistance and strains originating from ICU. In case of ceftazidime, strong biofilm formation and descending from ICU reduced the likelihood of drug sensitivity. For other drugs such as aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, we found opposite relation (but it was not statistically significance).

This species exhibits an unusual parasexual cycle in which mating produces tetraploid cells that undergo a nonmeiotic program of concerted chromosome loss to return to a diploid or aneuploid state. In this work, we used a multipronged approach to examine the capacity of parasex to generate diversity in C. albicans First, we compared the phenotypic properties of 32 genotyped progeny and observed wide-ranging differences in fitness, filamentation, biofilm formation, and virulence. Strikingly, one parasexual isolate displayed increased virulence relative to parental strains using a Galleria mellonella model of infection, establishing that parasex has the potential to enhance pathogenic traits. Next, we examined parasexual progeny derived from homothallic, same-sex mating events, and reveal that parasex can generate diversity de novo from identical parental strains. Finally, we generated pools of parasexual progeny and examined resistance of these pools to environmental stresses. Parasexual progeny were generally less fit than control strains across most test conditions, but showed an increased ability to grow in the presence of the antifungal drug fluconazole (FL). FL-resistant progeny were aneuploid isolates, often being diploid strains trisomic for both Chr3 and Chr6. Passaging of these aneuploid strains frequently led to loss of the supernumerary chromosomes and a concomitant decrease in drug resistance. These experiments establish that parasex generates extensive phenotypic diversity de novo, and that this process has important consequences for both virulence and drug resistance in C. albicans populations.","authors":[{"name":"Matthew P Hirakawa"},{"name":"Darius E Chyou"},{"name":"Denis Huang"},{"name":"Aaron R Slan"},{"name":"Richard J Bennett"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Sexual reproduction"},{"word":"aneuploidy"},{"word":"antifungal"},{"word":"fluconazole"},{"word":"pathogenesis"}]},"article68":{"pmid":"28912103","title":"Membrane perturbing activities and structural properties of the frog-skin derived peptide Esculentin-1a(1-21)NH","date":"2018-09-17","abs":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent new alternatives to cope with the increasing number of multi-drug resistant microbial infections.

This study aims to investigate the epidemiological relationship of clinical and environmental P. aeruginosa isolates and to characterize the resistance and virulence properties of clonal clusters and sporadic strains in a non-outbreak setting. A total of 436 patients were screened for P. aeruginosa during hospitalization, and environmental samples were taken from their immediate ward media, including faucets, doorknobs, bedrails, pillows, quilts, and mattresses. As a result, 100 P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained, including 74 clinical strains and 26 environmental strains. By using Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis, the fingerprint displayed 20 distinct clusters and 44 sporadic strains. According to identical genotypes, there were clear P. aeruginosa cross-colonization processes from the ward media to inpatients, indicating faucets, bedrails, and pillows as the main propagation media that had been contaminated by clonal isolates previously detected in other patients. In addition, there were P. aeruginosa transmission processes between inpatients that were unexplained for lack of epidemiological evidence. As compared to sporadic strains of P. aeruginosa, clonal clusters are more capable of producing high-level biofilm, developing multi-drug resistance and inducing high-degree cytotoxicity. Among P. aeruginosa clonal clusters, there was a strong positive correlation between antibiotic resistance and biofilm production. We conclude that constant cross-colonization of P. aeruginosa clonal isolates will pose a long-term serious threat in terms of nosocomial outbreaks.

A limited number of antifungal agents from only a few drug classes are available to treat patients with these serious infections. Resistance can be either intrinsic or acquired. Resistance mechanisms are not exchanged between Candida; thus, acquired resistance either emerges in response to an antifungal selection pressure in the individual patient or, more rarely, occur due to horizontal transmission of resistant strains between patients. Although multidrug resistance is uncommon, increasing reports of multidrug resistance to the azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes have occurred in several Candida species, most notably Candida glabrata and more recently Candida auris. Drivers are overall antifungal use, subtherapeutic drug levels at sites of infection/colonization, drug sequestration in the biofilm matrix, and, in the setting of outbreaks, suboptimal infection control.

It has previously been demonstrated that mutation of atl, codY, rot, sarA, and sigB limits biofilm formation in the USA300 strain LAC while mutation of agr, fur, and mgrA has the opposite effect. Here we used a murine sepsis model to assess the impact of these same loci in acute infection. Mutation of agr, atl, and fur had no impact on virulence, while mutation of mgrA and rot increased virulence. In contrast, mutation of codY, sarA, and sigB significantly attenuated virulence. Mutation of sigB resulted in reduced accumulation of AgrA and SarA, while mutation of sarA resulted in reduced accumulation of AgrA, but this cannot account for the reduced virulence of sarA or sigB mutants because the isogenic agr mutant was not attenuated. Indeed, as assessed by accumulation of alpha toxin and protein A, all of the mutants we examined exhibited unique phenotypes by comparison to an agr mutant and to each other. Attenuation of the sarA, sigB and codY mutants was correlated with increased production of extracellular proteases and global changes in extracellular protein profiles. These results suggest that the inability to repress the production of extracellular proteases plays a key role in attenuating the virulence of S. aureus in acute as well as chronic, biofilm-associated infections, thus opening up the possibility that strategies aimed at the de-repression of protease production could be used to broad therapeutic advantage.

We tested the antimicrobial activity of extracts from kino of C. citriodora, C. torelliana × C. citriodora, and C. torelliana against three Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria and the unicellular fungus, Candida albicans. All extracts were active against all microbes, with the highest activity observed against P. aeruginosa.

All flavonoids were active against P. aeruginosa, and one compound, (+)-(2S)-4',5,7-trihydroxy-6-methylflavanone, was active against S. aureus. Another compound, 4',5,7-trihydroxy-6,8-dimethylflavanone, greatly increased biofilm formation by both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The presence or absence of methyl groups at positions 6 and 8 in the flavonoid A ring determined their anti-Staphylococcus and biofilm-stimulating activity.

However, the main factors that can affect the establishment of an organism on hard substrates and the colonization patterns on modern and time-averaged shells remain unclear. Using experimental and field approaches, we compared sclerobiont (i.e., bacteria and invertebrate) colonization patterns on the exposed shells (internal and external sides) of three bivalve species (Anadara brasiliana, Mactra isabelleana, and Amarilladesma mactroides) with different external shell textures. In addition, we evaluated the influence of the host characteristics (mode of life, body size, color alteration, external and internal ornamentation and mineralogy) of sclerobionts on dead mollusk shells (bivalve and gastropod) collected from the Southern Brazilian coast. Finally, we compared field observations with experiments to evaluate how the biological signs of the present-day invertebrate settlements are preserved in molluscan death assemblages (incipient fossil record) in a subtropical shallow coastal setting. The results enhance our understanding of sclerobiont colonization over modern and paleoecology perspectives. The data suggest that sclerobiont settlement is enhanced by (i) high(er) biofilm bacteria density, which is more attracted to surfaces with high ornamentation; (ii) heterogeneous internal and external shell surface; (iii) shallow infaunal or attached epifaunal life modes; (iv) colorful or post-mortem oxidized shell surfaces; (v) shell size (<50 mm2 or >1,351 mm2); and (vi) calcitic mineralogy. Although the biofilm bacteria density, shell size, and texture are considered the most important factors, the effects of other covarying attributes should also be considered. We observed a similar pattern of sclerobiont colonization frequency over modern and paleoecology perspectives, with an increase of invertebrates occurring on textured bivalve shells. This study demonstrates how bacterial biofilms may influence sclerobiont colonization on biological hosts (mollusks), and shows how ecological relationships in marine organisms may be relevant for interpreting the fossil record of sclerobionts.","authors":[{"name":"Vanessa Ochi Agostini"},{"name":"Matias do Nascimento Ritter"},{"name":"Alexandre José Macedo"},{"name":"Erik Muxagata"},{"name":"Fernando Erthal"}],"keywords":[]},"article93":{"pmid":"28902253","title":"Bacterial adhesion on conventional and self-ligating metallic brackets after surface treatment with plasma-polymerized hexamethyldisiloxane.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Plasma-polymerized film deposition was created to modify metallic orthodontic brackets surface properties in order to inhibit bacterial adhesion.","authors":[{"name":"Rogerio Amaral Tupinambá"},{"name":"Cristiane Aparecida de Assis Claro"},{"name":"Cristiane Aparecida Pereira"},{"name":"Celestino José Prudente Nobrega"},{"name":"Ana Paula Rosifini Alves Claro"}],"keywords":[]},"article94":{"pmid":"28902235","title":"Trends in restorative composites research: what is in the future?","date":"2017-10-06","abs":"Clinical trials have identified secondary caries and bulk fracture as the main causes for composite restoration failure.

LMOf2365_0442, 0443, and 0444 encode for fructose-specific EIIABC components of phosphotransferase transport system (PTS) permease that is responsible for sugar transport. In previous studies, in-frame deletion mutants of a putative fructose-specific PTS permease (LMOf2365_0442, 0443, and 0444) were constructed and analyzed. However, the virulence potential of these deletion mutants has not been studied. In this study, two in vitro methods were used to analyze the virulence potential of these L. monocytogenes deletion mutants. First, invasion assays were used to measure the invasion efficiencies to host cells using the human HT-29 cell line. Second, plaque forming assays were used to measure cell-to-cell spread in host cells. Our results showed that the deletion mutant ΔLMOf2365_0442 had reduced invasion and cell-to-cell spread efficiencies in human cell line compared to the parental strain LMOf2365, indicating that LMOf2365_0442 encoding for a fructose specific PTS permease IIA may be required for virulence in L. monocytogenes strain F2365. In addition, the gene expression levels of 15 virulence and stress-related genes were analyzed in the stationary phase cells of the deletion mutants using RT-PCR assays. Virulence-related gene expression levels were elevated in the deletion mutants ΔLMOf2365_0442-0444 compared to the wild type parental strain LMOf2365, indicating the down-regulation of virulence genes by this PTS permease in L. monocytogenes. Finally, stress-related gene clpC expression levels were also increased in all of the deletion mutants, suggesting the involvement of this PTS permease in stress response. Furthermore, these deletion mutants displayed the same pressure tolerance and the same capacity for biofilm formation compared to the wild-type parental strain LMOf2365.

In the absence of the Psp system, secretin mislocalization permeabilizes the IM and causes rapid cell death. The Psp proteins PspB and PspC form an integral IM complex with two independent roles. First, the PspBC complex is required to activate the Psp response in response to some inducing triggers, including a mislocalized secretin. Second, PspBC are sufficient to counteract mislocalized secretin toxicity. Remarkably, secretin mislocalization into the IM induces psp gene expression without significantly affecting the expression of any other genes. Furthermore, psp null strains are killed by mislocalized secretins, whereas no other null mutants have been found to share this specific secretin sensitivity. This suggests an exquisitely specific relationship between secretins and the Psp system, but there has been no mechanism described to explain this. In this study, we addressed this deficiency by using a coimmunoprecipitation approach to show that the Psp proteins form a specific complex with mislocalized secretins in the Y. enterocolitica IM. Importantly, analysis of different secretin mutant proteins also revealed that this interaction is absolutely dependent on a secretin adopting a multimeric state. Therefore, the Psp system has evolved with the ability to detect and detoxify dangerous secretin multimers while ignoring the presence of innocuous monomers.","authors":[{"name":"Disha Srivastava"},{"name":"Amal Moumene"},{"name":"Josué Flores-Kim"},{"name":"Andrew J Darwin"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Yersinia"},{"word":"protein interactions"},{"word":"secretin"},{"word":"stress response"}]},"article105":{"pmid":"28899678","title":"Behavior of nitrogen removal in an aerobic sponge based moving bed biofilm reactor.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"This study aims to investigate the behavior of nitrogen removal in an aerobic sponge based moving bed biofilm reactor by evaluating nitrification and denitrification rates of sponge biocarriers from three aerobic moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) with filling ratios of 10% (R-10), 20% (R-20) and 30% (R-30).

The majority of laboratory studies has used new and pristine microplastics to test their impacts, while aging processes such as weathering and biofouling alter the characteristics of plastic particles in the marine environment. We investigated zooplankton ingestion of polystyrene beads (15 and 30 μm) and fragments (≤30 μm), and tested the hypothesis that microplastics previously exposed to marine conditions (aged) are ingested at higher rates than pristine microplastics. Polystyrene beads were aged by soaking in natural local seawater for three weeks. Three zooplankton taxa ingested microplastics, excluding the copepod Pseudocalanus spp., but the proportions of individuals ingesting plastic and the number of particles ingested were taxon and life stage specific and dependent on plastic size. All stages of Calanus finmarchicus ingested polystyrene fragments. Aged microbeads were preferred over pristine ones by females of Acartia longiremis as well as juvenile copepodites CV and adults of Calanus finmarchicus. The preference for aged microplastics may be attributed to the formation of a biofilm. Such a coating, made up of natural microbes, may contain similar prey as the copepods feed on in the water column and secrete chemical exudates that aid chemodetection and thus increase the attractiveness of the particles as food items. Much of the ingested plastic was, however, egested within a short time period (2-4 h) and the survival of adult Calanus females was not affected in an 11-day exposure. Negative effects of microplastics ingestion were thus limited. Our findings emphasize, however, that aging plays an important role in the transformation of microplastics at sea and ingestion by grazers, and should thus be considered in future microplastics ingestion studies and estimates of microplastics transfer into the marine food web.","authors":[{"name":"Renske J E Vroom"},{"name":"Albert A Koelmans"},{"name":"Ellen Besseling"},{"name":"Claudia Halsband"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofouling"},{"word":"Ingestion"},{"word":"Marine"},{"word":"Microplastics"},{"word":"Zooplankton"}]},"article108":{"pmid":"28898826","title":"Identification of hotspots for NO and N","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"A membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) provides a counter-current substrate diffusion geometry in which oxygen is supplied from a gas-permeable membrane on which a biofilm is grown.

Bioremediation of PAHs by the activity of microorganisms is an ecological, economical, and safe decontamination approach. Since the introduction of foreign organisms into the Antarctica is prohibited, it is key to discover native bacteria that can be used for diesel bioremediation. By following the degradation of the PAH phenanthrene, we isolated 53 PAH metabolizing bacteria from diesel contaminated Antarctic soil samples, with three of these isolates exhibiting a high phenanthrene degrading capacity. In particular, the Sphingobium xenophagum D43FB isolate showed the highest phenanthrene degradation ability, generating up to 95% degradation of initial phenanthrene. D43FB can also degrade phenanthrene in the presence of its usual co-pollutant, the heavy metal cadmium, and showed the ability to grow using diesel-fuel as a sole carbon source. Microtiter plate assays and SEM analysis revealed that S. xenophagum D43FB exhibits the ability to form biofilms and can directly adhere to phenanthrene crystals.

Fluoride-resistant S. mutans has seldom been isolated in clinical settings, despite the wide application of fluoride in oral-care products. One explanation is that the fluoride-resistant S. mutans strains have decreased fitness. However, so far, there has been no conclusive evidence to support this idea. The aim of this study was to investigate the fitness cost of 48-h biofilms of two fluoride-resistant S. mutans strains, UF35 and UA159-FR (UAFR), using the wild-type fluoride-sensitive strain UA159 as a reference. The engineered UF35 strain contains one point mutation, whereas UAFR, selected from NaF-containing agar plates, has multiple chromosomal mutations. All biofilms were formed for 48 h under a constantly neutral pH or a pH-cycling (8 h of neutral pH and 16 h of pH 5.5) condition in the absence of fluoride. The biomass of the biofilms was quantified with a crystal violet assay. The biofilms were also treated with chlorhexidine or solutions at pH 3.0, after which their lactic acid production was quantified. Compared to the UF35 and UA159 biofilms, the biomass of UAFR biofilms was two-four fold higher, and the UAFR biofilms were more resistant to chlorhexidine and low pH in terms of lactic acid production. No difference in biomass and lactic acid production was detected between UF35 and UA159 biofilms. The fluoride resistance of UAFR and UF35 strains in biofilms was further confirmed by treating the biofilms with NaF solutions. The level of NaF resistance of the three biofilms is generally ranked as follows: UAFR > UF35 > UA159. In conclusion, there is indeed a fitness consequence in UAFR, but surprisingly, this fluoride-resistant strain performs better than UF35 and UA159 under the described conditions. In addition, UF35 did not display a reduced fitness; it performed as well as the wild-type fluoride-sensitive strain.","authors":[{"name":"Yanling Cai"},{"name":"Ying Liao"},{"name":"Bernd W Brandt"},{"name":"Xi Wei"},{"name":"Hongyan Liu"},{"name":"Wim Crielaard"},{"name":"Cor Van Loveren"},{"name":"Dong Mei Deng"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Streptococcus mutans"},{"word":"biofilm"},{"word":"chlorhexidine"},{"word":"fitness cost"},{"word":"fluoride resistance"},{"word":"low pH"},{"word":"sodium fluoride"}]},"article120":{"pmid":"28894439","title":"Phenotypic Changes Exhibited by E. coli Cultured in Space.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Bacteria will accompany humans in our exploration of space, making it of importance to study their adaptation to the microgravity environment.

Contrast light microscopy and focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy showed that, on average, cells in space were 37% of the volume of their matched controls, which may alter the rate of molecule-cell interactions in a diffusion-limited mass transport regime as is expected to occur in microgravity. TEM imagery showed an increase in cell envelope thickness of between 25 and 43% in space with respect to the Earth control group. Outer membrane vesicles were observed on the spaceflight samples, but not on the Earth cultures. While E. coli suspension cultures on Earth were homogenously distributed throughout the liquid medium, in space they tended to form a cluster, leaving the surrounding medium visibly clear of cells. This cell aggregation behavior may be associated with enhanced biofilm formation observed in other spaceflight experiments.","authors":[{"name":"Luis Zea"},{"name":"Michael Larsen"},{"name":"Frederico Estante"},{"name":"Klaus Qvortrup"},{"name":"Ralf Moeller"},{"name":"Sílvia Dias de Oliveira"},{"name":"Louis Stodieck"},{"name":"David Klaus"}],"keywords":[{"word":"aggregation"},{"word":"bacterial growth"},{"word":"bioastronautics"},{"word":"cell envelope"},{"word":"cell size"},{"word":"microgravity"},{"word":"vesicle"}]},"article121":{"pmid":"28894437","title":"Evolution of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in Cystic Fibrosis Lung over Chronic Infection: A Genomic and Phenotypic Population Study.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has been recognized as an emerging multi-drug resistant opportunistic pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We report a comparative genomic and phenotypic analysis of 91 S. maltophilia strains from 10 CF patients over a 12-year period. Draft genome analyses included in silico Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and pangenome characterization. Growth rate, biofilm formation, motility, mutation frequency, in vivo virulence, and in vitro antibiotic susceptibility were determined and compared with population structure over time. The population consisted of 20 different sequence types (STs), 11 of which are new ones. Pangenome and SNPs data showed that this population is composed of three major phylogenetic lineages. All patients were colonized by multiple STs, although most of them were found in a single patient and showed persistence over years. Only few phenotypes showed some correlation with population phylogenetic structure. Our results show that S. maltophilia adaptation to CF lung is associated with consistent genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infecting multiple hosts likely experiences different selection pressures depending on the host environment.

We conducted a side-by-side comparison of the biofilm-forming abilities of the prototype laboratory strains and the currently circulating isolates from two countries with different vaccination programs.

Biofilm structural analyses revealed country-specific differences, with strains from the United States forming more structured biofilms. Bacterial hyperaggregation and reciprocal expression of biofilm-promoting and -inhibitory factors were observed in clinical isolates. An association of increased biofilm formation with augmented epithelial cell adhesion and higher levels of bacterial colonization in the mouse nose and trachea was detected. To our knowledge, this work links for the first time increased biofilm formation in bacteria with a colonization advantage in an animal model.

Previously, two series of cationic amphiphiles (CAms) which self-assemble into supramolecular nanostructures with membrane-lytic properties were designed with hydrophilic head groups and nonpolar domains. The combination of CAms and commonly prescribed antibiotics is suggested as a promising strategy for targeting microorganisms that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. Activities of the CAms against Gardnerella vaginalis ATCC 14018, a representative BV pathogen, ranged from 1.1 to 24.4 μM. Interestingly, the tested healthy Lactobacillus species, especially Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 39268, were significantly more tolerant of CAms than the selected pathogens. In addition, CAms prevented biofilm formation at concentrations which did not influence the normal growth ability of G. vaginalis ATCC 14018. Furthermore, the biofilm minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC-Bs) of CAms against G. vaginalis ATCC 14018 ranged from 58.8 to 425.6 μM, while much higher concentrations (≥850 μM) were required to produce ≥3-log reductions in the number of biofilm-associated lactobacilli. The conventional antibiotic metronidazole synergized strongly with all tested CAms against planktonic cells and biofilms of G. vaginalis ATCC 14018. The synergism between CAms and the tested conventional antibiotic may be considered a new, effective, and beneficial method of controlling biofilm-associated bacterial vaginosis.","authors":[{"name":"Ammar Algburi"},{"name":"Yingyue Zhang"},{"name":"Richard Weeks"},{"name":"Nicole Comito"},{"name":"Saskia Zehm"},{"name":"Juanita Pinto"},{"name":"Kathryn E Uhrich"},{"name":"Michael L Chikindas"}],"keywords":[{"word":"AMP mimics"},{"word":"Gardnerella vaginalis"},{"word":"antimicrobials"},{"word":"bacterial vaginosis"},{"word":"biofilm"}]},"article124":{"pmid":"28893778","title":"Protocol for Identifying Natural Agents That Selectively Affect Adhesion, Thickness, Architecture, Cellular Phenotypes, Extracellular Matrix, and Human White Blood Cell Impenetrability of Candida albicans Biofilms.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"In the screening of natural plant extracts for antifungal activity, assessment of their effects on the growth of cells in suspension or in the wells of microtiter plates is expedient.

Here, a confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) protocol for testing the effects of large numbers of agents on biofilm development is described. The protocol assessed nine parameters from a single z-stack series of CLSM scans for each individual biofilm analyzed. The parameters included adhesion, thickness, formation of a basal yeast cell polylayer, hypha formation, the vertical orientation of hyphae, the hyphal bend point, pseudohypha formation, calcofluor white staining of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and human white blood cell impenetrability. The protocol was applied first to five plant extracts and derivative compounds and then to a collection of 88 previously untested plant extracts.

Farnesol is a quorum sensing molecule secreted by the fungal species Candida albicans and shown to play a central physiological role during fungal biofilm growth. Our pervious in vitro and in vivo studies characterized an intricate interaction between C. albicans and the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, as these species coexist in biofilm. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of farnesol on S. aureus survival, biofilm formation, and response to antimicrobials. The results demonstrated that in the presence of exogenously supplemented farnesol or farnesol secreted by C. albicans in biofilm, S. aureus exhibited significantly enhanced tolerance to antimicrobials. By using gene expression studies, S. aureus mutant strains, and chemical inhibitors, the mechanism for the enhanced tolerance was attributed to upregulation of drug efflux pumps. Importantly, we showed that sequential exposure of S. aureus to farnesol generated a phenotype of high resistance to antimicrobials. Based on the presence of intracellular reactive oxygen species upon farnesol exposure, we hypothesize that antimicrobial tolerance in S. aureus may be mediated by farnesol-induced oxidative stress triggering the upregulation of efflux pumps, as part of a general stress response system. Hence, in mixed biofilms, C. albicans may influence the pathogenicity of S. aureus through acquisition of a drug-tolerant phenotype, with important therapeutic implications.

Here we describe a genetic program for cell-fate decision in the opportunistic human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, which generates the phenotypic bifurcation of the cells into two genetically identical but different cell types during the course of an infection. Whereas one cell type promotes the formation of biofilms that contribute to chronic infections, the second type is planktonic and produces the toxins that contribute to acute bacteremia. We identified a bimodal switch in the agr quorum sensing system that antagonistically regulates the differentiation of these two physiologically distinct cell types. We found that extracellular signals affect the behavior of the agr bimodal switch and modify the size of the specialized subpopulations in specific colonization niches. For instance, magnesium-enriched colonization niches causes magnesium binding to S. aureusteichoic acids and increases bacterial cell wall rigidity. This signal triggers a genetic program that ultimately downregulates the agr bimodal switch. Colonization niches with different magnesium concentrations influence the bimodal system activity, which defines a distinct ratio between these subpopulations; this in turn leads to distinct infection outcomes in vitro and in an in vivo murine infection model. Cell differentiation generates physiological heterogeneity in clonal bacterial infections and helps to determine the distinct infection types.","authors":[{"name":"Juan-Carlos García-Betancur"},{"name":"Angel Goñi-Moreno"},{"name":"Thomas Horger"},{"name":"Melanie Schott"},{"name":"Malvika Sharan"},{"name":"Julian Eikmeier"},{"name":"Barbara Wohlmuth"},{"name":"Alma Zernecke"},{"name":"Knut Ohlsen"},{"name":"Christina Kuttler"},{"name":"Daniel Lopez"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus aureus"},{"word":"cell differentiation"},{"word":"infectious disease"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"opportunistic infection"}]},"article127":{"pmid":"28893370","title":"Inhibitory efficacy of geraniol on biofilm formation and development of adaptive resistance in Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"The current study has been designed to delineate the efficacy of geraniol (GE) on biofilm formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of GE on the development of adaptive resistance.","authors":[{"name":"Arunachalam Kannappan"},{"name":"Murugesan Sivaranjani"},{"name":"Ramanathan Srinivasan"},{"name":"Janarthanam Rathna"},{"name":"Shunmugiah Karutha Pandian"},{"name":"Arumugam Veera Ravi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"adaptive response"},{"word":"antibiofilm"},{"word":"geraniol"},{"word":"sequential exposure"}]},"article128":{"pmid":"28893354","title":"Similar virulence properties of infection and colonization associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the agents that are commonly implicated in nosocomial infections.

The aim of this study was to develop an organotypic oral mucosa model that could be exposed to in vitro cultured commensal and pathogenic biofilms in a standardized and scalable manner. The oral mucosa model consisted of a tissue-engineered human gingiva equivalent containing a multilayered differentiated gingiva epithelium (keratinocytes) grown on a collagen hydrogel, containing gingiva fibroblasts, which represented the lamina propria. Keratinocyte and fibroblast telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized cell lines were used to overcome the limitations of isolating cells from small biopsies when scalable culture experiments were required. The oral biofilms were grown under defined conditions from human saliva to represent 3 distinct phenotypes: commensal, gingivitis, and cariogenic. The in vitro grown biofilms contained physiologic numbers of bacterial species, averaging >70 operational taxonomic units, including 20 differentiating operational taxonomic units. When the biofilms were applied topically to the gingiva equivalents for 24 h, the gingiva epithelium increased its expression of elafin, a protease inhibitor and antimicrobial protein. This increased elafin expression was observed as a response to all 3 biofilm types, commensal as well as pathogenic (gingivitis and cariogenic). Biofilm exposure also increased secretion of the antimicrobial cytokine CCL20 and inflammatory cytokines IL-6, CXCL8, and CCL2 from gingiva equivalents. This inflammatory response was far greater after commensal biofilm exposure than after pathogenic biofilm exposure. These results show that pathogenic oral biofilms have early immune evasion properties as compared with commensal oral biofilms. The novel host-microbiome model provides an ideal tool for future investigations of gingiva responses to commensal and pathogenic biofilms and for testing novel therapeutics.","authors":[{"name":"J K Buskermolen"},{"name":"M M Janus"},{"name":"S Roffel"},{"name":"B P Krom"},{"name":"S Gibbs"}],"keywords":[{"word":"bacteria"},{"word":"gingivitis"},{"word":"host-pathogen interactions"},{"word":"immune evasion"},{"word":"keratinocytes"},{"word":"oral mucosa"}]},"article134":{"pmid":"28892294","title":"Nuclease activity gives an edge to host-defense peptide piscidin 3 over piscidin 1, rendering it more effective against persisters and biofilms.","date":"2020-02-25","abs":"Host-defense peptides (HDPs) feature evolution-tested potency against life-threatening pathogens.

This GI does not carry genes with transfer functions, but it carries four genes required for robust biofilm formation. Notably, this GI is inserted in the integration site for SXT/R391 ICEs. We demonstrated that acquisition of an SXT/R391 ICE results in either a tandem GI/ICE arrangement or the complete displacement of the GI. The GI displacement by the ICE greatly reduces biofilm formation. In contrast, the tandem integration of the ICE with the GI in cis allows the GI to hijack the transfer machinery of the ICE to excise, transfer and re-integrate into a new host. Collectively, our findings reveal that the integration of an ICE into a GI integration site enables rapid genome dynamics and a new mechanism by which SXT/R391 ICEs can augment genome plasticity.","authors":[{"name":"Pengxia Wang"},{"name":"Zhenshun Zeng"},{"name":"Weiquan Wang"},{"name":"Zhongling Wen"},{"name":"Jie Li"},{"name":"Xiaoxue Wang"}],"keywords":[]},"article136":{"pmid":"28892140","title":"Biofilm Formation and Its Relationship with the Molecular Characteristics of Food-Related Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The capability to produce biofilm is an important persistence and dissemination mechanism of some foodborne bacteria.

Significant advances in the structural and functional analysis of AcrB have informed the selection of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs). However, an accurate method to determine the kinetics of efflux pump inhibition was lacking. In this study we standardised and optimised surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to probe the binding kinetics of substrates and inhibitors to AcrB. The SPR method was also combined with a fluorescence drug binding method by which affinity of two fluorescent AcrB substrates were determined using the same conditions and controls as for SPR. Comparison of the results from the fluorescent assay to those of the SPR assay showed excellent correlation and provided validation for the methods and conditions used for SPR. The kinetic parameters of substrate (doxorubicin, novobiocin and minocycline) binding to AcrB were subsequently determined. Lastly, the kinetics of inhibition of AcrB were probed for two established inhibitors (phenylalanine arginyl β-naphthylamide and 1-1-naphthylmethyl-piperazine) and three novel EPIs: 4-isobutoxy-2-naphthamide (A2), 4-isopentyloxy-2-naphthamide (A3) and 4-benzyloxy-2-naphthamide (A9) have also been probed.

The results showed that the sub-MIC doses of zinc oxide nanoparticles exhibited significant anti-biofilm activity against S. pneumoniae, with maximum biofilm attenuation found at 12 μg/ml. Taken together, the results indicate that zinc oxide nanoparticles can be considered as a potential agent for the inhibition of microbial biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Purnita Bhattacharyya"},{"name":"Bikash Agarwal"},{"name":"Madhurankhi Goswami"},{"name":"Debasish Maiti"},{"name":"Sunandan Baruah"},{"name":"Prosun Tribedi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Anti-biofilm"},{"word":"Antimicrobial"},{"word":"Streptococcus pneumoniae"},{"word":"Zinc oxide nanoparticle"}]},"article168":{"pmid":"28889121","title":"Structure-Function Analysis of the Periplasmic Escherichia coli Cyclophilin PpiA in Relation to Biofilm Formation.","date":"2019-02-20","abs":"The presence of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases, EC: 5.2.1.8) in all domains of life indicates their biological importance.

Herein, we developed a new route to obtain a homogeneous and crystalline apatite coating on diamond-like carbon films grown on 304 biomedical stainless steel and evaluated its antibacterial effect. For this purpose, films containing two different concentrations of titanium dioxide (0.1 and 0.3g/L) were obtained by chemical vapor deposition.

The antibacterial activity of the films was evaluated by bacterial eradication tests using Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering spectroscopy, and goniometry showed that homogeneous, crystalline, and hydrophilic apatite films were formed independently of the titanium dioxide concentration.

This study aimed to find naturally derived lectins that inhibit the initial attachment of a cariogenic bacterial species, Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), to carbohydrate chains in saliva in vitro. Seventy kinds of lectins were screened for candidate motifs that inhibit the attachment of S. mutans ATCC 25175 to a saliva-coated culture plate. The inhibitory effect of the lectins on attachment of the S. mutans to the plates was quantified by crystal violet staining, and the biofilm was observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed to examine the binding of S. mutans to carbohydrate chains and the binding of candidate lectins to carbohydrate chains, respectively. Moreover, binding assay between the biotinylated-lectins and the saliva components was conducted to measure the lectin binding. Lectins recognizing a salivary carbohydrate chain, Galβ1-3GalNAc, inhibited the binding of S. mutans to the plate. In particular, Agaricus bisporus agglutinin (ABA) markedly inhibited the binding. This inhibition was confirmed by SEM observation. SPR analysis indicated that S. mutans strongly binds to Galβ1-3GalNAc, and ABA binds to Galβ1-3GalNAc. Finally, the biotinylated Galβ1-3GalNAc-binding lectins including ABA demonstrated marked binding to the saliva components. These results suggest that ABA lectin inhibited the attachment of S. mutans to Galβ1-3GalNAc in saliva and ABA can be useful as a potent inhibitor for initial attachment of oral bacteria and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Takashi Ito"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Yoshida"},{"name":"Yasuyoshi Shiota"},{"name":"Yuki Ito"},{"name":"Tadashi Yamamoto"},{"name":"Shogo Takashiba"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Carbohydrate chains"},{"word":"Inhibitor"},{"word":"Initial attachment"},{"word":"Lectin"}]},"article176":{"pmid":"28887578","title":"[Topical antiseptic agents].","date":"2019-06-28","abs":"Topical therapy is an important domain in the treatment of dermatological diseases in the 21st century.

Macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), two important factors in innate immune response, were cocultured with nano-ZnO and bacteria/lipopolysaccharide in vitro, and the nano-ZnO films could enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of macrophages and PMNs through promoting phagocytosis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. This study provides insights into the anti-infective activity and mechanism of ZnO and consolidates the theoretical basis for future clinical applications of ZnO.","authors":[{"name":"Jiaxing Wang"},{"name":"Huaijuan Zhou"},{"name":"Geyong Guo"},{"name":"Jiaqi Tan"},{"name":"Qiaojie Wang"},{"name":"Jin Tang"},{"name":"Wei Liu"},{"name":"Hao Shen"},{"name":"Jinhua Li"},{"name":"Xianlong Zhang"}],"keywords":[{"word":"antimicrobial"},{"word":"immunomodulatory"},{"word":"macrophages"},{"word":"nanoparticles"},{"word":"nano−bio interactions"},{"word":"polymorphonuclear leukocytes"},{"word":"zinc oxide"}]},"article192":{"pmid":"28884496","title":"Potential Role of Curcumin Against Biofilm-Producing Organisms on the Skin: A Review.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Turmeric root (Curcuma longa) is predominantly used as a spice, but has also long been known to possess antimicrobial, analgesic, antiinflammatory, and anticancer properties. One predominant group of active compounds in turmeric are curcuminoids, namely bright yellow-pigmented curcumin. While modern science has yet to fully investigate the therapeutic claims of turmeric and its derivatives, results have proven promising in decreasing pain and inflammation in arthritis, improving insulin sensitivity in diabetes, and even curing a variety of infections. The purpose of this review is to discuss the potential for curcumin as an agent against microbial infections, with a special focus on the skin and in the development of bacterial biofilms. Curcumin has demonstrated bactericidal efficacy against a variety of infections when administered with antibiotics in several clinical studies, with consistent antimicrobial activity demonstrated in vitro, as well as in urinary tract infections, gingival infections, and chronic wound infections. Hypothesized mechanisms of action include curcumin's ability to perturb bacterial membranes, disturb protofillament assembly, and even impair bacterial virulence factors. Further investigation is needed to fully understand which organisms are most susceptible to the effects of curcumin and how curcumin can be implemented in dermatology to treat skin conditions such as chronic wounds and acne vulgaris.

Biofilms are formed as the bacterial metabolism adapts to an attached growth state. We studied whether bacterial metabolism, hence biofilm formation, can be modulated in electrochemically active surfaces using the conducting conjugated polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). We fabricated composites of PEDOT doped with either heparin, dodecyl benzene sulfonate or chloride, and identified the fabrication parameters so that the electrochemical redox state is the main distinct factor influencing biofilm growth. PEDOT surfaces fitted into a custom-designed culturing device allowed for redox switching in Salmonella cultures, leading to oxidized or reduced electrodes. Similarly large biofilm growth was found on the oxidized anodes and on conventional polyester. In contrast, biofilm was significantly decreased (52-58%) on the reduced cathodes. Quantification of electrochromism in unswitched conducting polymer surfaces revealed a bacteria-driven electrochemical reduction of PEDOT. As a result, unswitched PEDOT acquired an analogous electrochemical state to the externally reduced cathode, explaining the similarly decreased biofilm growth on reduced cathodes and unswitched surfaces. Collectively, our findings reveal two opposing effects affecting biofilm formation. While the oxidized PEDOT anode constitutes a renewable electron sink that promotes biofilm growth, reduction of PEDOT by a power source or by bacteria largely suppresses biofilm formation. Modulating bacterial metabolism using the redox state of electroactive surfaces constitutes an unexplored method with applications spanning from antifouling coatings and microbial fuel cells to the study of the role of bacterial respiration during infection.","authors":[{"name":"Salvador Gomez-Carretero"},{"name":"Ben Libberton"},{"name":"Mikael Rhen"},{"name":"Agneta Richter-Dahlfors"}],"keywords":[]},"article195":{"pmid":"28883911","title":"Antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation among coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from clinical samples at a tertiary care hospital of eastern Nepal.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"Coagulase negative staphylococci were long regarded non-pathogenic as they are the commensals of human skin and mucosa but the recent changes in the medical practice and changes in underlying host populations, they are being considered significant pathogens associated with number of nosocomial infections.

As these bacteria can limit the effectiveness of antibiotics to eradicate certain infections, their elimination is a relevant issue. Photodynamic therapy seems suitable for this purpose, but phenotypic tolerance to it has also been reported for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To test whether any phenotypic feature could confer tolerance against both antibiotics and photoinactivation, survivors from exposures to light in the presence of methylene blue were treated with ofloxacin, an antibiotic effective on nongrowing bacteria. Susceptibility to ofloxacin was normal in these bacteria in spite of their increased ability to survive photodynamic inactivation, suggesting the absence of cross-tolerance. It thus seemed possible to use one of these treatments to eliminate bacteria which had phenotypic tolerance to the other. To test this strategy, persister bacteria emerging from ofloxacin treatments were submitted to the action of light and methylene blue while the antibiotic remained in the bacterial suspension. Persisters lost their clonogenic ability under these conditions and the effects of the treatments seemed to be synergistic. These observations suggest that photodynamic antimicrobial therapy could be used as a complement to antibiotic treatments to eliminate persister bacteria from localized infections.","authors":[{"name":"Oscar Juan Oppezzo"},{"name":"Ana Florencia Forte Giacobone"}],"keywords":[]},"article205":{"pmid":"28881210","title":"Total electron acceptor loading and composition affect hexavalent uranium reduction and microbial community structure in a membrane biofilm reactor.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"Molecular microbiology tools (i.e., 16S rDNA gene sequencing) were employed to elucidate changes in the microbial community structure according to the total electron acceptor loading (controlled by influent flow rate and/or medium composition) in a H","authors":[{"name":"Aura Ontiveros-Valencia"},{"name":"Chen Zhou"},{"name":"Zehra Esra Ilhan"},{"name":"Louis Cornette de Saint Cyr"},{"name":"Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown"},{"name":"Bruce E Rittmann"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Acceptor loadings"},{"word":"Homoacetogens"},{"word":"Methanogens"},{"word":"Spore-forming microorganisms"},{"word":"Sulfate reducers"},{"word":"Uranium reduction"}]},"article207":{"pmid":"28880814","title":"Investigation of full-scale ozonation at a municipal wastewater treatment plant using a toxicity-based evaluation concept.","date":"2018-11-25","abs":"Effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are known to be point sources of micropollutants for surface waters.

PFOR is present in these anaerobic pathogenic bacteria and thus we hypothesized that amixicile would effectively inhibit their growth. In general, PFOR is present in all obligate anaerobic bacteria, while oral commensal aerobes, including aerotolerant ones, such as Streptococcus gordonii, use pyruvate dehydrogenase to decarboxylate pyruvate. Accordingly, we observed that growth of the PFOR-containing anaerobic periodontal pathogens, grown in both monospecies as well as multispecies broth cultures was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner while that of S. gordonii was unaffected. Furthermore, we also show that amixicile is effective against these pathogens grown as monospecies and multispecies biofilms. Finally, amixicile is the first selective therapeutic agent active against bacteria internalized by host cells. Together, the results show that amixicile is an effective inhibitor of oral anaerobic bacteria and as such, is a good candidate for treatment of periodontal diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Justin A Hutcherson"},{"name":"Kathryn M Sinclair"},{"name":"Benjamin R Belvin"},{"name":"Qin Gui"},{"name":"Paul S Hoffman"},{"name":"Janina P Lewis"}],"keywords":[]},"article224":{"pmid":"28874606","title":"Bacterial d-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells.","date":"2019-01-12","abs":"In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas activation of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) stimulates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, activation of the sweet taste receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that d-amino acids, which are produced by various bacteria and activate T1R in taste receptor cells in the mouth, may also activate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of Staphylococcus species, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa, produced at least two d-amino acids that activate the sweet taste receptor. In addition to inhibiting P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, d-amino acids derived from Staphylococcus inhibited T2R-mediated signaling and defensin secretion in sinonasal cells by activating T1R2/3. d-Amino acid-mediated activation of T1R2/3 also enhanced epithelial cell death during challenge with Staphylococcus aureus in the presence of the bitter receptor-activating compound denatonium benzoate.

The results showed that MAP inhibited the growth of the P. fragi strains. Compared with the control, more loose and less bound EPS (containing protein and carbohydrate) were produced by P. fragi in MAP samples.

Considerable evidence links biofilm formation by oral microbiota to oral disease and consequently systemic infections. Streptococcus sanguinis, a Gram-positive bacterium, is one of the most abundant species of the oral microbiota and it contributes to biofilm development in the oral cavity. Due to its altered biofilm formation, we investigated a biofilm mutant, ΔSSA_0351, that is deficient in type I signal peptidase (SPase) in this study. Although the growth curve of the ΔSSA_0351 mutant showed no significant difference from that of the wild-type strain SK36, biofilm assays using both microtitre plate assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed a sharp reduction in biofilm formation in the mutant compared to the wild-type strain and the paralogous mutant ΔSSA_0849. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed remarkable differences in the cell surface morphologies and chain length of the ΔSSA_0351 mutant compared with those of the wild-type strain. Transcriptomic and proteomic assays using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry, respectively, were conducted on the ΔSSA_0351 mutant to evaluate the functional impact of SPase on biofilm formation. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis revealed a number of proteins that were differentially regulated in the ΔSSA_0351 mutant, narrowing down the list of SPase substrates involved in biofilm formation to lactate dehydrogenase (SSA_1221) and a short-chain dehydrogenase (SSA_0291). With further experimentation, this list defined the link between SSA_0351-encoded SPase, cell wall biosynthesis and biofilm formation.","authors":[{"name":"Jessica Aynapudi"},{"name":"Fadi El-Rami"},{"name":"Xiuchun Ge"},{"name":"Victoria Stone"},{"name":"Bin Zhu"},{"name":"Todd Kitten"},{"name":"Ping Xu"}],"keywords":[]},"article247":{"pmid":"28868927","title":"Measuring a critical stress for continuous prevention of marine biofouling accumulation with aeration.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"When cleaning the hull of a ship, significant shear stresses are needed to remove established biofouling organisms. Given that there exists a link between the amount of time that fouling accumulates and the stress required to remove it, it is not surprising that more frequent grooming requires less shear stress.

Worldwide estimates reveal that, billions of dollars are being spent annually for the management of such chronic ailments. Evidently, bacterial biofilms pose a greater problem in the effective management of infection in chronic wounds, since most of the currently available antibiotics are unable to act on the microorganisms residing inside the protected environment of the biofilms. Accordingly, in the present study, we have attempted to evaluate the anti-biofilm properties of human placental extract (PLX) and also other virulence factors that are mediated via the quorum sensing (QS) signalling system. PLX is well known for its anti inflammatory action and it has been shown earlier some anti microbial and enzymatic activity also. PLX was found to produce significant inhibition of biofilm formation and also decreased the levels of pyoverdin and pyocyanin. The microscopic analysis (both light microscopy and atomic force microscopy) of biofilms was also used for substantiating the findings from spectrophotometric (crystal violet estimation) and fluorescence analysis (resazurin uptake). PLX pre-treatment decreased the hydrophobicity of gram-positive and gram negative cells, indicating the effect of placental extract on adherence property of planktonic cell, serving as an indicator for its antibiofilm effect on microorganisms. The reduced extracellular DNA (eDNA) content in biofilm matrix following treatment with PLX also indicates the effectiveness of placenta extract on bacterial adherence, which in turn serves as evidence substantiating the antibiofilm effects of the PLX. Furthermore, PLX was also found to be significantly effective in the in vitro wound biofilm model. Thus the present study, the first of its kind with PLX, establishes the therapeutic benefit of the same particularly in infected wounds, opening up newer avenue for further exploration.","authors":[{"name":"Sutapa Goswami"},{"name":"Ratul Sarkar"},{"name":"Pritam Saha"},{"name":"Amit Maity"},{"name":"Tridib Sarkar"},{"name":"Debmalya Das"},{"name":"Piyali Datta Chakraborty"},{"name":"Subhasri Bandyopadhyay"},{"name":"Chandan Kumar Ghosh"},{"name":"Sanmoy Karmakar"},{"name":"Tuhinadri Sen"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Human placenta extract"},{"word":"Motility"},{"word":"Quorum sensing"},{"word":"Wound"},{"word":"eDNA"}]},"article253":{"pmid":"28867634","title":"Two potential uses for silver nanoparticles coated with Solanum nigrum unripe fruit extract: Biofilm inhibition and photodegradation of dye effluent.","date":"2018-05-15","abs":"Silver nanoparticle was green synthesized involving the unripe fruit extracts of Solanum nigrum (Sn-AgNPs).

A more reasonable way to tune QS is to augment reactors with AHL-producing or -quenching bacteria. In this work, the impacts of continuous dose of AHL-producing or -quenching strains on the activated sludge during its granulation process were explored. Augmentation of AHL-producing or -quenching strains resulted in up- or down-regulation of the AHL concentration in the reactors.

The findings here link exogenous fatty acid exposure to changes in bacterial membrane phospholipid structure, permeability, phenotypes associated with virulence, and consequent stress responses that may impact survival and persistence of pathogenic Vibrio species. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (ranging in carbon length and unsaturation) supplied in growth medium were assimilated into bacterial phospholipids, as determined by thin-layer chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

It has been incorporated in oral hygiene formulations to mitigate sensitivity and to prevent caries. In this investigation, the effects of sustained arginine dosing of dental plaque microcosms on bacteriological composition and pH were evaluated under controlled conditions. Plaque microcosms were established in constant-depth film fermentors (CDFFs) using salivary inocula and fed continuously with artificial saliva. To simulate resting and cariogenic states, the CDFFs were supplemented with sterile water or 5% sucrose, respectively. Plaques were then dosed twice daily with a dentifrice with 1.5% arginine arginine added (DA) or without arginine (DN). This regimen continued for over 3 weeks, after which fermentors were maintained without dosing. Microcosms were analyzed by differential viable counting, with a pH microelectrode, and by eubacterial DNA profiling. Sucrose dosing was associated with significantly (P < 0.001) decreased pH, significantly (P < 0.05) increased counts of total aerobes, Gram-negative anaerobes, aciduric species, acidogenic species, arginine utilizing species, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and streptococci, and significant (P < 0.05) changes in DNA profiles. Plaques dosed with DA had a significantly (P < 0.001) higher pH than those dosed with DN, with or without sucrose supplementation. Dosing with DA but not DN significantly (P < 0.05) decreased counts of all functional bacterial groups apart from the total anaerobes in cariogenic plaques, and in resting plaques, dosing with DA significantly (P < 0.05) decreased counts of streptococci, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and acidogenic bacteria. In summary, sustained exposure of oral microcosms to arginine in formulation significantly increased plaque pH and significantly reduced the viability of cariogenic bacterial species.

To further correlate this role with presence of CRISPR, we analyzed, by computational methods, 122 genomes from 15 species of CoNS. Only 15% of them harbored CRISPR/Cas systems, and this proportion was much lower for S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, the CoNS most frequently associated with opportunistic infections in humans. These systems are of type II or III, and at least two of them are located within SCCmec, a mobile genetic element of Staphylococcus bacterial species. An analysis of the spacers of these CRISPRs, which come from exogenous origin, allowed us to track the transference of the SCCmec, which was exchanged between different strains, species and hosts. Some of the spacers are derived from plasmids described in Staphylococcus species that are different from those in which the CRISPR are found, evidencing the attempt (and failure) of plasmid transference between them. Based on the polymorphisms of the cas1 gene in CRISPRs of types II and III, we developed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) suitable to screen and type CRISPR systems in CoNS. The PCR was tested in 59 S. haemolyticus strains, of which only two contained a type III cas1. This gene was shown to be expressed in the exponential growth, stationary phase and during biofilm formation.

However, the physiological relevance of this apparent redundancy is not clear, emphasizing the need for investigating the functions of each of these enzymes. Here we focused on the phosphodiesterase PA2133 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important opportunistic pathogen. We phenotypically characterized P. aeruginosa strain K overexpressing PA2133 or its inactive mutant. We showed that biofilm formation and motility are severely impaired by overexpression of PA2133. Our quantitative proteomic approach applied to the membrane and exoprotein fractions revealed that proteins involved in three processes were mostly affected: flagellar motility, type III secretion system and chemotaxis. While inhibition of biofilm formation can be ascribed to the phosphodiesterase activity of PA2133, down-regulation of flagellar, chemotaxis, and type III secretion system proteins is independent of this enzymatic activity. Based on these unexpected effects of PA2133, we propose to rename this gene product FcsR, for Flagellar, chemotaxis and type III secretion system Regulator.","authors":[{"name":"Jessica Rossello"},{"name":"Analía Lima"},{"name":"Magdalena Gil"},{"name":"Jorge Rodríguez Duarte"},{"name":"Agustín Correa"},{"name":"Paulo C Carvalho"},{"name":"Arlinet Kierbel"},{"name":"Rosario Durán"}],"keywords":[]},"article282":{"pmid":"28860468","title":"Characterization of cervico-vaginal microbiota in women developing persistent high-risk Human Papillomavirus infection.","date":"2019-06-13","abs":"Changes in cervico-vaginal microbiota with Lactobacillus depletion and increased microbial diversity facilitate human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and might be involved in viral persistence and cancer development.

Phase variation of these DNA methyltransferases (Mod) alters global DNA methylation patterns. The change in DNA methylation due to phase variation events alters expression of a regulon of genes, called a phasevarion, and results in differentiation of the population into cells with two distinct phenotypes. For example, in N. meningitidis switching of the modA11 phasevarion alters expression of immunogenic outer membrane proteins such as lactoferrin-binding protein, and also modulates sensitivity to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin.

It is now well recognised, that S. Typhi produces a typhoid toxin with a carcinogenic potential, that induces DNA damage and cell cycle alterations in intoxicated cells. In addition, biofilm production by S.

Anti-biofilm efficacy was evaluated in numerous adapted American Standards for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard biofilm models and other bespoke biofilm models. The ASTM standard models employed included the Minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) biofilm model (ASTM E2799) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) biofilm reactor model (ASTM 2871). Such bespoke biofilm models included the filter biofilm model and the chamberslide biofilm model. Results showed complete kill of microorganisms within a biofilm using the antimicrobial surfactant-based wound dressing. Interestingly, the nonantimicrobial surfactant-based dressing could disrupt existing biofilms by causing biofilm detachment. Prior to biofilm detachment, we demonstrated, using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), the dispersive effect of the nonantimicrobial surfactant-based wound dressing on the biofilm within 10 minutes of treatment. Furthermore, the non-antimicrobial surfactant-based wound dressing caused an increase in microbial flocculation/aggregation, important for microbial concentration. In conclusion, this nonantimicrobial surfactant-based wound dressing leads to the effective detachment and dispersion of in vitro biofilms. The use of surfactant-based wound dressings in a clinical setting may help to disrupt existing biofilm from wound tissue and may increase the action of antimicrobial treatment.","authors":[{"name":"Steven L Percival"},{"name":"Dieter Mayer"},{"name":"Anne-Marie Salisbury"}],"keywords":[]},"article300":{"pmid":"28857279","title":"Self-perceived mouthfeel and physico-chemical surface effects after chewing gums containing sorbitol and Magnolia bark extract.","date":"2018-12-02","abs":"The European Food Safety Authority recognizes the contribution of sugar-free chewing gum to oral health through increased salivation, clearance of food debris, and neutralization of biofilm pH.

The relationship between the strain biocontrol ability and their in vitro studied traits was investigated to identify the most important factors to be considered for the selection of effective biocontrol agents. In fact, previous selection procedure relying only on in vitro antibacterial activity was shown to be not suitable in some cases. A direct plant-protection strategy was performed to screen the 32 Bacillus biocontrol agent candidates. Moreover, potential in vitro biocontrol traits were investigated including biofilm formation, motility, hemolytic activity, detection of lipopeptide biosynthetic genes (sfp, ituC and bmyB) and production of antibacterial compounds. The obtained results indicated high correlations of the efficiency of the biocontrol with the reduction of gall weight (p = 0.000) and the antibacterial activity in vitro (p = 0.000). Moreover, there was strong correlations of the efficiency of the biocontrol (p = 0.004) and the reduction in gall weight (p = 0.000) with the presence of the bmyB gene. This gene directs the synthesis of the lipopeptide bacillomycin belonging to the iturinic family of lipopeptides. These results were also confirmed by the two-way hierarchical cluster analysis and the correspondence analysis showing the relatedness of these four variables. According to the obtained results a new screening procedure of Bacillus biocontrol agents against crown gall disease could be advanced consisting on two step selection procedure. The first consists on selecting strains with high antibacterial activity in vitro or those harbouring the bmyB gene. Further selection has to be performed on tomato plants in vivo.

In the present work we contribute to this important topic with new results on how MCM-41 is affected by a simple treatment in alcohol at room temperature. The effects of alcohol treatment are characterized by TGA, FTIR, and sorption calorimetry. The results are clear and show that treatment of MCM-41 in methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, or octanol at room temperature introduces alkoxy groups that are covalently bound to the silica surface. It is shown that alcohol treated MCM-41 becomes more hydrophobic and that this effect is sequentially more prominent going from methanol to octanol. Chemical formation of alkoxy groups onto MCM-41 occurs both for calcined and hydroxylated MCM-41 and the alkoxy groups are hydrolytically unstable and can be replaced by silanol groups after exposure to water.

T4P are assembled by nanomachines that span the bacterial cell envelope. Cycles of T4P assembly and retraction, powered by the ATPases PilB and PilT, allow bacteria to attach to and pull themselves along surfaces, so-called twitching motility. These opposing ATPase activities must be coordinated and T4P assembly limited to one pole for bacteria to show directional movement. How this occurs is still incompletely understood. Herein, we show that the c-di-GMP binding protein FimX, which is required for T4P assembly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, localizes to the leading pole of twitching bacteria. Polar FimX localization requires both the presence of T4P assembly machine proteins and the assembly ATPase PilB. PilB itself loses its polar localization pattern when FimX is absent. We use two different approaches to confirm that FimX and PilB interact in vivo and in vitro, and further show that point mutant alleles of FimX that do not bind c-di-GMP also do not interact with PilB. Lastly, we demonstrate that FimX positively regulates T4P assembly and twitching motility by promoting the activity of the PilB ATPase, and not by stabilizing assembled pili or by preventing PilT-mediated retraction. Mutated alleles of FimX that no longer bind c-di-GMP do not allow rapid T4P assembly in these assays. We propose that by virtue of its high-affinity for c-di-GMP, FimX can promote T4P assembly when intracellular levels of this cyclic nucleotide are low. As P. aeruginosa PilB is not itself a high-affinity c-di-GMP receptor, unlike many other assembly ATPases, FimX may play a key role in coupling T4P mediated motility and adhesion to levels of this second messenger.","authors":[{"name":"Ruchi Jain"},{"name":"Oleksii Sliusarenko"},{"name":"Barbara I Kazmierczak"}],"keywords":[]},"article311":{"pmid":"28854274","title":"Enhancing antibacterial effect of sodium hypochlorite by low electric current-assisted sonic agitation.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"This research focused on the effects of low electric current (μE)-assisted sonic agitation of sodium hypochlorite on Enterococcus faecalis infected human root dentin.","authors":[{"name":"Murat Maden"},{"name":"İhsan Furkan Ertuğrul"},{"name":"Ekim Onur Orhan"},{"name":"Cevat Emre Erik"},{"name":"Ceylan Çağıl Yetiş"},{"name":"Yasin Tuncer"},{"name":"Mesud Kahriman"}],"keywords":[]},"article312":{"pmid":"28853985","title":"A Moraxella catarrhalis vaccine to protect against otitis media and exacerbations of COPD: An update on current progress and challenges.","date":"2019-12-10","abs":"Moraxella catarrhalis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially causing otitis media in young children and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults.

Herein we report the first characterization of the sweat metabolome from screen-positive CF infants and identify metabolites associated with disease status that complement sweat chloride testing. Pilocarpine-stimulated sweat specimens were collected independently from two CF clinics, including 50 unaffected infants (e.g., carriers) and 18 confirmed CF cases. Nontargeted metabolite profiling was performed using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry as a high throughput platform for analysis of polar/ionic metabolites in volume-restricted sweat samples. Amino acids, organic acids, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, purine derivatives, and unknown exogenous compounds were identified in sweat when using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, including metabolites associated with affected yet asymptomatic CF infants, such as asparagine and glutamine.

Therefore, we studied the effects of MSC administration in mouse and dog models of chronic infections associated with biofilms. Mice with chronic Staphylococcus aureus implant infections were treated by i.v. administration of activated or non-activated MSC, with or without antibiotic therapy. The most effective treatment protocol was identified as activated MSC co-administered with antibiotic therapy. Activated MSC were found to accumulate in the wound margins several days after i.v. administration. Macrophages in infected tissues assumed an M2 phenotype, compared to untreated infections which contained predominately M1 macrophages. Bacterial killing by MSC was found to be mediated in part by secretion of cathelicidin and was significantly increased by antibiotics. Studies in pet dogs with spontaneous chronic multi drug-resistant wound infections demonstrated clearance of bacteria and wound healing following repeated i.v. administration of activated allogeneic canine MSC. Thus, systemic therapy with activated MSC may be an effective new, non-antimicrobial approach to treatment of chronic, drug-resistant infections.","authors":[{"name":"Valerie Johnson"},{"name":"Tracy Webb"},{"name":"Annalis Norman"},{"name":"Jonathan Coy"},{"name":"Jade Kurihara"},{"name":"Daniel Regan"},{"name":"Steven Dow"}],"keywords":[]},"article323":{"pmid":"28851857","title":"Effect of Probiotic Lactobacilli on the Growth of Streptococcus Mutans and Multispecies Biofilms Isolated from Children with Active Caries.","date":"2020-03-06","abs":"BACKGROUND The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of probiotic lactobacilli on Streptococcus mutans (MS) and multispecies biofilms isolated from children with severe caries.

IraD functions as an antiadapter protein that inhibits RssB-mediated degradation of RpoS, the general stress response and stationary-phase sigma factor of Escherichia coli Here we identified a novel mechanism in which CsrA represses iraD translation via translational coupling. Expression studies with quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, Western blotting, and lacZ fusions demonstrated that CsrA represses iraD expression. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified four CsrA binding sites in the iraD leader transcript, all of which are far upstream of the iraD ribosome binding site. Computational modeling and RNA structure mapping identified an RNA structure that sequesters the iraD Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. Three open reading frames (ORFs), all of which are translated, were identified in the iraD leader region. Two of these ORFs do not affect iraD expression. However, the translation initiation region of the third ORF contains three of the CsrA binding sites, one of which overlaps its SD sequence. Furthermore, the ORF stop codon overlaps the iraD start codon, a sequence arrangement indicative of translational coupling. In vivo expression and in vitro translation studies with wild-type and mutant reporter fusions demonstrated that bound CsrA directly represses translation initiation of this ORF. We further established that CsrA-dependent repression of iraD translation occurs entirely via translational coupling with this ORF, leading to accelerated iraD mRNA decay.","authors":[{"name":"Hongmarn Park"},{"name":"Louise C McGibbon"},{"name":"Anastasia H Potts"},{"name":"Helen Yakhnin"},{"name":"Tony Romeo"},{"name":"Paul Babitzke"}],"keywords":[{"word":"CsrA"},{"word":"IraD"},{"word":"RpoS"},{"word":"translational control"},{"word":"translational coupling"}]},"article325":{"pmid":"28851574","title":"Levofloxacin-loaded bone cement delivery system: Highly effective against intracellular bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.","date":"2018-06-04","abs":"Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen in bone associated infections due to its ability to adhere and form biofilms on bone and/or implants.

To address these questions, we developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based approach to determine the precise species composition of mixed- Candida species biofilms formed by clinical isolates and laboratory strains in the presence and absence of clinically relevant concentrations of 3 commonly used antifungals: fluconazole, caspofungin, and amphotericin B. In monospecies biofilms, fluconazole exposure favored growth of C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while caspofungin generally favored significant growth of all species to a varying degree. Fluconazole was not effective against preformed mixed- Candida species biofilms while amphotericin B was potent. As a general trend, in mixed- Candida species biofilms, C. albicans lost dominance in the presence of antifungals. Interestingly, presence in mixed versus monospecies biofilms reduced susceptibility to amphotericin B for C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Overall, our data suggest that antifungal treatment favors the growth of specific non- albicans Candida species in mixed- Candida species biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"G Vipulanandan"},{"name":"M Herrera"},{"name":"N P Wiederhold"},{"name":"X Li"},{"name":"J Mintz"},{"name":"B L Wickes"},{"name":"D Kadosh"}],"keywords":[{"word":"candidiasis"},{"word":"cell biology"},{"word":"infectious disease medicine"},{"word":"microbiology"},{"word":"mycology"},{"word":"oral health"}]},"article332":{"pmid":"28850103","title":"Discovery of Phylloseptins that Defense against Gram-Positive Bacteria and Inhibit the Proliferation of the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cell Line, from the Skin Secretions of Phyllomedusa Frogs.","date":"2018-12-07","abs":"The growing occurrence of bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics has called for the development of new classes of antimicrobial agents.

Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mediates the inflammatory response to P. gingivalis and TLR2-deficient mice resist alveolar bone resorption following oral challenge with this organism. Although, MyD88 is an adaptor protein considered necessary for TLR2-induced inflammation, we now report for the first time that oral challenge with P. gingivalis leads to alveolar bone resorption in the absence of MyD88. Indeed, in contrast to prototypical TLR2 agonists, such as the lipopeptide Pam3CSK4 that activates TLR2 in a strictly MyD88-dependent manner, P. gingivalis strikingly induced TLR2 signaling in neutrophils and macrophages regardless of the presence or absence of MyD88. Moreover, genetic or antibody-mediated inactivation of TLR2 completely reduced cytokine production in P. gingivalis-stimulated neutrophils or macrophages, suggesting that TLR2 plays a non-redundant role in the host response to P. gingivalis. In the absence of MyD88, inflammatory TLR2 signaling in P. gingivalis-stimulated neutrophils or macrophages depended upon PI3K. Intriguingly, TLR2-PI3K signaling was also critical to P. gingivalis evasion of killing by macrophages, since their ability to phagocytose this pathogen was reduced in a TLR2 and PI3K-dependent manner. Moreover, within those cells that did phagocytose bacteria, TLR2-PI3K signaling blocked phago-lysosomal maturation, thereby revealing a novel mechanism whereby P. gingivalis can enhance its intracellular survival. Therefore, P. gingivalis uncouples inflammation from bactericidal activity by substituting TLR2-PI3K in place of TLR2-MyD88 signaling. These findings further support the role of P. gingivalis as a keystone pathogen, which manipulates the host inflammatory response in a way that promotes bone loss but not bacterial clearance. Modulation of these host response factors may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes in disease conditions associated with P. gingivalis.","authors":[{"name":"Hasnaa Makkawi"},{"name":"Shifra Hoch"},{"name":"Elia Burns"},{"name":"Kavita Hosur"},{"name":"George Hajishengallis"},{"name":"Carsten J Kirschning"},{"name":"Gabriel Nussbaum"}],"keywords":[{"word":"MyD88"},{"word":"P. gingivalis"},{"word":"PI3 kinase"},{"word":"TLR2 signaling"},{"word":"immune evasion"},{"word":"macrophages"},{"word":"neutrophils"}]},"article335":{"pmid":"28848715","title":"HmsC Controls Yersinia pestis Biofilm Formation in Response to Redox Environment.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"Yersinia pestis biofilm formation, controlled by intracellular levels of the second messenger molecule cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), is important for blockage-dependent plague transmission from fleas to mammals.

We utilized a newer two-step bottom up wet milling approach to prepare Curcumin Quantum Dots (CurQDs) using acetone as a primary solvent. Minimum inhibitory concentration against select Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was performed. The antibiofilm assay was performed at first using 96-well tissue culture plate and subsequently validated by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy. Further, biofilm matrix protein was isolated using formaldehyde sludge and TCA/Acetone precipitation method. Protein extracted was incubated with varying concentration of CurQDs for 4 h and was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Molecular docking study was performed to observe interaction between curcumin and phenol soluble modulins as well as curli proteins. The biophysical evidences obtained from TEM, SEM, UV-VIS, fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, and zeta potential analysis confirmed the formation of curcumin quantum dots with increased stability and solubility. The MICs of curcumin quantum dots, as observed against both select gram positive and negative bacterial isolates, was observed to be significantly lower than native curcumin particles.

Compounding this problem is the ability of many pathogenic bacteria to form biofilms during chronic infections. Importantly, these communities are often recalcitrant to antibiotic treatments that show effectiveness against acute infection. The antimicrobial properties of silver have been known for decades, but recently silver and silver-containing compounds have seen renewed interest as antimicrobial agents for treating bacterial infections. The goal of this study was to assess the ability of citrate-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) of various sizes, alone and in combination with the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin, to inhibit established Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Our results demonstrate that smaller 10-nm and 20-nm AgNPs were more effective at synergistically potentiating the activity of tobramycin. Visualization of biofilms treated with combinations of 10-nm AgNPs and tobramycin reveals that the synergistic bactericidal effect may be caused by disrupting cellular membranes. Minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assays using clinical P. aeruginosa isolates shows that small AgNPs are more effective than larger AgNPs at inhibiting biofilms, but that the synergy effect is likely a strain-dependent phenomenon.

Subsequent all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the enzyme complex model in a membrane and structure-guided mutagenesis suggested that a few interenzyme salt bridges and coulombic interactions of NiR with the membrane could stabilize the complex of one NiR homodimer and one NOR molecule and contribute to rapid NO decomposition in cells. The MD trajectories of the NO diffusion in the NiR:NOR complex with the membrane showed that, as a plausible NO transfer mechanism, NO released from NiR rapidly migrates into the membrane, then binds to NOR.

By investigating a P. aeruginosa conditional fur mutant, we demonstrate that Fur is not essential for P. aeruginosa growth in liquid media, biofilm formation, and pathogenicity in an insect model of infection. Conversely, Fur is essential for growth on solid media since Fur-depleted cells are severely impaired in colony formation. Transposon-mediated random mutagenesis experiments identified pyochelin siderophore biosynthesis as a major cause of the colony growth defect of the conditional fur mutant, and deletion mutagenesis confirmed this evidence. Impaired colony growth of pyochelin-proficient Fur-depleted cells does not depend on oxidative stress, since Fur-depleted cells do not accumulate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are not rescued by antioxidant agents or overexpression of ROS-detoxifying enzymes.

Much attention has been given to genes related to multiple drug resistance derived from plasmids, integrons or transposon, but such genes are also detected in chromosomal systems, like the mar (multiple antibiotic resistance) locus, that confer resistance to a range of drugs.

For clear elucidation of the spatial distribution of the dual-species biofilm, P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were labeled with red and green fluorescence, respectively. E. faecalis was located at the lower part of the dual-species biofilm, while P. aeruginosa developed a structured biofilm on the upper part.

At the end of phase I the developed biofilm was harvested and re-inoculated with naturally weathered PE films. Bacteria from both treatments were able to establish an active population on the PE surfaces as the biofilm community developed in a time dependent way. Moreover, a convergence in the composition of these communities was observed towards an efficient PE degrading microbial network, comprising of indigenous species. In acclimated communities, genera affiliated with synthetic (PE) and natural (cellulose) polymer degraders as well as hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were enriched.

Pneumococci within mature cardiac microlesions exhibited salient biofilm features including intrinsic resistance to antibiotic killing and the presence of an extracellular matrix. Dual RNA-seq and subsequent principal component analyses of heart- and blood-isolated pneumococci confirmed the biofilm phenotype in vivo and revealed stark anatomical site-specific differences in virulence gene expression; the latter having major implications on future vaccine antigen selection. Our RNA-seq approach also identified three genomic islands as exclusively expressed in vivo. Deletion of one such island, Region of Diversity 12, resulted in a biofilm-deficient and highly inflammogenic phenotype within the heart; indicating a possible link between the biofilm phenotype and a dampened host-response. We subsequently determined that biofilm pneumococci released greater amounts of the toxin pneumolysin than did planktonic or RD12 deficient pneumococci. This allowed heart-invaded wildtype pneumococci to kill resident cardiac macrophages and subsequently subvert cytokine/chemokine production and neutrophil infiltration into the myocardium. This is the first report for pneumococcal biofilm formation in an invasive disease setting.

Three cellulose nanocomposites with 1-5 w% octadecylamine-modified montmorillonite (ODA-MMT) were prepared by regeneration of cellulose from ionic liquid solutions in the presence of ODA-MMT suspension. Structural characterization of the nanocomposites showed that the ODA-MMT can be exfoliated or intercalated, depending on the load level of the nanofiller. Thermal gravimetric analysis showed that the incorporation of ODA-MMT nanofiller can improve the thermal stability of the nanocomposites compared with regenerated cellulose. Evaluation of the anti-QS effect against a pigment-producing bacteria C. violaceum CV026 by disc diffusion assay and flask incubation assay revealed that the QS-regulated violacein pigment production was significantly inhibited by the cellulose nanocomposites without interfering the bacterial vitality. Interestingly, the nanocomposite with the lowest load of ODA-MMT exhibited the most significant anti-QS effect, which may be correlated to the exfoliation of nanofillers. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the anti-QS effect of cellulose nanocomposites without the addition of any small molecular agents. Such inexpensive and nontoxic biomaterials will thus have great potential in the development of new cellulosic materials that can effectively prevent the formation of harmful biofilms.","authors":[{"name":"Deniz Demircan"},{"name":"Sedef Ilk"},{"name":"Baozhong Zhang"}],"keywords":[]},"article362":{"pmid":"28841178","title":"Biosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles on Orthodontic Elastomeric Modules: Evaluation of Mechanical and Antibacterial Properties.","date":"2018-12-07","abs":"In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized in situ on orthodontic elastomeric modules (OEM) using silver nitrate salts as metal-ion precursors and extract of the plant Hetheroteca inuloides (H. inuloides) as bioreductant via a simple and eco-friendly method.

PAH remediation strategies focus on biological processes mediated by bacteria. The availability of oxygen in polluted environments is often limited or absent, and only bacteria able to thrive in these conditions can be considered for bioremediation strategies. To identify bacterial strains able to degrade PAHs under oxygen-limiting conditions, we set up enrichment cultures from samples of an oil-polluted aquifer, using either anoxic or microaerophilic condition and with PAHs as the sole carbon source. Despite the presence of a significant community of nitrate-reducing bacteria, the initial community, which was dominated by Betaproteobacteria, was incapable of PAH degradation under strict anoxic conditions, although a clear shift in the structure of the community towards an increase in the Alphaproteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae), Actinobacteria and an uncultured group of Acidobacteria was observed in the enrichments. In contrast, growth under microaerophilic conditions with naphthalene as the carbon source evidenced the development of a biofilm structure around the naphthalene crystal. The enrichment process selected two co-dominant groups which finally reached 97% of the bacterial communities: Variovorax spp. (54%, Betaproteobacteria) and Starkeya spp. (43%, Xanthobacteraceae). The two dominant populations were able to grow with naphthalene, although only Starkeya was able to reproduce the biofilm structure around the naphthalene crystal. The pathway for naphthalene degradation was identified, which included as essential steps dioxygenases with high affinity for oxygen, showing 99% identity with Xanthobacter polyaromaticivorans dbd cluster for PAH degradation. Our results suggest that the biofilm formation capacity of Starkeya provided a structure to allocate its cells at an appropriate distance from the toxic carbon source.","authors":[{"name":"Sophie-Marie Martirani-Von Abercron"},{"name":"Patricia Marín"},{"name":"Marta Solsona-Ferraz"},{"name":"Mayra-Alejandra Castañeda-Cataña"},{"name":"Silvia Marqués"}],"keywords":[]},"article364":{"pmid":"28840961","title":"A technology for the investigation of biofilm transmission under shearing pressures.","date":"2019-01-16","abs":"Biofilm formation is a multifactorial and dynamic process.

Proteins extracted from the control and deletion mutant strains were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the protein spots were stained with RuBPS and Pro-Q Diamond in order to visualize the total proteome and the phosphoproteome, respectively. The alterations in spot intensities were determined by densitometry and were analysed with the Delta2D (Decodon) software. Spots showing significantly different intensities between the mutant and control strains were excised from the gels and were digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. As many as 15 protein spots were found that exhibited significant changes in their intensity upon the deletion of the phosphatase and 20 phosphoproteins were identified in which the level of phosphorylation was modified significantly in the mutant. In agreement with previous findings we found that the affected proteins function in protein synthesis, oxidative stress response, regulation of morphology and metabolism. Among these proteins we identified two potential CaPpz1 substrates (Eft2 and Rpp0) that may regulate the elongation step of translation. RT-qPCR experiments revealed that the expression of the genes coding for the affected proteins was not altered significantly. Thus, the absence of CaPpz1 exerted its effects via protein synthesis/degradation and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.

Interestingly, our analysis reveals that P. aeruginosa can undergo complex flagellum-driven dynamical behavior, including precession, nutation, and an unexpected taxonomy of surface motility mechanisms, including upright-spinning bacteria that diffuse laterally across the surface, and horizontal bacteria that follow helicoidal trajectories and exhibit superdiffusive movements parallel to the surface.","authors":[{"name":"Jaime de Anda"},{"name":"Ernest Y Lee"},{"name":"Calvin K Lee"},{"name":"Rachel R Bennett"},{"name":"Xiang Ji"},{"name":"Soheil Soltani"},{"name":"Mark C Harrison"},{"name":"Amy E Baker"},{"name":"Yun Luo"},{"name":"Tom Chou"},{"name":"George A O'Toole"},{"name":"Andrea M Armani"},{"name":"Ramin Golestanian"},{"name":"Gerard C L Wong"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"word":"bacteria microscopy"},{"word":"bacteria motility"},{"word":"finite element method"},{"word":"flagellum"},{"word":"hydrodynamic simulations"},{"word":"single-cell tracking"}]},"article374":{"pmid":"28836084","title":"Effect of ultrasonic irradiation on bacterial biofilms.","date":"2018-11-13","abs":"The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of ultrasonic irradiation on biofilm produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), which causes central venous catheter-related infections.","authors":[{"name":"Harumi Koibuchi"},{"name":"Yasutomo Fujii"},{"name":"Yoshikazu Hirai"},{"name":"Takashi Mochizuki"},{"name":"Kohji Masuda"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Kotani"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Yamada"},{"name":"Nobuyuki Taniguchi"}],"keywords":[{"word":"Biofilm"},{"word":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"word":"Ultrasonography"},{"word":"Ultrasound irradiation"}]},"article375":{"pmid":"28835795","title":"Branched Peptides: Acridine and Boronic Acid Derivatives as Antimicrobial Agents.","date":"2019-11-20","abs":"The emergence of microbial resistance presents a challenge in the development of next generation therapeutics.

How the material properties of the matrix contribute to biofilm growth and robustness is largely unexplored, in particular in response to environmental perturbations such as changes in osmotic pressure. Here, using Vibrio cholerae as our model organism, we show that during active cell growth, matrix production enables biofilm-dwelling bacterial cells to establish an osmotic pressure difference between the biofilm and the external environment. This pressure difference promotes biofilm expansion on nutritious surfaces by physically swelling the colony, which enhances nutrient uptake, and enables matrix-producing cells to outcompete non-matrix-producing cheaters via physical exclusion. Osmotic pressure together with crosslinking of the matrix also controls the growth of submerged biofilms and their susceptibility to invasion by planktonic cells. As the basic physicochemical principles of matrix crosslinking and osmotic swelling are universal, our findings may have implications for other biofilm-forming bacterial species.Most bacteria live in biofilms, surface-attached communities encased in an extracellular matrix.

Specifically, the polyamines norspermidine and spermidine enhance and repress V. cholerae biofilm formation, respectively. These effects are relevant for understanding V. cholerae pathogenicity and are mediated through the periplasmic binding protein NspS and the transmembrane bis-(3'-5') cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) phosphodiesterase MbaA. However, the levels of spermidine required to inhibit biofilm formation through this pathway are unlikely to be encountered by V. cholerae in aquatic reservoirs or within the human host during infection. We therefore hypothesized that other polyamines in the gastrointestinal tract may control V. cholerae biofilm formation at physiological levels. The tetramine spermine has been reported to be present at nearly 50 μm concentrations in the intestinal lumen. Here, we report that spermine acts as an exogenous cue that inhibits V. cholerae biofilm formation through the NspS-MbaA signaling system. We found that this effect probably occurs through a direct interaction of spermine with NspS, as purified NspS protein could bind spermine in vitro Spermine also inhibited biofilm formation by altering the transcription of the vps genes involved in biofilm matrix production. Global c-di-GMP levels were unaffected by spermine supplementation, suggesting that biofilm formation may be regulated by variations in local rather than global c-di-GMP pools.
